He mentioned repeatedly the figure of &euro;5,000.  It appears as if there could be a 25% shortfall in the expenditure on the first tranche of the scheme.

Second, we always said the maximum payment for GLAS was &euro;5,000, or &euro;7,000 for  GLAS+.  We also said that we thought the average payment would be very close to the maximum payment of &euro;5,000 because the majority of farmers would be able to draw down the full amount.  Let us be accurate about what was said rather than trying to change things.<\/p>  <p>  The first tranche of GLAS has proved to be hugely successful, attracting nearly 27,000 applicants in all.  Applications were received from every single county and virtually every action was selected at some stage.  On the basis of the interest shown to date, I have no doubt that GLAS will succeed in attracting the 50,000 applications projected over the lifetime of the scheme.  We have a projected figure of about &euro;250 million of expenditure per year when the full 50,000 applicants are in the scheme, but we always said this would have to happen on a phased basis.  Farming organisations bought into that at the time.  We have 27,000 applications now.  We will open applications for tranche two next week, which will take into another 10,000.  Therefore, we will have roughly 36,000 farmers in GLAS by next year, with the second tranche starting from 1 January.  We will then progress after that to move up to the full 50,000 applicants when we can afford to do it.  Nobody was suggesting or expecting that we would have the full 50,000 applicants in the scheme in the first year.  That would be totally unrealistic.<\/p>  <p>  I expect that the first approvals for GLAS will issue next week or very shortly thereafter.  On the basis of the expected intake, expenditure this year on GLAS will be &euro;20 million.

There will be plenty of time to get that finished.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, farmers will be paid as long as they have committed to adherence to that plan, even before it is fully finalised and signed off.  The commitment they are making in commonage areas will ensure they get early receipt of their GLAS payment, which is about as flexible as we could possibly be.  A huge number of commonage farmers are now part of the GLAS commonage project.  It has been very successful as anyone would have to accept.  When one looks at what is being committed to now in terms of some of the headline outcomes from GLAS, they are hugely successful.  They include hectarage covered as well as commitments to hedgerows, native trees, orchards and stone walling.  Some 90,000 bird boxes and 80,000 bat boxes are to be erected in addition to protecting 3,000 archaeological monuments and planting 8,000 hectares of wild bird cover.  GLAS is about delivering sustainable outcomes across farmland in rural Ireland and paying farmers properly to do that.  We will have 50,000 farmers as part of that scheme within the next few years.

The intended objective of such licences is, according to the report, to optimally facilitate traditional fishing practices in conjunction with the establishment of a producer organisation representing vessels under a certain length overall, LOA, in these designated areas.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to representation for the rural coastal and island fishing communities, in May 2014 I announced the establishment of innovative consultative structures to bring Ireland&rsquo;s inshore fishing communities into discussions on the future of Ireland&rsquo;s seafood industry.  In recognition of the need to take a different approach to communicating with Ireland&rsquo;s small-scale coastal fishermen in view of the very low level of professional trade representation for this part of the industry, both regional and national structures have been put in place.  The newly established National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, and Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums, RIFFs, provide areas for inshore fishermen to develop proposals on inshore fisheries management, including compliance and data gathering.  The inshore forums are representative of the &ldquo;under 12 m&rdquo; fishing fleet, the fishing boats of less than 12 m overall length and their focus is on fisheries management in the coastal waters within six nautical miles.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the four NIFF meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies and initiatives.  As a result of the successful discussions with the forum, I have included NIFF members on the quota management advisory committee, the industry science fisheries partnership and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF operational programme monitoring committee.  That gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on the allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, on data collection and scientific research and, perhaps most importantly, on how funding is utilised.  The NIFF is taking the industry lead in setting priorities for the policy development for the inshore sector and recommendations from the NIFF are taken very seriously by me.

Approximately &euro;420 million of the funding will be spent on what are called national envelopes to enable a positive impact within countries on the income of dairy and pig farmers.  Ireland's allocation is just under &euro;14 million.  There is a facility through which, if we want, we can match that funding with Exchequer funding.

Those discussions have not yet concluded.<\/p>  <p>  We had a good discussion with all of the stakeholders at the first dairy forum meeting, which took place last week.  The recommendation from farming organisations was that we consider the introduction of a flat payment for farmers, which would positively discriminate in favour of smaller farmers in terms of payments.  Macra na Feirme made clear that it would like to see some level of top-up or priority for younger farmers, who may be more indebted because they are trying to grow their businesses, and may be under more pressure than dairy farmers who have been around longer.  I agree with those recommendations.  The Department's proposals in this regard have not yet been finalised but will be based on those principles.  I do not propose to pay farmers on the basis of the amount of milk they produce and, therefore, give larger farmers more money.  I do not think that is where the need is.  In terms of the final outcome, I think most farmers, regardless of size, will receive similar payments.

Beef exports in 2014 amounted to 524,000 tonnes, worth &euro;2.27 billion.  The suckler herd is a critical component of this industry.  The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is a response to these challenges and opportunities, and particularly to the challenges associated with improved breeding performance, including for maternal traits such as cow fertility, and the very onerous requirements to reduce the percentage of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions which comes from the agriculture sector.  Improving the genetics of the suckler herd can make a positive contribution in both of these areas while also improving the economic viability of suckler farming.<\/p><p>The BDGP provides targeted support to suckler farmers.  It builds on the success of the State&rsquo;s investment of over &euro;9 million in the beef data programme in each of 2013 and 2014 and on the success of the pilot beef genomics scheme, which involved investment of around &euro;23 million last year.  The scheme was launched on 5 May last as part of Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme, RDP, and involves funding of some &euro;300 million over six years.  Scheme participants will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 for the first 6.66 hectares and &euro;120 for each hectare thereafter, up to a maximum payable hectarage.  That is the equivalent of about &euro;95 per cow for the first number of animals.  In return for this payment, participants will be required to undertake six actions, some of which will be well known to suckler farmers through their participation in previous schemes.<\/p><p>In recent weeks, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation has issued every scheme applicant with detailed reports of the current status of animals in their herds.  Participants will receive similar information about the scheme and their individual herd on an ongoing basis.  This is in addition to a training programme which will be rolled out over the next 12 months.  I have also announced a series of information meetings for participating farmers which will commence next week.<\/p><p>It is clear from the large number of applications received for the BDGP that farmers recognise the benefits this scheme can deliver locally and nationally.

Earlier this month the Department said there was a 2% withdrawal rate.

I know Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked the question earlier.<\/p>  <p>  For the second tranche of GLAS, which I intend to launch next week, I have revisited the various actions that will be available to farmers in the light of the substantial progress made to date.  GLAS differs from previous schemes in that it adopts a very targeted approach to meeting its environmental objectives and the RDP includes a provision for review and reassessment after the first tranche.  Not all the actions which have met or exceeded targets require to be adjusted, given that the associated spend is in many cases relatively easily accommodated in within the total budget. <\/p>  <p>  However, given the very high uptake of low input permanent pasture, it is proposed to adjust the provision of this action under the next tranche.  It will still be possible to take up to 10 ha of either low input permanent pasture or traditional hay meadow as before, but the low input permanent pasture component will be limited to 5 ha.  The average application for low input permanent pasture so far has been about 7.5 ha, so we will reduce that slightly.  While this means that we will still see permanent pasture coming into GLAS, I hope it will encourage more farmers to take the hay meadow option, which is well behind target, and which delivers the same payment per hectare. <\/p>  <p>  I am proposing to suspend the planting of new hedgerows for the second tranche, along with the planting of traditional orchards.  Both actions have met their targets for the entire RDP, and there are concerns about the availability of planting stock.  I will, however, review this in the third tranche.  Most of the concern I have heard is about the planting of hedgerows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700008#F00600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1444209600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>No.  It is about low input permanent pasture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700008#F00700","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1444209600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Under the first tranche, so far 8 million plants have been ordered.

For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, which includes the European Investment Bank, EIB, as one of its funding partners, has recently announced a new agriculture investment loans product.  This credit is available at favourable terms for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.  The features of these products compared with those currently on the market are lower interest rates, loan amounts of up to &euro;5 million and increased repayment flexibility.  Of the almost &euro;45 million in loans approved and drawn down by SMEs between March and the end of June from the SBCI, a third has been accessed by the agricultural sector.  Things are already happening.<\/p><p>As to the EIB itself, earlier this year, the European Commission and the EIB presented a model guarantee instrument for agriculture, developed within the framework of their memorandum of understanding on co-operation in agriculture and rural development within the EU.  The model instrument aims to help to ease access to finance for farmers and other rural businesses.  Member states and regions can adapt and use this model to set up financial instruments funded by their rural development programmes, RDPs under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD.  Financial instruments can take the form of loans, guarantee funds or equity investments.  The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on Ireland&rsquo;s existing RDP allocation of EAFRD funding as well as national Exchequer funding.  It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources for such instruments. <\/p><p>In our RDP we have made a commitment to examining the potential for the use of financial instruments.  However, the inclusion of financial instruments by way of a modification to the RDP is required by EU regulation to be based on an <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation which must assess the existence of a market failure, the potential for added value, the resources required to implement a proposed financial instrument and the proposed strategic approach to financial instruments.

People who are using grant aid to upgrade their farmyards, for example, should be able to borrow the balance from competitive funds that can be put in place to do that.  If we can show there is market failure in certain areas, in other words, that farmers or the agricultural industry cannot get competitive finance in the normal way or we can show that there is the potential for added value to an investment in a certain area, and if that is consistent with EU policy, which is always a test for EIB investment, we should be able to draw down money to do that.

I did not get to press the first amendment.<\/p><p>The Minister argues that the advice from the Attorney General's office is that we must get rid of the institution of civil partnership.  I find that hard to accept but that is the advice.  What I find much harder to accept is the fact that advice that nobody in this House will ever see is effectively used to clobber debate.  I am sure that if I called the Attorney General and asked her for advice as a Member of this House, she would ask me what I was doing as she does not offer advice to the House or Members.  She advises the Government and I accept that.  If it is supposed to be unconstitutional, so be it.  The Constitution does not state that the Government shall control and dominate this House and that it shall make legislation for this State.  That is why we have a State and what 1916 was about.<\/p><p>That is what 1921 was about: the power for a legislature elected by the people of Ireland to make law for Ireland, not a Government to make law by decree.  I do not see many amendments other than those proposed by Ministers being accepted in here.  Why not just rule by decree?  Why bother with the facade of parliamentary democracy, where we have a Committee Stage on which committees do not debate very much?  Some Ministers have taken amendments, but by and large the practice is no different to previous Governments.  There is no great reform or empowerment of the D&aacute;il.  In fact, I have nothing to compare it to, because I was not here before, but I am told there was probably greater control exercised by the Government over this D&aacute;il than has been the case in the past.<\/p> <p> If the Minister says the Attorney General says it is unconstitutional, so be it, but that is civil partnership as it existed up to now.  Why not open it up?  Why not open it up to people who are not homosexual or to people who live together in a committed relationship that is not of a sexual or intimate nature in a family unit and who want the protection of the law?  I doubt very much that the Attorney General has said that would be unconstitutional or that it would be competitive to marriage.  I doubt she has even been asked, but I do not know.  We will never know.  However, I do know that debate in this Chamber is consistently being stifled by so-called advice from the Attorney General.  Sometimes I notice that it changes.  Deputy Michael McGrath had a Bill at one point that went from being potentially unconstitutional to unconstitutional in the space of about an hour, as the heat got turned up in Leaders' Questions, or something like that.  I have a concern about this tendency to stifle debate.<\/p> <p> On this amendment specifically, the Minister says the advice is that it would be an unconstitutional attack on the institution of marriage if people were to continue to be able to have a civil partnership.  She also says it would be unconstitutional to recognise foreign civil partnerships, because that, too, would be an attack on the institution of marriage.  There is a logic in that.  However, the Minister's legislation, if I understand it correctly, proposes to continue to recognise civil partnerships for six months.  If the Constitution is to be interpreted so literally that we are going to defend from attack the institution of marriage, and if allowing people to engage in a civil partnership or recognising a civil partnership is an attack on the institution of marriage, then recognising it for six months is still an attack.  The Constitution does not say, \"We will protect the institution of marriage from attacks lasting longer than six months\".  It is about attacks, full stop.  I question the logic of the Bill in that regard.  I really question why it is an attack on marriage to retain civil partnership on the books, but I question the logic of continuing to recognise it for six months.  There are, of course, people who will continue to engage in civil partnerships abroad.  We live in the European Union.  France and the Netherlands are two countries in the EU where civil partnership exists and I expect people will continue to migrate between France, the Netherlands and Ireland, as long as the European Union exists, which I hope will be for the foreseeable future.  On that basis, I ask the Minister to consider the amendment, which would continue to recognise civil partnerships, not just between homosexual couples, but civil partnerships more broadly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700011#J01000","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444212000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>This is a useful amendment because it gives us an opportunity to discuss an issue of some importance.  I was not able to participate in the Second Stage debate, because it coincided with the Jewish fast of Yom Kippur, so I had no opportunity to raise this issue previously, but I did raise it in an article some time ago.  As everybody knows, I welcome the fact that the referendum was successful and that we have this legislation before the House and I sought for many years to bring about this possibility.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty I see arising from the legislation as it is now before the House relates specifically to gay couples who have entered into the equivalent of our civil partnership in other states, who will, for the time being, continue to reside in other states that do not allow same sex marriage, and who will, for the best of reasons, enter into civil partnerships in the future.  There are states within the European Union that do not allow same sex marriage, some of which are very seriously opposed to it, and there are states of importance outside the European Union that do not allow same sex marriage.  Citizens from those states visit this country, come here lawfully to work and bring their partners with them.  I will mention two countries very briefly.  One is Germany, which does not at present allow same sex marriage, but allows civil partnership.  The second is Australia, which may in the foreseeable future change under the new Prime Minister.  It does not allow same sex marriage either.<\/p>  <p>  I see no reason and no constitutional difficulty of any description in this State continuing to recognise civil partnerships that are celebrated in other states subsequent to this legislation coming into force and attaching to those civil partnerships the same status that we currently attach to civil partnerships celebrated outside the State.  I do not see that giving rise to constitutional difficulties of any description.  It is a legislative matter.  It is by way of this State recognising a status conferred lawfully by another state on a couple and, where that status is different to the status of marriage, accepting that it attracts to it all of the same rights and obligations as attach to civil partnerships currently in this State.  I do not see that as a difficulty or as a constitutional issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am taking what Deputy McNamara is saying on this, because I am not a member of the justice committee, so I did not participate in the committee discussions.  I do not see how recognising civil partnership in that form could, in any legal shape, be regarded as \"an attack on marriage\".  It may be that the Minister is not saying that.  I do not know.  To say that to recognise foreign civil partnerships and to attach a status to them similar to the current status of Irish civil partnerships is an attack on marriage is equivalent to saying that the legislation we enacted in this State in 2010, which allowed for civil partnerships, was unconstitutional and was an attack on marriage.  There is no logic in this and there is no constitutional principle in it.<\/p>  <p>  This is a common-sense issue.  If a couple who have entered a civil partnership come to work and live in this State, under the European Union rules they have a right to freedom of movement and the right to establish here.  For example, we have many German nationals who are living in Ireland, working for multinational companies at present, and we have others who do not work for multinational companies but who simply come to live and work here because they have chosen Ireland as a country of residence.  If a German national in 2016 comes with his or her partner to live in Ireland, having in 2016 celebrated a civil partnership in Germany, why should we say we do not recognise that relationship, we do not recognise it as having any status and will not grant it any of the rights and obligations that we would grant that relationship under the law as it is at the moment?  It makes no sense.  It makes no legal sense, no constitutional sense and no human sense.<\/p>  <p>  This issue should be addressed.  It is not going to be addressed on Report Stage, quite clearly.  An appropriate amendment could be tabled in the Seanad.  I do not imagine there is any major political opposition on any side of this House to any such change.  I do not imagine there is any objection from the general public.  My plea is that we deal with this with a degree of additional insight into the human situations people find themselves in.<\/p><p>There are many Irish young people who in the past few years chose - some had no choice - to go to countries such as Australia to establish residence and work there.  It may well be that there are some Irish citizens who are parties to the Australian version of civil partnership celebrated in Australia who may in the coming years return home here.  They may not immediately marry.  There could be all sorts of reasons one would not immediately marry.  Let us take that human situation of two Irish citizens who have entered into a civil partnership in Australia, one of whom, for example, is seriously ill, and decide to come back to Ireland so that one of them can live his or her last few days on this earth in Ireland.  Are we to say, for example, that the surviving civil partner will have no inheritance rights unless, in a situation of medical emergency, a marriage had been celebrated upon their return to Ireland?  The one thing I know, as someone who worked in the area of family law over the years, is that there are such diversity of possible human predicaments that arise.  None of us can predict them, but there will be a circumstance which will give rise to great injustice and public outcry in a year, two years, three years or four years if we do not deal with this on a common sense basis.  This is not complex.  Like the Minister, I am anxious that this legislation goes through rapidly which is why I did what I could to highlight this issue some weeks ago.  I just do not understand why we are not addressing it and I hope we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700012#K00200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444212600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The proposed amendments have a number of aims.  One is to preserve civil partnership.  The second is to open civil partnership to opposite-sex couples and non-conjugal couples such as cohabiting family members or friends.  The third is to widen the scope of the redress scheme provided in Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act  2010 so that it also encompasses non-conjugal couples.  I want to address these matters which were subject to significant consideration in the preparation of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will be aware, the rights and obligations of civil partnership are broadly comparable with those of marriage, although civil partners do not have the additional constitutional recognition and protections that spouses have.  This means that allowing civil partnerships to continue as an alternative to marriage is fraught, as I stated on Committee Stage and previously, with constitutional difficulties.  When the constitutional interpretation was that same-sex couples could not marry, there was a clear justification for setting up the statutory scheme of civil partnership.  It enabled same-sex couples to enter a formal and recognised relationship with each other, to take on extensive rights and obligations in relation to each other, and to have strong legal protections and benefits in that relationship.  Those rights, obligations, benefits and protections correlated closely with those afforded to spouses in a marriage.  The constitutional context has now changed following the vote.  In the wake of the referendum and after the passage of this Bill, same-sex couples will be able to marry each other.  This means that the rationale that was there for providing civil partnership for same-sex couples is falling away.  Deputy McNamara talks about that six-month period.  That is no more than discontinuing the situation in an orderly way and I think courts would recognise that.<\/p>  <p>  The policy the Government has adopted in the Marriage Bill based on extensive and careful analysis and legal advice is that civil partnership will be discontinued in an orderly way.  The advice I have is that to consider maintaining access to civil partnership creates an unacceptable risk that the statutory scheme would become constitutionally non-compliant.  There is, therefore, a risk that a constitutional challenge to its continuation would be successful and civil partnership could be struck down.  This could have serious consequences for current civil partners.  That is a consideration as well, regarding a threat to the rights, obligations and protections of civil partnership.  That is the constitutional context that, I have been advised, has to be taken into account.  Neither would it be appropriate to downgrade civil partnership in order to make its continuation less constitutionally risky.  This is because the consequences for civil partners would be significant.  They have a reasonable expectation that their rights, protections and obligations will continue in force unless and until they dissolve the relationship, should that happen.<\/p>  <p>  To take up another element of Deputy McNamara's proposals, the intention of his amendments is that civil partnership would also be available to non-conjugal couples such as siblings or friends living together in the long term.  It is worth noting that being in a civil partnership is an impediment to marriage.  This would probably be seen as an unacceptable infringement on the right to marry set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.  Also, there is little evidence of a demand for civil partnership in this particular circumstance for these couples.  I remind the House, as Deputy McNamara will be well aware, that siblings are already in a preferred category in terms of succession rights, and, similarly, where two persons live together and one of them leaves a shared home to the other, the survivor may benefit from favourable treatment.  Obviously, there is that situation which is set out in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act  2003.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Deputy McNamara suggests an extension of the redress scheme set out in Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act  2010.  The Deputy's proposal is intended to enable couples, such as family members or friends living together, to have access to the remedy set out in Part 15.  A person would in certain circumstances be able to apply for maintenance or for a property or pension adjustment order from his or her friend or family members with whom he or she had been living, but there is not that much evidence that people want this.  There has not been substantial consultation in this area since 2006 when both the Law Reform Commission and my Department separately held consultation on what rights and obligations should be extended to cohabitants.  The Law Reform Commission observed importantly in the wider sense in relation to cohabitation that \"It would be difficult, however, to devise a scheme that would apply to all these relationships.  It would assume that a single rationale could be uniformly applied to such diverse situations.\"  The Working Group on Domestic Partnership also stated: \"In view of the dearth of submissions made, the Working Group found it difficult to consider in any depth the nature of the diverse relationships in this category and the options for and consequences of according legal recognition.\"<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of any major developments or evidence of demand for greater access to that redress scheme, I take the view that it is not appropriate to accept these amendments.  The scope of the Bill is specifically limited to the measures that are necessary to enable same-sex couples to marry, not to wider law reform in the sphere of personal relations that Deputy McNamara describes.  I think the Deputy would accept that this is outside.  These are broader issues that arise in relation to these issues which have been considered by both the constitutional law group and the working group.  The Deputy can see the complexity of the issues from the short piece that I quoted.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat the point in terms of my legal advice that continuing civil partnership for couples in Ireland creates constitutional difficulties.  Deputy McNamara describes that as conservative advice.  It is the advice that the Government has taken.  It is the advice that we have been given which I respect.  There are particular constitutional issues, as the House well knows, that arise in Ireland given the Constitution that must be taken into account.  We have got this important change through by going out to the people by way of referendum and that is the way one brings about such change.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising foreign registered partnerships is an equality issue as it would make an option available to couples who have registered partnerships abroad that will not be available to Irish resident couples.<\/p><p>Other changes would have to take place for it to happen.  We do not recognise opposite-sex registered partnerships, and arrangements are being proposed for same-sex couples.  There are varying complexities to the issue and it is not simple in that constitutional issues come into play.  I would not want to risk anything here.  It is very important.  The people have very clearly expressed their will regarding the contents of the Bill and everybody in the House wants us to move the legislation forward quickly.  This is the advice I have received and I am putting it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700013#L00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444213200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister and her Department on the speed with which they are moving the Bill forward and the fact the voice of the people in so far as it related to facilitating same-sex marriage is being heeded and enacted.  The Minister said it is only what is required to introduce same-sex marriage.  Is it necessary to remove the institution of civil partnership?  The Minister said there has not been a public consultation on the matter since 2006.  Why are we removing this institution without a public consultation?  The people voted in favour of equality, not to confine family relations that enjoy legal protection to marriage alone.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the downgrading of the protections of civil partnership to make it constitutional.  Nowhere in my amendments have I suggested downgrading the protections.  I would not propose it and would find such a suggestion hard to accept.  There would be rights that would be enjoyed by non-conjugal couples, not accidentally by two mates who happen to live together but by two people who voluntarily and knowingly entered into a civil partnership.  One would not accidentally find oneself subject to a maintenance order in respect of a friend with whom one had lived during college and for a few months afterwards.  This is not what is proposed.  It would be for people who voluntarily enter into a civil partnership.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister justified the six-month issue as an orderly discontinuance or an orderly wind-down.  While I do not accept that recognising civil partnerships from abroad is an attack, if it is, an orderly wind-down of an attack is still an attack for six months.  There is a lack of logic in the Bill in this regard.  Either we can recognise civil partnerships, which we can and should, or we cannot.  If we cannot, to do so for six months is unconstitutional.

There is a long waiting list to get married for heterosexual couples, who are the only ones who can get married.  It is difficult to get a place, and no matter how long one waits, one cannot get a registrar to perform a marriage on a Saturday, Sunday or even 5 p.m. on a Friday.  It is limited.  If one wants to get married at a time of one's choosing, one had better have a religious marriage.  Freedom of religion is a cornerstone of our Constitution.  As a Roman Catholic, I have the right to be married in a Roman Catholic church if the church allows me to do so.  One of the key aspects of freedom of religion is freedom from religion.  If I am not a member of a religious group, I should still have a right to be married.  However, it is severely curtailed, not by law but by the practicalities of getting married.  It must be Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in a registry office.<\/p><p>We recently introduced an amendment to allow humanist marriages.  Although it is not a religion, humanism is a belief structure or concept, not a secular structure.  I greatly welcome the fact the House will soon pass a Bill that will enable gay couples to get married.  Already, straight couples cannot get married when they want to and there is a very long waiting list.  Added to this will be the number of gay couples who will, it is hoped, want to get married.  We believe a large number wish to get married, and even if there is only one, it is still very important because it is equality.  The practical question is whether they will be able to get married.  Resources are probably insufficient.  I wrote to the Minister previously and was told it was a resources issue, which I accept.  If it is, maybe we should consider alternatives.<\/p><p>Given that we respect religions equally, we allow members of religious organisations equally to solemnise marriages.  Is there a particular reason people such as commissioners for oaths, notaries public or peace commissioners could not apply to solemnise marriages?  I am not suggesting all the formalities of giving notice, attending the registry office to produce documentation and identification, and satisfying the registrar that it is not a sham marriage should not continue.  Those civil protections exist no matter who solemnises a marriage and no matter where, be it a mosque, Roman Catholic church or synagogue, and I do not propose to alter them.  Given there are not enough registrars in Ireland to marry the people who want to get married now, much less those who will want to get married after the Bill has passed, maybe we should consider allowing commissioners for oaths, peace commissioners, notaries public or some secular figures in society to solemnise marriages.  I am not saying they should all be allowed to solemnise marriages at the stroke of a pen but that they should be allowed to apply to the registrar to be registered to solemnise marriages.  Statutory instruments could be introduced to ensure they had the requisite training and abilities to do so.  I urge the Minister to consider this practical problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700014#M00600","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1444213200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>The Deputy raises an interesting point in that there is an issue in terms of people being able to get married on a Saturday, for example.

It is absolutely beautiful.  It is an old church.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Keating, sings in a choir and is a musician.  The atmosphere at this wonderful venue was befitting of the occasion.  We changed the ceremony venue from being in the registry office.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to speak about the context of what we have done as a country and as a State.  We have extended the right to marry to all of us.  As I said earlier, we are no longer locked out.  The Saturday issue that has been mentioned means that in some cases, people have to go to the registry office during the week to get married, or in the past civil partnered, on their own with their witnesses before having their public celebrations on the Saturday.  This brings me back to the point that has been made about hotels.  I am not flying the flag for the hotel industry.  I am talking about the actual ceremony.  For the couple involved, it is probably the most important day of their lives.  We need to be creative in the context of this amendment.  I am not quite sure I would be happy to provide for peace commissioners to take on this role.  I mean no disrespect to any of the peace commissioners I know, one of whom is my father, when I say that.  I think the registrar is the person in question.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McNamara has raised a very valid point that needs to be responded to.  He has spoken about freedom from religion.  I know the Catholic Church has its own rules and regulations.  We still have the view, which we expressed during the campaign, that it is not about being able to get married in a church.  The Church of Ireland has a different view in some cases.  One of the most extraordinary exponents of the referendum was Bishop Colton in Cork.  Would it not be great if he or others could do this?  That is a different argument.  I think we need to see whether we can expand on the argument that Deputy McNamara has presented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700015#N00900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1444213800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I am loth to engage in competitive tendering for appropriate locations for marriage celebrations, but without promoting any commercial outlet I would like to mention that Marlay Park, Airfield and Rathfarnham Castle in my constituency make fantastic venues for celebrating marriages.

We rarely get an opportunity to discuss the issue he has raised in this House.  Just as weddings are happy occasions, the enactment of this legislation will be a very happy occasion.  I wish to use Deputy McNamara's amendment to tease out a particular issue, which I have found to be a source of personal irritation for many years.  I know many people who have sought to marry have found it to be a cause of irritation too.  It has been mentioned by Deputies McNamara and Buttimer.  Many years ago, when the civil registry office was effectively located in a solicitors' firm in Kildare Street, civil marriages in Dublin were celebrated there by a Mr. Downey with great solemnity and aplomb.  All of this was subsequently taken over, in effect, by the former Eastern Health Board.<\/p>  <p>  I do not understand why this bureaucratic administrative requirement is not being questioned.  It seems it will always be done in this way because it has always been done in this way.  I think it is right that we should question why a civil marriage should have to be celebrated between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday., simply because they are the work hours of the officials who are employed by the State or a State agency.  I understand that no one wants to pay them overtime for working outside their working hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  Has anyone ever suggested that they might work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Tuesday to Saturday?  Maybe some of them would welcome that and there would be no extra charge to the State.  There are many people who would like to celebrate their wedding on a Saturday or a Sunday.  Getting married is a very special occasion.<\/p>  <p>  Most people who are getting married, or whose friends are getting married, do not object to taking a day off work, but it presents as a difficulty for some people.  It can present as a difficulty for people who are flying in from abroad for weddings.  Many people, particularly those who are having civil marriage ceremonies, would like to marry on a Saturday or a Sunday.  The only group through which that can be done at the moment is the Humanist Association of Ireland.  It is fantastic that the humanists can celebrate ceremonies.  I understand they are now celebrating wedding ceremonies for large numbers of people who are not members of the Humanist Association of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  This does not fall within the Minister's remit, but it is relevant to the discussion and the amendment.  I cannot for the life of me see why we are so structured and inflexible.  It is just assumed that one can never celebrate a marriage ceremony earlier than 9 a.m. on a Monday or later than 5 p.m. on a Friday, and not at all on a Saturday or Sunday unless it is a religiously celebrated ceremony or the Humanist Association of Ireland has a vacancy and is able to celebrate one's ceremony.  That may be months away because of the demand being experienced by the humanists.<\/p>  <p>  This is an administrative issue.  It is not about legislation.  It is simply about whether we can rearrange the bureaucracy.  It may well be that those who are currently celebrating marriages would be delighted to do this.  Maybe they would have no difficulty at all with it.  For all sorts of domestic reasons, it might suit them to work on a Saturday and not on a Monday.  I have no idea.  I simply do not know.  It should not be beyond the realms of human ingenuity at Government or HSE level to ensure we have a more flexible arrangement.  It may well be that a few more officials could be trained to celebrate marriage ceremonies.  Maybe some people would be very happy to do this at the weekend, or early in the morning.  It may not be an enormous financial imposition on the State.<\/p>  <p>  We all visit myriad of countries outside this State.  I have not done a survey of how many European countries, or countries beyond the EU, allow one to celebrate one's civil ceremony on a Saturday or a Sunday, but I would be aware that the number is quite considerable.  We are in some sort of marital celebratory ceremony straitjacket that has been bestowed on us by an administrative bureaucracy that nobody questions.  I sometimes get into trouble for asking questions, but this is not a question of great complexity.  Why should we continue to do this in the way we have been doing it?<\/p>  <p>  I believe the public would welcome the availability of civil registrars who would celebrate marriages on Saturdays and Sundays and after 5 p.m. during the summer months.  Why does it stop at 5 p.m. during the summer months?  I do not know the answer to that question.  Why should a marriage not be celebrated at 7 p.m. on a Friday evening during the summer at some venue where people would like to celebrate it?  This would enable guests attending the ceremony to work the day if they so wished.  Why are we in this sort of odd bureaucratic straitjacket?  It makes no sense.<\/p>  <p>  This is of relevance to heterosexual couples, gay couples and all people who are going to marry in the future.  Perhaps the Minister could have this conversation with her colleague in government who is responsible for this matter.  Maybe there could be some dramatic and simple change that would affect this area and bring us out of the sort of strange straitjacket that we have been in since the 19th or 20th centuries and into a more flexible 21st century model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700015#N01200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1444213800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>My party indicated on Second Stage that it would not be submitting any amendments, in the spirit of the Bill and the decision made by the people in the referendum, to allow this legislation to make speedy progress through the Houses.  However, I want to acknowledge Deputy McNamara's amendment and the previous amendment.  I think the issues that have been raised are valid.  In the case of this amendment, it strikes me that same-sex couples will not be able to get married outside a registry office.  Therefore, as Deputy Shatter has said, they will be hampered by the current office hours, which will restrict them to getting married between Monday and Friday.  Obviously, wider options will be available to couples who are able to get married in religious ceremonies.<\/p><p>Clearly there is an issue of equality at play here when one set of couples will not have the same options in terms of the day for getting married and having their receptions on the same day.

I will relay today's discussion to her again because I believe these are issues for consideration.  I do not need to elaborate further on them because they speak for themselves.  Deputies have outlined the particular points and the limitations of current arrangements.  Clearly various discussions must be had with the relevant people to make these changes, but the points made are valid and there is no question of me arguing against them.

The role of solemniser is a serious and responsible one.  Deputy Buttimer said that he is not sure he would agree with the changes proposed by Deputy McNamara.  The person authorised to act as solemniser is nominated either by the approved religion of which he or she is a member, as the Deputy has said, or the approved secular body as provided for in the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2012.  Following that Act, bodies must comply with the requirements set down in legislation and solemnisers must have the necessary training.  All these issues and any unforeseen consequences which could arise would have to be considered in detail before changes could be countenanced.  I do not believe these amendments are for this Bill but this discussion certainly has been worthwhile.

We need flexibility.  State services, whether one is talking about the solemnisation of marriage or a bus from A to B, exist for the benefit of the public and not for the benefit of those who provide them.  Obviously those who provide the services must be looked after and paid.  They are essential to the provision of a good service but fundamentally a State service exists for the benefit of the public and we need to bear that in mind.  I am glad that discussions are taking place on the fact that civil marriages cannot currently take place on Saturdays or Sundays.  I acknowledge that there is no requirement to change legislation to achieve that and that it can be done under the existing framework if registrars will agree to marry people at weekends.  However, if they continue to refuse to do so, then the point made by Deputy Shatter that civil marriages were once carried out in solicitors' offices is valid.  There is no particular reason notary publics could not carry them out in the future again if the registrars are determined not to work on Saturdays and Sundays.  Ultimately, registrars carry out a State function and it is a very important function provided by the State, that of marrying people.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister.  I will not press the amendment in light of the constructive discussion we have had but it is an issue that needs to be looked at and not just parked until the next time there is a Bill before the House that happens to be about marriage.

Now that we have almost passed this marriage equality legislation, there may be other changes to marriage that Deputies have in mind.  The point made by the Deputy is one we must look at in the context of all the contributions to this debate.  How marriage is celebrated and solemnised requires further debate.  I know from speaking to registrars about this issue that it may boil down to resources.  The Minister said she has already spoken to the Minister for Social Protection.  The HSE, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality are the three organs of State which must move on this.  Deputy Shatter is right that it should be possible to have marriages at 3 p.m., 7 p.m., on a Saturday or Sunday or whatever.  We have moved on from the old approach to marriage, where it depended on when the priest was available in the case of church marriages or whatever slot was available in the registry office.  We must have a wider discussion about how we can perform marriage celebrations for couples.  I hope we can be creative and come up with a solution to what is a first world problem on one level, given that the success of the referendum now presents people with the option of getting married which they did not have before.  I hope the Departments will have a conversation about how we can change the times available.  We have already made changes with regard to venues and can make further changes once the will exists.

I will look back, very briefly, if I may.  I was very privileged, as Minister for Justice and Equality, to bring to Cabinet the proposal that we hold a referendum to provide for marriage equality.  It was an outstanding outcome to that referendum that such a large majority in this State supported change.  This is the next historical event, following on from that referendum, with this legislation being passed by this D&aacute;il.  The Bill has yet to go through the Seanad but I hope that the desire we all have for this to pass speedily through the Seanad will not prevent the Minister from looking at and addressing in the Seanad the issues discussed today because bringing the Bill back to the D&aacute;il would delay its enactment by no more than a few days.  It is very important we get it right and I urge the Minister to look again at the issue of those who enter into civil partnerships abroad after this legislation becomes effective and attach to those civil partnerships the same status that we will continue to attach to civil partnerships that have been celebrated by couples in this State before the legislation has become operative.<\/p><p>A myriad of difficulties could arise if we were not to do that, but I will not go into them today.<\/p> <p> We should celebrate the fact that this legislation has been enacted through the House.  It is a major step towards putting flesh on the bones of the decision made in the referendum in that it enables same-sex couples to have the same recognition extended to their loving relationships that those of us who are heterosexual have had the benefit of for so long.  Constitutionally we are all equal, and we are all now seen to be equal.  There was never any reason for individuals to be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation.<\/p> <p> There remains one issue that must be addressed and that has yet to come before this Chamber.  Crucial change is needed to section 37 of the Employment Equality Act in order that individuals are not discriminated against and do not fear discrimination against them in their employment due to their sexual orientation or the simple fact that they may now avail of the right they have, as a same sex couple, to enter into a same-sex marriage.  In April 2014, when I was Minister for Justice and Equality, a report on this issue was provided to my Department.  I had asked the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to look at how we could better balance the provisions in the Employment Equality Act.  As I understand it, the Government is proceeding to address the issue.  It is important that it be addressed during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  I am concerned that it not be postponed until a later occasion.  I am also concerned, in the context of the employment of certain people such as teachers working in denominationally based schools, that they may fear availing of the freedom extended to them by being entitled to enter into a same-sex marriage and may be concerned as to the consequences with regard to their employment or promotional opportunities if we do not amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act.  I hope the necessary measure will come before the House and will be enacted in the form recommended for change before the House sees an end to its life because of the calling of a general election.  I do not have any insight into whether we will see an election on this side or the far side of Christmas.

The weekend of debate in Malahide was one of the memorable and moving moments in the 12-month life of the convention.

This comes after the same entity created 700 additional jobs over and above those that were already in local authorities delivering water services and paid bonuses in respect of those 700 positions.  It was also confirmed that there will be a flat-rate charge for the next seven years despite the fact the Government decided with Irish Water to spend &euro;550 million on water meters that will, in essence, be redundant for the next seven years and perhaps beyond.  It is a colossal waste of public funding.  Irish Water has failed the EUROSTAT test when the rationale for setting it up in the first place was to have it off balance sheet.  It no longer can be and there are very good reasons for that.  Up to half the people have not paid their water charges and the conservation grant will be given to those who do not pay their water charges.  By the way, the Government is even screwing up the giving out of the grant, which it cannot do properly.  There are thousands of people ringing up and the form is impossible to decipher and follow through.<\/p>  <p>  It is people's general taxation which has paid for this.  From motor tax alone, &euro;265 million has gone for the establishment and operational costs of Irish Water while next year it will be &euro;316 million.  If one takes the full total that has been spent, we are worse off by &euro;800 million.  Up to &euro;800 million has been spent on this entity and not an extra cent has been spent on water infrastructure.

Now, Fianna F&aacute;il wants to restore the situation that applied before with 31 local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Irish Water business plan.  It sets out a &euro;5.5 billion investment plan to 2021 so that all of the challenges and difficulties that were apparent for many years can be dealt with.  The plan includes, for example, the elimination of all boil-water notices, making safe the supplies that are currently at risk for 940,000 people, ending the practice from 2015 of continuing to pump raw sewage into our rivers, harbours and seas at 44 locations throughout the country, there for all to see, a reduction in the amount of leaks from 49% to under 38%, and an increase in the fresh water capacity for Dublin city in particular where it is currently balanced on a knife edge.  The business plan published this morning sets out the structure by which this will be achieved, including making operational savings of &euro;1.1 billion over the period.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water has achieved reductions in numbers because of natural wastage and people retiring.  One of the reasons was to reduce the waste or duplication of having 34 separate water authorities which were not of a similar high standard serving the people of the country.  I understand that the business plan targets a 7% year-on-year efficiency in the inherited cost base culminating in &euro;1.1 billion in savings, which is the equivalent of a 40% reduction by 2021.  Irish Water has set out that it sees a sizeable reduction of up to 1,200 with a primary focus on the operational local authority staff engaged under service level agreements.  Irish Water points out that it may be necessary to have a voluntary scheme in the course of those years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700018#Q01700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444215600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>There is no &quot;may be&quot; about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700018#Q01800","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1444215600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The numbers involved in operations within local authorities have reduced by 300 since 1 January last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700018#Q01900","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444216200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>What about the meters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700019#R00100","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1444216200,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Irish Water estimates that a further 1,200 reduction will need to be managed through natural attrition, redeployment and a voluntary redundancy scheme.

Deputy McDonald challenged NAMA about redactions in its responses to questions from the Northern Ireland inquiry and in particular, details of Frank Cushnahan's conflict of interest declaration to the agency.  NAMA's representatives told the Deputy they could not give them to her and were not even obliged to so do.  Answers will not be forthcoming without a commission of inquiry.  There have been a great number of questions but there have been absolutely no answers and I still am not convinced the Government wants the answers.  Members still do not know why NAMA allowed the Project Eagle process to continue despite the involvement of Tughans and Brown Rudnick, which had been involved in the Pimco deal.

I then asked the Taoiseach what I thought was a very reasonable question - to confirm if the House was to be dissolved before the end of the year.  If a general election is called, the banking inquiry will never report and I believe the House should be apprised of that matter.  It is reasonable that the House would have some certainty, having voted on this issue yesterday, as to whether the banking inquiry will report in January unhindered, in other words, that the report of the banking inquiry will not be undermined or prevented by the calling of a general election.  It is very reasonable to seek clarity on that and, if necessary, we should have time to discuss it.  It could not be more basic than that.  Given all the time, effort and money that has been put into the inquiry, it seems extraordinary that the Taoiseach cannot give a straight answer as to whether it will definitively report in January on the basis that there will not be a general election before the end of the year.  I would appreciate it, therefore, if the Taoiseach could, in a straightforward and upfront manner, give an answer to that simple and reasonable request.<\/p><p>Secondly, last night on <i>Prime Time<\/i>there were some harrowing stories and presentations by many families and relatives of people who lost their loved ones.  In some cases they were murdered or killed.  They were very genuine cases.  As the Taoiseach knows, an independent panel of barristers was set up by the Minister for Justice and Equality to investigate these particular cases, including that of Mrs. O'Farrell who lost her son in an appalling situation.  In another case, the family of Shane Tuohey outlined the circumstances of his death which, they would assert, were not investigated properly by the Garda.  What emerged from the programme was deep dissatisfaction with the process to date in terms of the independent panel and the replies that quite a number of the families have received.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach has seen the programme, but it would be worth his while watching it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700021#T03400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1444217400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Other Deputies did not get in yesterday.

In fact, some of these cases came directly to the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p><p>This is the only Government that has set up an independent investigation and analysis of all of these cases, over 200 in total.  The Minister was very careful to have a person of appropriate experience look at all these cases objectively and communicate with the persons involved or their loved ones.  The independent review was not put together as a commission of investigation or a commission of inquiry.  Its purpose was to look at the allegations made and to make a determination on whether any further action was needed.  It is important to note that it was open to the independent review mechanism to recommend any form of statutory inquiry into cases that it examined.  Deputy Martin will be aware, because he gave some of them to me himself, that some of these cases are very complicated and go back over many years.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that the Garda has fully complied with all requests for information in connection with the cases that were referred to the panel.  Any suggestion that the panel did not receive full co-operation and full information is not accurate.  The panel has provided recommendations to the Minister in all 320 cases and the Minister has accepted the recommendations of counsel in all cases.  In order to ensure the probity and independence of the entire process from start to finish, the Minister for Justice and Equality requested the retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Murphy, to undertake the task of overseeing the preparation of the letters of notification to ensure that those letters contained a fair and accurate reflection of the panel's recommendation.  A total of 152 letters have issued to date.  Some cases resulted in recommendations for further action, which the Minister has accepted, including referral to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and requesting a report from the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 41(2) of the Act of 2005.  The remaining notification letters will continue to issue over the coming weeks.  It is understood that a number of these cases will result in significant further action, of which I am not yet aware.  It is the intention of the Minister, on the completion of the process, to make a comprehensive statement of all the actions she has decided to take in line with the recommendations from counsel, and that will be discussed here.<\/p> <p> I referred to the other matter Deputy Martin mentioned yesterday.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis requested extra time from the D&aacute;il to complete his report and the committee's report.  The D&aacute;il granted extra time until the end of January.  That is normal business and a normal request.

I think it is a discourtesy.<\/p>  <p>  There will be much discussion on the squeezed middle and double taxation, but I have considerable sympathy for one particular group and that is those who in good faith bought a house in a housing development which had planning permission, on which they could legitimately have expected work to have been done properly, that the works would have been supervised, given that we live in a civilised country, and that the estate would have eventually been taken in charge.  In many estates throughout the country this is simply not the case.  Estates have not been finished and will not be taken in charge.  The local authorities are reluctant to do so because they were not the developer and just gave planning permission, but the roads and lights are unfinished and the greens are not maintained.  The residents of these estates have very little comeback.<\/p>  <p>  On top of this, the Government introduced a local property charge.  I have no sympathy for those who do not pay their taxes.  The local property charge was introduced to fund local services such as roads, lights, open spaces, sewers and water mains.  People who live in these estates pay this charge in good faith and in effect get nothing back because they must pay again on the double to a management committee to provide for this.<\/p>  <p>  There are obstacles in law to the local authorities taking these estates in charge.  These include that a petition can be initiated or signed by the residents to have an estate which is not properly complete taken in charge, but this can only happen seven years after the planning permission has elapsed.  Seven years is a very long time to pay the local property charge and get nothing back.  Another obstacle is that local authorities which are not water services authorities cannot take the water mains and sewerage systems in charge.  This covers every local authority because no local authority is now a water services authority.  All the functions of water service authorities have been transferred to Irish Water.  In practice what happens is a local authority engages in a discussion with Irish Water on taking an estate in charge and Irish Water considers the matter over a long and protracted period, as public bodies generally engage in very protracted discussions that take a long time, and it arrives at the conclusion that the water services in the estate are not up to scratch and were not properly done so it will not take it in charge.  In particular, Irish Water is refusing to take in charge developer-led sewerage developments which do not go into the main sewage system but have a separate sewage treatment plant for the estate, many of which do not work, and when they do, they are funded by the residents.<\/p>  <p>  I am among the Deputies who encourage people to pay their local property and water charges because they have been legitimately introduced by the House, and regardless of whether one agrees with them, they have been introduced.  It is very hard when people tell me they bought a house back in 2005 in good faith and paid an awful lot more for it than it is now worth while a fellow down the road bought another house, and in return for his water and local property charges he has the lights and the road outside his house maintained, running water into the house and the sewerage works properly.  The people speaking to me are in an estate where the roads and the lights are not finished, the greens are not maintained and the sewerage system does not work and they ask me why should they pay for these.  I honestly cannot say such people should pay for these.  The people should pay, but the local authorities should take these estates in charge and if they incur costs in fixing these estates for which they gave planning permission - which they may well do and this is why they do not take them in charge - they can, of course, pursue the developer.  At present the argument is there is a bond and perhaps residents of the estate should pursue the developer.  They cannot do so because they are ordinary citizens who do not have that much money.  Local authorities have money and legal departments and are in a position to remedy the situation, which is why I am bringing the legislation before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700024#W05700","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1444219200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700024#W05800","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444219200,"counter":608,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700024#W05900","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444219200,"counter":609,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700024#W06000","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444219800,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700025#X00100","speaker":"977"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1444219800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"European Council Meeting: Statements","time":1444219800,"counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700025#X00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1444219800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the diverse agenda of the European Council taking place next week in Brussels.  Following the events of recent months, which have seen the greatest movement of people to and through Europe since World War II, international and European attention has rightly been focused on the current refugee and migration crisis.  An extraordinary European Council was convened on 23 September, which I attended.  Building on previous European Council meetings in April and June, this considered both the immediate crisis and some of the broader issues around migration and our collective efforts to deal with them.  It agreed on a wide range of issues requiring intense and urgent further work.<\/p><p>The European Council will next week continue its work on shaping a comprehensive EU approach on the basis of solidarity and responsibility and recognising the crisis points that exist around our Union.  This will involve a further substantial discussion on migration in all its aspects, including follow-up on the points agreed at the previous European Council meetings.  The Council will be briefed on the outcomes of the meetings with the Turkish President in Brussels on Monday and tomorrow's high level conference on the western Balkans route.  It will also take stock of preparations for the Valletta summit with the African Union in early November.<\/p><p>Also on the agenda and further to the June 2015 meeting, the European Council will take stock of discussions to date on the five presidents' report on economic and monetary union, based on work undertaken by the Council and by the Commission.  Again following on from the June European Council, where British Prime Minister Cameron outlined his general thinking on EU reform and the UK referendum on EU membership, the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, will inform Heads of State and Government about the state of play of the technical analysis that has been taking place at official level.  The president will also set out his intentions for the process ahead.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to address foreign policy issues in his wrap-up statement.  Of course, the issue in Syria is directly relevant to the migration crisis.  I will, however, now address the other issues on the agenda.  I should add that the fact that this statement necessarily has had to be made somewhat earlier than usual means that the draft conclusions have not yet been circulated by President Tusk, nor have the normal preliminary discussions yet taken place in Brussels.<\/p><p>The issue of migration and the current refugee crisis has been at the centre of European discussion for a number of months.  European Union justice Ministers met twice in September at emergency Councils in Brussels, first to confirm an earlier decision to relocate 40,000 people and then to adopt proposals to relocate a further 120,000 people in need of international protection.  This means that a total of 160,000 people seeking asylum will be relocated to other EU member states from Greece, Italy and other states that may be hit by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries.  At the informal European Council meeting on 23 September, progress on taking forward the various elements of a comprehensive approach to migration, which were broadly agreed at our meetings in April and June, was examined.  Outcomes included a commitment of some &euro;1 billion in budgetary assistance to agencies such as the UNHCR and the World Food Programme, as well as renewed diplomatic efforts to resolve the crises in Syria and Libya.  Strengthening the protection of the EU's borders and better arrangements to process arriving asylum seekers in front-line countries were also discussed.<\/p><p>Ireland has consistently called for solidarity, both externally and internally, in shaping the EU's responses to the migration issue.  We have aimed in our approach to be both compassionate and practical, seeking to alleviate suffering, as well as tackling root causes.  I note that Ireland has been making an important contribution on a number of fronts to ongoing efforts to tackle the crisis.  The Government has agreed that it will accept in the region of 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees overall under resettlement and relocation programmes.  This is well in excess of any notional &quot;quota&quot; that we might have been attributed by the European Commission.  This includes 520 refugees who we have offered to resettle from refugee camps.  Some of these have now started arriving in Ireland.  The decisions to relocate 600 people from Italy and Greece under the initial Commission proposal and a further approximately 1,850 under the subsequent Commission proposal were, of course, subject to Oireachtas approval.  This has now been received and the European Commission was duly notified on Monday, 5 October, of Ireland's intention to join the two measures.  The remaining 1,030 people will be taken on resettlement or on relocation, with the final breakdown between these two categories still under consideration.<\/p><p>We have deployed a naval vessel and full crew in the Mediterranean since June, initially the <i>LE Eithne<\/i>, then <i>LE Niamh<\/i>and now the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>, to assist our Italian colleagues in their international humanitarian search and rescue efforts there.  Since May, our naval vessels have rescued 7,639 people.  We are extremely proud of their outstanding endeavours in very difficult circumstances, and I know that everyone in the House and the Irish people as a whole are united in their admiration and appreciation.  Why would that not be the case, given our history of coffin ships off Canada and the United States?<\/p><p>Importantly, we provide other supports to areas particularly affected by instability and conflict.  For example, a total of &euro;41 million will have been provided by the end of 2015 towards assisting those displaced as a result of the Syrian crisis, including through participation in a regional development and protection programme in the Middle East.  We have also provided almost &euro;36 million in humanitarian funding to Somalia over the past number of years.  Furthermore, at the start of September, we committed to doubling our annual contribution to the World Food Programme from &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million per annum for the next three years.  All of these measures have been supported by a swift response at home, led by the Department of Justice and Equality, to put measures in place that will facilitate the arrival of refugees to Ireland and offer a welcome safe haven for those seeking international protection.<\/p><p>The announcement on 10 September of the establishment of the Irish refugee protection programme and particularly the efforts of a new interdepartmental task force chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality are important steps in the Government&rsquo;s contribution to long-term sustainable solutions to this crisis.  An important part of Ireland&rsquo;s response to the migration crisis is our participation in forthcoming high level meetings with a specific regional focus, both of which were also discussed at the extraordinary European Council meeting on 23 September.  The first meeting, the western Balkans conference, takes place in Luxembourg tomorrow and will be attended by Ministers dealing with migration issues.  This will immediately follow the scheduled meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council tomorrow and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, will attend on behalf of Ireland.<\/p><p>The western Balkans conference is expected to agree a declaration emphasising the need for solidarity and a collective response to what is a common challenge.  In this context, Turkish President Erdogan&rsquo;s visit to Brussels earlier this week, when he held talks with the presidents of the European Parliament, European Council and European Commission - Presidents Schulz, Tusk and Juncker - is significant.  Turkey hosts over 2.2 million people from Syria and Iraq, so it must play an important part in addressing the crisis.  President Juncker and President Erdogan at their meeting discussed a draft plan for strengthening co-operation between the EU and Turkey in responding to the migration crisis.  This plan constitutes an important part of the ongoing political dialogue between the EU and Turkey, building on but going beyond the accession framework.  It focuses on supporting refugees and their host communities in Turkey on the one hand and stepping up co-operation in combating irregular migration on the other.  The Commission and President Erdogan agreed to take forward work on the plan quickly.  There will be continuing indepth consideration of the issue as it affects Turkey and other partners at the western Balkans conference tomorrow and of course, following that, at the European Council itself.<\/p><p>The conference declaration is expected to identify five key common actions, including support for host governments and communities in Syria&rsquo;s immediate neighbourhood, primarily Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey; support to affected transit countries; co-operation in the fight against people-smuggling and associated organised crime; addressing the root causes of forced displacement; and working with countries of origin.  We are hopeful that the conference will contribute to making progress in dealing with this very complex and difficult issue.<\/p><p>A second meeting, bringing together EU leaders and our African counterparts, as well as representatives of multilateral organisations in the region, will take place in Valletta, Malta, on 11 and 12 November.  This summit was identified by EU leaders at our April Council as a valuable opportunity to increase engagement with our African partners.<\/p><p>The purpose of the summit is to focus on the external relations dimension of migration policy and to find the appropriate tools to address both current and future migratory challenges.<\/p> <p> The conference will seek to build on existing co-operation frameworks with African partners, many of which are countries of origin and transit, in order to address migration challenges to our mutual benefit.  It is proposed to issue two documents from the Valletta summit, a political declaration and an action plan with areas of action.  Arrangements for the Valletta summit, including the preparation of these outcome documents, are ongoing across my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p> At the upcoming European Council, Heads of State and Government will give further consideration to the report entitled Completing Europe&rsquo;s Economic and Monetary Union, which was published by the presidents of the Euro Summit, the ECB, the Eurogroup, the European Parliament and the Commission on 22 June.  This is known as the report of the five presidents.  At the June European Council, the report was noted and referred back to Council for \"rapid examination\".<\/p> <p> It will be recalled that, building on measures implemented in recent years to make economic and monetary union, EMU, more stable and resilient, the report proposes a two-stage approach to further reform.  The first is a short-term stage focused on boosting competitiveness, maintaining responsible fiscal policies and completing banking union, while the second is a longer-term stage which could involve more significant changes to the EU&rsquo;s economic and institutional architecture.<\/p> <p> Following discussions by finance Ministers at the informal ECOFIN in September and by social and employment Ministers at EPSCO on 5 October, the Commission is expected to present some definite proposals for stage one in the coming weeks.  These are likely to include an in-depth review of the so-called six-pack and two-pack, which set out detailed fiscal rules in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, some reorganisation of the European semester, and a proposal for unified external representation of the euro area at international financial institutions.<\/p> <p> Subsequent proposals are expected to focus on completing the banking union.  Ways to strengthen the euro area&rsquo;s focus on competitiveness issues and its ability to take an overview of its fiscal position are also being considered.  There has also been discussion of ways to strengthen the social dimension of the euro area.<\/p> <p> In general terms, Ireland is pragmatic and realistic about what can be achieved.  As we see it, economic governance within EMU has been subject to major changes in recent years.  The effects of these changes still have to be fully worked through, particularly at national level, where a considerable European dimension has been introduced into the framing of budgets.  Our stated position has been that work must continue on fully implementing the current economic governance framework, rather than engaging in significant further initiatives.<\/p> <p> Our focus has to be on practical measures for driving economic growth and the EU's ability to deliver for its citizens.  However, we welcome the focus of the proposed short-term measures in stage one, particularly the completion of banking union and acceleration of the capital markets union, CMU, with the CMU action plan, which was launched by the Commission on 30 September.<\/p> <p> As for the medium to longer term, as the debate on future options becomes more concrete, which it may not be for some time, we will continue to engage fully with partners and the institutions on the basis of our own national analysis.  I welcome the recent hearings by the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the future of EMU, which represent a useful contribution to widening debate here.<\/p> <p> Finally, I will just say a word on the issue of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s membership of the European Union.  Firstly, I understand that President Tusk intends to update Heads of State and Government at the Council on the state of play of the technical work that has been under way in Brussels between British and EU officials since the June European Council.  I look forward to hearing from President Tusk and to finding out how he sees the process advancing in the weeks ahead.  There is an expectation that the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, will present his latest thinking on the issues he has identified at some stage after the European Council meeting, and the hope is that this will lead to a phase of more detailed discussion.  The arrangements for taking forward that detailed discussion are not yet clear, but there is likely to be further consideration by Heads of State and Government at the European Council meeting in December.<\/p> <p> I set out the position of the Government at some length in answer to questions in the House last week.  However, I would like to take this opportunity again to stress that the place of the United Kingdom in the European Union is of real national importance for Ireland, and this issue is a strategic priority for the Government.  I have made clear to Mr. Cameron in my discussions with him how much value we attach to the fact that both of our countries are members of the European Union.  We are therefore watching developments very closely.  Officials in my Department, our permanent representation in Brussels and our embassy in London are in very regular contact with British and other colleagues.  We will be open and pragmatic when it comes to sensible proposals to improve the EU and make it better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and also to address specific UK concerns, although of course we will be fully conscious both of our own national interests and of the views of other member states.  We will work with the British Government and all our EU partners to find a consensual basis for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of our Union.  I look forward to learning more about progress next week and, of course, to reporting to the House afterwards.<\/p> <p> The European Council will, therefore, address a number of important issues.  I expect that, in keeping with the urgency and complexity of the situation, migration will dominate proceedings, but the discussions of EMU and the UK will also be of considerable interest for the longer term.  I look forward now to hearing Deputies&rsquo; comments and perspectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700025#X00400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444220400,"counter":615,"content":"<p>When this D&aacute;il first met, four and a half years ago, there was cross-party agreement that we would put European issues at the heart of our discussions.  We all agreed that pan-EU matters had become too important for Ireland to be left as an afterthought.  Unfortunately, the reality is that things have actually got worse.  There has, on occasion, been more time scheduled for speeches, but the level of serious engagement with European issues has got worse.  Ultimately, our Government or Parliament has not engaged properly with the major issues facing Europe today.<\/p>  <p>  As the Government enters its final days, it has no stated policy on the reform of the Union.  It is content with banal generalities with regard to the UK's position.  It has accepted policies on banking union and fiscal controls which leave untouched key causes of the recession.  It has been playing catch-up on the refugee crisis, only starting to engage once the scale of public outrage became clear.  Deputies have lost count of the number of times the Taoiseach has come in here to say that everything is in hand and the crisis is being addressed.  Yet Europe continues to stumble from crisis to crisis.  The failure of the Taoiseach and his colleagues to act before a situation reaches boiling point continues to define their behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Today's debate is actually the first time in four months that we have been allowed to discuss Europe.  The Taoiseach refused to report to the D&aacute;il on two previous meetings of leaders even though we requested that time be scheduled.  In his contribution the Taoiseach has again spoken at length and said little of substance.  The one thing Ireland and Europe desperately need is to end the lack of ambition and energy which characterises how the Taoiseach and other leaders approach every issue.<\/p>  <p>  For the last two years, I and my colleague Deputy Brendan Smith have repeatedly raised the humanitarian disaster that has emerged in Syria.  The mass movement of refugees to Europe is no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to what is one of the largest refugee crises for over 50 years.  At the root of the crisis is a dictatorship that chose to wage war on its own people rather than concede democratic rights.  The early support the Assad regime received from some other countries and the Hezbollah movement was decisive in stopping its collapse and leading to a dramatic radicalisation.  The conflict has developed into a many-fronted civil war, with the ISIS grouping representing a barbaric new element.  More than 12 million people have been displaced and they are overwhelmingly to be found in neighbouring countries.  The people - up to a million of them - who have risked their lives in an effort to reach Europe are not refugees by choice.  They are fleeing intolerable conditions.  They are denied even the most basic right of being able to live safely and to look after their families.  Massive camps with only basic facilities, no schools, no work and no hope are the reality for millions who have fled to Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.  There comes a point at which endurance can go no further and that is why we have seen the pressures of recent months.  They do not want to be refugees; they want to live peacefully in their own land, and because this is not possible, we have a moral obligation to help them.<\/p><p>The failure by the international community to respond to the refugee crisis quickly and comprehensively is why so many have now come to Europe.<\/p> <p> In the summits of June and September as well as in the agenda for next week's summit, there continues to be a strategy of trying to find a way of doing as little as possible to muddle through.  The frankly xenophobic comments of certain leaders were a disgrace.  This is no time to pander to the extremists who want to spread fear.  It is a time to assert the primacy of the values which we should share as Europeans.  I welcome the fact that there has been a broad humanitarian consensus in Irish society and we must all work to protect this.  I welcome the Government's eventual agreement to a significant resettlement plan and for the principle that all countries should accept a share of the task.  What has yet to happen is for a plan to be outlined which is proportionate to the challenge.  There is no comprehensive plan and there is no real commitment to helping countries which face disproportionate pressures.<\/p> <p> This is an unprecedented emergency.  The European Union and its member states cannot address it if every proposal has to be dealt with through existing resources, and yet so far every initiative is to be funded through the reallocation of existing funds which mostly involves diverting money from other urgent humanitarian tasks.  This zero-sum approach cannot continue.  A dramatic increase in funding is required for these actions.  First, and most important, is to give hope to the millions living in camps.  They need decent facilities and access to education and some work.  Their main desire is to return home and until this is possible, they need our help.  Second, we must recognise the particular needs of member states which are facing the greatest pressures.  All of the evidence is that their capacities are stretched to or beyond breaking point.  Basic solidarity requires that they be helped.  Finally, each member state needs to genuinely welcome those who have fled a conflict which has been relentless and bloody.<\/p> <p> The Defence Forces have continued to play an honourable and effective role in the Mediterranean.  We should be proud of them and the great tradition of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann in serving the State and humanitarian causes throughout the world.<\/p> <p> Next week leaders will discuss the programme for the special regional summit in Valetta.  As currently drafted, there is no indication of genuine urgency or ambition.<\/p> <p> In relation to the conflict in, and increasingly around, Syria there have been very disturbing developments in recent months.  The Kurdish forces have played a positive role in confronting IS.  The decision of the Turkish Government to hinder Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish forces and to re-launch a full-scale conflict with the PKK is serving no one's interests.  There is an urgent need for an intervention to try to end this escalation.  The imminent Turkish election may well be playing a role, but we need to do everything possible to support a return to the peace process once it is over.<\/p> <p> The decision of Russia to put troops into Syria and to begin daily bombings has been directed at the sole aim of protecting the Assad regime.  The majority of attacks appear to have been against the more moderate opposition, including Kurdish forces, and have been well away from the areas dominated by ISIS.  There is no scenario in which Assad will be able to bring peace to his country.  The conflict began because of his efforts to crush moderate opposition and it escalated because of his brutality, including using chemical weapons against his own people.  From the very beginning, and at a point where the conflict was solely an internal Syrian affair, Russia has blocked any international effort to support a transition in the country.<\/p> <p> Separately, there have been indications that Russia is de-escalating the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and this is to be welcomed.  What it does not yet show is a willingness of Russia to end its occupation and partition of Ukraine.  Its imperialist agenda against a former subject state remains in place.  So too does its efforts to find and use what Lenin once called \"useful idiots\" in Europe who will defend Russia no matter what it does, particularly through deploying false comparisons and demands to remove any consequences for Russia of its actions.  Parties on the extreme right and extreme left remain active advocates for lifting sanctions against Putin's Government.  There have been signs in recent days of a push by some major businesses to get back into the Russian market.  Our Government should join with those who are demanding that there be no restoration of normal relations as long as Russia continues its policy of occupation and partition.<\/p> <p> The summit is due to have a further discussion concerning reforms to economic and monetary union.  There are, in fact, no genuine reforms being proposed.  None of the already identified causes of the recession is to be tackled.  The banking union covers only a fraction of the industry at the core of the meltdown.  There is no shared deposit guarantee system and moves are already in place to limit the oversight of banks which pose systemic risks.  There are not even proposals for a fiscal union which would allow for regions under the most pressure to receive help at times of greatest need.  All we have is a set of controls relating to deficits and debt.  While the specific targets set in these controls may be reasonable, and they are appropriate for Ireland, they are entirely inappropriate in many situations.  They preclude stimulus spending in cases where this can be afforded.  They also preclude the type of policies which helped other countries to more quickly and robustly exit the recession.  The threat of deflation is again present and the only thing standing in the way of a new recession is an ECB programme, which has been opposed by Germany and which has been referred to the Court of Justice.  The Taoiseach's refusal even to argue for a set of real reforms to EMU is representative of a policy which has emphasised photo opportunities and pats on the head over genuine substance.<\/p> <p> The summit is also due to hear further details about British proposals for the renegotiation of parts of its membership of the Union.  The rhetoric at this week's Tory party conference has been far beyond anything which Ireland should be willing to accept.  The absence of the moderating influence of the Liberal Democrats from the Cameron Administration is clearly having an impact.  Most strikingly, United Kingdom Ministers have begun deploying arguments which were directly refuted by the independent review of EU policies carried out in the past few years.  The basic drift of their demands is to seek a protection of all of the benefits of membership in relation to markets but to undermine all social elements of membership.<\/p> <p> United Kingdom membership of the Union is something which Ireland has a major interest in, but this must not mean that we will pay any price to make it continue.  It is long since passed the time when the Government should put on the record its basic response to the Tory demands.  This should be an issue in the election, whenever the cycle of spin runs out and the Taoiseach decides to end the permanent campaign which has defined his approach to government.<\/p> <p> The basic model of the European Union which we signed up to is one which sees economic and social progress as inseparable objectives.  We did not only sign up for a free market; we signed up for a free market which gave a guarantee of fair competition based on decent working conditions and protections.  The British have not been able to demonstrate the negative impact of laws against discrimination, bad working conditions and exploitative contracts.  These form the core of what a modern decent society should have in place.  We must reject any push to enable a rush to the bottom.  Equally, we should oppose any proposals concerning restrictions of social supports.  This has the potential to undermine the position of hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens and at a minimum, we should demand a legal commitment from Britain that the rights of the Irish people will not be changed.  This has particular implications for mobility on this island and the reduction of current rights from their current iron-clad basis is something we will absolutely oppose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700026#Y00200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444221000,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Crowe.<\/p><p>At the outset, I congratulate and praise the work of the crew of the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>which rescued 430 refugees who were in trouble in the Mediterranean Sea this weekend.  This is the third Irish vessel to carry out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean and, collectively, they have rescued 7,639 people.  The brave crews of these ships are a great credit to the Irish people.<\/p><p>I am disappointed the Taoiseach has not taken the opportunity to tell the D&aacute;il whether the rescue operation will continue beyond December.  A row has erupted over allowances to be paid to Naval Service personnel in the Mediterranean.  Gerry Rooney of PDFORRA has said members of the Naval Service who volunteered for this dangerous mission feel they have been duped and are being ignored given the refusal to pay them the same rate as troops involved in UN peace missions on land.  I am sure the Taoiseach agrees these Naval Service personnel carry out their duties to a very high standard and to international acclaim and are entitled to be properly paid for their crucially important work.<\/p> <p> The EU&rsquo;s collective response to the refugee crisis, the most serious refugee crisis since the Second World War, has been weak and has exposed major rifts between member states.  While Germany and Sweden&rsquo;s response has been laudable, countries such as Hungary are criminalising refugees and others are doing the bare minimum.  My colleague and Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, has confirmed that the first Syrians selected under a resettlement scheme will arrive in the North before December.  While the scheme will begin with a modest number, more will arrive in the future on a phased basis and I welcome this initial and progressive step.  N&iacute; fhaca muid a leith&eacute;id de seo riamh agus t&aacute; daoine ag fulaingt go g&eacute;ar.  Caithfimid n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh n&aacute; mar at&aacute;imid &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh anois.  I hope the Taoiseach will argue for a humane and moral approach to the refugee crisis at the European Council meeting and that he will stand up to the European governments which are seeking to criminalise refugees.<\/p> <p> The European Council meeting will also focus on the negotiations surrounding the British in-out referendum on the EU.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes a British withdrawal from the EU would represent a major political and economic challenge for the island of Ireland.  Such a development could hinder the process of democratic transformation in the North.  A Brexit could lead to the prospect of a reinforced partition, with the potential for customs checkpoints, trading tariffs and adverse knock-on effects for all-island economic activity and co-operation on a cross-Border basis.  Citizens in the North could also see the loss of Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy payments.  They could also suffer the loss of EU Structural Funds which have been central to small and medium enterprise development, community regeneration and government programmes.  As well as the dreadful economic, social and political implications, the proposed referendum is profoundly undemocratic.  The referendum, as it is planned, will allow the views of English voters to dictate the future relationship of the North - and therefore Ireland as a whole - with the EU.  I look to the Taoiseach to raise these concerns at the European Council meeting and inform other European leaders about how serious and damaging a Brexit would be for this island.<\/p> <p> Last week, while in New York, I met the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, whom I congratulated on his very successful election campaign.  I briefed him on the current political situation in Ireland and he outlined the next challenges facing the people of Greece.  Much of our conversation focused on the two big issues in Europe, namely, debt and refugees.  The geographic location of Greece has meant it has had to contend with a major influx of refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in the Middle East.  Dealing with the issue in the midst of major economic and financial difficulties has clearly tested the Greek state and the Greek people who have shown great generosity and resilience.<\/p> <p> While international attention has shifted to Syria and the refugee crisis, the need for debt relief has not gone away.  There was a Eurogroup meeting last Monday, and Greece hopes to open negotiations on debt relief by the end of the year.  The Taoiseach's position and that of his Minister for Finance of no debt relief but crippling austerity for Greece is impossible to justify on economic grounds.  It is a cynical political position aimed at covering for the Taoiseach's own failure to achieve or even request debt relief for the citizens of this State.  Everyone knows Greece cannot repay its debt.  Failing to recognise it merely stores up an even more serious crisis down the road.  If the Taoiseach's interests stretch beyond his electoral fortunes, he must, in discussion with his EU counterparts, support the IMF's call for significant debt relief for Greece and for Ireland.

The matter will be the primary issue at the European Council meeting.  Will the Taoiseach ensure any national spending on the refugee crisis by EU members states is excluded from debt and deficit calculations?  I ask the Taoiseach to bring this positive message to the table.  While I welcome that the Government has agreed to accept 4,000 refugees, I am concerned about the lack of accurate detail and information surrounding the relocation.  A cohort of 520 will arrive in Ireland already classified as refugees.  However, the other 3,500 will come to Ireland under the Irish refugee protection programme and will instead seek refugee status when they arrive.  Will they be forced into the disgraceful direct provision system or a similar programme with a different name?  This is everyone's concern.  Given that direct provision has failed many people, we do not want people to go through the process.<\/p>  <p>  Irish officials are expected to travel to Italy later this month to help select the first intake of almost 2,500 people due to arrive under the EU resettlement programmes.  Most are likely to be Syrian, Iraqi and Eritrean nationals.  How will they be selected?  What are the criteria?  I am also very concerned about the possibility of expelling refugees who arrive in the EU if they have arrived from what the EU is now calling safe third countries.  This could see refugees sent back to Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon where they face inhumane conditions, crippling poverty and possible human rights violations.  People have referred to the positive role our Naval Service is playing and I join in the praise and urge that Ireland continue these life-saving missions.  While the weather will become worse over the winter, the conflict in Syria continues to become more violent and brutal, which means more people will risk their lives to reach what they perceive as safety in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  I have received breaking news that the EU is planning to fast-track the deportation of refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and others if their asylum applications have failed.  Leaks have suggested the proposals will include threats to withdraw aid, trade deals and visa arrangements if countries refuse to take back refugees.  If there is substance to these leaks, it is a very significant step.  The proposals also envisage EU states detaining thousands of people to prevent them from absconding to avoid deportation.  We have this image in our heads.  Is the Taoiseach aware of this and what is Ireland's position?  I urge the Taoiseach to ensure Ireland strongly opposes this move which is wrong and will involve major potential human rights violations.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days, renewed clashes have broken out in occupied east Jerusalem leaving several dead and tensions heightened to an unprecedented level.  Will the Taoiseach raise this important issue at the European Council meeting?  Every day we hear about another violation of Palestinian fundamental rights, another violent clash on a holy site or, increasingly, another fatality in the region.  Over the weekend, three young Palestinians were killed, one of whom was a 13 year old boy still in his school uniform.<\/p><p>In the last week, over 500 Palestinians have been wounded, 200 of them with live bullets.  This is the context for the ongoing illegal occupation of Palestine.  The brutal repression, the intensification of illegal settlement and the collective punishment and humiliation of the Palestinian civil population are adding to the heightened tension.  The illegal ban on Palestinians entering the old city of Jerusalem has to stop immediately, as does the blanket restriction on Palestinians, Christians and Muslims trying to access their holy sites in Jerusalem.  People of all faiths must be free to worship unconditionally.  The fig leaf of security should not be used to bar one from one's church.  The downhill path of trying to present an occupation as a religious conflict is extremely dangerous and should be stopped at its heels.<\/p> <p> Israeli religious discrimination, coupled with an alarming increase in Israeli settler violence, is made worse by the total impunity with which Israel acts.  The international community cannot stand idly by as the occupying power and settler militias continue their violent crimes against the Palestinian people.  The international community and the EU must act immediately and responsibly to insist on respect for international law without exception.  Even though the state of Palestine has repeatedly appealed for international protection, the EU continues to provide Israel with favourable political agreements.  I think that goes against the views of populations right across Europe and certainly against the view of the Irish people.<\/p> <p> There are real fears that this latest violence will lead to a third intifada.  I ask the Taoiseach to call on the EU to act urgently and decisively to alleviate the immense suffering of the Palestinian people.  The labelling and banning of all illegal settlement goods is a positive step that Europe could introduce.  The recognition of Palestine is another step that this country could take, bearing in mind that it is the collective view of this House, as agreed by Deputies of all parties and none.  I suggest that this is something the Irish people would broadly support.  There is huge support out there for this.  I propose that the Irish Government take the next step by recognising the state of Palestine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700028#AA00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444222200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputies Paul Murphy, Richard Boyd Barrett, Shane Ross and Clare Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700029#BB00200","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1444222200,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I have seldom seen as little opposition in Europe to the militarisation of the Middle East and beyond.  All of them seem almost to have bought into the philosophy that this is the way things are done now.  France and Britain were initially pretty reluctant to take in refugees.  Obviously, they and many others, including ourselves, have been shamed into it by Germany at this stage.  They actually want to bomb Syria now, as if that is going to improve things.  It is bad enough that the Russians have started.  The whole thing is getting worse.  They are all engaged in mindless nonsense.  The devastation is incredible.  George Monbiot described it accurately in <i>The Guardian<\/i>today:<\/p><blockquote>There are no simple solutions to the chaos and complexities western firepower has helped to unleash, though a good start would be to stop making them worse.  But a vast intelligence and military establishment that no president since Jimmy Carter has sought to control, the tremendous profits to be made by weapons companies and military contractors, portrayals of these conflicts in the media that serve only to confuse and bamboozle: they all help to ensure that armed escalation, however pointless and counter-productive, appears unstoppable.<\/blockquote><p>He also refers to NATO's description of the bombing of the hospital in Kunduz:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;The strike may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility.&quot;  This is how an anonymous Nato spokesperson described Saturday&rsquo;s disaster in Afghanistan.  Let's translate it into English. &quot;We bombed a hospital, killing 22 people.&quot; But &quot;people&quot;, &quot;hospital&quot; and &quot;bomb&quot;, let alone &quot;we&quot;: all such words are banned from Nato's lexicon.<\/blockquote><p>The plane came back repeatedly to bomb the people trying to escape from the building.  We are sitting at the table with these people.  We have troops from our Defence Forces over there.  Seven Irish defence personnel are working with these fellows in Afghanistan.  What is wrong with us?  This is a war crime.  We have been told that the Americans are going to do an internal investigation.  I suggest that is like getting the fox to investigate a raid on the chicken house.

There has been a massive outpouring of solidarity with those who are fleeing war and poverty in Syria and other parts of the world, including Afghanistan, the Middle East and north Africa.<\/p>  <p>  Recent events have highlighted the bloody, tragic reality of fortress Europe.  Over the past 20 years, some 20,000 people have died trying to enter Europe.  This year alone, more than 2,500 migrants are believed to have been drowned.  The European powers have a responsibility for this.  They are not just the charitable benefactors here.  They are responsible for it.  They are responsible for the racist policies of fortress Europe.  They are responsible for the Europe-based arms industry profiting to the tune of billions from the conflict in Syria.  They are responsible for stoking up the conflict in Syria by supporting air strikes and pumping arms into the country.  Their support for the invasion of Iraq led to the creation and formation of ISIS and the massive instability across the region.<\/p>  <p>  I invite Deputies to look at the conclusions from the last Council and at the plans for the Valletta conference in November, both of which focus on having the north African states act as a buffer against migration and plans to increase EU intervention in north Africa and the Sahara region, including so-called initiatives in the field of law enforcement.  This is no solution.  If we sink the boats of people traffickers, migrants will be driven into even more perilous and desperate measures to try to make it to Europe.  They will take more risks and more of them will die.  I suggest that further backing for the EU strategy for the Sahel will not work, as it is a thinly veiled support for increased imperialist intervention in the region and the backing of French imperialism in particular.<\/p>  <p>  Military intervention is driving the refugee crisis.  Approximately 85% of the migrants who arrive in Greece come from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, all of which have seen Western military intervention.  Any solution must be based on ending imperialist interventions, upholding the right of people to asylum and following the lead that has been shown by people across Europe.  I refer to the outpouring of solidarity we have seen in response to the mass movement of refugees and their allies.  There is need to tear down the fences, break down the racist borders, bring down the racist fortress that is Europe and fight for a decent life for everybody.  In this State, that should involve immediately abolishing direct provision and giving people the right to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700029#BB00600","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1444222200,"counter":626,"content":"<p>If ever there was a time for those who have any conscience or any care for human beings to receive a wake-up call, now is that time.  The actions of the big powers - the Western powers and Russia - have led to the disintegration of the societies of the vast majority of the war-torn countries from which 12 million people have been displaced and the subsequent unleashing of the worst refugee crisis we have seen since the Second World War.  Is it not time for people to speak the truth about why this is happening and to respond with compassion and humanity?<\/p><p>The European Union, which is making noises about being humane and compassionate, is playing a double game.  Over 12 million people have been displaced, but we are talking about only taking in 160,000.  There are 2 million refugees in Turkey alone, with millions more in Lebanon and Jordan; that is okay for them, but we can only take 160,000.  It is pathetic.  At the same time, we talk about strengthening border controls and making it more difficult for people to get into the EU.  That hypocrisy has to stop, as does the hypocrisy of refusing to speak out about what the big powers are doing in fuelling this situation in the first place.  If we are serious, we must do something about the arms industry.  Given that no-one else is doing it, will the Government ask why Britain and the United States are financing Saudi Arabia?  Why are we not imposing punitive taxes and stopping the arms trade, which is fuelling this situation?  Somebody has to say this.  <\/p> <p> I will move on briefly to the issue of Palestine, a long-term example of exactly the same issue.  Israel is a state that is involved in illegal occupation and in horrific, ongoing, systematic, deliberate and unashamed attacks on peoples' human and civil rights, but we are still doing business with it.  We allow it to have an embassy here.  We go to conferences and summits and do not say, \"This is unacceptable.\"  When will some sort of moral conscience inform the foreign policy of this and other countries?  When are we going to say that this has to stop?  When are we going to stop pretending these guys are normal when in fact they are warmongers, tyrants and despots who are slaughtering people?  They should not be part of the international community of nations until they stop this kind of behaviour.

The conclusion one comes to every time one reads a speech from a Minister or the Taoiseach is that Ireland is a passenger on the European train and that we do not really count.  I wonder sometimes what happens when the Irish delegation arrives.  Perhaps the Minister of State can tell us.  Does Mrs. Merkel turn around and say, \"God, we had better listen to these guys.  These guys are boat rockers - they are going to make us stand up and think\"?  Quite the opposite, it appears.  One could excuse the utterly cowardly attitude, with the anonymous, voiceless Irish delegation saying nothing that would rock the boat, at a time when we were in extraordinary debt to Europe and dependent upon it for everyday funding.  Now, however, we are apparently out of the European doghouse and are prospering.  We are the poster boy of Europe, but we are still refusing to take a lead on any issue at all.  I ask the Minister of State to point out to the House one example in which Ireland has said \"This is wrong and we must do the following\" - an example of Ireland taking a position of leadership at the European table.<\/p>  <p>  What one sees in Europe at the moment is the management of a series of crises.  We had the crisis in Greece, at which time we disgraced ourselves by hiding behind the big powers while we watched Greece falter in a sea of debt.  Now Europe and Ireland are pretending that the Greek situation is resolved, but this particular problem is going to come back to bite us time and again because of the attitude that has been taken.  As Deputy Adams has said, the debt is still there and it is enormous and unpayable, but no-one is facing up to that.  Ireland is relieved that the Greeks have not embarrassed us by actually getting a massive default, which would have made us look utterly stupid.<\/p>  <p>  Crisis management in other areas was responded to by the Taoiseach in his speech today with the assertion that Ireland's attitude in each instance - to the Greek, migrant and UK crises - is one of being \"pragmatic.\"  Pragmatic is an old Fianna F&aacute;il word and means that one is not guided by any principles but by \"whatever you're having yourself\" on the day.

It is a tragedy and a particular disgrace against the backdrop of what is going on in Europe at the moment, with a refugee crisis to which the European response has been too little, too late.  That response has ignored the reality that it is not Europe that has a migrant crisis but the migrants who have a problem with Europe and with the military interventions by this Government's allies and friends in the United States.  Those interventions are one of the key reasons for the large number of refugees.  The Minister of State would do well at that meeting to remind his European counterparts of that fact.  He should also recognise, within that, Ireland's role and complicity by allowing the US military to continue to use Shannon Airport as a \"virtual forward airbase\" for its forces, as described by Dr. Tom Clonan.<\/p>  <p>  This Government wants a pat on the back for accepting 4,000 refugees, and I am glad that we are accepting them.  I note that the Minister for Justice and Equality said last week that the refugees would not be put into the direct provision system, clearly acknowledging that the Government could not humiliate itself by allowing refugees and war victims from Syria to be put up in a few caravans in Mosney.  That would not look too good.  It would help if the Government focused on the fact that there are people living in such conditions now, and that reality must be addressed too.<\/p>  <p>  If Europe wants to go forward it must look at where it came from.  The Minister of State might ask his European colleagues what they thought would happen when they started channelling money away from helping people and into building walls and fences.  They cut the Mare Nostrum programme and replaced it with Operation Triton, which to a large extent is about border control and not about humanitarian refugee support.  I welcome the fact that the programme has been somewhat reformed, but the reality is that most European expenditure is going on border controls and not on assisting migrants.  That is not the way forward.  Will the Minister of State make those points at the meeting?  Will he also support the calls for an independent investigation into the war crime that happened in the M&eacute;dicins sans Fronti&egrave;res hospital in Afghanistan?  Will the Minister of State call for an investigation into that incident, in which 22 people, including three children, were butchered?  People were burned in their beds in that atrocity.  What position will the Minister of State take on it?

However, I must note that with the imminent publication of our budget, this House is carrying out a slightly earlier than usual consideration of the European Council agenda.  It has not yet been clarified which foreign policy issues will be dealt with by the Heads of State and Government.  That said, the focus of the European Council agenda is, of course, on migration and the instability which persists, particularly in Europe's southern neighbourhood.  There is also a suggestion that there will be some discussion of Syria, Iraq and Libya.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise, as the Taoiseach did earlier, that an important part of the Irish and European Union response to the migration crisis is working with countries of both origin and transit and attempting to deal with the root causes of the huge migratory flows that we are currently witnessing.  In this regard, the European Council will discuss the two upcoming international conferences which are of most relevance - that is, the conference on the eastern Mediterranean-western Balkans route, which takes place in Luxembourg tomorrow, and the Valletta summit, which will take place on 11 and 12 November.  The western Balkans conference is expected to agree a declaration emphasising the need for solidarity and an action plan.<\/p><p>The action plan will address support for host governments and communities in Syria's immediate neighbourhood, primarily Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, support to affected transit countries, co-operation in the fight against people smuggling and associated organised crime, addressing the root causes of forced displacement, and working with the countries of origin.<\/p> <p> The Valletta summit of European Union leaders and their African counterparts, along with multilateral organisations, will focus on the external relations dimensions of migration policy.  The Valletta conference will seek to build on existing co-operation frameworks and issue two documents, namely, a political declaration and an action plan. <\/p> <p> The ending of the Syrian conflict is essential to stabilising the Middle East, stopping the spread of radical terrorism and addressing the humanitarian and security crises which are afflicting the Syrian people and neighbouring countries.  Ireland and the European Union remain strongly supportive of the efforts of the current United Nations envoy, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, to bring the conflict towards a close.  Ireland's position, which has been restated on many occasions, is that a political solution remains the only basis for resolving the crisis in Syria and Iraq.  We have consistently called for all regional and international stakeholders with influence over the parties to the conflict to give their support to the ongoing efforts of the United Nations to find a peaceful solution to this tragic conflict. <\/p> <p> The position in Libya remains one of grave concern.  Outbreaks of violence continue and large swathes of the country remain under the control of militant groups, including Islamic State.  Peace talks led by the UN special representative, Mr. Bernardino Le&oacute;n, have come to an advanced and critical stage, with a final agreement between all parties drafted and awaiting a decision.  Ireland fully supports the European Union and United Nations in encouraging all parties to accept the agreement and move forward towards the formation of a government of national accord.  We stand ready to work with the European Union to support Libya in any way we can. <\/p> <p> At this relatively early stage, it is not yet clear how exactly the Heads of State and Government will divide their time among the issues on next week's Council agenda.  However, it is to be expected that the conclusions to be adopted will bring some focus, in particular, the necessary impetus for further essential work to be advanced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700030#CC00600","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1444223400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.15 p.m. and resumed at 3.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Seanad","time":1444223700,"counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700032#EE00100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444223700,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Houses of the Oireachtas (Appointments to Certain Offices) Bill 2014, without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700032#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Deputy Bernard Durkan)"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1444223700,"counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700032#EE00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","time":1444223700,"counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700032#EE00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1444223700,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter today.  From my conversations with the Minister in recent days, I know she is fully up to date with the funding shortfall currently being experienced by St.Mary's national school in Drumlish.  I thank her for the commitment I received that she would be happy to meet the school principal at some stage next week to discuss the issue in greater detail.  The number of pupils in St. Mary's has steadily increased in recent years and the school has an enrolment of 209 pupils for the 2015-2016 academic year.  The Minister of State will agree that this is an exception to the current trend in Ireland and a clear testament to the vibrant community in the Drumlish area.  It is particularly people like the principal, Ms Deirdre Coffey, former principal, the late Ms Elizabeth Brady, and the staff who have spearheaded the expansion and growth of the school in recent years.  Meanwhile, the local community, children, parents, staff and board of management have a long tradition of fund-raising for the school when it has needed financial assistance.  However, on this occasion the financial assistance required is a bridge too far for the local community.<\/p>  <p>  The total grant aid allocated by the Department currently is approximately &euro;1,200 per square metre whereas total building costs are in the order of &euro;1,500 per square metre.  As such, the school is currently falling short by &euro;62,948.  As the Minister of State can imagine, this is a substantial gap for a small rural school to try to close.  At every stage of the process, the school and board of management have followed the procedures and guidelines set down by the Department and, in total, the school is set to receive &euro;330,400 while total building costs are set at &euro;393,348.  This leaves a total shortfall of &euro;62,948.  If an outstanding grant of &euro;23,500 is not approved, the shortfall will increase to &euro;86,448.  Yesterday, I received a reply to a number of parliamentary questions I asked regarding the securing of extra funding for St. Mary's.  I was informed that it was open to the school authority to apply for additional funding but that, to date, no application had been received.  While this is true, the school was in touch with the Department last week to raise the issue of the shortfall and it has asked for guidance on the matter.  As of today, it has not received a reply.  While departmental officials have been extremely helpful with the school at all times, some guidance from officials on how to apply for extra funding is needed.  It is to be hoped this will be forthcoming.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to funding coming forward because this is a very rural school that is doing well with increasing numbers.

There is a serious shortfall in the funding provided for an extension at St. Mary's school.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Bannon is right that the school's numbers have exploded from 145 pupils in 2007 to 209 this year.  The school applied through the devolved grant system, met the full terms and conditions in a voluntary capacity and relieved the pressure on the Department by putting the project out to tender itself.  Given the size of the extension, the additional classrooms and the extra support room, the school has incurred an additional cost due to the new building regulations, but the Government has not allocated enough money, only providing approximately &euro;1,200 per square metre at a time when building costs amount to &euro;1,500 per square metre.  The fire officer who carried out the inspection identified a number of deficiencies in the current building.  That it must be upgraded is only right and proper, but this work should be done when extensive renovations are being conducted.<\/p>  <p>  The school chose the cheapest options in the construction and architect tender processes, but it has still found itself with a shortfall of almost &euro;80,000.  It is a DEIS school that serves many economically disadvantaged families.  It cannot afford to meet the shortfall if the Government does not step up to the mark and make additional funding available.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's statement today that she will meet a deputation of the school's principal and some members of its board of management.  That is positive, but the principal and board do not want to come to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a day trip.  They want to come here next week to find out that the Government has made the necessary funding available in order that the board and parents will not be left to make up the &euro;80,000 shortfall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700033#FF00100","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1444224000,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  In recent weeks, Deputy Bannon was in contact with the Minister and me in this regard.  It is important we bring clarity to the situation.  If there is any confusion, we will try to put it to bed.  I will offer a formal answer, after which we can go through the details.<\/p>  <p>  This debate gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the building project that is under way at St. Mary's national school in Drumlish, County Longford.  In January 2014, the school submitted an application to my Department's planning and building unit for two new 80 sq. m mainstream classrooms and a resource room to cater for increased enrolments.  In March 2014, following an assessment of the school's application, the school authority received sanction for a devolved grant under my Department's 2014 additional accommodation scheme to build two additional mainstream classrooms and an additional resource room.  The grant was sanctioned on condition that the school authority utilise the grant to build a permanent, stand-alone structure.<\/p>  <p>  Devolved grants allow school authorities the means to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives them day-to-day control of their building projects.  It is a central tenet of the devolved scheme that responsibility for the management of a project, including cost control, timing of tendering and construction, rests with the school authority.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2014, the school authority submitted an application for additional funding for a replacement boiler and an upgrade of its fire alarm system, emergency lighting and main electrical board.  Additional funding was sanctioned for the costs associated with the boiler replacement and upgrade of the main electrical board.  The costs in respect of the upgrade of the fire alarm system and emergency lighting were not approved, however, as these works were being carried out in the existing school building and were outside the scope of the approved project.<\/p>  <p>  The planning and building unit was informed that building works commenced on site in August and the first instalment of the approved grant was paid to the school authority in early September 2015.  If the level of funding provided by the Department is not sufficient to cover the cost of the approved works, it is open to the school authority to apply for additional funding, which is a common practice.  However, if works are being carried out over and above the approved works, the cost of these must be met by the school authority.<\/p>  <p>  The management authority of St. Mary's national school recently informed the planning and building unit that there was a shortfall in funding.  In the coming days, the school will be requested to explain the reasons for this shortfall.  On receipt of that information, my Department will be in a position to consider the request for additional funding.  Obviously, there will be a time lag after the information comes forward.  The process must be followed.  A school submits the reasons for the increased costs and backs them up with evidence, after which time a decision can be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700033#FF00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1444224000,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

To be clear, the Department's building and planning unit has proven itself to be fit for purpose in recent years.  It has responded quite well and has a clear mission, which is to spend taxpayers' money correctly, wisely, fairly and equitably nationwide.  Consequently, as the Deputy will appreciate, there must be a formal process.  The unit has proved itself - I believe all Members have dealt with quite a number of cases over the years - and it can respond in the correct manner.  The Deputy has indicated that the board of management has done the job correctly, with a good record and so on, and once a good record is in place and the school can prove that there has been a budget overrun and the reason for it, the Department and this unit always have shown the ability to do the job properly when a decision is to be made.  However, Deputy Troy must appreciate that there must be a process.  He is correct that there can sometimes be a timing difference between the allocation of money and the subsequent cost of building, but that must be shown clearly for the approved project.  To be clear, I refer to the project that was approved; as the Deputy will appreciate, additional works are different.  Hopefully this matter will be dealt with quite quickly.  Information is going back and forth and the formal process is on the way but, in fairness, it is the unit's job to assess this matter and to deal with it properly.  It will be helped if, as the Deputy noted, the board has done an excellent job in managing the devolved grant scheme.  That scheme works well and has delivered many school projects in Counties Meath, Westmeath and Longford and everywhere else.  It is a successful approach that works well.  Most schools speak highly of it, and this is how it should be kept.

In any event, the Minister of State will be aware that allegations were brought to my attention in 2012 pertaining to alleged improper payments at the University of Limerick.  At the time, I brought that matter to the Committee of Public Accounts and it went through a process.  Unfortunately, Members do not have sight of what that process was back in 2012.  However, a number of other whistleblowers have now come into the public domain and have made a number of allegations similar to those brought to my attention in 2012.  These similar allegations were reported recently in the <i>Limerick Leader<\/i>and widely by other media outlets.  There is much commonality between all these allegations, but one common theme to emerge is that many people who raised their heads and queried certain payments at the University of Limerick were asked to leave.  Many of them were paid off and removed from their jobs.  In addition, many of them were asked to sign confidentiality agreements and agree to not speak about their experiences.  This is quite serious, given the number of people who now have come forward into the public domain.  In addition, other people whom I know and to whom I have spoken have not come forward.  These are people of the highest integrity who have professional qualifications and are part of professional associations.  Their integrity is beyond question and they also have come forward.  The alarm bells are ringing, and Members must sit up and take note in this regard.<\/p><p>On foot of this, the University of Limerick has now issued High Court proceedings against the<i>Limerick Leader<\/i>newspaper, which is quite unprecedented, and against its editor, Mr. Alan English, personally.  I have a serious issue with this action, because a State-funded institution is using taxpayers' money in an attempt to gag a newspaper and its editor, which are pursuing matters in the public interest that are in the public domain.  In his reply, the Minister of State might address a couple of issues on behalf of his senior Minister.  Is the Higher Education Authority the competent authority to hold an investigation into this affair?  I ask because the Minister of State's senior line Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, stated this week that she would support the intention to have an external examination of this issue and that the reputation of the University of Limerick was hugely important.  All Members agree with that and wish to see it protected.  She stated that what was needed was someone independent to investigate all the allegations.  Is the Higher Education Authority the competent authority to investigate this matter independently, given that it has been involved in it from 2012 right up to the present?  Second, if the Minister of State does not agree that the Higher Education Authority is the competent authority, will he or his senior Minister appoint an independent competent authority to review and investigate this matter and report to the Minister independently?  There are issues pertaining to social welfare and to the Revenue Commissioners, for example, that must be investigated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700034#GG00400","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1444224600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700034#GG00500","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1444224600,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Finally, will the Minister of State join with me on his own behalf and that of his senior line Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in calling on the University of Limerick to withdraw its High Court proceedings against the <i>Limerick Leader<\/i>newspaper and against Mr. Alan English?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700034#GG00600","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1444224600,"counter":671,"content":"<p>While I have great respect for the Minister of State personally, I deplore the fact that the Minister is not present in the Chamber to answer personally on a matter that relates directly to her own constituency.  In addition to the cases brought to the attention of Deputy Niall Collins, a number of different individuals have approached me and essentially have told me the same story, whereby people who raised their heads and raised issues about certain payments in particular were literally hounded out.  This has happened in several cases that have been brought to my personal attention.  It reflects a disturbing pattern of behaviour, and all the investigations that have taken place - that is, the internal university investigations into the circumstances surrounding the situation in which people ultimately were obliged to leave - show a distinct and patent lack of independence.  While there are several matters about which I could talk today, one interesting aspect is that in both cases that are in the public domain at present, the university has made an offer to settle on the basis that the two people involved should resign from the university and collect two years' salary by way of payment.  That payment of two years' salary involves taxpayers' money, but in both cases the university's so-called and allegedly independent investigator found that the two people had acted maliciously.  Why would one pay two years' worth of taxpayers' money to somebody whom one's own investigator, who was meant to be independent, found to have acted maliciously?  This matter must be investigated properly and the investigation must be both independent and perceived to be independent.<\/p><p>I also ask the Minister of State what he thinks of the actions of the University of Limerick in resorting to the heavy machinery of the law by employing a high-profile firm of solicitors at what I am sure is great expense to the taxpayer to sue the<i>Limerick Leader<\/i>, which, like all provincial newspapers, is hardly awash with funds.  This proposed High Court action will place a serious strain on an organisation which I am sure is already struggling.  In addition, the university's intention to sue the editor personally looks like a deliberate attempt to gag discussion of the matter, put it underground and prevent any discussion in the public domain.  The Minister for Education and Skills knows better than anyone else that the <i>Limerick Leader<\/i>is the main print medium for both the city and county of Limerick, which she and I represent, and has been so for more than a century.  While I do not agree with everything the<i>Limerick Leader<\/i>or its editor says, the Minister of State will appreciate that a free press is essential in a properly functioning democracy.  I ask the Minister of State to communicate immediately to the Minister for Education and Skills that Members expect her to contact the university and to ask it, as Minister, to call off these legal bloodhounds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700034#GG00700","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1444225200,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  It is certainly a matter of concern to my senior Minister, but she cannot be in two places at the same time so I am answering this matter on her behalf.<\/p><p>In early 2012, a former employee of the University of Limerick informed a public representative, who in turn informed the Committee of Public Accounts, of alleged irregular practices in the finance department of the University, her attempts to rectify them and how she had been dealt with by the university.  The issues were referred by the Committee of Public Accounts to the Secretary General of my Department and, at his request, the HEA sought the response of the university.  The university informed the HEA that it was engaging with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the issues and had provided all related correspondence to that office.  The president of the university also wrote to the Committee of Public Accounts stating that the university was satisfied that it had dealt fully with the allegations made by its former employee as follows:<\/p><blockquote>The University refutes in the strongest possible terms these allegations. The University has at all times paid expenses in accordance with its Travel and Subsistence Policy and is satisfied that the controls in place ensure that payments are reimbursed in accordance with Policy.<\/blockquote><p>The letter goes on to say that the university was in correspondence with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the matter, and continues: <\/p><blockquote>The University is subject to rigorous auditing on an on-going basis. This includes external audit, internal audit and oversight by the Governing Authority's Audit and Risk Management Committee. The area of expenses is generally reviewed annually as part of the annual audit. A recent report to the Governing Authority Audit and Risk Management Committee by the University's external auditors confirmed that there were no weaknesses identified in relation to the controls in place regarding expenses.<\/blockquote><p>In June this year, two employees of the university, who were employed in the finance department, requested of my Department to make a disclosure under the protected disclosures legislation.  They were directed to the CEO of the Higher Education Authority, as that person is a prescribed recipient under the legislation.  The CEO, Mr. Boland, met with the employees on 5 May 2015.  An agreed minute of that meeting was provided to the president of the university for his observations.  It is important to say that at the meeting no specific allegations were made of financial irregularities in the university.  However, the employees outlined a series of events which they considered amounted to bullying and victimisation of them by management and colleagues in the university.  They stated their view that this arose because of their questioning of what they saw as irregular practices in the finance department.  The employees in question have not, to date, set out specific allegations, pleading a lack of confidence in the university to properly inquire into them.  The university, in response to the HEA, refuted the claims made by its employees.  It stated that the allegations of bullying and victimisation were not substantiated, and that the employees had refused to co-operate with various inquiries and had been found by one inquiry to have made malicious claims.  Both employees are now subject to disciplinary proceedings.<\/p><p>More recently, the former employee has contacted the HEA repeating her initial allegations.  At her request, Mr. Boland met with her last evening.<\/p><p>The Department has concerns on a number of levels.  First, in the case of the employees and the former employee, they continue to feel victimised for having, as they see it, challenged irregular practices.  Second, as the university is an important institution regionally and nationally and the current controversies are potentially damaging to its good reputation, as the Deputies have said, they need to be dealt with comprehensively and conclusively as soon as possible.  Third, the demands of public accountability are such that the truth of any allegation of misconduct in a higher education institution needs to be established beyond reasonable doubt.  Having regard to these considerations, the HEA, in consultation with my Department and the university, will now put in place a process of review.  The precise terms of reference will be established within the next few days.  However, I stress that the review will be independent of the university's processes and will cover how the initial inquiry into the allegations of irregular payments and the allegations of victimisation and bullying were dealt with by the university.  A final report will be concluded by the end of November.  If that is not possible, an interim report will be provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700035#HH00100","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1444225200,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

Will the investigation be able to take evidence from those people, in view of the fact that they have already been forced by the university to sign confidentiality clauses concerning settlements that were made at the time of termination of their employment?

Unfortunately, there is not a family or home in the country that has not been touched by cancer.  A particular problem has come to my attention but, in order to be helpful, I also have a solution.  I hope the simple answer to the difficulty that people are experiencing will be taken on board and, more importantly, will be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The issue has to do with the turnaround concerning decisions on medical cards, as well as the pain and financial strain that have been caused by the delay involved.<\/p><p>Over recent months I have had a number of very worried and sick people have come to my office in Dungarvan in County Waterford seeking help with their medical cards.  Naturally, these people are extremely worried and stressed about their diagnosis and the treatment they are facing.  I am sad to report that while they were focusing on getting treatment and trying to get better, our medical card system was adding to their stress.  This is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p> I will illustrate the point by way of example.  Recently, a lady came to me who had received a serious cancer diagnosis in June.  Straight away she applied for her medical card.  By the time she had contacted me it was September and there was no decision on her card.  Only this morning I received from Kieran Healy, head of customer services at the HSE, a response to a parliamentary question on this issue.  The reply clearly states that the application processing team works to a 15-day working day turnaround time for complete applications.  That is clearly not the case.<\/p> <p> More upsetting, I spoke to the lady who had been waiting from June to September, by which time there was no decision on her medical card.  In that time she had incurred bills of in excess of &euro;500 in the pharmacy and was also facing a very expensive bill for four chemotherapy treatments.  I know of another case where a sick man applied for a card in August and as of today, 7 October, it has not even been sent for initial assessment.  That lapse is far more than 15 days.  The response I received to a parliamentary question is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p> The applications for a medical card need to be screened initially for serious illnesses such as cancer.  These applications should be taken from the pile and fast-tracked.  There should be a quick initial scan of applications and the relevant applications should be prioritised for means.  The HSE should ensure these are done within 15 days.  It is as simple as that.  I realise the Minister of State knows that people facing serious illnesses have enough to worry about.  They should not have to worry about the cost of chemotherapy or drugs as well.  They should be focusing on getting well and should not have to go to Deputies or ring helplines to get something to which they are entitled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700035#HH01000","speaker":"1093","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444225800,"counter":683,"content":"<p>A woman came into my clinic in Ballinasloe recently.  She had been diagnosed with cancer.  I sympathised with her not because she had been diagnosed with cancer or because herself and her family were going to have to go through that challenge over the coming months but because of the horrendous experience she is going to have to go through to be granted a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the report by the Irish Cancer Society because it exposes two issues, the first of which is the failure to recognise properly the medical expenses in the assessment of medical card applications for illnesses such as cancer.  It is not a means assessment; it is a mean assessment.  The average spend per month for a cancer patient is &euro;862 while the average income loss is &euro;1,400.  However, the allowances provided under the medical card system for health expenses, prescribed medicines and appliances and hospital charges come to the princely sum of &euro;62.65 per week.  This means the figure of &euro;459.49 per week in costs and income lost, as identified by the Irish Cancer Society, is being ignored in the current medical card assessment.  Regardless, even to get recognition from the medical card section for the &euro;62.65 per week, patients on chemotherapy will literally have to sweat blood and tears.  The majority of these cases will be granted a medical card at the end of the process, but that is months down the road.  It seems that the main policy is to try to wear people down in order that they simply throw in the towel and do not pursue it to the bitter end.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the report and I welcome that the Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs is replying to the issue in the House today because the report exposes the active discrimination within the medical card section against people who are sick and residing in rural areas.  The report highlights that the average cost for travel expenses per week is &euro;66.23.  This is not only for cancer but also relates to other medical conditions requiring frequent attendance at regional centres.  The provision for transport under the medical card assessment comes under health expenses.  I have seldom seen a case where an application gets anything more than &euro;15, that is, one quarter of the real cost identified by the Irish Cancer Society.  We have developed centres of excellence, particularly for cancer, and they are all welcome.  For someone in my county who has to travel to Galway for a hospital appointment, the cost comes to &euro;150.  We do not have public transport to facilitate such people in getting to the appointment and back again on the same day.  As a result, these people must pay for a taxi.  The HSE will not assist with this cost and the Department of Social Protection will not assist in the matter either.  These people have to fork out the money from their own pockets.  If a person is unfortunate enough to come from Arigna, for example, it will cost him &euro;200 to get to the hospital appointment in the first place.  No recognition is being given to that fact by the medical card section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700036#JJ00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1444225800,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising these important matters.  At the outset, I am keen to acknowledge the work and effort of health staff that has resulted in Ireland's cancer survival rate improving consistently in recent decades.  I have no doubt the national cancer strategy steering group set up to advise on developing a new national cancer strategy for 2016 to 2025 will build on positive developments.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have a universal eligibility system for primary and community health services.  I maintain the view that until we have universal health care and everyone is entitled to health care, we will always have anomalies and injustices.  There will always be someone who is a little above the means threshold, who does not have the prescribed disease or whose condition is not sufficiently severe.  As a result, these individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware of the publication of the report of the expert panel on medical need for medical card eligibility and the medical card process review, known as the Keane report.  One key recommendation was that a person's means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  The panel concluded that it would not be feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order as a means of determining medical card eligibility.  The findings of the expert panel raise questions for us as legislators about the approach of basing eligibility for health services on having a particular disease or special assessment arrangements for one disease or another.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is ensuring a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications.  This involves greater exchange of information between the central assessment office and the local health offices on people's medical circumstances and needs.  We can see the results of these improvements.  The number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased by approximately 76%, from 52,000 in mid-2014 to almost 93,000 at the beginning of September this year.  Under the General Medical Services scheme, eligibility is granted from the date a complete application has been assessed and a decision is made by the HSE in accordance with the legislation and the national assessment guidelines.  The HSE makes every effort to make timely decisions.  The HSE has a target to process 90% of properly completed claims within the 15-day period to which Deputy Conway referred.  The current turnaround is over 98%.  This ensures a short lead time between applications being submitted and a decision being made on the eligibility of the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  I imagine the Deputies will appreciate in light of the legislation that applications must be supported with a range of documentation, as outlined on the application forms.  It has to be acknowledged that the processing time for incomplete applications is dependent on the furnishing of the required supporting documentation.  Discretion continues to be an integral part of the medical card assessment process.  If an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds, as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances that might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical card services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis.  I am aware the HSE routinely affords applicants the opportunity to furnish additional supporting information and documentation to take account fully of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700036#JJ00300","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1444226400,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  Nobody is disputing that there are issues in terms of what we as legislators decide to do regarding changes to legislation on eligibility criteria other than means, but I referred to cancer patients who are entitled to medical cards because of their means and are still waiting in excess of the 15 day turnaround period.  I received a response today from Mr. Kieran Healy, head of customer services in the HSE.  It is not happening.  <\/p>  <p>  I was able to lift the telephone in my office in September and within two days a card was issued.  The woman concerned had built up a large bill in her local pharmacy and had received a large bill from the treating hospital for her chemotherapy.  Pharmacists are under the illusion that medical cards are backdated, but they are not.  It is something we as a Government need to tackle.  The date of the initial application for social welfare payments is the date from which the card is sanctioned.  I am not referring to people who do not have an entitlement to a card, but rather those who are entitled to one.  <\/p>  <p>  In the two cases I outlined, in a response the HSE referred to 98% turnover and stated that 90% of people have their applications completed within 15 days.

Even though it has direct access to Revenue and social welfare and can get information at the touch of a button, it deliberately forces sick patients to go to local tax offices to get printouts of their last tax liabilities and to go into social welfare offices to get printouts of their social welfare payments.  Such a policy delays processing applications and saves the medical card section money.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the medical card eligibility group recommended that we should not base medical cards on particular medical conditions.  However, the subsequent Minister announced that every child in the country diagnosed with cancer would get a medical card.  I ask the Minister of State to lift that age barrier.  Regardless of age, if someone is diagnosed with cancer they should get a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the rural discrimination that is taking place across the board regarding medical cards, and not just for cancer patients and the chronically ill.  I want the Minister of State to address this issue.  A patient in Galway city is receiving treatment in Dublin and was given medical expenses of &euro;14.45 a week less than a patient living beside him in Galway city who receives treatment in University Hospital Galway.  The reality is that even though there is a lack of public transport in rural Ireland, the HSE is deliberately ignoring transport costs when making medical assessments.  This practice is taking place across the county and the reality is that the HSE is actively discriminating against those living in rural Ireland who are sick and cannot travel from provincial towns to regional centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700037#KK00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1444226400,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that we have already taken the initiative on rural transport and are working with the HSE and the NTA on the parts of rural Ireland where people experience difficulties in trying to travel to hospital appointments.

The group includes patients' representatives and is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.  In the context of that work, the group made an interim recommendation, as Deputy Naughten stated, to award medical cards to all children under the age of 18 years with a diagnosis of cancer for a period of five years.

I am not sure if the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is familiar with the site.  It is ideally located beside the hospital and Garda station.  It is anonymous and is surrounded by a supportive community.  The difficulty is that Respond!, which is a voluntary agency, has said it cannot afford to fund the refuge for women and children fleeing domestic violence.  Respond! has bankrolled the refuge for the past three and a half years without any financial support from the State.<\/p>  <p>  The refuge caters for nine families and has housed 71 women and 96 children, at a cost of &euro;350,000 per annum.  Respond! undertook responsibility for it for three years.  Without the service women and children may have to return to potentially dangerous environments.  I have heard that agencies, including Tusla, accept that Respond! has identified a definite need to care for women and children in such circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  We know that there is a need for these type of refuges.  If it closes, where do the women go?  We know that if, for instance, they go to the sexual assault unit in the local hospital the Garda usually refer them to the refuge.  It has a large catchment area, but it is not just women from Tallaght or the wider area who use the service.  Women from different counties may use it, depending on their safety.  Clients may move from different refuges.  <\/p>  <p>  It is doing its job and working well.  If it closes, it means we are moving backwards.  What will replace it if it closes?  We need to open more refuges rather than close them.  It is a question of money.  I raised this issue during the debate on homelessness because it is part of that chain.  People leave the family home because of domestic violence or sexual assault.  We know what eventually forces women to leave the family home - it is usually the women who have to leave and the abusive partner stays behind.  There is a safety aspect.  What can the Minister do about this matter?<\/p><p>It is not a huge amount of money.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, has said the homelessness issue is not a matter of resources and I am glad to hear it.  This is part of that chain because when they leave the home they become homeless.  The added difficulty is if the garda&iacute; have somebody in the local hospital who has been attacked or abused they normally look for somewhere for the family to go.  We know in Dublin that hostel accommodation is full at night time and there is the same difficulty with hotels, so where do they go?  Usually the garda&iacute; put them in the station, which is okay for an hour or two or, at a push, overnight.  Where do the families go?  If we take this huge important piece of infrastructure out of the system what will replace it?

It is funded by Respond! Housing Association.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency allocates available funding for domestic violence to emergency refuge accommodation services and community-based domestic violence supports.  It does not fund Cuan &Aacute;lainn.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Cuan &Aacute;lainn centre provides second stage accommodation for women and children who have experienced domestic violence and who may already have been in emergency accommodation.  The facility does not operate as a front-line emergency domestic violence service, rather it provides step down or transitional accommodation to support transition into a permanent settled home.  This can include survivors of domestic violence who are transitioning from emergency services to a new, permanent home.<\/p>  <p>  Departmental officials and Tusla recently met Respond!, at the housing association's request, to discuss the current situation in Cuan &Aacute;lainn.  Respond! advised that it was not in a position to continue funding for the centre.

Clearly, there is a need for the State to provide services of this nature and to do so in a planned and organised fashion.  It is very welcome that Respond! as a housing agency does this independently without regard to the State, and it is also very commendable that it has funded it, but we need to have a proper organised handover if it is going to cease to fund it.  It is not as if the organisation is bereft of funds, that it is overdrawn in the bank or that its capital is expended and it is extended.  This is not the case.  Its board is quite entitled to make the decision that, having established and funded this, it feels it is not core to its work and that it would like to cease funding it, but there is an onus on it to sit down and speak to us about how it can be handed over in an orderly fashion to allow the Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to determine how best to continue funding to support women and families who have been the subject of domestic violence and abuse and how to transition from the emergency situation, as Respond! has done by providing the service, into a more permanent solution and permanent home, which clearly involves the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government also.

It is not fair to the families concerned to have them looking at 18 December, the week before Christmas, with the threat of having the roof over their heads removed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700038#LL00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1444227000,"counter":698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700038#LL00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1444227000,"counter":699,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1444227000,"counter":700,"content":"<p>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald is in possession and I understand she is sharing time with her colleague, Deputy Dessie Ellis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700038#LL00700","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1444227000,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, is on his way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700038#LL00800","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1444227000,"counter":702,"content":"<p>Likewise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700038#LL00900","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1444227000,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Would I be right in assuming that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700038#LL01000","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1444227000,"counter":704,"content":"<p>No more than the Deputy, I assume so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700038#LL01100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1444227000,"counter":705,"content":"<p>If the Deputy wishes, we will wait for the Minister of State to arrive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700038#LL01200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1444227000,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I would prefer to give it a moment because I feel like I am speaking in a vacuum more so than usual.

I brought to his attention the demise of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, and I commented on how the Minister of State had given a very benign account of why all of that happened.  It happened nonetheless and we are where we are now.<\/p>  <p>  It is extremely important that we get this legislation right.  When we commend the community and talk about building and developing a vibrant community, we should mean it and our words should amount to more than rhetoric, so that the communities in question benefit.  I am conscious that there are essentially two strands in the docklands communities: those who would be considered to be there for generations and people who have moved to the area to raise families, live and make their lives.  The Minister of State noted the anticipated swelling of numbers in the area and it is very important that we get that integration right.  The communities and families for whom the docklands have always been home should still feel at home in a place that has changed very radically over the past number of years, and which will undoubtedly change again.  The objective, in other words, must be to achieve positive change all around.<\/p>  <p>  I am very disappointed there is no statutory basis for social gain.  The experience set out in the Minister of State's initial statement, although I do not deny the positive aspects, is a little misty-eyed and not exactly a full telling of what happened in the docklands area.  It is important, while recognising what has happened, that we should not have an inflated sense of the social dividend for those communities and families.<\/p>  <p>  For example, we can consider social housing.  As the Minister of State knows, I represent the north side of the docklands area.  I can tell him that we have lists the length of his and my two arms and beyond for local families seeking to be accommodated.  The phenomenon of overcrowding is huge in these communities and some of the accommodation is of poor quality.  The local authority, despite a Dublin docklands area plan, has not been in a position to provide even basic maintenance in many cases.  The Minister of State cited the Docklands Housing Trust and I acknowledge that initiative.  Nevertheless, trying to pretend that it or the totality of the social and affordable units afforded in the docklands over the years is anything close to what was required or that which would represent a real social dividend is to live in cloud cuckoo land.  That simply did not happen.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the educational dividend, the Minister of State was quite right to point out bursaries, scholarships and opportunities, many of which were pursued through the National College of Ireland.  I acknowledge them here today.  It is also important to record that a new primary school was promised to St. Laurence O'Toole school on Sheriff Street but that never materialised.  That was a cause of considerable local anger and although various plans were put forward, the long and short of it is that it did not happen.  Other primary school facilities in the docklands area and up to East Wall have gained in some small measure from the largesse, generosity and creativity of the DDDA but it is nothing like what could be possible.  We need to be ambitious when we speak about social dividend, and it must amount to more than just flouncing or initiatives to take the bad look from what might seem to be very aggressive commercial development; in essence, giving the crumbs from the table to the local communities.  We need a far more integrated sense and approach than that, which is why the social dividend and gain must have a basis in law.  It should be written in the legislation, and I have no doubt we will return to this on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State instanced the issue of employment and - not unfairly - pointed to the potential that will unquestionably arise for new jobs that would be well paid, good quality, high tech and high spec.  That is what we want to see.  The Minister of State indicated that local people will have an advantage in respect of employment opportunities and that must become the reality.  He referenced specifically local employment clauses and I am glad he did so but they were in place, as the Minister of State is probably aware, in the last dispensation.  If the Minister of State went to the docklands to ask people what they made of that element of the plan and what it delivered for the community, they would say they are hard-pressed to find somebody who accessed employment regardless of a local employment clause.  They would probably go on to say that where employment was secured, it was only in very specific types of functions.  All work is noble, dignified and good but if we are to speak about a meaningful local employment clause, it must mean that local kids, students, women and men have a real opportunity to get diverse opportunities for good quality work.<\/p>  <p>  The bottom line is that the local employment clause should be based in law.  Both the Minister of State and I are aware of the legal issues with respect to domestic and European law in how that clause is couched; that is to keep ourselves on the right side, legally speaking.  However, it can be done.  If the Government is serious about local employment opportunities and a local employment clause, it will appear in the legislation.  If that does not happen, many people will view any commitment to local employment in a very jaundiced way, and I could not blame them for doing so.<\/p>  <p>  The consultative forum to be established is detailed in the legislation.  It is envisaged very much in an advisory capacity but it could and should be more than that.  Of course, consultation with local stakeholders, whether they are from business and the local community or residents, is always a good and healthy exercise.  We can consider the scale of development envisaged, which the Minister of State described as profound and transformational.  That is the right kind of language to use in this respect.  In these circumstances, however, and given that there is a fast-tracked planning application under the strategic development zone, the consultative committee must be in a position to give more than advice.  It must be in a place where it can take decisions that can be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Although it would be fair to say that many of the experiences for docklanders in participating in DDDA forums was positive and pleasant at times, there has been an ongoing and residual criticism that much of that process was tokenistic and at times bore the hallmarks of a talking shop.  That is not good enough.  For the consultative forum to have teeth, mean something and make a difference, it must be more than advisory in nature.<\/p><p>This is something we will return to and which I hope the Government will remedy in the legislation.<\/p> <p> On the issue of planning, the 22 hectares subject to the strategic development zone and the involvement of NAMA in that has been set out.  Provision is made, for instance, for section 25 certificates to allow completion of developments that are substantially commenced but not completed.  That is a sensible thing to do.  It is possibly in the area of planning that the biggest hole exists in this legislation.  I will set it out for the Minister of State as clearly as I can.  Longboat Quay is not unique in respect of the fire hazards the residents face.  Full culpability for that rests with the developer in question.  I acknowledge that there are questions to be asked of the other agencies in terms of oversight and certification, but in the final analysis, the developer in question is the person with whom responsibility lies.  Longboat Quay is not unique.  The Taoiseach acknowledged that in the House this morning.  It is not unique in the context of the docklands area either.  There are many other developments which were thrown up, which remain shoddy and where residents face considerable difficulties in terms of their quality of living.  Some of those hazards relate to fire safety while others do not, but all are a consequence of shoddy workmanship, greed, haste and indifference.<\/p> <p> I have cited Bernard McNamara several times.  As the Minister of State is probably aware, I am looking to speak to him and if the Minister of State has any influence there, he might help me.  It should also be said that McNamara is not the only developer who has left residents in the lurch.  There are others and many of them went through the NAMA process.  In many cases their businesses have been dissolved and they are no longer trading.  We might see those same individuals back in business and we may very well - I believe we will - see them making applications to build again in the docklands area.  They will have the facility of the fast-track planning process and so on.  We cannot countenance a situation in which any developer who has short-changed residents, people who bought homes in good faith, would simply be allowed to apply for planning permission, secure permission and go right ahead and build all over again without making good the shoddy work they carried out previously.<\/p> <p> The issue of compliance has to be at the heart of this.  The question is how we sort that out legislatively.  That is as much a question for the Minister of State as an observation.  I cannot imagine how the State or this legislation could allow Bernard McNamara or anybody else to go back into the docklands in a new guise and build again.  I accept that developers have to build and things have to be built.  That is not my issue.  It is unacceptable that they would be allowed to motor on and that the State would not demand that they would make good the shoddy work they left behind them.  That is a matter of basic common sense.  If we could achieve that within this legislation, that would be a very good day's work.  If we do not, we are at least partially responsible for letting these developers off the hook.  That would not be good enough.  We have bailed out the banks and had to suffer the phenomenon of NAMA.  These developers have been bailed out not once but twice.  They are not going to be bailed out a third time for not bothering to comply with building regulations with which they were fully conversant and the standards of which they were fully aware.  In their haste and under the nose of the previous authority, they disregarded all of the above and now residents or taxpayers may face the prospect of paying that bill.  That, to my way of thinking, is not going to happen.  I ask-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700039#MM00100","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444228200,"counter":713,"content":"<p>Sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but she is sharing time with Deputy Ellis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700040#NN00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444228200,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I am.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700040#NN00300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1444228200,"counter":715,"content":"<p>There are only nine minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700040#NN00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444228200,"counter":716,"content":"<p>I am aware of that.

Cuireann s&eacute; deireadh leis an Dublin Docklands Development Authority agus aistr&iacute;onn s&eacute; gach rud go Chomhairle Cathrach Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill on Second Stage and will take this opportunity to raise a number of issues with the Minister of State.  This Bill proposes the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, and the transfer of rights and functions to Dublin City Council.  Section 7 deals with the transfer of functions from the authority to Dublin City Council.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Minister of State considered the legal implications in moving all functions from the DDDA to the council, specifically in respect of the current desperate situation in Longboat Quay?  Tonight, more than 600 residents in just short of 298 apartments face evacuation from their homes if they cannot collectively find the &euro;4 million required to resolve fire safety defects.  Each resident is currently facing a personal cost of &euro;18,000 to conduct the necessary work to ensure the safety of their home.  The work needed includes the installation of \"an adequate smoke ventilation system\" for the lobbies and communal stairs, fire separation between apartments, upgrading of fire doors and the installation of fire-stopping materials in utility services.<\/p>  <p>  The developer, Bernard McNamara, built the complex in 2006 at the peak of the Celtic tiger.  His company, Gendsong, went into receivership not long after that.  As a result, the properties remain with the DDDA, which also owns a number of apartments in the complex.  To date, the DDDA has invested &euro;1 million in contracting fire wardens and upgrading the fire alarms system.  In its supposed attempt to address this situation, the DDDA offered to put &euro;2.75 million towards the necessary works, which the residents rightly refused.  Why should they have to foot a single penny of this colossal bill?<\/p>  <p>  Today, Dublin City Council's chief executive said the council has nowhere to put residents as the homeless crisis deepens.  Does this honestly come as a surprise to the Government when there are 130,000 applications on the housing list and almost 180 people sleeping on the streets every night in addition to 1,500 children in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation?  The situation facing the docklands residents is further proof, as if any were needed, that the homeless crisis has gained unprecedented momentum due to failures of this Government and is now worsening by the day.<\/p><p>Direct and decisive action is needed in addressing this issue before more citizens find themselves in the same situation as many thousands have done, with little light at the end of the tunnel.<\/p> <p> It is clear from the experience of Priory Hall in 2011 that poor building regulations and little oversight resulted in developers, insurance companies and builders doing their utmost to shirk all responsibility and accountability.  No consideration was given to residents who bought or rent these properties and all this is evidence of the worst kind of capitalism.  To date, Priory Hall has cost the city council &euro;27 million.  Will the Minister of State confirm or give a commitment that the Department or the local authority which has assumed new responsibilities will absorb the cost of these necessary works at Longboat Quay?<\/p> <p> The nightmare situation facing the docklands residents threatens to replicate itself throughout the country as I have no doubt news of other substandard properties will emerge in the near future.  While the Minister of State has acknowledged the likelihood of more affected properties, such as a development in County Kildare, or Prospect Hill in Finglas, which we are hearing about, he has attempted to dodge the core issue of regulation by blaming the policy of previous Governments for current deficiencies in building standards.  Such deflections are becoming all too habitual as the Minister of State continues to pass blame for the housing emergency while ignoring the devastating realities of the homelessness crisis.<\/p> <p> This week a Minister claimed the Government had introduced legislation demanding better building regulation.  Not surprisingly, this claim was directly countered by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, which warned that the regulations do not provide adequate oversight of development and will not ensure this does not happen in the future.  It seems I have to make the point that the Government must hold developers to account because the Government is operating in a permanent blind spot when it comes to holding the appropriate persons to account.  We call for the implementation of regulations as per the recommendations of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland in conjunction with introduction of legislation to ensure developers are held responsible for any failing on their part to correspond to standards and regulations set out by the authorities.<\/p> <p> Local community groups, residents' associations and businesses play a vital role in shaping the places in which they live and work.  Part 5 provides for the establishment of a consultative forum on a statutory basis to allow for the input of relevant parties into any future planning by the local authority in the docklands.  I welcome this and reiterate the importance of community participation in the planning process as it is essential to the establishment of a suitable and harmonious residential environment.  It is essential, therefore, that the structures that comprised the consultative form previously be maintained.  We welcome the deepening of the consultation process between the city council and the aforementioned community stakeholders.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State outline whether employees of the DDDA have received any guarantees about redundancies, whether compulsory or voluntary?  Will employees be transferred to Dublin City Council and, if so, on what terms?  Will pensions be honoured?  Are there any outstanding debts that the taxpayer and the city council will have to take up?  Will the Minister of State confirm that the Castleforbes apartments, which have been left lying idle for six or seven years and do not comply with building standard regulations, were bought by Dublin City Council from the DDDA for a very large sum?  The docklands is a modern residential, office and business hub and area that has been transformed into one of the most vibrant parts of the city.  It is an example of what can be done to what was once a run-down area.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether there is a cost to this transfer and, if so, what is it?  I believe that future regeneration plans for the area are probably being transferred into the best hands, and where they should be, with Dublin City Council, but it is important that we all keep an eye on this and that Dublin City Council is held to account in the future as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700040#NN00600","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444228800,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.<\/p>  <p>  Even though we are talking specifically about the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the responsibility for which is moving back to the city council, this Bill is about development, which includes housing, and there are probably more plans to put more of the high-end business element in the area than housing.  It is interesting that NAMA is going to get involved in the area.  Normally, it bundles the assets together and sells them to foreign funds at a cheap price, but now it is going to start investing in developments.  It seems to be driven towards partnerships with the private sector to provide office space for some of these large American companies that are moving in of late to the residential and office markets in particular.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt housing is a serious problem.  Obviously, no one is separating this from what has happened in Longboat Quay.  We have been here before with Priory Hall and other developments and I reckon we will be here again.  It is not going to go away all of a sudden.  A lot of stuff was put together over a number of years that left a lot to be desired.<\/p>  <p>  There are a few main problems with housing at present and I have been disappointed that some serious problems have not been addressed in the housing area.  Deputy McDonald referred to the fact a builder could build badly and seem to have no problem in getting planning permission to do the same again, and that is something that is worth looking at.  The builder in question has obviously gone bankrupt, he has come out of the system and he is a new individual now.  I understand how bankruptcy works and I understand that it is not possible for the Taoiseach to ring Bernard McNamara because Mr. McNamara is not the entity he was before he got bankruptcy and the system allowed him back into the fold with a clean slate.  However, the Government needs to look at the idea that if a builder does not carry out his work in a manner that meets the building regulations and the planning rules, there has to be a mechanism - legislation needs to be brought in - to stop that from happening again.  If a builder or developer fails to fulfil his or her obligations in this area, while I am not saying one should lock him or her up and throw away the key, he or she should never get a project of that nature and size again.  That is a flaw in the system.<\/p>  <p>  Right now, there is no obligation on a developer to retain competent design professionals to design a building or a competent contractor to build it.  This is something that could be looked at as well.  Having a system so loose is not a good idea and it should be tightened up.  There should be an onus on a developer to retain persons of a certain proven professional standard who have not blotted their copybook.<\/p>  <p>  One of our biggest problems, to which I heard the Taoiseach refer a couple of times in the past fortnight, is the idea that developments should have been inspected.<\/p><p>Sadly, the Government has refrained from reintroducing proper inspection.  We all know that if we want everybody to do good work, we need to inspect it, and we need independent inspection, not self-certification.  In the past, this was performed by the clerk of works, who insisted on inspecting work at all levels.  The clerk of works was on site, was deemed competent enough to inspect the work and could monitor everything that was done.  The system was worth its weight in gold.  While it was a cost to the State, it was very valuable and worth the money.  If the State argues that it does not have the money to do it, the money for the clerk of works should be incorporated into the levy.  The clerk of works should be on site from the start of the job to the finish and should reach a certain level of competence.  This could all be done.  If it must be done, the Government should implement the levy in order to cover the cost.  It is not rocket science.<\/p> <p> The new regulations the Government has implemented place all the responsibility on the architect.  It does not make sense on a building site.  I have made the point several times that the architect cannot possibly be there all the time and will not be paid to have somebody there all the time on his or her behalf.  An architect does not know everything about building and is not trained to.  There are many different aspects to it.  The clerk of works had a good general background in different aspects of construction.  Independent, local authority inspection is a must if the Government wants good building work to be done.<\/p> <p> I disagree with the idea of relying on the architect and his or her insurance to cover everything.  It makes no sense.  The engineer designs the structure of pillars, beams and columns that holds the building together.  The architect makes decisions about space, environmental impact, image and the final look while the engineer ensures the building keeps together.  The engineer takes the architect's drawings, determines how to make the building stand up and stay up and ensures it does not cause problems.  One cannot expect the architect to know everything about engineering, no more than one could expect an engineer to know everything about architecture.  It is unfair.<\/p> <p> Subcontractors come in.  Many of the buildings built during the past 20 years have a structural steel frame, and how it is put together is vital.  The person who puts it there must sign off and certify that he or she has done it properly and must have the insurance to cover the work in case anything goes wrong.  If he or she does not have the insurance before starting, he or she should not get the job.  He or she must be able to stand over the work and have the insurance to pay for problems in case the work is not right.  This applies to other areas.  If I go to a site and put a roof on a building, I should have to sign a certificate to state I have done it right and in accordance with regulation, I have not broken any rules and my workmanship is up to standard.  I must also have insurance.  If I were to go bankrupt or out of business the following week, my insurance must remain in place for approximately ten years after I leave the site and get the completion notice.  If this means a bond process, I should have to pay for a bond before putting the roof on.  If a roof leaks because I did not do it right, it causes major problems throughout the building for other subcontractors involved.  If there is no insurance or bond to ensure the roofer pays for his or her responsibility for not doing the work properly, where is the logic?  It does not make sense.  The architect does not know whether a roof was put on properly.  The architect has a roof in the drawings and can examine it at the end to ensure it is the roof he or she designed.  While the architect can certify that it is the roof he or she designed, there are other questions.  Was it done right?  Will it keep the water out?  Could the wind lift it?  Is it held down properly?  Wind is a major factor; roofs have blown off.  The roofer must have insurance in place to cover any possible problems.<\/p> <p> There is a major debate over Longboat Quay and who should pay for remediation of the problems there.  Had the local authority done its job properly, it would have found out that things were not done right.  In defence of the local authority, it is not getting paid and does not have the personnel or capability to inspect everything.  The local authority admits it inspects approximately 15% of built work.  However, all built work should be inspected.  The new regulation has improved the manner in which drawings and designs are inspected in the early stages and at the start, and this is good.  However, it ignores the built work to a great degree, and the Government should address this.  It is a major problem and it is possible to address it.  It is not rocket science.  The Government must listen to the people in the industry.  While all the problems are soluble, we have been ignoring them for too long because certain people have had vested interests in neglecting to address them.  I am not saying the Government had a vested interest in not addressing them.  I am not sure where the advice on the new building regulations came from.  However, they are not good and they must be revisited.<\/p> <p> We are talking about housing quality.  I will move on to the lack of housing and the difficulty so many people on low incomes have accessing housing.  They are not disconnected.  Until some Government allows the local authorities to start building State housing again, the problems will prevail.  We allowed much of our social housing to be sold to the occupants.  After living in them for a certain time, many of these people sold the houses to private bodies which rented them out to people who could not afford a house but received rent supplement.  We have paid &euro;15 billion in rent supplement over ten or 15 years.  It is a frightening figure.  It does not make sense.  The lack of social housing is driving up the demand for other houses and in the past, the fact that we built social housing helped in this area.  We must build social housing again, and in far greater numbers than the Government is planning.  The Government's plans are too reliant on the private sector.  While not everybody likes the idea of returning to building State housing, it is a must.  We will continue to have a housing crisis until we change our attitude towards it.  We have to do it; it is imperative.<\/p><p>We have an added problem now with people who do not own their houses and cannot get on the property ladder.  I am not saying everyone should be able to get on the property ladder, as I do not believe they should.  I think it is just too expensive for some people.  It is a stone around their necks.  It is too burdensome.<\/p> <p> Rent is now becoming a serious problem because we have seen so much rental property moving into investment funds.  NAMA and the banks have sold huge tracts of apartments, houses and development lands to US investment funds that are actually forming a cartel in the rental market.  I know rents.  I have spoken about this issue a couple of times now.  Rent keeps going up.  I know apartments that were getting &euro;900 a month.  I built the apartments in question, which are in Dominick Street.  The foreign investment funds that own them are now looking for &euro;1,500 a month.  I believe they will get such rents because there is such a scarcity of rental property.  It is a massive problem.  A small group of players now have significant control of the rental market.<\/p> <p> There is an idea that the problems in the rental market and the need to provide homes to people can be dealt with through the rent supplement system, but that is not really workable because it is too expensive for the State in the absence of regulations to deal with rent.  I have not seen much of an appetite in the Government for rent control.  I am a bit puzzled by its failure to look at the European models.  It keeps getting worse and it will be difficult to backtrack on it.  There is an absolute need for some control or regulation to be brought into this whole area.  Some people say that landlords will leave the business if rent controls are introduced.  That did not happen in Europe, however.  When rent control settles down, it actually leads to certainty for the landlord as well.  Landlords are entitled to rights.  We should probably look at cases in which landlords are not being fairly treated by troublesome tenants.  Landlords have to be given reasonable powers to deal with such cases.  I am not anti-landlord.  I have been a landlord.<\/p> <p> There is a serious lack of regulation in this whole area.  The Minister of State does not need me to tell him that a lack of regulation has been problematic in many areas.  The current housing crisis is strongly linked to the lack of regulation in many areas.  The whole construction industry is highly problematic.  I do not see those problems being addressed.  The Government needs to sit down with stakeholders and the different people who work in this problematic industry, which has substantial problems.  Those problems will continue until they are addressed.  They need to be addressed in here by means of legislation.  They are capable of being addressed.  It is bordering on a kind of free-for-all.<\/p> <p> We had arguments about land banking when we discussed a previous Bill.  The legislation that has been introduced has not really dealt with land banking, which is absolutely at the root of all of this.  The legislation in question is not going to deal with land banking.  Who has bought up the big tracts of land that went into NAMA after the banks went into receivership?  Most of them have been bought by big US investment funds.  These guys are going to control most of what is built in this town over the next couple of years.  If one looks at the applications that are being made for planning permission, and who is making those applications, one will learn that most of the entities that are applying are vulture funds.  These guys are interested in rent in Dublin because it is so lucrative that it is hard to beat.  It is amazing that a two-bedroom apartment could cost between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,500 a month.  I have made the point in this House previously that a two-bedroom apartment in Turin makes between &euro;300 and &euro;400 a month.  There is not much point in the vulture funds going there.  They will come here because we are unregulated and it is a free-for-all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700041#OO00200","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444230000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>As I listened yesterday evening to the speech given by the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, I was struck by some of the points he made.  He suggested that since the inception in 1997 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, \"what was once a derelict part of the city has been transformed into a vibrant neighbourhood and progressive economic area, housing some of the most prestigious international and domestic companies\".  The use of the word \"prestigious\" is rather ironic, given that on Private Members' business last night and tonight we are debating the aggressive tax planning and profit-shifting of multinationals, some of which may be the prestigious companies mentioned by the Minister of State last night.  Regardless of the accuracy of the reference to prestigious international companies, I take issue with the suggestion that until 1997 the docklands were a derelict part of the city.<\/p>  <p>  I was born in a docklands community and I continue to live in such a community.  Many members of my family were born in the docklands and continue to live in a neighbouring docklands community.  Those communities - I refer to the north side of the docklands - were always vibrant.  It is certainly not true that they were not vibrant until the DDDA came into existence.  As some of the new communities that have been created on foot of the DDDA housing developments are gated communities, it is very difficult for them to engage with the local communities on issues.  I accept that the docks themselves were derelict.  The Minister of State recognised last night that it was once an active working port.  However, containerisation had a devastating effect, with the loss of many jobs, including jobs in the allied industries.  Successive Governments made little or no attempt to provide alternative employment.  That dereliction and destruction was allowed to continue year after year.<\/p>  <p>  I recently had a look back at the aspect of the 1982 Tony Gregory deal that related to the port and the docks.  It was very far-sighted and innovative.  I know it seems strange to be talking about acres, but the plan suggested that six acres be provided for office accommodation, ten acres for local authority housing, eight acres for industrial development and three acres for leisure and recreational purposes, although that did not happen.  If only they had got it right then, we might have been spared so many of the difficulties that arose afterwards.  It is another one of those cases of \"if only\".  When the DDDA was established in 1997, housing and leisure and recreation were certainly not priorities.  That is another point that was acknowledged by the Minister of State last night.  However, he suggested that \"substantial community gain\" was associated with the redevelopment of the docklands.  While there was some community gain, I am doubtful about his use of the word \"substantial\".  It certainly was not substantial when it came to housing the long-established communities in the local area.<\/p>  <p>  There is absolutely no doubt that the DDDA was tainted.  Tony Gregory was aware of this.  He was well ahead of others in spotting the crucial conflicts of interest in the membership of the board of the DDDA.  Some of the board members were associated with Anglo Irish Bank, which was funding the largest development in all of the north docklands.  The members of the board granted planning permission for this development in the first place.  How could local community interests be protected in such an environment?  The reality was that the developers had absolutely no regard for the communities.  In the cases of some small communities, all the developers thought they had to do was come along with some kind of sweetener or brown envelope to entice the people of those communities to ride off into the sunset.  The issues with the developers that the communities had to deal with at the time of the DDDA included shadowing due to the height of developments and the blocking out of natural light.  Areas that were once quiet enclaves for families were subjected to endless and excessive noise and dust and over-the-top working hours which breached the rules on working hours.  Those involved worked through the night at times.  Work took place at 6 o'clock on Sunday mornings.  There was subsidence of houses and cracks appeared on gable walls.  Communities had to engage in constant battles as they tried to deal with endless building sites.  The cherry on the cake was the derelict monstrosity that was supposed to become the headquarters of Anglo Irish Bank.<\/p>  <p>  While the redevelopment of the docklands was successful in certain respects, such as with regard to business and finance, we can see that there are major issues today.  Social and economic regeneration did not apply to everyone.  Communities have felt excluded and isolated in the face of the towering grey and glass structures that surround them.  When one walks down through the docklands today, one can see a 20 ft. fence separating the development at Custom House Quay from Mariners Port in North Wall.  That is just one small example.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that there have been physical improvements to the quays as well as to the cultural, recreational and educational life of the area through the Convention Centre, the <i>Jeanie Johnston<\/i>, the Famine Memorial, the restaurants, the National College of Ireland and so forth.  I also want to acknowledge the work of Dublin Port Authority and the way in which it supports and engages with the docklands communities.  It is very proactive in opening up the port to water-based activities and community groups.<br\/><br\/>I have a number of questions for the Minister of State.  There are DDDA legacy issues relating to planning.  Community gain lost out in the current structures and there was a loss of land in the form of plot 8.  This has weakened the community aspect of the plan.  What will happen to the section 25 planning certificates, two of which have been activated in the last month?  Are there others outstanding and what is their life span?  I also have a question about the common areas and green spaces in apartment dwellings.  These will come under the control of Dublin City Council but does the council have adequate funding to look after them?  We have three planning systems operating in the docklands - Dublin City Council, strategic development zone or SDZ, and section 25 planning certificates.  That makes it very difficult for people to engage.  It is not just a dual planning system but one with a third string.  How are communities' rights protected when two of the systems have no appeals mechanism while the third system has?  There have been benefits but what communities really want to see is a real and meaningful engagement with the new body in charge, Dublin City Council.  I believe that it probably will be better for local communities and I hope I am not proven wrong on that.<br\/><br\/>I have two items on my wish list.  The first relates to boats.  I would like to see easier access for boats that travel along the two canals, the Royal and the Grand, to the basin.  Something must be done with the Scherzer bridge.  Why is it so difficult to get it open?  My second wish list item relates to the very dynamic and vibrant Dublin Dockers group that has come together in recent years and gathered artefacts, memorabilia and photographs of the life of the docker.  That group needs a space and I know that negotiations are going on with regard to developing a docklands museum.  There is great potential there to develop a model similar to the Arigna Mining Experience under which former dockers can give guided tours. <br\/><br\/>Money was collected per square meter for cultural projects.  Has all of that money been spent and is it accounted for?  What is the social capital benefit for local communities as the huge capital programmes are planned?  Local communities were let down when it came to employment by the DDDA.  The Grangegorman Development Agency is much more proactive in this regard.  At meetings that I attend, that agency presents the local employment figures from each of the companies working in Grangegorman.<br\/><br\/>We talked about corporate tax last night and will discuss it again tonight.  In that context, how much of the 12.5% tax that the businesses in the docklands are paying will go to the local communities?  That said, I acknowledge the involvement of some of those businesses with local schools and youth clubs in the area.  The Government says that Dublin City Council is best placed to take on the project.  I, along with my colleagues, have been to meetings with Dublin City Council about the plans and there are a lot of positives there.  However, I am a little dubious when I read phrases like &quot;fast-track planning procedures&quot;, especially in the context of the three applications that are in for consideration at the moment.  Local communities can only make submissions, for which they have to pay, and they cannot make objections.  That is an issue of concern for communities.<br\/><br\/>I hope that Dublin City Council has more of a social conscience than the DDDA and that when it comes to housing, it will keep families in mind and not just the type of apartments that suit those working in the business and financial services sector in the area.  In the past, under the DDDA, it was the developers, businesses and property owners who benefitted from the planning schemes and the tax schemes.  We must be assured that it will be the communities who will benefit most going forward.  Prevention of opportunities for recidivism takes the incentives away from the speculators and the developers.  The centenary of the 1916 Rising is approaching and there are great stories from the docklands on its association with the Rising.  I look forward to seeing that developed.  I bow to the superior knowledge of Deputy Mick Wallace when it comes to building, but even I know that anything built must be rigorously regulated, monitored and inspected.  Towards the end of his speech the Minister of State used phrases like &quot;bright future&quot;, &quot;handsome rewards&quot;, &quot;increased prosperity&quot; and &quot;improving economic position for the capital&quot;.  I would love to see the words &quot;well-being of the communities&quot; included as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700043#QQ00200","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444230600,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  The text of the Bill is simple and straightforward and it provides for the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the transfer of its functions to Dublin City Council.  Despite its simplicity, it is very far reaching in its implications.  Passage of the Bill will mark the end of a bold experiment to fast-track planning in the docklands by making the DDDA the planning authority for the area.  Substantial development took place along the docks in the early years of the authority's existence but with the arrival of the Celtic tiger, its mission statement of social and economic regeneration in equal measure was forgotten.  The contradictions in its dual role of development and planning became all too obvious.  The joint enterprise purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site by the DDDA and the developers Bernard McNamara and Derek Quinlan, with money from Anglo Irish Bank, was a financial disaster that beggared the authority to the tune of &euro;52 million.<\/p>  <p>  The fire safety problems currently being experienced by the residents of Longboat Quay do not reflect well on the effectiveness of the DDDA in fulfilling its joint role as a planning and development authority.  If further apartment blocks are found to be sub-standard in the quality of their construction and not in compliance with building standards, the DDDA may have serious questions to answer into the future.  Perhaps, before this Bill is passed, the Department should reflect on the timing of the dissolution of the authority and consider whether the transfer of its functions and liabilities to Dublin City Council is desirable before a full survey is carried out of properties constructed since 1997 when the DDDA was established.  Section 10(1) of the Bill states that \"A claim in respect of any loss or injury alleged to have been suffered by any person arising out of the performance before the dissolution day of the functions of the Authority shall, on and after that day, lie against the Council and not against the Authority\".  All of the liabilities are taken on by Dublin City Council.  It might be wise to wait a little while.<\/p>  <p>  Last night the Minister of State went through the history of the docklands and provided quite a good description.  However, I disagree with some elements of it and will give the Minister of State my own version, as someone who has been a public representative for the area for almost 30 years.  The Dublin docklands is an area in the heart of the city with a close relationship to Dublin Port.  Traditionally, most working men in the docklands were employed as labourers and carters on the docks and railways.  A lot of this work was highly irregular and casual.  Many other jobs in the docklands were also dependent on the port.  Working conditions were tough and there were often two or three men available for every job.  There were few jobs for women, though some earned a living from street trading and from cleaning or domestic service in more prosperous parts of the city.  The docks were a focal point of the 1913 Lockout as the casual labourers in the docks had joined the new Irish Transport and General Workers Union.  The area was also a focal point during the 1916 Rising.<\/p>  <p>  From the 1950s, containerisation and roll-on-roll-off shipping reduced the need for manual labour, storage facilities and large dockside space where cargo could be loaded and unloaded.  Thus, more sites became derelict and jobs disappeared.  The docks were no longer able to provide employment for a large number of people and the area has never recovered from the devastating impact of this development.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the houses built in the docklands during the nineteenth century were of poor quality.  Local authority flat complexes were constructed in the North Wall between 1930 and 1952 but were demolished in the 1980s as the Government of the day sought to regenerate the docklands.  The population fell by 50% between 1900 and the 1980s.  The Urban Renewal Act was passed in 1986 and the Customs House Docks Development Authority, CHDDA, was established to redevelop the docklands.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, replaced the CHDDA in 1997.  The DDDA had within its remit an obligation to regenerate the docklands.  It was obliged to give effect to social and economic regeneration in equal measure.  The mission statement of the DDDA reads as follows: \"We will develop the Dublin Docklands into a world-class city quarter - a paragon of sustainable inner city regeneration - one in which the whole community enjoys the highest standards of access to education, employment, housing and social amenity and which delivers a major contribution to the social and economic prosperity of Dublin and the whole of Ireland.\"<\/p><p>Little of the promised social regeneration took place, however.  The north docklands area has an indigenous community that continues to be among the most deprived in the country.  This community is located cheek by jowl with a new, affluent community and there is very little interaction between the two communities.  Education levels in much of the docklands are extremely low and multi-generational unemployment is a problem.  The increase in the population in recent years and the decline in derelict sites in the docklands do not reflect a lifting of all boats but, rather, a widening gulf between the indigenous community and the new residents who inhabit the new developments.  The Pobal Haase-Pratschke or HP deprivation index for 2006 and 2011 reveals the stark dichotomy between the new affluent communities and the neglected indigenous community.  The index for primary education levels shows similar stark contrasts.<\/p> <p> While thousands of construction workers were employed on the docklands projects and a 20% local labour clause was provided for in the master plan, the developers avoided local labour by parachuting their external workforce into temporary rented accommodation in the North Wall and East Wall areas and claimed that this constituted local employment.  The commitment to provide social housing on the north side of the River Liffey was reneged on, as was the commitment to provide &euro;7 million to build a new primary school for the children of the North Wall.  While the Dublin Docklands Development Authority provided a community gain fund, it failed utterly to fulfil its social obligation to the community in a systematic way.  At the same time, expensive residential complexes and much sought after office blocks created a new skyline along the River Liffey, north and south.  Effectively, the DDDA created a disparate two-tier docklands society, despite 30 years of urban renewal in the area in the sense that it followed on from the work of the Custom House Docks Development Authority which was established in 1987.  The best part of three decades has been spent on urban renewal that was supposed to be, in equal measure, social and economic in nature but which has been entirely one-sided with the focus on economic development.  Nobody speaks well of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in the old working class docklands area.<\/p> <p> In 2011, when the new coalition Government assumed office, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was in terminal decline and operating in transition mode.  In 2013, when plans were set in motion to establish a new phase of development on the docklands, it became clear that the DDDA did not have the credibility to carry out the work and a decision was taken to transfer its functions to Dublin City Council through this dissolution Bill.  The new development plans encompassed an area of 66 ha. on either side of the River Liffey, that is, the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock.  A strategic development zone was identified and approved by the local authority for fast-track development, which it is estimated will create 23,000 jobs, a not insignificant number.  NAMA controls 75% of the assets in the SDZ area and is the facilitator of the development.  With a projected investment of &euro;2 billion, NAMA has a critical role in the SDZ.  I suggest this may well provide the template for future disposals by NAMA of its debts and the development of its assets.  Rather than selling off its assets, it should engage in development in the areas where they are located. <\/p> <p> On social regeneration, a large number of stakeholders in the docklands came together in January 2015.  They were determined that the failure of the DDDA to deliver on the social regeneration of the docklands should not be repeated under the new dispensation.  In consultation with NAMA and Dublin City Council, they met to explore the possibilities for the docklands communities that would be created by the new SDZ developments.  A plan was drawn up that would provide employment and apprenticeships locally, develop local businesses, invest in local education and training at every level, and make provision for social housing, local arts, crafts and sports.  It was considered essential that the essence of the docklands, namely, the history of the docks and its dockers and the confluence of the canal, river and sea, be preserved and presented to the world by the creation of a docklands heritage and historical trail to rival in importance the Wild Atlantic Way.  This time, social regeneration must continue alongside economic regeneration to create an integrated, vibrant docklands community as opposed to a two-tier community, which has been the case thus far.<\/p> <p> The SDZ is the last opportunity for proper docklands regeneration to take place.  It is necessary, therefore, that the new dissolution Bill states clearly that the central purpose of the SDZ is to effect the social and economic regeneration of the docklands and that Dublin City Council and NAMA should work together to achieve that outcome.  The legislation does not include a statement presenting a vision or purpose for the strategic development zone.  A DDDA master plan statement expressed a vision of equal social and economic regeneration.  However, this was disregarded by the developers and DDDA board.  Such a statement of intent should be provided in the legislation to create a backdrop against which the development of the SDZ can commence.<\/p> <p> Dublin City Council, as the planning authority for the SDZ, is the responsible party and must play the key role in the regeneration process.  The city council can place conditions on planning applications that would make provision for ensuring that the SDZ and surrounding areas are developed as a living, vibrant heartland of the city.  It is not doing so and planning applications are being granted without any attempt being made to provide an overall strategic vision or with planning conditions attached that could ensure integrated development in the strategic development zone.  A potential alignment with future planning applications will be required so as to provide space for education, training, housing, sports, arts, heritage and culture for the docklands and its community, as detailed in the current plan.  This will require the planning authority to present an overall vision of the SDZ project to ensure individual development projects are woven into a coherent regeneration framework and linked to the wider docklands area.<\/p> <p> NAMA, with its control of 75% of the assets in the area that constitutes the strategic development zone, should work in partnership with Dublin City Council to facilitate the regeneration process.  It should also work with Departments and other State authorities on specific projects and the provision or acquisition of sites or floor space.  The National College of Ireland needs space to expand its burgeoning educational activity, which is beneficial to the entire docklands community, from the child care level to the postgraduate level.  This should be recognised, identified and built into the SDZ plans before all the space is gobbled up by individual development projects.<\/p> <p> Second, the community stakeholders have identified the present headquarters of the DDDA, which was the old Isle of Man ferry ticket and berthing office and departure area, as a suitable location for community facilities.  An additional floor would make it a building of considerable capacity.  It is ideally located at the entrance to the docklands across from the iconic CHQ building and could include a one-stop shop for the docklands.  It could provide an interpretative centre for the abundant history and heritage of the docklands, housing some of the amazing artefacts, equipment, memorabilia and photographs that are still extant.  It could also serve as the starting point for the Dublin docklands heritage trail and provide facilities for arts and crafts, reflecting the rich musical, theatrical and writing traditions in the docklands.  The building could also provide a centre for local employment, placement as well as training services and catering and restaurant facilities for the local and business community.  None of this has been taken on board by any of the players in the docklands.<\/p> <p> On the consultative forum, Part 5 of the dissolution Bill provides for the establishment of a docklands consultative forum to advise the city council \"in relation to the formulation, development, monitoring and review of the Council's policy relating to the performance of the functions of the Council in so far as they relate to the docklands area.\"  The forum will consist of 21 members plus a chairperson drawn from community, educational and business organisations and local councillors.  It reflects the representative structure that was in place under the old DDDA, which was totally ineffective in holding the authority to account.  While the forum is a fine democratic structure, it will never be more than a talking shop because it has a consultative role, which means it will be allowed to speak but no one will be required to listen.  A totally different body is required to effect delivery of the social and economic regeneration of the docklands.  A specific new statutory oversight and implementation structure is needed to monitor and drive the social regeneration of the docklands.  The new structure must have teeth and targets.  It should liaise with Dublin City Council and NAMA while remaining independent of both, and should be answerable only to the Minister and the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700044#RR00200","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1444231200,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Building on Recovery: Statements","time":1444231800,"counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700046#TT00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1444231800,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to outline to the House the capital investment framework,\u00a0Building on Recovery, which represents an Exchequer spend of\u00a0&euro;27 billion over the next six years.  The longer six-year timeframe for the\u00a0plan will facilitate the delivery of a greater number of projects and programmes.  Key investments will be made in transport, education, health and enterprise, including a new metro link between the city centre and Dublin Airport and\u00a0Swords, a number of new road projects, a renewed and increased commitment to flood risk\u00a0management, the relocation of both Dublin maternity hospitals as well as Limerick Regional Maternity\u00a0Hospital, construction of the national children's hospital, installation of wireless networks in all schools, the removal of remaining prefabs at schools and investment in the enterprise regional building programme.  In every part of the country, these investments will boost our competitiveness, create jobs and\u00a0upgrade our social infrastructure.  If we add investment from the wider semi-state sector and off-balance-sheet mechanisms such as public private partnerships, total State investment will amount to\u00a0&euro;42 billion in new and existing infrastructure over the period, which is an average of 3.5% of GNP per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The House will recall that the capital plan announced in 2011 contained necessary reductions in expenditure which reflected the fiscal position we were then in.  As recent Exchequer figures have shown, those difficult but necessary decisions are beginning\u00a0to pay off.  Of the\u00a0&euro;42 billion worth of investment set out in the new programme, &euro;27 billion will be invested through direct Exchequer spending.  This represents a significant increase of some\u00a0&euro;10 billion over the previous five-year plan.  Decisions to allocate Exchequer funding were made following a lengthy review process, which included input from stakeholders at the national economic dialogue which we began this year.  The dialogue process was a most worthy discussion over two days.  The analysis identified capacity constraints, infrastructural bottlenecks and areas where demand pressures were building.  It informed the investment decisions contained in this framework to direct funding where it is most needed while maximising the economic and social return to the taxpayer.  The\u00a0investment framework\u00a0marks the beginning of a return to normal levels of investment.<\/p>  <p>  In order to sustain growth, we must invest, but we must also do so in the right way.  We will make affordable, sustainable\u00a0investments that boost the productive capacity of the economy, improve public services and\u00a0lay the foundations for future growth.  It is intended to have a mid-term review of the plan,\u00a0which will allow for a refreshing of the priorities and allocations, if appropriate, within the\u00a0updated fiscal context at the time.  The plan is not a departure from the prudent management of the public finances that has been\u00a0the hallmark of this Government.  Rather, it is an affirmation of that approach.  The fiscal rules enshrined in both national and European law ensure that increases in expenditure reflect\u00a0the underlying strength of our economy.\u00a0 Building on Recovery\u00a0is entirely consistent with this\u00a0approach.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the economy is now in a sustained recovery.  All the data so far this\u00a0year have been encouraging.  Consumer spending has been strong in 2015, with retail sales up by almost 10% year on year in July.  Car sales were up by almost 7%\u00a0over the same period.  Investment is also growing, with both building construction and machinery and equipment\u00a0spending on a rising path.  Recovery in the construction sector continued in July, with the purchasing managers' index for the sector recording its 23rd successive month of growth.  In fact, with the inclusion of the August figure, there have been 24 consecutive months of growth.  These encouraging macroeconomic data are mirrored in total taxation receipts, which are up 9.8% to August, year on year.  The Department of Finance published its macroeconomic forecasts in April, in which GDP was\u00a0expected to expand by 4% in 2015 and 3.8% in 2016.  As can be seen from recent independent forecasts, the Department's forecasts may be a little behind the curve right now, and I expect they will be updated in the Budget Statement next Tuesday.<\/p>  <p>  Investment decisions must take account of future needs as well as meeting current demands. \u00a0Demand for extra funding and investment is high, but decisions about how and where we spend our resources are not taken lightly.  I have introduced a requirement that all capital programmes and projects with a value greater than\u00a0&euro;100 million will require Government approval prior to commencement.  Further, and in line with long-standing practice, all projects and programmes to be delivered under this Exchequer\u00a0capital investment framework are subject to the provisions of the public spending code, including the provisions in relation to the need for\u00a0appraisal and value for money.  Projects are also subject, of course, to planning\u00a0guidelines and requirements, including environmental impacts assessments as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The new capital programme supports the Government's number one priority, which is getting people back to\u00a0work.  An estimated 45,000 construction jobs will be directly supported as a result of the\u00a0Exchequer plan.  The Government has also committed to spending\u00a0&euro;3 billion to support business and innovation through our enterprise agencies over the duration of the plan.  The IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland support 320,000 jobs in\u00a0this country.  We will continue to support these agencies by providing funding for grants, equity\u00a0investments and innovation supports.<\/p>  <p>  In order to grow, businesses need fast, efficient transport networks.  In the decade up to 2008,\u00a0Ireland addressed many of the infrastructural deficits that had been constraining growth.  I acknowledge that large-scale investments were made in our road network, public transport links and airports.  As Europe's fastest-growing and most dynamic economy today, it is essential that\u00a0we preserve our competitiveness by building on those investments.  In recognition of the fact that large transport projects have long lead-in times, the Government\u00a0will provide a seven-year capital envelope to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  A\u00a0total of\u00a0&euro;10 billion will be available to the Department over the period.  By 2022, we will have\u00a0doubled the level of annual investment in the transport area to &euro;2 billion per annum.  The largest single project will be a new metro and light rail link in Dublin.  Based on the outcome of the recent Fingal and north Dublin transport study, the National Transport Authority has\u00a0recommended that a revised metro project be selected as the appropriate public transport project to address the transport needs of the Swords and Dublin Airport to city centre corridor.  The plan\u00a0is to have a metro link in operation by 2026 to 2027 along a route for which travel demand is forecast\u00a0to grow by almost 40% by 2033 and where the current and potential future levels of car\u00a0dependency are unsustainable.<\/p>  <p>  The proportion of our citizens aged over 65 is, thankfully, increasing, which poses challenges to our\u00a0health care system.  To meet these challenges, there will be a large-scale investment in health care\u00a0facilities for the duration of the plan.  By 2021,\u00a0&euro;600 million will be spent annually to upgrade our hospitals, residential homes and health infrastructure.<\/p><p>This level of funding restores capital expenditure in health to its previous peak.<\/p> <p> The capital framework provides funding for the relocation of the Dublin maternity hospitals, which we announced, and Limerick maternity hospital.  Under the plan, an additional &euro;300 million will be invested in upgrading residential facilities around the country to meet Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards.  These facilities will not only provide an excellent standard of care and recovery, but also ease the pressure on hospitals and improve efficiencies across the system.<\/p> <p> Our young and growing population will allow us to sustain our recovery over the next decade and beyond, but we must ensure that public infrastructure is in place to support young families.  Nowhere is this more evident than in education.  Between 2012 and 2014, which were the most difficult of times, the Government built more than 84 new schools and 55 large-scale school extensions.  The capital investment framework continues that commitment.  We will spend more than &euro;3 billion in the next six years investing in our children's future by building new schools and upgrading existing ones.  These new and upgraded buildings will be fit for the 21st century.  The capital plan provides &euro;400 million for the installation of wireless networks in all schools, investment in IT hardware and a programme to replace the remaining prefabs in schools.  Many of the record number of pupils due to complete school in the coming years will inevitably attend college.  We must plan and invest for this as well.  A total of &euro;350 million will be invested in third level infrastructure, including a new &euro;200 million public-private partnership, PPP, investment in the institutes of technology sector.<\/p> <p> As the House will know, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is embarked on a programme of substantial reform.  A critical priority for the Government is to support this process of reform through increased expenditure on Garda information technology.  We want to remove any impediment to the development of a modern, state-of-the-art police force.  To support that goal in the six years to come, we will invest more than &euro;330 million in Garda ICT systems and technologies and &euro;46 million on new and upgraded Garda vehicles.<\/p> <p> The Government is committed to ensuring that our economic infrastructure is available in all regions.  Investment in ICT is critical to our national economy.  Recently, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources agreed the national broadband strategy.  The plan will utilise significant private sector investment and be supported by investment from the Exchequer.  It will ensure that every business and household has access to high-speed broadband to help connect communities, spread growth and support local business.<\/p> <p> Given the pressing need to recommence a house building programme to meet urgent housing needs, additional allocations to support social housing were announced as part of last year's budget.  Through direct Exchequer spending and local government investment, approximately &euro;3 billion will be provided for the social housing strategy.  The Government remains committed to using every available source of funding to address the shortage of social and affordable housing.<\/p> <p> The Government is also aware that we have obligations to behave responsibly not only in respect of fiscal sustainability, which we have proven, but also in terms of environmental sustainability.  We need to protect and maintain our environment and habitats not just for today, but for future generations.  We cannot ignore the impact of climate change and, as a country, we have a responsibility to play our part in reducing reliance on fossil fuels.  We also have legally binding renewable energy targets and &euro;444 million will be spent on energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes during the period of the capital plan.  However, the effects of climate change are already visible in towns and villages across Ireland.  To protect vulnerable communities, the Government has prioritised the introduction of a new flood risk management programme.  By 2021, spending on this programme will have reached &euro;100 million per annum.<\/p> <p> As we approach the centenary of the 1916 Rising, it is appropriate that we complete all planned works on our important heritage sites and provide additional funding for commemoration projects.  Under the capital framework, an additional &euro;31 million will be provided next year for these works.<\/p> <p> A new PPP programme valued at &euro;500 million will be developed in the justice, education and health sectors.  This programme will build on recent successes, utilise the significant level of expertise that we have developed in this area and leverage Ireland's positive position among national and international investors.  To coincide with this PPP programme, the Government will introduce a PPP investment policy framework.  The framework will limit expenditure on PPPs to a stated percentage of annual capital spending and provide transparency and clarity to ensure that the long-term interests of the taxpayer are protected.<\/p> <p> The Government will provide a responsible, affordable and sustainable way forward.  By working together, State and industry will deliver modern, strategic infrastructure that will build on the economic recovery and allow it to continue.  I thank the House for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700046#TT00200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444232400,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late for the Minister's remarks.  He was positively purring when he delivered some of the macroeconomic statistics.  I do not know whether it was a dress rehearsal for next Tuesday.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of issues with the plan.  It should be viewed in the context of a lack of deliverable dates for many of its projects.  This points to a failure to reform the delivery of large-scale projects.  I do not mean this in a party political way, but our public service operates in a silo fashion, with one Department deciding one project while another Department is in charge of the regulations for delivering and planning that project, leading to projects not proceeding.  It could be 11 years before a ticket is sold on the metro north.  If we want to be a modern European economy with a capital city that strives to be one of the best not just in Europe, but in the world, surely we must be able to deliver such a transport system in less than 11 years.<\/p>  <p>  The plan was announced with a great deal of fanfare and publicity, but alongside the announcement we lost the Web Summit.  This was a statement on Dublin's lack of capacity to deliver on large events.  Those behind the Web Summit want to move it around and it is a private company, but we must examine the concerns that were highlighted last year about, for example, Wi-Fi and hotel accommodation, which factor into this plan and its ambitions.<\/p>  <p>  In 2008, before the onset of the crisis, &euro;9 billion per year was invested in capital projects.  While the Minister has acknowledged this, capital expenditure will only have reached approximately half of that level by 2019.  Amid the fanfare and the spin, there are many gaps.  I do not know whether we have weeks or months left in this House.  Does even the Minister know?  Regardless, proper respect for democracy and debate could be shown by having every line committee examine the plan and, within its priorities-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700047#UU00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1444232400,"counter":731,"content":"<p>It is open to them to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700047#UU00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1444232400,"counter":732,"content":"<p>----analyse whether and when X, Y or Z will be delivered.  The civil servants who are in charge of prioritising and not prioritising projects within the plan should appear before each committee to justify that selection.  I do not know whether we can do that in the course of this D&aacute;il.  Perhaps we cannot, in which case it should be the first item on the agenda for the next bunch of committees.  If there is to be a mid-term review of the plan's projects, we need to review the manner in which we deliver the plan.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I noticed that Apple's welcome decision to locate in Athenry had become subject to a planning appeal.  That is normal and is people's right, but it will take An Bord Plean&aacute;la at least six months to decide on the matter.  The board's track record on smaller projects has seen the process extend to nine or 12 months.  We will delay a project that was hard fought for by the good people in IDA Ireland, was located in the regions to everyone's surprise and was badly needed.  It will go into the quagmire of our planning system.  Have we not learned lessons from previous plans?  Surely there should be an overall infrastructural body to take charge of and deliver these plans.  Instead of delay upon delay, we would then get a plan that had dates and delivery targets for specific projects.<\/p>  <p>  This plan contains many projects that were not delivered in the Government's previous plan for various reasons - for example, budgets, or, more importantly, a lack of progress.  Were the Minister a finalist in tonight's \"The Great British Bake Off,\" he would be criticised for reheating what was previously baked and lose marks.  There are an awful lot of soggy bottoms in this plan.  Many of them are due to problems with the Government and its lack of ambition, but others are due to system problems that, if not acted upon, will plague this plan and haunt its delivery in the same way they did with other plans.<\/p><p> The plan's employment statistics are ambitious.  Everyone wants people to work, and I note the plan seeks to create 45,000 construction jobs.  That is fantastic, but does the apprenticeship system have the capacity to back that up?  Were the Minister to allocate money to SOLAS next week to put in place an apprenticeship programme, how would it be able to get up to that capacity quickly to avoid a situation similar to that which pertained in 2001 and 2002, when the construction rates and the tender amount one was obliged to pay to get construction done ate into the value of the projects?  Unless the capacity is available to deliver an apprenticeship programme that is real and relevant to 2015, as opposed to the early 1980s, this plan will not deliver, and it certainly will not deliver 45,000 construction jobs.  There is a cadre of people who have skills that need updating, and they should be targeted through employment programmes.  They should be given access to these jobs, and the people who wish to learn those skills from school or otherwise should now be given a chance.  If this involves the Minister front-loading investment in SOLAS and the institutes of technology to make those programmes available and to produce those skilled people, that should be done, because the labour force then will be available to deliver the plan.<\/p> <p> I will go through some of the projects.  At present, 42% of Ireland's GDP is generated around the environs of this building, in places like Dublin 2 and Dublin 6, and not even in all of Dublin.  When one leaves Dublin's city centre, one encounters serious economic black spots that are not witnessing a recovery, and when one leaves Dublin altogether one encounters serious problems.  One measure of this plan will be its ability to restore that balance and its ability to give the regions a proper say and a proper role in the country's recovery, as well as a proper chance to exploit its opportunities.  However, the plan as laid out does not do this.  A plan that leaves out a link road between two key cities, Cork and Limerick, does not say anything about regional development.  A plan that cuts the budget for the regional broadband scheme that was announced only a few weeks previously does not do much for a regional broadband economy.  As for the road network plan, ironically, my constituency colleague, the Taoiseach, as well as our senior constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, are running to claim credit for the N5, yet the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has stated that he has no direct involvement in the choosing of the roads.  Perhaps the Government needs to get its story right.  However, when one considers that &euro;4.4 billion of &euro;6 billion over the next few years has been allocated to maintenance-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700047#UU00400","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444233000,"counter":734,"content":"<p>Is that not a good thing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700048#VV00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1444233000,"counter":735,"content":"<p>-----it leaves little scope for new regional maintenance and regional development projects.

Serious flood issues arose in Cork in 2010 that are the subject of court cases at present, but there has not yet been much investment in flood management in Cork.  While some good work has been done in rural areas, there is much more to do, and the planning is taking a long time.  I am aware of this from experience in my native county, where a flood issue arose in Crossmolina in 2007 that only now is being resolved in 2015, which I welcome as part of this plan.  In my home town of Ballina, a serious flood issue has not been included in this plan because the Office of Public Works has not got around to drawing up its local flood management plans as yet.<\/p><p>On the mid-term review, I stated earlier that the Minister was purring about the fiscal position.  However, the Minister must focus his Department on the public service reform side of things and on the system's ability to deliver on a plan such as this.

In 2008, capital expenditure reached its peak at &euro;9 billion, and by the time the Minister came into government in 2011, capital expenditure was at &euro;4.5 billion.  Over the term of the present Government it fell steadily, reaching &euro;3.3 billion in 2014.

Most people would regard this plan as part of the choreography of general elections.  Famously, under the previous Government, the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, flanked by John Gormley of the Green Party, announced a massive spending plan to the tune of &euro;40 billion.  Does the Minister remember that?  Of course it never happened; it was notional and aspirational, much as is this document.

We should avail of the opportunity to do that.<\/p> <p> As my time is limited, I want to zero in on one proposition the Minister has made.  It is on page 31 under the heading of health care.  In it, he sets out a reconfiguration of the investment in maternity services, which is long overdue.  He plans to move the Rotunda Hospital out to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown.  I would like the Minister to provide the cost-benefit analysis and position papers that informed that particular decision.  I wonder if such documentation exists.  Anybody who knows this particular hospital, which has been crying out for investment for a long time, would know that its medical referral relationship has always been with the Mater hospital.  Those of us who know the area - I suspect the Minister himself also knows it - are aware that there is a site adjacent to the Mater hospital which had been earmarked for the children's hospital.  The Minister will remember that and he will also know that considerable amounts of taxpayers' moneys were invested - some may argue wasted - in the preparation of that site.  <\/p> <p> People who have attended or worked in the Rotunda Hospital cannot understand this decision to move it to Blanchardstown.  Why on earth would one do that and disrupt those medical relationships, while leaving that site idle?  For the purposes of this specific initiative, I would like to see all of the considerations and analyses, including a cost-benefit analysis, that informed a decision to move this maternity hospital to Blanchardstown, which is the constituency both of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton.<\/p> <p> I have raised that specific issue, but each of the other initiatives contained in the report need to be subjected to that kind of analysis in terms of expenditure, the efficacy of the spend, and the process the Minister went through to produce this document.

There would appear to be a lack of investment in child care, given the public outcry for better facilities and access in this regard.  The sum of &euro;11 million a year in early years and youth projects is a pittance when looked at from an outside perspective and demonstrates a lack of will to invest in the youth of today, especially considering that a large percentage of that allocation is to be put towards the child detention facility in Oberstown.<\/p>  <p>  From meeting a number of my constituents in east Cork, along with a number of stakeholders, we are all in agreement that early intervention is the way forward.  A proactive approach is needed, rather than the reactive one which this Government seems to support.<\/p>  <p>  Substantial investment is needed in the youth work sector.  The work that these people carry out is invaluable and they need to be supported in their endeavours.  Most of these workers get by with limited resources on a daily basis and still produce results when their hands are effectively tied.  They work out of shoddy offices or no offices at all, working directly with the most marginalised and vulnerable young people in the country.  With the funding the Minister has outlined to be allocated, how does he propose that these services are ever to become more effective in what is an already hugely strained sector?<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's investment in Tusla, although I believe it falls somewhat short of what is required.  Massive resources need to be freed up in order to allow social workers to do the already taxing and difficult work they carry out.  The children to social workers ratio is well and above recommended levels.  In practical terms, this allows social workers to meet with their assigned cases on an infrequent basis and can adversely lead to a breakdown of what was a workable relationship.  The reality of what is needed seems to be alien and although these issues are acknowledged in this House time and time again, nothing much ever seems to change.  A detachment from reality appears to be consistent across the board and is an all too recurring theme.  Access visits between families tend to be conducted in these overworked office spaces, so money should be allocated to provide facilities that are welcoming and which allow these families to meet in a safe and comfortable environment, rather than in a dull and dreary office.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that within the Minister's allocated finances, from whatever little will be left, moneys will be ring-fenced to support family resource centres.  These centres also do great work in marginalised and disadvantaged areas, but they are struggling at both national and local level.  They are grossly understaffed and unable to accommodate and support families that find themselves in situations of consistent poverty.  Unfortunately, these numbers are still rising due to the policies prioritised by the Government.  There is a significant need for investment in these areas to allow staff to have space to provide for these young people and families.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;136 million being invested in our country's children is merely a token gesture over the course of the five years.  It is quite simply a drop in the ocean when analysed and broken down.  If the Government is truly serious about child care infrastructure and the aspirations towards a Scandinavian model, why allocate so little?  Instead of cutting tax, adequate capital investment should be made available if we are to move forward and fix this in a way that is both sustainable and of benefit to working parents, or those who are hampered in returning to work due to astronomical costs.<\/p>  <p>  Refugees are set to enter our country before Christmas.  Minimal amounts appear to be allocated to address this matter, including services, their accommodation and other infrastructure.  I have major concerns surrounding these areas also and especially the treatment of children who will be entering the country.  These children are coming from war-torn countries, often having travelled for weeks on end, all of which could only leave these children with a mass of traumatic experiences.  How are we going to cope with these children who need help to overcome their traumatic experiences when we are currently so under-resourced in this sector?  More needs to be done in this regard and I call on the Government to revisit seriously and analyse a document that seems to have been compiled with disregard to the reality of ground-level services and amenities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700049#WW00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1444233600,"counter":750,"content":"<p>The capital investment plan introduced by the Government over a week ago, amid much inflated hype, earmarks &euro;27 billion toward a number of areas, including transport and housing, over a six-year period.  The plan is plush with style and grand statements, but when we search for the substance and detail there is little to be found.<\/p>  <p>  As we draw ever closer to the end of 2015, the spectre of an election looms large, and I have little doubt as to the extent of its influence.  For all the contrived statements and press calls, the Government must remember that these issues affect every person in this country.  The people are not just an electorate to be courted, but citizens to which these plans must be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Housing is grossly under addressed in the Minister's document.  It takes up just over one page, the majority of which repeats details of another document, the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  According to the capital plan, and I quote directly from the text, \"The Government believes that everyone should have access to good quality housing suited to their needs at an affordable price and in a sustainable community\".  Why then has this Government failed comprehensively to tackle the housing emergency in a decisive manner?  Through the capital plan the Government aims put &euro;3 billion towards the Social Housing Strategy 2020, under which the Minister claims he will deliver up to 35,000 units, with an implication that he might not deliver on the full 35,000.  It is clear that most of that 35,000 will be delivered from the private sector and will be directed towards the RAS, rent supplement and HAP schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  At current estimates, we reed over 20,000 houses a year to meet demand.  I remind the Government that between 2008 and 2014, State spending on housing fell by &euro;1.6 billion.  It started with the previous government and finished with the current one.  In 2013, approximately 750 units were built by local authorities and AHBs, with a further 1,200 delivered through leasing arrangements.  We are in a crisis and this situation has reached a fundamentally critical stage for far too many people across the country.  The Government spinning a skeletal plan in the context of an election does nothing to improve the situation.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding transport, we broadly welcome the much-needed investment in the road network, including the &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for road maintenance and upgrades.<\/p><p>However, we have concerns about the lack of costings in the capital plan.  A total of &euro;1.6 billion is to be spent on new road projects.  The Minister listed a broad range throughout the country, almost one for every area.<\/p> <p> The metro north rail project is essential for a European capital city like Dublin.  In principle, we welcome plans to proceed with its development.  Plans for a metro in Dublin go all the way back to 2001, when the report entitled A Platform for Change, produced by the Dublin Transportation Office, proposed two metro lines, metro north and metro west.  In 2006 the Railway Procurement Agency drew up plans for three potential routes.  However, it was March 2007 before RPA started the procurement process, and it was not until 2009 that potential bidders were short-listed.  The consideration of other potential projects such as metro north and the DART underground, as well as issues in finalising the route selection, resulted in the deferral of any metro plan for Dublin.  Today, 14 years after the idea was originally proposed, the Government has earmarked funding, and construction of the metro north will start in 2021.  The project is due for completion in 2026 or 2027.  Given the 15-year wait for any real progress, it is difficult to envisage the Government delivering a metro even within this elongated timeline, particularly if the consultation process is to be revisited.  I wish to remind the House that &euro;170 million has been spent on the metro north already.<\/p> <p> It is also disappointing that the A5 has been all but written off in the Government plans.  So much for cross-Border projects and co-operation.<\/p> <p> Our success in public private partnerships is not impressive, and this calls into question the &euro;300 million announced by the Government in housing.  We have seen many projects collapse over the years, and PPPs have always been a major problem.<\/p> <p> Throughout the tenure of this Government, investment in housing and transport has suffered.  Between 2012 and 2014, the capital budget for transport amounted to &euro;3.4 billion.  I have no doubt those in the Government will congratulate themselves on forward planning, but delivery is the essential component.  Otherwise, this plan can be considered little more than electioneering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700049#WW00300","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444234200,"counter":752,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot will be shared by Deputies Paul Murphy, Michael Fitzmaurice and Richard Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700050#XX00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1444234200,"counter":753,"content":"<p>When I first read the capital plan it reminded me of the film \"This is Spinal Tap\" in which they talk about the turning the volume up to 11.  This time the Government has announced a capital plan that is six years long instead of the normal five years.  This allowed the Government to announce &euro;27 billion instead of something less than &euro;22 billion.<\/p>  <p>  If the purpose of the plan is pre-election propaganda, it may or may not be successful.  If the purpose of the plan is to deal with the historically low levels of public and private investment in the economy, then the plan is utterly inadequate.  Let us start with the headline figures.  Twenty-seven billion euro sounds like a great deal of money, until we compare it to historical long-term average figures for public investment.  The historical long-term average figure for public investment in the State is 3.5% of GDP.  In 2015 the figure stands at 1.8% of GDP, and with this new magic plan it will be 1.9% of GDP.  In money terms, this means the plan represents an increase in public spending next year of &euro;200 million and, in the following years of the plan, increases of &euro;250 million.  This is in the context of the Government's plan to cut taxes in the next budget to the tune of &euro;750 million, tax cuts that will skew towards higher earners.  The context is private sector investment remaining down by 35% compared to pre-crisis levels and public sector investment having been absolutely slashed.  Those are the headline figures<\/p>  <p>  When we examine it in more detail, the situation is even worse.  Let us consider the phasing of the money.  The money is back-loaded - that is to say, more money is spent later on down the road, when the Government may or may not be in power, rather than now.  We simply do not know if the Government will be in power next year, never mind six years from now, by which time these big promises of public spending and investment may have been forgotten.  In 2016 we will start with &euro;3.8 billion, and this will rise in 2021 to &euro;5.4 billion.  This is utterly cynical and makes no economic sense at a time when interest rates are at an all-time low and the State could borrow at this stage to invest.  It would be better to invest now in improving our infrastructure and to front-load that investment.  The only reason to do it the other way around is cynical electioneering.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the plan in more detail.  There is no new money for housing, despite the emergency - only &euro;3 billion or &euro;500 million per year.  Let us consider the categories of investment.  More investment is going to areas that are connected to corporate welfare for some big businesses, rather than going into health, education, climate change and housing.  The total going on enterprise or corporate welfare is &euro;4.3 billion.  Let us consider how money will be spent within the spending categories.  Out of the &euro;10 billion being spent on transport, including public private partnerships, more than &euro;6 billion is going on roads and less than &euro;4 billion on public transport.  Let us compare that to &euro;874 million on climate change, &euro;430 million of which is going towards adapting to climate change by building flood defences rather than actually trying to stop it.  The Government is also planning to invest as much in defence as on climate change.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the role of public private partnerships.  Some &euro;500 million will be spent on new PPP funding, stood over by the Labour Party, in what is a scheme that costs the public more money.  It is a more expensive way to deliver infrastructure and is basically about the public sector subsidising private profit.  This is not what we need.  In fact, it is the opposite of what we need.  We need major public investment to deal with all the social problems that exist in our society and create the basis for a sustainable recovery.  A key basis for a sustainable recovery will be increased levels of investment in our society.  The collapse in investment - between 66% and 70% of private sector investment - was a key driving factor in the dragging down of the economy over an extended period.  It is also the only way we will deal with the social problems that exist.  For example, the Anti-Austerity Alliance will launch its budget statement in the coming days.  The centrepiece of the document is the idea of major public investment to deal with the housing crisis.  We estimate that for &euro;10 billion of additional public investment, spread over three years - that is, a little less than &euro;3.5 billion per year - we could build 100,000 homes and effectively clear the housing waiting list, together with the use of vacant properties and the resources of NAMA.  In addition, we believe there is a need for further public investment based on creating decent jobs.  One estimate suggests that an investment stimulus of &euro;1 billion for one year would create approximately 16,750 jobs.  That would represent a net cost of &euro;575 million owing to greater tax revenues as a result of higher GDP.  For example, for &euro;2.3 billion we could have 15,000 workers in a major public works programme to replace non-compliant water mains throughout the State, or 10,000 child care workers in publicly owned cr&egrave;ches, or 5,000 special needs assistants, or 10,000 workers to develop Ireland's wind and wave energy to its potential.<\/p>  <p>  The problem in the State is not too much public investment but too little, particularly in the context of the crisis in the private sector.  This document does nothing to reverse the trend.  In fact, it continues a level of stagnation in public investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700050#XX00300","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1444234200,"counter":754,"content":"<p>When I heard the announcement of the capital plan and the amount of money involved, I was intrigued.  I said to myself that perhaps the devil would be in the detail.  Then I heard road jobs being announced and the announcement of the road from Tuam to Gort.  I recalled that the work was nearly done, yet the project was announced again.  I heard the plans for Moycullen being announced.  I was out there recently and that project is very close to being done as well.  I am not sure what the reason is for announcing some things several times.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the budget for road construction is for maintenance.  While I realise that roads need maintenance, the Government failed to take a great opportunity.  In 2011 the Government decided to take the west of Ireland out of the TEN-T project.  That could have resulted in funding of between 30% and 40% from the European Union, basically free, for core infrastructural projects between two countries.  This is a missed opportunity.<\/p><p>We see where it has been landed, from Limerick to Dublin to Newry and from Cork to Dublin to Newry, and we wonder why.  Most of the clout must be hitting that way.<\/p> <p> It is welcome that funding of &euro;450 million for nursing homes and the disabled was announced, but the sad reality is that we have asked what is being done a few times and no detail has been given.  We hear every Deputy in the House talk about the need for social housing.  It has been neglected down through the years.  The effort that has been made this year in the counties I represent has been abysmal.  We were given figures on what would be done in the last budget and were told billions would be spent.  However, all we had were photo sessions with builders' hats on our heads and announcements about houses that were never built.<\/p> <p> I spoke last week about the &euro;9 billion the credit unions had to help the Government if social housing was required.  In a time of need, the credit unions are willing to talk to the Government, but the Government does not seem to want to do so.  It can borrow money elsewhere, but it must remember that every bit of interest it pays on moneys borrowed from groups such as the credit unions will be spent in our country, rather than going to a vulture fund or speculator living in another country trying to make money on the backs of the Irish people.  <\/p> <p> The children's hospital was announced for the fifth or sixth time.  A spade has not yet been put into the ground.  A previous Deputy referred to other hospital services being put out to Blanchardstown.  I do not think anybody thought of people in the north, south, east and west of the country who travel with sick children.  It would have been better to keep the hospital nearer to the M50.  I travelled from the roundabout on the M50 today and the traffic was chaotic for the entire journey.  A person from Cork, Limerick, Donegal, Sligo, Galway or Mayo travelling to St. James's Hospital will find the journey chaotic after travelling for two or three hours.  Joined-up thinking is required.  Mistakes have been made.  At one stage the hospital was to be located in the middle of town and then it was supposed to be in St. James's Hospital.  The children's hospital is supposed to be for all the children in the country.  We need to make sure that we rethink the project.<\/p> <p> Successive Governments have promised much and delivered little in terms of broadband.  We have abysmal broadband.  Everyone says the regions will be helped, but they cannot be helped if they do not have broadband.  A broadband package has been announced.  I attended a committee today and found out it will be next summer before we get the go-ahead from our masters in Europe to start the project.  Rural parts of Ireland need infrastructure, including roads, which is why I have referred to the likes of the TEN-T project.  If we want to make sure that we boost tourism in, for the sake of argument, the west of Ireland, and bring in manufacturing jobs, we will need core infrastructural projects.  That means broadband and roads.<\/p> <p> The IDA needs to get its act together and make sure that every announcement does not revolve around the financial centre or similar areas.  While we welcome jobs in any part of the country, we need them in other parts of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700050#XX00400","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444234800,"counter":756,"content":"<p>The Government seems to specialise in big and bold, but deceptive, headline announcements when it comes to spending.  The latest example of this is the big, bold headline of &euro;27 billion to be spent between now and 2021.  Of course, why not have a 20-year plan with an even larger figure, or a 30-year or 50-year plan involving hundreds of billions of euro?  It is completely deceptive because it does not tell us how it compares with capital investment when the level of capital investment was at a reasonable level prior to the crash, after which it collapsed.  If one makes that comparison, one finds we still are nowhere near the level of public capital investment we had when there was a relatively reasonable public investment plan.  Even then it was insufficient, to my mind.<\/p>  <p>  At its height, there was public investment of about &euro;9 billion a year.  Broken down on a year-by-year basis, the Government's proposal is a fraction of that.  As we know, there was chronic under-investment in water infrastructure and social housing, even at the height of the boom when we had lots of money.  I could refer to many other areas, such as the chronic under-investment in public transport, even when the money was available to us.  <\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned forestry in the House many times.  It is pathetic that the State forestry company cannot engage in afforestation even though we know the economic, social and cultural benefits that would derive from a serious public investment programme in forestry.  None of that happened, even when we were spending twice or three times what has been proposed in this plan.<\/p>  <p>  If one rolls up the figures of public investment over a long period of time, as this announcement does, it sounds great.  However, when one breaks it down, one finds it is pathetic.  It is well below the levels of public investment we had previously and, quite worryingly, it suggests that even by 2021 we will not have overcome the massive deficit that we now have in public capital investment arising from the crash and the austerity that has been imposed.  We will still be well below the levels of public investment that we had prior to the crash, which is a very depressing picture of capital investment plans.<\/p>  <p>  I will not discuss all of these areas; rather, I will discuss one in particular in the short time available, namely, housing.  We have the rehash of announcements that have been made, whereby the figure of &euro;3 billion has been extended by one year to add a few extra hundred million to it.  The vast bulk of this is not real capital spending at all, because about 75% to 80% of the &euro;3 billion support for the housing strategy will go to private landlords under the HAP scheme, which will not deliver.  That is not just a prediction, because it has not delivered this year.  The delivery promised was 8,400 new units under the HAP scheme, but I understand less than half that number have been delivered.  I am not absolutely clear on the figures for the end of the year, but they are not anywhere near what we were promised.  We know the figures will not be delivered because landlords are running away from arrangements with local authorities and have no intention of providing social housing when they can charge astronomical levels of rent in the private market.  Why the hell would they?  The plan is completely flawed and deceptive in the case of housing because it is not real public investment in building council housing, which would actually provide us with housing stock to deal with the housing crisis.  It is a guaranteed recipe that the housing crisis will continue to get worse, notwithstanding big, bold announcements and large-sounding figures.  The plan completely fails to deal with this emergency situation.  If it cannot deal with an emergency, how can we give any credibility to the rest of the plan as actually delivering anything serious in terms of the massive injection of public capital investment we need to get the economy back on the rails?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700051#YY00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1444235400,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words, and I want to take up a point made by the previous speaker: his criticism of the lack of ambition in the capital programme.  The ambition in the capital programme must be related to the relative position of the public finances.  It is true to say the public finances have improved, but we are certainly not out of the woods.  We still spend &euro;5 billion more than we earn on an annual basis.  If we continue to improve the public finances through prudent management it may be possible to add some additional projects in a mid-term review.  There is no shortage of items for the shopping list that all of us in the House would like to see included.  There are things I would love to have seen in the capital programme that are not in it, but it is grounded in reality related to the relative position of the public finances, and this is something we must bear in mind.  It must be remembered this is borrowed money we are investing in critical public infrastructure. The list has been mentioned and includes housing, roads, broadband and hospitals.  It is worth bearing in mind that when we came into office we could not borrow money in the marketplace because the interest rates were in excess of 15%.  Now we can borrow money at the same interest rate as countries such as the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. This is because we are considered to be a good bet by people who lend us the money, as they think they will get it back.  Perhaps if we continue to prudently manage the public finances, other items can be added in the a mid-term review.<\/p>  <p>  I want to deal with a couple of issues which are in the capital programme, including the road from the county boundary in my constituency to a point east of Macroom, the Ballyvourney-Macroom N22 improvement.  The cost-benefit analysis associated with this is one of the highest for any national road project.  It is included in the five-year capital programme, and the critical issue is to get this project to a stage at which construction can begin.  It is a long construction process and will take a number of years.  We need to get it to a stage at which construction can begin as quickly as possible.  The merits of the project speak for themselves.  Regrettably, there have been accidents involving pedestrians and cars, including some fatalities.  The economic benefit not only to Macroom and its hinterland but to the entire south-west region is inextricably tied up with the project, and I welcome its inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  I share the views expressed by Deputy Fitzmaurice on broadband.  I do not claim to be an expert on the technology, but as a representative of a rural constituency I have found that when one contacts eir, which we must remember is now a private company, and asks it to make an exchange broadband-enabled, unless it is on Patrick Street or the main street of the big town it is not interested.  Of the &euro;275 million included for broadband, which is as critical now to modern-day living as running water or rural electrification was many years ago, would it be possible, without compromising the national broadband plan, to direct some of this funding towards making a host of eir exchanges throughout the country broadband-enabled?  The lessons we can learn retrospectively about how Eircom was privatised are myriad, but we must look forward rather than backwards, and perhaps this is something we could look at with a view to improving the service for many thousands of people the length and breadth of the country.  Unfortunately, we will be waiting for the main players to arrive at a crossroads to deliver broadband.  A consultation process on the national broadband scheme is ongoing, but we need something immediate.  I do not know the cost of making the remaining eir exchanges broadband-enabled, so to some extent I am speaking in a vacuum, but I would like it be investigated.  It would help improve the service for many people who do not have an acceptable level of service.<\/p>  <p>  I want to speak about education, as &euro;3.8 billion is available for investment in primary, secondary and third-level school buildings and universities.  It is a great tribute to the Government that at a time of significant challenges in the public finances and a baby boom we were able over recent years to ensure every child had access to classroom space.  Many school buildings are long overdue renewal.  In particular I want to mention two schools which I hope will be included in the capital projects.  One is De La Salle College in Macroom, which is looking for a new school with an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, element in it.  Investment has been made in a number of ASD units at primary level in the region, but these children are moving through the education system and it is incumbent on all of us to ensure adequate facilities are available at local level.  Unfortunately, at present, many of these children travel 20 or 30 miles to the nearest facility, and it would be appropriate, having availed of ASD units in many of the schools around Macroom, that they have an opportunity to progress to second level with a local ASD unit attached to a new De La Salle College in Macroom.  The other school I want to mention - I am conscious that my time is practically up and I do not want to delay Deputy Breen, who I am sure has words of wisdom - is Clondrohid national school.  It has multiple prefabricated classrooms and a number of ASD units, including an new temporary ASD classroom for next September.  A new school was originally announced by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin back in 1997 when he was Minister, but it still has not happened.  The centenary celebrations were in 1996 and the then Minister, Deputy Martin, came down in 1997 and promised a new school, but it still has not been delivered.  We need to look forwards, not backwards.  Will the Minister for Education and Skills take these two specific schools into account in terms of the capital programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700052#ZZ00100","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1444235400,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.  Over the past four years, the Government has made significant progress in transforming the economy from the basket case of Europe to the fastest-growing economy in Europe.  Maintaining fiscal prudence and stability is critical to the ongoing recovery as we emerge from the recession.  This is why the plan is important.  It is based on what we can deliver, as other Government speakers have said.  We certainly do not want to make the mistakes we made in the past again.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Creed and previous speakers spoke about broadband.  Broadband is one of the most important issues facing the country and needs to be delivered to every part of the country.  I hope the investment put into broadband will deliver, because it is the future for rural Ireland.  We talk about sustaining rural Ireland.  The only thing that will sustain rural Ireland is broadband, so that people can work at home in their houses.  The other day I heard an auctioneer say the first thing asked by a person who wants to buy a house in the country is whether the area has a broadband service.  If there is broadband people will work from home.  They will buy houses in the country.  It is obviously important for people to live in the country.  Their children will go to school.  It is critical that we invest in broadband and I hope we have high-speed broadband in every part of Ireland by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Transport is an important part of the plan, and it is important to know there is much work ongoing.  In the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency, the N17-N18 Tuam-Gort bypass is making huge and fast progress, and it will open up the entire west of Ireland.  It is also creating many jobs at present, and this is extremely important.  Most economists who have spoken about the plan have said it will deliver and that it is unlike other plans, particularly the previous Government's plans, with Bertie bowls and things we could not afford.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Creed said, &euro;3.8 billion will be invested in education, and I welcome the fact that two schools in Ennis have been included.  These are the Christian Brothers national school and Scoil Chr&iacute;ost R&iacute; in Cloughleigh.  I hope that Sixmilebridge national school can also be included.  Huge money has been invested in schools, and this is important.<\/p>  <p>  More money is going into health care.  Limerick Regional Maternity Hospital is being transferred to the University Hospital Limerick, which is an important factor because experts throughout the world believe it is important to have the two hospitals alongside each other.<\/p><p> Today, in my own constituency, over &euro;1.4 million has been allocated by the Office of Public Works to Clare County Council for agricultural land embankments, etc., damaged during the flooding and storms in 2014.  That is a significant amount of money going into west Clare.  Never before has that kind of money been put into embankments and coastal protection measures for agricultural land by a Government.<\/p> <p> There is much happening.  I have mentioned the health services.  There is also the Shannon bridge crossing at Killaloe, which is most welcome.  Killaloe has a strong reputation as a tourist town and the current bridge is unable to handle the high volume of traffic going over the bridge to Ballina.  The construction of a new crossing will be a major boost for east Clare and particularly for the tourism sector.  I hope it will come about as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> There is much in this plan, and significant investment has been put into hospitals in Clare, including Regina House in Kilrush and Ennistymon community hospital.  The Minister will be down on 19 October to lay the foundation stone for phase two at Raheen hospital.  The whole of society will benefit from this plan.  From an education perspective, new facilities will be provided at primary, secondary and third levels.  There will be improved road infrastructure in the country, although there is one project that is not in the plan, which disappoints me - the motorway from Limerick to Cork, which would have completed the loop and linked all of our cities.  I hope there might be a change of heart and the project could be included in the plan.  It would be very important for the mid-west and south of Ireland.  Nevertheless, this is a good plan and, as I mentioned, most economists have welcomed it because they see the possibility of its completion.  I have no doubt that the country will be much better off as a result of this.  Jobs will be created in the construction phases of the plan.  It is realistic, affordable and prioritises what is really needed in our road, rail, health, education and broadband infrastructures.  It will make a difference to many communities across the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700052#ZZ00200","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444236000,"counter":760,"content":"<p>Like previous speakers, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the debate on the capital development programme announced last week.  It is a short window in which to speak, but in the main I hope to address the issues for which I have responsibility as Opposition spokesperson on the environment and, specifically, Irish Water and the housing elements.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome a development plan such as this, which seeks to prioritise capital investment in our infrastructure for the next five years.  One must acknowledge the fact that we are able to do so again and that the Government has completed the necessary one third of the overall adjustment required to stabilise our finances.  In parallel to that, a strong dollar and sterling, along with the stabilisation of our wage structure and costs, have assisted our exports and would have helped job creation.  Nevertheless, people say on a regular basis that they do not feel or see the recovery and that it appears to be centred in Dublin and the east coast.  That is very obvious to many of us, and there should have been a concerted effort in this plan to address that imbalance.  I am not sure that has happened.<\/p>  <p>  A point was made relating to education.  It is amazing that when an election is being spoken about, this Government talks about the great restraint it has shown and the lessons it has learned from the past, yet we see a headline with a quote attributed to the Minister for Finance promising iPads for all school children throughout the country.  That is in a time when pupil-teacher ratios need to be adjusted and pressure is being exerted on special needs assistants, capitation grants and small rural schools with two, three or four teachers.  There are many issues that must be addressed in education before we go down the road of keeping children's heads in screens all day long.  There is much more to education than that, although it is necessary to have broadband and communications support available for education and homes.  As previous speakers have indicated, it is an aspect of life that is similar to many other services, and it is only right and proper that there should be a greater effort to make broadband available throughout the country and in rural areas in particular.  I hope that pushing this out to 2020 will not be a cop-out and there can be more of a targeted effort to address that imbalance.<\/p>  <p>  I have questions relating to my area of responsibility, as I mentioned.  Irish Water is mentioned within the capital development plan, with &euro;3.8 billion to &euro;4 billion spent in the area over the next seven years, inclusive of this year.  Today, Irish Water issued a plan for the next seven years to 2021, inclusive of this year, in which it indicates that &euro;5.5 billion will be spent.  As is usual with every announcement emanating from Irish Water, or from the Government on behalf of or relating to Irish Water, I am puzzled but not surprised.  The EUROSTAT tests demonstrated that the model created by the Government, along with the methods behind it, have not stacked up.  As much as the Government wanted this off-balance-sheet, it remains firmly on the balance sheet.  The costs associated with Irish Water remain firmly in the hands of the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  There is a hole in the figures, with up to &euro;1.7 billion unaccounted for.  This year, for example, &euro;75 million is to be paid in water grants, and there will be &euro;20 million in administration costs and another &euro;40 million for metering.  There will be a loss this year, but Irish Water indicated today that it will have &euro;2 billion in residential charge income over the next six years.  It is just not possible.  The company's figures are based on an 80% compliance rate, but even with that rate it is not possible.  Irish Water intends to borrow based on the income stream it has, meaning it will pay far in excess of what the Government and the National Treasury Management Agency are borrowing.  The only way to close the gap is to increase residential water charges.  It is high time somebody came clean on this sorry mess or eventually realised that the company is going nowhere, so the exercise needs to be brought to a halt and started again.  Irish Water will continue to throw good money after bad at the expense of the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  Despite what we hear in today's spin, less is being spent on the maintenance and servicing of our network this year than was spent in the years of the previous Government.  Irish Water would have us believe that it will spend &euro;660 million per year over the next six years, based on figures that do not stack up and without acknowledging administration and salary costs and commitments in various contracts.  The company will continue to spend less than the amount spent by the previous Administration under a different regime.  This is against a backdrop of an assumption that 1,200 workers will be taken out of Irish Water.  Those workers will be taken from the pool of people who were doing the work even before Irish Water came into being.  The consultants and those in the higher tiers of management will remain, along with associated bonuses.  The company made a so-called commitment to former local authority staff with the service level agreement to 2025, but they are now to be discarded.  It is time somebody came clean about this, and perhaps this debate offers an opportunity for the Government to tell us about the gap in the figures and how Irish Water intends to fill it.<\/p><p>From my perspective, the Government intends to fill it from people's pockets, whether in the form of general taxation, extra taxation, increased water charges or increased cost to the taxpayer because of the high interest rates they are paying on their borrowings.<\/p> <p> The other point I want to make about housing is that we have had three separate announcements of the housing construction programme: last November, last March and again last week, down in Heuston Station.  They have not built three houses in my county, but they have had three launches of this massive development programme.  Then they tagged on another &euro;400 million and put an extra year on it.  That is because the commitments they made last November for this year have not been met and the money has not been spent, so it is easy to throw it on the back of this plan.<\/p> <p> The Government has not delivered on any commitment in respect of the emergency in the housing sector.  There has been talk of emergency legislation to fast-track planning in respect of any proposals that are brought forward to meet the current emergency.  Another week has gone by with no legislation.  The Whips have been meeting and there is no talk of any legislation next week.  One begins to wonder whether the Government is going to rush to the country because it cannot meet some of the commitments it has made in recent weeks and is afraid of being exposed on that.<\/p> <p> Another issue, as I said in the course of debate on this issue in recent weeks, is vacant units and the myth that the Minister and the Taoiseach created by saying money is not an issue in respect of the funding required to put them back in use.  That has been contradicted fervently by officials I have spoken to in local authorities.  I will use this opportunity to place that contradiction on the record and will ask some member of Government to respond accordingly.<\/p> <p> The Government has also rubbished figures that have emanated from local authorities in respect of the actual numbers on the waiting list and the number of vacant units throughout the country.  To continually ballyrag those people is not addressing the issue at hand, which is what people want.  They want to hear the issues at hand acknowledged, appreciated and addressed in real and meaningful ways.  That is the immediacy of the problem we find there and into the short and long term, as provided for in this capital spending plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700053#AAA00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444236600,"counter":762,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is shared by the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, and Deputy Tony McLoughlin.

As the Minister said, the Government is revising upwards its capital expenditure commitment for the remainder of the decade, and this capital report presents a new &euro;42 billion multi-annual capital investment programme.  Over the period 2016 to 2021, the planned investments will cement economic recovery and help to lay the foundations for continued growth and broad-based prosperity for the next decade and beyond.  It is very important to have a clear-cut plan, as we now have.<\/p><p>I would like to point out some elements of this plan, including the commitment in the plan of &euro;7.5 million for the Kerry sports academy, which is planned for the Institute of Technology in Tralee.  Deputy Spring has a similar interest in this project.  The Institute of Technology in Tralee is a key driver of economic and social development for County Kerry.  It was established in 1977, approved by the then Fine Gael Minister for education, Peter Barry.  It has more than 3,000 full-time students, employs 350 staff and provides a financial contribution of about &euro;60 million to the local authority.  In March 2014 the institute established a foundation to assist with fundraising for future developments, with the priority project being the Kerry sports academy.  The director of the fundraising initiative was a former colleague of mine,<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>Ogie Moran.  We played together for a number of years.  He has shown tremendous leadership in ensuring that this project will go ahead.  The foundation also comprises people such as Dick Spring, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs; Stan McCarthy, CEO of the Kerry Group; Pat O'Leary of Liebherr Container Cranes; M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh; Oliver Murphy; and<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>Br&iacute;d McElligott.  It is a very powerful group of people.  As we know, the institute has an esteemed international reputation for leadership in inclusion and adapted physical activity and is the only higher education provider globally to be awarded a UNESCO chair.  This is testimony to the excellence of the institute's work in including people with disabilities in physical education, sport fitness and recreation.  The sports academy is the next capital project to be undertaken under the institute's master development plan.  It will allow sportspersons, able and disabled, to enjoy, prepare and compete to the highest standards.  The foundation is confident, now that it has been granted 50% funding for the project, that it will be able to raise the remainder of the funds.  To date, it has secured about &euro;5 million, of which &euro;1 million is from the institute, &euro;1 million from the GAA, &euro;1 million from the J.P. McManus Benevolent Fund, &euro;1 million from private donations and &euro;650,000 from Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.  Hopefully this project will start in the very near future, and but for this programme it would not have got off the ground.<\/p><p>The other project to which I would like to refer briefly is the N22 and its importance to both Kerry and Cork, particularly south Kerry.  The business and tourist communities in the south west are very dependent on it for connectivity with Cork and beyond.  The Ballyvourney to Macroom section of the N22 is in very poor condition, and is widely recognised as needing immediate improvement.  The National Roads Authority and Cork County Council have recognised this, and have successfully taken an improvement scheme through An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as well as other measures.  I hope, now that it is included in the capital investment programme, that work will commence as soon as possible.  All the necessary statutory approvals are in place, compulsory purchase orders have been put on the land, and advance work such as archaeology has been carried out.  This could readily be developed under a public private partnership, for example, because it is shovel-ready and would not require any great level of up-front State funding.<\/p><p>Before I hand over to Deputy McLoughlin, I must mention that there is a commitment of &euro;275 million for national broadband roll-out.  One of the major disadvantages in County Kerry is the absence of high-quality broadband.  There is broadband available, but it does not have the same speed and bandwidth as Dublin and other centres of population.  We are finding it increasingly difficult to attract industry to Kerry because of the lack of high-quality broadband.  It is something we have to improve.  Eir has proposals, as does Vodafone with SIRO, but we need to see action as soon as possible.  With this provision and the new national broadband programme, I hope it will be rolled out.<\/p><p>There is also &euro;430 million in flood risk management.  I was very disappointed that the Cashen River was not included, because the Minister has visited it and seen for himself how the system has broken down there.  Because of silting, the measures put in place in the early 1950s are no longer effective, resulting in large-scale flooding, with thousands of acres of land being flooded and over 600 homes threatened.  I hope this river can be included in the programme in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700054#BBB00300","speaker":"1046"}]
