I am raising the issue of the need for chefs to be added to the critical skills employment permit list.  The issue of the shortage of skilled labour in the hospitality sector, and of chefs in particular, has been deemed critical by the hospitality industry.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland, RAI, estimates that more than 5,000 chefs will be required by 2018 to fill vacancies and to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the hospitality sector in general.<\/p> <p>While new apprenticeships have had some impact in alleviating the current situation, it is my understanding that they are not sufficient to meet current demand in the short to medium term.  In fact, it is estimated that it will be three to four years before the new apprenticeship and mentoring initiatives which are coming on stream will have any impact at all on the current situation.  The only short or medium-term solution to this crisis therefore is for the hospitality sector to partner with chef training colleges worldwide to attract qualified chefs to Ireland.  The main obstacle to this, however, is the issue of obtaining work permits for student chefs and qualified chefs.  As it stands, chefs are not on the list of occupations which are eligible for a permit on the list maintained by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, with the exception of executive chefs, head chefs, sous chefs and specialist chefs earning in excess of &euro;30,000 per year.  This, of course, rules out any hope of restaurant owners recruiting student chefs from abroad to get around the shortage of potential employees in this country.  <\/p> <p>Occupations such as senior health services and public health managers and directors are on the Department's critical skills employment permit list, yet it is my understanding that the HSE has a glut of these professionals already employed.  Other professionals given special status at the moment include: accountants and tax consultants; environment health professionals; quality assurance and regulatory professionals; sales, marketing and related associate professionals; web design and development professionals, etc.  The Department also has a list of those professions eligible for internship employment permits.  This list mirrors the list for critical skills employment permits and chefs are not covered on this list either.  <\/p> <p>It is interesting to note that the Department last updated its work permit eligibility list on 3 April 2017.  At that time the critical shortage of chefs was already well documented and publicised.  I am aware that the RAI has met with Department officials on this issue approximately four times in the past 18 months, but I have been contacted by individuals in the industry, such as people running hotels and restaurants.  In the past four years they have made a submission on the issue every six months.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I understand the Department has informed them that it is not keen to offer two-year temporary visas for chefs at the moment.

Ireland's over-arching labour market policy is to support the sourcing of skills and labour needs from within the workforce of Ireland and the European Economic Area, EEA.  The employment permits system offers an interim solution for employers when specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA.  The system is ordered by the use of lists which determine which occupations are in high demand and which are ineligible for consideration for employment permits.  Changes to the lists are made on the basis of research undertaken by the expert group on future skills needs in tandem with a consultation process as part of a package of measures to meet these skills needs.  With the exception of executive chefs, head chefs, sous chefs and specialist chefs who specialise in non-EEA cuisine, chefs are on the ineligible list for employment permits at present.  I introduced these rules during my term as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The provision of employment permits to chefs in the exceptional categories I have mentioned supports Ireland as an attractive destination for tourists who enjoy a wide range of cuisines.<\/p> <p>In 2015, a study of the future skills needs of the hospitality sector conducted by the expert group on future skills needs indicated that the demand for skills was increasing in line with the economic recovery.  It made a series of recommendations to avoid skills shortfalls as the sector grows.  Consequently, a hospitality skills oversight group was established in 2015 to drive and co-ordinate action.  The group comprises representatives of private and public stakeholders, including the Restaurant Association of Ireland.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is aware that work is under way to increase the supply of chefs through training initiatives such as the development of a new commis chef apprenticeship and a chef de partie apprenticeship.  While the emphasis is on developing skills in the Irish labour market, the role migration can play is being kept under review.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is responsible for ensuring the employment rights of people in the labour market are protected.  Critically, therefore, any potential opening up of the regime would require measures to be put in place to mitigate any potential risk of abuse of non-EEA employees.  The use of an indicator of compliance with employment standards is being considered by the Department in collaboration with Solas and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#C00200","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response.  I appreciate where she is coming from when she speaks about providing jobs for Irish citizens and people from the EU.  As I mentioned at the outset, it is felt that the training initiatives will not bring enough people on stream to service the industry for another two or three years.  For that reason, I am calling for an interim measure to be agreed that would allow people in the industry on wages below &euro;30,000 to be employed from outside the EU, if possible.  The Minister of State has said that this matter is under review.  I would like to be kept up to date.  I will be in touch with the Department in due course to see how that plays out.  I have marked the necessity which I am hearing from different hoteliers with regard to the shortage.  They are finding it difficult to get people to fill sous chef, executive chef, head chef and specialist chef positions.  They need regular chefs as well.  I am not an expert.

The college was founded in 1898 and is the oldest training college in the State for primary school teachers.  It was started by the Sisters of Mercy as part of their convent on the South Circular Road and has expanded over many years.  It is in the centre of the city.  When it started, the college had a couple of hundred students.  It now has almost 5,000 but some of its facilities have not been updated.  Its library caters for approximately 700 students, which means that many of the college's students are being disenfranchised because they have to go on a waiting list to get a time slot for library access in the context of research and so on or, alternatively, are obliged to use the public library in Limerick.  The number of students in the college and the number of courses on offer there are both growing.  In addition to teacher training, the college now offers several other bachelor degrees and postgraduate courses.  It plays a crucial role as people come from all over Ireland because its name is known worldwide.  When people apply for jobs and so on, the name of the college is recognised.  It has established very important links with the University of Limerick, which now accredits all of the college's graduates.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight the plight of the many students who are being disenfranchised by not being able to access the library because there is not enough space therein.  The college has outgrown its library.  The capital plan review is coming up shortly.  It is very important that Mary Immaculate College be considered as part of that in terms of the development of third-level education because all Members will agree that primary school teaching is where we all start in education and it is so important that the students attending the college are not disenfranchised and get the same opportunity as those attending other colleges in terms of being able to undertake proper research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#D00600","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue of the library in Mary Immaculate College.  I am very aware of the good work of the college for its students.  The Government recognises the importance of the higher education sector to Ireland's future economic and social development.  However, the reality of the economic situation in recent years and the nature of the public expenditure corrections that had to be made presented challenges in all areas of public expenditure, including higher education.  The sector has responded well to those challenges and has continued to provide opportunities for increasing numbers of students to undertake higher education qualifications.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In that context, the Department of Education and Skills is aware of the significant infrastructure challenges faced by Mary Immaculate College with respect to library and learning resource facilities.  The Higher Education Authority has received a submission requesting funding for a new library to address these challenges.  The Department previously provided funding to Mary Immaculate College to upgrade its existing library facilities in 2010.  However, as part of the budgetary process in November 2011, a Government decision was taken to concentrate available expenditure or educational capital resources on delivering school places and to restrict investment in higher education infrastructure to legally binding contractual commitments in place at the time.  While a very limited amount of funding has been made available since then, it has not been sufficient to allow us to progress the Mary Immaculate College library project.<\/p><p>The Senator will be aware that the 2016-21 capital plan provides for a direct Exchequer investment of &euro;150 million in higher education, including &euro;40 million already allocated to the Grangegorman project.  It also provides for &euro;200 million worth of public private partnership, PPP, projects.  While these are extremely important and very welcome investments, they cannot address the full scale of demand in the sector.  Most of the direct Exchequer funding currently available under the capital plan is required to deliver on existing commitments.  The distribution of the remaining funds in future years will depend on a number of factors and this is being managed very carefully in consultation with the Higher Education Authority.<\/p><p>The report of the Expert Group on the Future Funding of Higher Education, the Cassells report, found that a capital programme of &euro;5.5 billion was required in the higher education sector over the next 15 years.  This has informed the submission of the Department to the ongoing capital review process led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We await the outcome of that process.  The Government will make final decisions on the allocation of the additional funding available for public investment over the period from 2018 to 2021 in the context of the 2018 Estimates.<\/p><p>Decisions on the distribution of existing and additional capital funding for higher education will be made based on the level of funding available and in the context of competing demands.  Particular strategic priorities include expanding capacity in areas of key skills deficits, orientating for demographic growth and ensuring core campus infrastructure is fit for purpose.<\/p><p>The immediate demands in the sector were identified in the responses from higher education institutions to a consultation process on capital requirements recently undertaken by the Higher Education Authority with the support of the Department.  These responses, including that from Mary Immaculate College, fed into our submission to the capital review.  They also provided higher education institutions with the opportunity to identify projects they wished to put forward for consideration as part of the higher education public private partnerships programme.<\/p><p>Officials of the Department and the Higher Education Authority, with the advice and assistance of the National Development Finance Agency where necessary, have since been engaged in a comprehensive assessment of the projects put forward for inclusion in the programme.  Project selection is in its final stages and I anticipate an announcement on the projects to be included in the programme will be made in the coming weeks.  It should be noted that projects which are not progressed as part of the PPP programme may still be considered for direct Exchequer funding.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Maria Byrne for raising this matter and confirm the Department's commitment to progressing the building project in the case of Mary Immaculate College, Limerick, when funding allows and taking account of the range of capital investment priorities in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#D00700","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her personal acknowledgement, on behalf of the Department, of the contribution of Mary Immaculate College.

I raise this issue today in the context of budget 2018 and the difficulties the Minister, and every Minister, will have with competing demands.  This matter relates to the areas of natural constraint payment where funding of approximately &euro;200 million is available from the Department towards the most severely disadvantaged lands and the farmers who farm those lands, whether they are constrained by coastal issues, hill farming, the altitude of the land, the marginal nature of the land, or the low stocking density.  They have argued for a long time, as have the farming organisations, that it is essential that the programme for Government recommendation or agreement for an additional &euro;25 million is made available.<\/p> <p>I raise this issue in the context of the forthcoming budget.  I know the Minister cannot divulge what he may or may not do, but I wish to highlight the need, if it is at all possible, to make that money available for 2018.  These areas are farmed and the first 10 ha of the payment is front loaded at around &euro;109.71 per hectare.  After 10 ha, it goes back to between &euro;95 and &euro;99 per hectare.  It is argued that there will be additional front loading done and if possible this front loading would increase from 10 ha to 20 ha.  This would be of significant benefit to the most marginal farmers in the State.  According to Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine figures, I understand some 30,000 such farms exist.  They are constrained and they are custodians of the most rural parts of Ireland.  I hope that additional moneys can be made available under the scheme, which is aimed at supporting the most marginal land.  I hope there will be some good news in the coming weeks in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#F00500","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for raising this matter.<\/p> <p>The areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme was introduced under the 2014-2020 rural development programme as a replacement for the previous disadvantaged areas and less favoured areas schemes, which had been in place since 1975.  Payments under the ANC scheme are an important support for farmers across the country in addressing cash flow issues and in contributing to the continued growth and development of the agrifood sector.<\/p> <p>The scheme was originally introduced in 1975 in recognition of the fact that farmers in particular areas were faced with challenges relating to lower productivity and higher production costs than farmers in other areas where levels of disadvantage were not as pronounced.  The significant level of financial support delivered through the scheme in the intervening years was provided in recognition of the fact that such issues posed a significant threat to the future viability of these farming communities.  The specific objectives of the scheme are structured around themes such as ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a viable rural society, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take environmental protection into account.<\/p> <p>I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to the more than 95,000 farmers who receive the payment annually.  With this in mind, I have prioritised the efficient payment of the ANC scheme in my Department in recent years.

Regular payments will be made in the coming weeks to ensure that cases are processed once they become clear.  At present, approximately &euro;170 million has issued to 80,000 farmers.<\/p><p>Under the Common Agricultural Policy finalised in 2013, the new rural development regulation introduced a change in how eligible areas under the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme were to be defined.  The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date has been based on a range of socioeconomic factors.  These factors include: particular stocking density levels; family farm income levels; population density; and the percentage of the total working population engaged in agriculture.  The change in question required that eligible areas must be designated using a set list of biophysical criteria.  The purpose of this change is linked to a concern at EU level that areas were not being designated as disadvantaged in a consistent manner across the various member states.<\/p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in respect of the new criteria.  Department officials have also been in contact with the joint research centre, JRC, and DG Agriculture and Rural Development in the EU Commission in respect of technical issues arising.  The ongoing analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will, in parallel, be subjected to a refinement process.<\/p><p>In the original rural development regulation, the new ANC designation was scheduled to be in place for payment in the 2018 scheme year.  However, as part of the ongoing discussion on amendments to regulations at EU level, a proposal to extend this deadline on an optional basis is being considered.  This proposal is currently passing through the relevant approval process at EU level along with a number of other regulatory changes in what is referred to as the \"omnibus proposal\".<\/p><p>In view of the importance of the financial support to farmers provided under the ANC scheme, the programme for Government commits to a &euro;25 million increase in funding for the scheme in 2018.  This is being considered as part of the ongoing annual budgetary process for 2018.  There are a number of options in respect of how any additional funding could be allocated.  These options range from allocating the funds as a flat increase across the current payable rates to various forms of targeted higher payment rates for particular categories of farmers.  Any changes would require agreement with the EU Commission via a formal amendment of the rural development programme for the period 2014 to 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#F00600","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The current rate of uptake is 93% on foot of a positive campaign.  As a father, I think it has been a very worthy campaign.  Unfortunately, the  rate of uptake for the HPV vaccine has dropped in recent years.  The vaccine was first introduced in 2010.  In 2013, the rate of uptake was 88%.  That fell to 86% in 2014 and to 76% in 2015.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They are stating now that it is possibly as low as 50%.  That is greatly worrying.  The HPV vaccination gives women the opportunity to be vaccinated against cervical cancer, which is a silent killer.  It is an issue that we, as a society, must address.  In terms of the figures, 650 women will need to attend hospital treatment for pre-cancerous conditions regarding cervical cancer every year.  Every year, 300 women contract the disease and, unfortunately, we lose 90 of them.  It is a silent killer, and that is the reason vaccination is so important.<\/p><p>We need to redouble our efforts to get across the positive message regarding this important tool to ensure that this disease can be controlled.  I read some figures yesterday and they frightened me.  Unfortunately, we would lose another 40 people with a 50% uptake.<\/p><p>I realise the Minister has worked tirelessly to ensure that the good message about this vaccine gets out.  We must ensure we have a follow-up programme for people who want to come back into the system.

I thank Senator Tim Lombard for tabling this very important issue, which provides me with an opportunity to update the Seanad on what is a very important public health matter.<\/p> <p>As Senator Lombard will be aware, immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost effective of health care interventions and the importance of vaccination is acknowledged by all the major health organisations.  The Senator is entirely correct.  Due to a very successful childhood immunisation programme, the uptake rates for many of our very important vaccinations are now in line with World Health Organization, WHO, targets, which is saving lives and helping to create healthier children at a younger age and throughout their lives.<\/p> <p>There is strong evidence of the beneficial impact of the HPV vaccine for women&rsquo;s health in countries that have had high uptake rates.  For example, cases of high grade pre-cancerous changes of the cervix have reduced by 75% in Australia and by more than 50% in Scotland as a result of the high uptake rate of this vaccine.  As Senator Lombard correctly said, this is a vaccine that can and is saving lives.<\/p> <p>I want to assure Senator Lombard that one of my absolute priorities as Minister for Health, and a priority of the Health Service Executive, HSE, is to counter misinformation relating to the safety of vaccines, and to increase uptake rates of all vaccines in the State's immunisation programmes.  That is important.  It is not good enough for us to sit silently by.  All of us who hold public office have a duty to help get the facts and the information out to the public and to debug the myths.  That is why I showed my strong support for this vaccine when I launched a new HSE HPV information campaign at the end of August.  That is an excellent campaign and I pay tribute to the HSE and the many doctors who worked with it in putting that together.  It is operating alongside a very effective campaign of information but from an alliance of medical experts who have come together to get the facts out, debug the myths and make sure parents can make informed choices.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to see the work of the HSE in developing a comprehensive range of materials as part of the immunisation programme for this new school year has started.  This includes a letter to parents concerning the vaccination programme, leaflets giving the facts about the HPV vaccine and cervical cancer for parents and teachers and a HPV vaccine key facts leaflet for general practitioners, GPs.<\/p> <p>Prior to all school immunisations, parents receive an information pack in a sealed package with an information leaflet, a consent form and a cover letter.  The information packs for all immunisations are standardised nationally.  The information booklets include information on all the known side effects that can occur after any vaccination.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.<\/p> <p>The HSE has invested in marketing communications at a time when parents are receiving our information packs and consent forms in schools, and when the vaccines will be given to girls.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As we speak, advertisements are running on radio stations nationally to coincide with the provision of this information to parents.  This five-week campaign of national and regional radio advertising started last week and will include social media posts on Facebook and Twitter as well as digital advertising.<\/p><p>It is very clear that misinformation is causing real harm to unvaccinated children and to adults who develop vaccine-preventable diseases.  A number of years ago, the big political outrage on this issue was that the vaccine was not available to girls in this country and was not being funded.  Indeed, my predecessor, Senator James Reilly, campaigned for it prior to its brave introduction by another predecessor, Mary Harney.  She saw its importance.<\/p><p>As Senator Lombard rightly points out, there was a very good uptake with 87% of eligible girls having this vaccine three years ago, but that rate has dropped to 50% in the last academic year due to misinformation.  The Irish Cancer Society estimates that this drop will have the following consequences, which are startling: that 1,000 girls will require invasive therapy to prevent the precancerous form of HPV; 100 girls will develop cervical cancer and require life altering treatment; and the deaths will take place of at least 40 girls with cervical cancer who did not receive the HPV vaccine.  The consequences of this are very serious, which is why I get agitated and use strong language when I hear people making ignorant and uninformed comments.  We must take our advice on vaccinations from medical experts.  In this case, the advice is very clearly that this is a fully tested vaccine which protects against the main cancer-causing strains of HPV and will eventually save around 60 lives in Ireland each and every year.  That is 60 girls who will go on into womanhood alive and well as a result of this vaccine.  The benefits of this vaccine are clear.  It can, does and will save lives.<\/p><p>To respond directly to Senator Lombard's question on a follow-up campaign, I am pleased to inform him that one is now in place.  If there are parents at home today who decided at the time they did not want to get their child vaccinated but have now informed themselves of the facts and would like to get it done, they need not feel they have missed out.  Any girl can be provided with the vaccine through the school immunisation programme, which is important information to get out to our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#H00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister on his response and on the campaigns he is running on this very important issue.

Since I went there 20 years ago, I have been amazed by the gun laws in the United States.  A couple of years ago, when President Obama wanted to introduce background checks, 91% of the American people voted in favour of them, and in the US Senate, where I have many friends, they could not get 60 votes out of 100 to bring the matter to the floor.

They are present to attend the briefing at 4 p.m. in the AV room.  As legislators of all political persuasions, we have a responsibility to join their fight for access to treatment that, as it has done in the North and elsewhere, significantly delays the loss of ability to walk and associated medical difficulties for these children.  Today's briefing will provide these families with the opportunity to share with us the story of their campaign to secure access to the drug Translarna, which has a proven life-changing impact on sufferers of muscular dystrophy.  Translarna is available in the North and my colleague, Ms Michelle O'Neill, approved it during her time as Minister of Health.  Along with our party president, Deputy Adams, she met the parents of muscular dystrophy sufferer Lewis Walsh Harte - they are present today - to hear their account of how crucial a factor time is in obtaining access to this drug.<\/p><p>Translarna is available in 22 other EU countries as well as the North.  This leaves parents facing an unjust decision, namely, must they move to another jurisdiction to obtain this drug?  It is imperative that, in cases such as these, we have an all-island approach to accessing life-changing and life-saving medicines.  It is illogical and unfair to have different levels of access for sufferers in different parts of the island.<\/p><p>The families have been told that there is no money, and the data are insufficient, to fund Translarna.  How can we possibly explain to these young children that the reason they are not walking like their peers in 22 other countries, the North and their very own country is that the data are not sufficient?  How can we possibly tell these five children that we cannot afford to provide this vital medicine when we see millions of euro wasted on renting empty office spaces for Departments?  These children cannot wait for lengthy legal processes that are likely to cost much more than the treatment would cost in the first place.  I urge the Government to right this wrong, make the right decision and approve Translarna without further delay.

The role of regional development in Europe has taken a back seat in some of the short-term national fiscal targets.  Public consultation and democracy have been neglected.

The society has also stated that many people with cancer forego the essentials of daily living in order to pay the prescription charge, which interferes with their well-being and ability to recover.<\/p><p>Ample research has also been compiled by the British Medical Association, the Coughlan Foundation and the World Health Organization, WHO.  They have all carried out independent research that show charges cause people to not take their medicines and act as a barrier to doing so.  In fact, the organisations have made the bald statement that these charges cause as much as a reduction in necessary care as they do any reduction in unnecessary care.  I believe that the time has come for us to remove the charges.<\/p><p>I call on the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance to abolish prescription charges in this year's budget.  If that is not possible I would like to at least see the process started by abolishing the charge for people over 65 years and those with chronic illnesses.  These are the very people who are the most vulnerable in our society.  They are the very people who need to take their medicines.  They are also the very people that if they do not take their medicines will fall ill, end up in hospital and cost the State an awful lot more money.  <\/p><p>The financial crisis is over.  I know we need to be prudent but this is an area that needs to be addressed, and addressed urgently.  We must send a strong signal to the many people who approach the last quarter of their lives that the sacrifices that they made to keep this country on its feet will be acknowledged now by giving them more affordable health care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#Q00300","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I think we are all in agreement that homelessness is destroying lives in Ireland.  As many as 3,000 children now live in emergency accommodation, which is profoundly shocking because we have been told that resources are not an issue for this crisis.  As a physician I have considered the human cost of this crisis, including research from Harvard University.  I have learned that the type of scenarios that many of these children face can be toxic to their developing brains.  First, the research is clear that \"strong, frequent, or prolonged adverse experiences\" lead to excessive cortisol and disrupts developing brain circuits.<\/p> <p>Second, and significantly, early adversity can lead to lifelong problems, developmental delays and a \"cumulative toll on an individual&rsquo;s physical and mental health\".  Of course, stigma goes hand in hand with homelessness.  Stigma is defined as a mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality or person.  All of us will remember a time when we felt extremely self-conscious.  We worried whether anyone would notice that one had the same schoolbag, pencil case or, indeed, uniform that was handed down from an older sibling or cousin, or that one stayed outside at lunchtime because one had no money for the tuck shop and all the while hoping nobody would notice.  Thankfully, these experiences for many of us were transient and short lived.<\/p> <p>Let us imagine how it feels to be a homeless child.  What does that do to one's self-esteem?  There would a stigma due to being unable to invite one's friends back to one's house for a game of football.  That stigma is corrosive to a young brain.  In 2013, the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, apologised unreservedly to the women who suffered the stigma of the Magdalen laundries.  In 1999, the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, apologised unreservedly for the stigma of those victims of institutional abuse.  Who will be the Taoiseach when an unreserved apology is given to the children trapped in homelessness?  That day will come unless we, as legislators, act swiftly and decisively.  In many cases these children need immediate psychological support because the damage being visited upon them by this stigma is profound.  It will last a lifetime and it will, undoubtedly, leave indelible mental scars.<\/p> <p>I call on the Deputy Leader to facilitate a debate on homelessness, how it pertains to young children and the psychological effects on same. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#R00200","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Last week the necessity of having a proper debate in this House on the future of Europe was raised.  I ask the Deputy Leader to consider allowing such a debate.  Our agenda is fairly unpacked, if I may use that phrase.  There is plenty of time to debate this issue and much has to be considered in respect of it, such as the attitude of the State to what is happening in the European Union at present, the various options open to the European Union, and the agenda that is being prepared by the extreme federalists such as Guy Verhofstadt and others to bring about a federal superstate in Europe, which is not being in any way contradicted or even considered in this Parliament.<\/p><p>In that context we have a network of Jean Monnet professors who are paid from European Union funds, and many people who participate as experts on the future of Europe.  We do not have a balanced debate because such debate as there is normally in our media on the subject of the future of Europe is between those who are absolutely and radically opposed to the European project at all and those who are quiet sleepers or active enthusiasts for the federal superstate project on the other.<\/p><p>The last time <i>The Irish Times <\/i>asked its readers what they genuinely thought about the process of European integration, the people by a margin of 3:1 or 2.5:1 were in favour of the position adopted by David Cameron in his requests to his fellow European partners for some latitude which would enable him to win the Brexit debate.  That is worth remembering.  A very considerable majority of Irish people do not share the minority federalist view and, when asked about it, fairly and squarely say so.  It is about time that our Government clearly articulated a vision of Europe which is based on partnership among member states who share certain aspects of their sovereignty and which states that there are other areas, particularly relating to tax sovereignty that we have no intention whatsoever of backing away from and on which we will always maintain our independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#S00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I wish to convey my condolences to all the families in the USA.  It was terrible to see the scenes on the television.  I wish to raise again the question of commercial rates.  I have been dealing with a business family in recent weeks who owe &euro;12,000 in commercial rates.  They offered to pay &euro;100 a week on top of paying this year's rates.  The offer was accepted with a struggle.<\/p> <p>In some counties business people are getting write-downs on rates outstanding, whereas in other counties families are being dragged through the courts.  The only legislation on rates dates back to the 1800s.  Property tax was introduced to start a new rate base when the crash came because the business rate base was gone and local authorities had no funding.  Business people thought that with the property tax and a new structured rate base, they would get relief.  Instead, things have remained the same and there has been no relief for businesses.  Now we see a new rate evaluation happening in most counties.  In County Westmeath, Senator Davitt has raised the issue of commercial rates and, like me he, has rattled the cage on the subject.  The commercial rates on small businesses have risen by 16%, whereas the rate bases of the large multinational businesses have reduced.  The figures Senator Davitt has given me show that with this new evaluation, 50% of retail shops will experience an increase in their rates.  It looks as if some people want to close down the small towns in rural Ireland.  We will see cactus and weeds growing as we go down the main street.<\/p> <p>The organisation, Business Retail Union of Ireland, some of whose representatives I have met, is starting a campaign calling for a national strike on paying rates until something is done.

Regardless of how they voted in the weekend's referendum, I want to express my solidarity with and commend the people there on taking their courageous stand in participating in that most basic tenet of the exercise of democracy.  The response of the Spanish state, which has been referred to, was to meet those people with baton-wielding riot police and, ultimately, violence.  The response of the Irish Government was slow in coming but I welcome an Taoiseach's remarks in the D&aacute;il to the effect that he was horrified by the scenes of violence on Sunday and that he would raise the matter with the Spanish Prime Minister.  I encourage Fine Gael Senators to do the same with their sister-party colleagues in the Partido Popular, PP.<\/p> <p>I believe to my core in the right of the Catalan people to national self-determination.  We should all be able to agree, not least here in Ireland, on the fundamental right of any people to pursue that objective peacefully and through the ballot box, as was seen on Sunday.  It is my view that the momentum is behind the people of Catalonia who voted overwhelmingly in favour of their right to independence.  The Taoiseach's assertion that the Government will not recognise the vote of the Catalan people will not only put this country on the wrong side of history, it is not reflective of the broad view of the people of Ireland.<\/p> <p>Ireland's bond with the Catalan people dates back many generations.  My own home city of Belfast sent many volunteers to fight against Franco and against the kind of tactics which we saw deployed against the people of Catalonia at the weekend.  My parish sent two IRA volunteers, Liam Tumilson and James Straney, who died in defence of the kind of democracy we saw exercised by the people of Catalonia on Sunday.  The people there have spoken.  They have voted for their independence.  As we prepare in the coming years, quite rightly, to remember and honour the historic election of 1918 and the establishment of our own democratically-elected Government in 1919 and the First D&aacute;il, which too faced repression and violence, it ill behoves the Government to be a passive observer to the changing political and social dynamic across Europe.  The Taoiseach should address us on this matter and heed the calls coming from Catalonia for an independent, international mediator to be appointed by the EU to help navigate the changed political paradigm which now exists between Spain and the people of Catalonia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#T00100","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I send my condolences to the people of Las Vegas and to those who lost loved ones in the horrendous atrocity that happened there.

These NGOs came out and spoke on the importance of this legislation being enacted in its entirety - all four measures.  The Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society also came out in support of this legislation in its entirety.  I ask the Deputy Leader when this legislation will be progressed.

The school authorities in Ballygarvan, which has been affected by these problems, are trying to ensure pupils will get the minimum number of days of education in the current school year.  Can Senators imagine that this is a core issue?

However, between 2014 and 2016 rates of HIV infection increased by 36% from almost 400 to more than 500.  PrEP is currently undergoing the necessary review processes by the Health Service Executive and it results will not be returned or a determination made in the matter for between six and 12 months.<\/p><p>A large proportion of men who have sex with men take PrEP and imported generic versions of the drug to stay safe.  The HSE does not provide clinical support or information and no alternative contraceptive is available that is as effective in preventing HIV.

Four months ago, we received the bad news that a proposed respite house in Bagenalstown would not proceed.  Four or five months prior to that decision being taken, the HSE indicated to me that it was considering placing a deposit on a house in Tullow.  Several weeks ago, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister stated the Government was committed to providing services and supports to people with disabilities which would empower them to live independent lives and provide greater independence.  It also advised me to revert to the HSE on the issue.  I was extremely disappointed with the Minister's reply.<\/p> <p>In recent days, I received a response to a query from the HSE in Carlow-Kilkenny reiterating that a deposit had been paid on a house in Tullow and noting that it would be 12 months or more before a respite service would be available.  This Christmas, the T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g respite service for children in counties Carlow and Kilkenny will have been closed for two years.  We were informed a new service would be provided in Gleann na Bear&uacute; in Bagenalstown but the project fell through.  I have since been informed by the Minister and HSE that it will be 12 months before the house in Tullow is ready.  When I received the letter from the HSE last week, I did not call any of the affected parents because I do not know what will happen.  It is a disgrace that for almost two years, we have not had a respite service for children with disabilities.  Waiting another 12 months will mean a service will not have been available for three years, which is unacceptable.  Children and families waiting for this respite care service to open are being given false hope.  This is an urgent case and I call on the Minister to address the matter in the House.<\/p> <p>The budget will be introduced next week and I hope it will be a good one because children are suffering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#W00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The Senator has made her point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#W00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I strongly support Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's comments on post offices.

I am literally just in the door from Barcelona.  I spent the weekend there as part of an international observation delegation for the referendum in Catalonia.  To say that I am shocked and disturbed by what I saw would be a massive understatement.  What we saw was state-orchestrated abuse of human rights and civil liberties.  I am not the only person saying that.  There was also another very large delegation of international experts who came out with the same opinion.<\/p> <p>There has been much rhetoric around the fact that this was not a legal referendum.  Was it legal to strike a 70 year old man on the crown for standing in line waiting to vote?  I spoke to that man on Sunday afternoon.  Was it legal to injure 900 people?  Was it legal to smash and damage the property in schools across Catalonia?  This was a massive attack on the right to free speech, the right to freedom of assembly and the right to self-determination.<\/p> <p>The Catalan people were absolutely incredible.  Not one of us in the delegation of almost 100 people saw one person provoke any of the Guardia Civil.  They were absolutely peaceful and determined.  Great praise goes to their local version of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Catalan Mossos d'Esquadra and to the fire-fighters of Catalonia who, in many cases, stepped in between the Guardia Civil and the civilians.  This was and is State enforced oppression.  It was extreme and totally out of proportion.  What happened was an absolute disgrace.  This was not just an attack on the people of Catalonia, it was an attack on democracy itself.  The members of the Spanish Government should, in my opinion, hang their heads in shame.  The Spanish Prime Minister did not come out to condemn the activity; he praised it.  The EU should hang its head in shame because it has agreed with the Spanish position.  Those leaders across Europe and the world who agree with that opinion should certainly rethink their position.  The President of Catalonia, Carlos Puigdemont, who we met on Friday, has called for an international, non-EU mediator to be appointed - sponsored by the EU - and I am of the view that this needs to happen.  This Parliament needs to take a stand and be counted in favour of democracy.  I note that Senator Swanick made a very good proposition last week that we invite President Carlos Puigdemont from Catalonia to address this House, as Nicola Sturgeon did.  I certainly would call for that, along with a full debate on the matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This is an issue for democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#X00200","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>That would have to go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#X00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>We would certainly put it to the CPP and will do so as quickly as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#X00400","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>As is often the case,. I find myself in agreement with my colleague and friend, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, on this issue.  It was appalling to watch the television images from Catalonia.  These people were going to vote.  Let the Spanish Government make the case, as it will, that it was not a legal exercise but these people were going out and doing something that was not causing any trouble.  There was no violence.  The vast majority of the people are very proud of their region.  The behaviour of the Spanish police was appalling and is an international crime.  I do not say this lightly but one could not be anything but horrified to watch what we saw on our television screens.<\/p> <p>I shall now turn to the issue of rural post-offices.  There have not been any closed in recent times, but there needs to be a recalibration of the role of the post office.  The post office really needs to become a one-stop shop for all official State transactions in towns and villages throughout the country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the suburban areas of cities and large towns, where there are no connectivity issues and buses are available, it is very hard to make a case for retaining those types of post offices.  Certainly there is a very strong case to be made for retaining post offices in towns and villages that are otherwise isolated, where there is no Bus &Eacute;ireann service every 20 minutes or half an hour and where the nearest post office is inaccessible for lots of people.  However, An Post needs to step up to the plate as well.  As somebody from a business background, I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach will agree with me.  There needs to be a total rethink.  What we are really talking about is a partnership between the local authorities, the State and An Post.  Why can I not go into the post office and tax my car?  Why can people not go into the post office to pay things like fines that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues?  Until such time as there is a proper working group set up with real powers to put in train a changed management culture, ethos and programme at An Post, we are going to be here next year and in future years talking about the threat to rural post offices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#X00500","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators who raised matters on the Order of Business today.<\/p> <p>I join with colleagues who have expressed sympathy with those who have lost loved ones and relatives in the horrific, shocking and tragic scenes in Las Vegas that we have witnessed on the television.  There is no question that a lot of the points raised by Senators with regard to gun control are very valid.  I will certainly talk to the Leader and perhaps the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about what could be done in the way of a communication with the US Government on that issue.  It is certainly something that happens too regularly in the United States.  It is difficult to get one's head around it.  I share Senator Lawless's frustration as a person who has a business.  I remember being in Chicago and chatting to some people one night, when a guy gestured that he had a gun in his jacket, which was supposed to be so impressive.  I was totally disgusted.  It is certainly something I have never come across in Europe and it is something I abhor.<\/p> <p>Senator Mark Daly raised legislation and issues in the Defence Forces.  They are issues that are well raised.  I think we should have a debate and that the Senator should share any ideas he has with regard to legislation.  It is always up to individual Members to decide to initiate legislation as Senator Daly has done in the past.  It might be worth considering.  A debate in the meantime to highlight the issues he has raised would be worthwhile.<\/p> <p>I have already covered the points that Senator Lawless raised.  I seconded Senator Conway-Walsh's request in respect of the NAMA Bill.  That is agreeable.  I compliment her on arranging a briefing for Members on muscular dystrophy.  The Translarna drug is not something with which I am very familiar but I will familiarise myself with the issue.  It is certainly something I will bring to the attention of the Minister although I have no doubt that he is aware of it.  If so many other EU countries are funding it, it may be something we should consider.<\/p> <p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins raised some interesting points on the EU, Catalonia and the overall democracy issue.  Senator McDowell mentioned the possibility of a debate on the future of Europe.  We are going to have a debate next week on that issue.  There are two hours scheduled and it is up to Senators to contribute to it.  Clearly, there is more action required than that, but in the short term it might be an opportunity to raise the issue.

The Senator raised the point about the Council of Ministers.  I would be shocked if it is not a topic for debate at the Council of Ministers.  Regardless of the illegality of the referendum, that could have been addressed in a much more peaceful manner by those objecting to the referendum.  If the Senator believes a debate on it is warranted in its own right, it is one I am sure the Leader will be willing to facilitate over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Nash raised the events in Las Vegas and Catalonia.  I have covered his points regarding the EU on which he was supporting Senator Higgins.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly raised an issue about prescription charges.  That strikes me as an issue that might make sense as a Commencement debate in advance of the budget.  Time constraints may not allow for that but I am sure it is an issue he can raise with the Minister at our parliamentary party meeting, if he has not already raised it with him.<\/p><p>Senator Swanick raised the issue of homelessness.  I could not disagree with his words regarding the effect it is bound to have on children.  I know he does not want me to give him a long list of the actions we are taking, and there are plenty of actions being taken, but I will suggest that we have a debate on that issue because it is one we endeavour to address on a regular basis as long as the crisis is ongoing.  It is certainly an issue we could usefully debate in the House in the near future.<\/p><p>I addressed Senator McDowell's point on the future of Europe.  There will be a debate on that issue next Thursday at 12.45 p.m. for two hours.  I agree entirely with his proposal that we have a balanced debate because like many issues, it is those who are particularly motivated who tend to get the most air time on any issue so it would be good to have that debate.<\/p><p>Senator Butler has long been a champion for the issue he raised, namely, the self-employed and small retailers.  I agree with him that a more professional or strategic approach needs to be taken when it comes to rates, and there are huge anomalies in that regard.  Clearly, there must be a need for legislation in this area and, in the meantime, the Senator is requesting a debate on it.  It is certainly something we will facilitate, perhaps after the budget.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile also raised the events in Catalonia.  I have covered the issues and note that the Senator noted the Taoiseach's comments on it and that he would like the Government to go further.<\/p><p>Senator Black raised the events in Catalonia and Las Vegas as well as the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill on which I agree with her comments.  It is being said that it will come into the House in the next few weeks.  I know no more than that but I have been pushing for it to come in as soon as possible.  I raised it today to see when it will be in the House.  It is legislation the Government initiated and there is a lot of work, for want of a better word, going on behind the scenes but we need it to come into this House.  I believe it will be here before the end of October but I do not have a precise date as yet.<\/p><p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of Irish Water.  I do not know the details of the cases he mentioned with regard to schools but that is clearly unacceptable.  I want to get more detail from the Senator but then I will raise those issues with the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Norris mentioned the events in Las Vegas and gun laws.  He also raised the case of a transgender individual he has been working for and it strikes me that that would be a good Commencement matter to raise.  As he asked, I will relay the comments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade but he will not be able to do much without knowing the specific case.  It would make sense to raise it as a Commencement matter.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Clifford-Lee, it would be a good idea for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come into the House to discuss that report, not least so that he can address concerns, rumours and discussion that has been had in the public at large, in politics and in the media.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As such, the Senator's suggestion presents the Minister with an opportunity to set the record straight or to clarify any questions Members might have.<\/p><p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell referred to An Post, as did Senators Martin Conway and John O'Mahony.  Clearly, this is another matter on which we need the Minister to come to the House.  A great deal is being reported about what is going on.  The Government continues to closely monitor the situation at An Post but the reality is that modern technology presents An Post with challenges.  People are not sending letters as often as they used to.  Clearly, we need to reinvigorate and restrategise how An Post carries out its business.  Certainly, it is an issue on which the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, would benefit from the opportunity to set the record straight, if that can be done.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield raised the events in Las Vegas as well as the issue of AIDS and men's sexual health.  It might make sense to arrange a debate where the Minister attends to discuss sexual health overall with an emphasis on AIDS and homosexual requirements for individuals to have a good sexual health strategy when it comes to the difficult area of AIDS.  A conversation around contraception and sexual health for all sexual orientations would be a good one for the House to have.<\/p><p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised a very important issue for her area.  Would she consider raising it as a Commencement matter so that she can get a precise answer from the Minister?  The Minister or a Minister of State would have to come to the House to give her a response.  It would give her the opportunity to get into the issue in more detail.  That would be a good approach.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to Catalonia.  He has long been a supporter of the issue there.  I have already addressed the issues and a debate could be worthwhile.  There might be an opportunity to have that next week as a debate is already appointed in the diary on the future of the EU.  Democracy and issues like this would be very relevant ones to raise at that debate, which represents an early opportunity to discuss the matter.<\/p><p>Senator Conway referred to Catalonia and made some interesting comments on An Post and the recalibration thereof.

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the nursing homes support scheme, more commonly known as the fair deal scheme.  The Government's priority is ensuring that our older population is looked after, supported and protected.  We are living longer lives than at any other time and, thankfully, it appears that this trend will continue into the future.  This is to be celebrated and embraced but we cannot ignore the challenges our ageing population brings with it, not least that of long-term care.  Most of our older people signal their desire to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as they are able.  It is Government policy to support this and it is something we feel strongly about.  However, there will always be a cohort who require access to quality long-term residential care.  This is why the fair deal scheme is such an important element of the range of services available for older people.  The scheme is a system of financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  With a budget of &euro;940 million in 2017, the scheme supports 23,600 people.  The Government target is that people will wait no longer than four weeks for approval for the scheme.  I am able to report that target has not been breached this year.<\/p><p>The fair deal scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are nursing and personal care, bed and board, basic aids and appliances necessary to assist with the activities of everyday living and laundry services.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much an applicant can contribute to the cost of his or her care.  An applicant will contribute up to 80% of their accessible income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of any assets per annum.  The State will then pay the balance of the cost of care.  It is important to note an applicant's principal private residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first three years.  This is known as the three-year cap.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual's assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the nursing home support scheme.  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<\/p><p>Although the nursing home support scheme covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the scheme retains at least 20% of his or her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State pension, whichever is greater.  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the scheme, the medical card or any other existing scheme.  Registered providers of nursing home care must agree a contract in writing with each resident on his or her admission to the nursing home, which includes details of the services to be provided and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees that are not set out in the contract.  Registered providers of nursing home care are also obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should, in the first instance, be taken up with the nursing home provider.  I encourage anyone with concerns to raise them with the nursing home through this complaints procedure.  The Office of the Ombudsman can also examine complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.<\/p><p>I have met Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, on a number of occasions to discuss the issue of additional charges in an effort to ensure more consistency and transparency on the part of nursing homes in dealing with additional charges.  I have asked that nursing homes advise prospective residents of these charges at inquiry stage rather than on admission.  I also requested an updated contract for care template to be used by all nursing homes.  Nursing Homes Ireland has already undertaken work on this with regard to its members.  I have also met Age Action, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the Ombudsman on the topic.  It is important that older people are protected and have all the information they need to make an informed decision.<\/p><p>A review of the nursing home support scheme was published in July 2015.  An interdepartmental agency working group chaired by the Department of Health has been established to oversee the implementation of many of the recommendations contained in the review of 2015.  These include improvements to the administration of the scheme, a review of how prices for private and voluntary nursing homes are set by the NTPF and a value for money and policy review of the cost differentials in public and private voluntary residential facilities which will commence in 2017.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the administrative reforms to the scheme.  Separately, the NTPF is progressing work on its review in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have also asked the interdepartmental group to consider the matter of additional charges in nursing homes and to examine the options that might be available.<\/p><p>Turning to the matter of farms and small businesses, concerns have been raised about the treatment of farms and in particular the potential impact of the annual contribution on the sustainability of family farms and businesses and specifically in circumstances where care may be required for a long period.  On this front, I have had ongoing negotiations with the IFA.  As recently as last week, I advised it of my intention to apply the cap that applies to private residential properties to farm assets and small business assets.  It is an ambition of Government and Government policy to encourage orderly succession arrangements for farms.  It is also endorsed by farming organisations.  In most cases, early succession arrangements in families should ensure farm assets are transferred well in advance of five years before nursing home care is required, meaning a levy on the farm asset is avoided entirely.<\/p><p>As outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government, we are fully committed to introducing changes as soon as practicable to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to note the scheme is underpinned by primary legislation and that, as such, any changes made to the scheme will require amendment to this legislation.  My Department is liaising with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the potential changes to the fair deal legislation which will address the concerns raised.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The issues currently being examined are legally complex and all aspects of the scheme need to be taken into consideration.<\/p><p>I mentioned at the outset that it is Government policy to promote care in the community for older people so they can continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.  The only statutory scheme in place at present to support older people is the fair deal scheme.  However, the Government is committed to establishing a new, separate statutory home care scheme, along with a system of regulation for home care services.  The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this.  The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in regard to the services for which individuals are eligible and in regard to how decisions are made on allocating services.  For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident the services provided are of a high standard.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I launched a public consultation on home care which opened on 6 July and closed yesterday.  A report on the findings of the consultation will be published in the coming months.  While these are important steps in the process, a significant amount of additional preparation needs to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of the home care scheme and system of regulation.  This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.  Every effort will be made to progress this matter as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#CC00200","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>The fair deal scheme is fundamentally a good scheme and the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health, Mary Harney, deserves credit for its introduction.  It was, of course, introduced at a time when there was a desperate need for a solution to the financial hardship faced by people who had to sell their homes, in some cases to pay up to &euro;1,000 a month in fees for private nursing homes.  At the time there was a stigma, whether real or not, associated with some health board facilities - that was not my view but it is a fact.  Prior to the scheme being formalised, care was patchy at best and elderly people often worried what would happen to them when their money ran out.  The fair deal scheme created something of a level playing field at the time and gave a level of security and comfort to those utilising it.<\/p> <p>As I say this, however, I am acutely aware of the problems that exist within the scheme.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises the many concerns surrounding the fair deal scheme and, in particular, those of many farming families and small businesses, as I have discussed with my colleague, Senator Paul Daly.  We agree it is vitally important that the issues around residential care for older people do not generate a situation that undermines the family farm model.  The programme for Government recognised the discrimination under the scheme against farm families and small businesses, and it pledged to make changes.  It is critical that this commitment be honoured.  Reports last week that the scheme will be changed to extend the three-year cap from the principal residence to the full family farm are welcome.  We looked for the financial assessment to only apply to the assets that had been transferred prior to entering the nursing home for less than a three-year period.  It is also worth noting that many farm families are opting not to avail of the scheme and are putting themselves under severe financial stress to find money to cover the costs of care in the short term.  Family farms are passed down from generation to generation, as we know, and no one wants to be the generation responsible for making the farm non-viable for the next generation.  The pressure is immense and this must be recognised.<\/p> <p>There have also been quite negative aspects such as the overcharging that appears to be occurring within certain nursing homes.  I was very disturbed by the reports of people being charged for services they could not possibly have participated in, or for extras such as orange juice, for example.  As a medic, I find this absolutely disgusting, and it is the most blatant form of elder abuse I have seen in recent years.  I echo the call made by my colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher, that any older person, or his or her representatives, should check and double-check the small print in the contracts they have signed with nursing homes.  I acknowledge they should not have to do this but, in too many circumstances, unfortunately, there are nursing homes which see older people on the fair deal scheme as opportunities to make excessive profits.  We must condemn this type of behaviour at every opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017100300002#EE00200","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1507037400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
