As line Minister for this important policy area, I look forward to his response.  I have expressed the view on more than one occasion that the bioenergy sector has been the poor relation or Cinderella of the broad renewable energy industry.  There is an apparent disregard at Department level and within the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for the role bioenergy can play in achieving our renewable energy targets, displacing CO2 emissions, reducing imports of fossil fuels and creating jobs.<\/p> <p>For two years, the Department dragged its heels on publishing a bioenergy policy perspective.  While I am glad it has finally been produced, the delay has led to certain problems, particularly with regard to the introduction of a renewable heat incentive, RHI.  It is important for the industry to know what supports will be provided and the infrastructure around the transfer from fossil fuels, namely, oil and gas, to renewables, including biomass and bioenergy.  However, the start-up date for the scheme is given as some time in 2016.  This uncertainty and delay has had the unforeseen consequence of impeding and stalling the sector and bringing about a chilling effect.  I could refer to numerous large-scale projects that were cancelled, put on hold or are in limbo because the developers are not willing to proceed without knowing at what stage the RHI will be implemented and what terms and criteria will apply.<\/p> <p>It is in the Minister's gift to address this issue and bring some clarity to the situation, either by bringing forward the date of implementation, actually fixing an implementation date or, even at this juncture, outlining the criteria and standards that will apply when the scheme is introduced.  That would enable people to proceed with investment and advance planning for such developments.  The current uncertainty is having a negative impact on the sector and obstructing job creation in rural areas and within the regions.  The bioenergy sector has a large contribution to make.  In fact, an as yet unpublished SEAI report indicates there are 5,000 sustainable jobs to be created in the sector if it is given its head and the opportunity to grow and prosper.  Unfortunately, many of the relevant companies have relocated to the United Kingdom, which is light years ahead of us on this.<\/p> <p>We must take a more vigorous and committed approach to the sector.  We need, in the first instance, a domestic equivalent to the UK's RHI scheme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Whelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2361\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2361&amp;amp;pid=JohnWhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Why should we be subsidising oil and gas furnaces through the Better Homes scheme when we should be subsidising bioenergy?  As the Minister knows, once families install boilers and heating systems, there is a 20-year commitment over a system's lifetime to importing oil and gas.  This is counterproductive to the Government's objective of reaching our 2020 renewable targets, making our contribution towards addressing climate change, removing carbon from the system and creating sustainable jobs instead of importing fossil fuels.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware, the commitment in the policy is to replace 200,000 tonnes of oil per year by 2020.  It would be a major boon to the economy if we were to do so via investing in bioenergy systems.  Will the Minister intervene in this matter?  It is within his gift.  Were clarity brought to the situation, it would help.  This has the added benefit of helping the Minister to achieve his objectives as regards the 2020 targets on renewable energy and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#C00100","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Whelan for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to address Senators on the topic.<\/p> <p>The Senator referred to Ireland's national renewable energy action plan, NREAP, which states that we aim to meet our overall 16% renewable energy target by 2020 by achieving 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, as well as 10% in transport and 12% in heating.  I agree that energy from biomass has a critical role in meeting these ambitions for 2020 and beyond.  It may interest the Senator and colleagues to know that provisional figures for 2014 show that biomass accounted for 3.6 percentage points of the 8.6 percentage points delivered by renewables, representing something in the order of 40%, which is not insignificant.<\/p> <p>Recognising the potential to develop the bioenergy sector significantly and to address the challenges involved, I published a draft bioenergy plan last October.  Analysis underpinning the draft plan demonstrates that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heating sector would represent the most cost-effective means of meeting a number of our policy goals.  It is therefore my intention, subject to further Government approval and state aid clearance, to introduce a renewable heat incentive, RHI, in 2016.  This would encourage larger heat users to change to systems that produce heat from renewable sources.  The scheme is being designed to increase the amount of heat generated from renewable sources, including biomass.<\/p> <p>There has been no delay in developing the scheme.  Work is under way on developing its terms and conditions, the criteria and so on to which the Senator referred, including those relating to support tariffs and eligible technologies.  These must be designed appropriately in order to ensure that the objectives of the scheme are met cost-effectively.  It is important that the scheme provide maximum value for money and minimise cost to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>The first of three public consultations which are required to be held during the development of the RHI will commence shortly.

I urge the Minister to put in place interim arrangements such as the triple E register standard, which is already in operation and approved by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to ensure that people do not need to wait until 2016 before they can start the process of planning and seeking finance to prepare for such installations.  As the Minister stated, many commercial and industrial operators would gladly embrace this technology, which is of considerable benefit in terms of job creation.  We could embark on exemplar projects that would need to spend a great deal of time in the pipeline, such as district heating systems for clusters of buildings, hospitals, prisons and schools in Portlaoise.

I am sure work has been going on but it is a year and a half since the then Minister published draft guidelines, which were unacceptable, and there was a public consultation process after that.  Little has happened with the exception of two applications being made to the board relating to north Meath.  One is on appeal from the county council for a small development of large turbines near Nobber while the other application is by the Element power company for a massive development across north Meath.<\/p> <p>What will be in the guidelines?  RTE radio knew the other day and it had a good wind of what was happening.  It is important that Parliament should know before a leak to RTE to try to help the Government parties and the Labour Party, in particular.  We need to know whether the guidelines will be acceptable to local communities.  What I hear about 700 m will not be acceptable and there are other issues surrounding the guidelines.  What is the position on applications currently before An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Should the developers not withdraw them, presumably to comply with the revised guidelines, or is it the case that the old guidelines will continue to apply?  No one will give a straight answer on this.  One Fine Gael Deputy in Meath East says they will not apply while another Fine Gael Deputy says they will.  The people deserve to know exactly what is going on in this regard because there should be fairness in planning.  People should know what rules will apply.  Will the Minister change the rules in the middle of the game to suit residents or will he leave the guidelines as they are to suit developers?  That is the choice the Government has to make.<\/p> <p>The 2006 guidelines are out of date and there has been criticism that Fianna F&aacute;il should have revised them previously, but the reality is the turbines proposed for north Meath did not exist during the lifetime of the previous Government.

Anyone who will speak at the hearing will have to know what are the relevant planning guidelines.  There is a planning application for another project before An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is probably nearing decision.  We need to know and there needs to be fairness.

Planning authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la, are required to have regard to my Department's wind energy development guidelines, which were published in June 2006, in making determinations on wind farm development proposals.  These guidelines provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through their development plans and the development management process.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy developments and the treatment of planning applications relating to such developments.<\/p><p>As the Senator noted, in December 2013 my Department published proposed draft revisions to the noise, setbacks and shadow-flicker aspects of the 2006 wind energy development guidelines.  These draft revisions proposed the setting of a more stringent day-and-night noise limit of 40 decibels for future energy developments, a mandatory minimum setback of 500 m between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling - for amenity considerations - and the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings.  A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the guidelines and this ran until 21 February 2014.  My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process.  It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 wind energy development guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.  In this regard, account must be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation process in framing the final guidelines.  Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the wind guidelines.  The revisions to the wind energy development guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  In the interim, the 2006 guidelines will continue to apply to existing planning applications, including those currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>It is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make the appropriate determination in respect of a planning application or appeal, having regard to relevant planning guidelines issued by my Department.

I tabled this Commencement motion last week and coincidentally, there was a report on Newstalk this morning by Kieran Cuddihy, who obtained figures through a freedom of information request regarding national waiting times for children with mild to profound intellectual or physical difficulties who were waiting for assessment.  They showed that 12,650 children nationally are waiting for assessments of whom 3,300 are waiting for longer than the three months that is the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Government's own benchmark.  As for children waiting for treatment, 4,500 are waiting for longer than three months, while 7,908 are waiting for treatment.<\/p> <p>At present, I am dealing with a number of families and I wish to give the Minister of State a flavour of their stories, because each individual case has its own personal story to it.  These are parents who are battling to get services for their child, who may suffer from a mild to a severe disability, be it intellectual or physical.  One such story concerned a child called Harvey, whose general practitioner, GP, referred him to the early intervention team in September 2013.  On 19 September 2013, the parents received a letter from the speech and language therapist regarding the referrals with a questionnaire attached.  On 29 November 2013, Harvey was assessed by the speech and language therapist and the conclusion in her report pertaining to autism stated that Harvey was demonstrating some clinically significant markers for autism, that this would be monitored in subsequent sessions and onward referral would be made to the autism team, as required, and with parental consent.<\/p> <p>The occupational therapist's report, which was based on an assessment carried out on 11 March and 14 April 2014, again referred Harvey on to the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, team for a diagnostic assessment.  The family was told this would happen in February or March 2014 but that date came and went.  It is now approaching June 2015 and the family still awaits that diagnostic assessment.  It had a private assessment carried out, which is accepted by the Department of Education and Skills but not by the HSE, which is the provider of the child services.  I have to hand another e-mail from other parents stating their child did not get proper support due to a significant delay in diagnosing and assessing their child.  Their son has ASD and received a private diagnosis when he was two.  While he receives appropriate resources in school, he is almost seven and the HSE only diagnosed him this year after a long road and battle.<\/p> <p>As Members are aware, early intervention is hugely important and these children have complex needs and need multiple therapies.  The question I specifically asked the Minister of State, because this is also relevant to where I come from in Waterford and is a national issue now it has been highlighted, is how many speech, language and occupational therapists are in the public system in County Waterford?  How long are children with mild to profound intellectual or physical disabilities in Waterford city and county waiting to be assessed?  There appears to be a problem with assessment waiting times and these are stories from parents of children who do not deserve to be obliged to battle the State to get support for their children.  They simply do not deserve that, as these resources should be provided as quickly as possible and under the timeframes to which the Government itself has committed.  Consequently, I raise these issues on their behalf as they have asked me to so do.<\/p> <p>Last year, 80 speech and language therapy posts were announced, not all of which were filled and none of which went to Waterford.  As another 120 further posts are to be announced, how many of those posts will be delivered in Waterford?  It is not just therapists as there also is a need for both child psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, as this is a joined-up system.<\/p> <p>The final point I will make is I visited the Sacred Heart Centre in Waterford city, where the staff provide fantastic support.  It is a joint venture between the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE but the building is dilapidated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Cullinane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The children have complex needs and the building is not fit for purpose.  There is a real need for resources to be put into this area.  Unfortunately, due to waiting times and the lack of therapists, staff and capacity in the system, children are waiting longer than they should.  The children in question have complex needs and we should not fail them.  We should provide parents with every possible support because, as the Minister of State and I are well aware, early intervention is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#G00400","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I agree with most of what Senator Cullinane said, but it is important to read out his exact question, because what he said in his contribution is not exactly what he asked in writing, so I do not have the entire answer to the issues raised.  The Senator inquired about<blockquote><br \/><br \/>the need for the Minister for Health to outline how many speech and language therapist and clinical psychologist posts exist in the public system in Waterford city and county, how many are vacant, how many of the 80 posts announced last year were allocated to Waterford and how many of the additional 120 posts will be allocated to Waterford and to outline waiting times for assessment for children referred with a mild to severe intellectual or physical disability.<\/blockquote>There is no reference to the other areas of psychology to which he referred in his contribution.  That is by way of explanation, because I do not wish Senator Cullinane to say subsequently that I did not answer the entire question.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Cullinane for raising the issue.  The Government is committed to the development of therapy services for children with a disability, including speech and language therapy and psychology services.  Health-related therapy supports and interventions for children with a disability can be accessed through both the HSE's primary care services and its disability services, depending on the level of need.  Speech and language therapy services in Waterford are provided by HSE teams in primary care and disability services, as well as by the Brothers of Charity and the Central Remedial Clinic regional service.  There are currently 15 approved speech and language therapists, or 14.81 in whole-time equivalent terms, in the Waterford service overall.  Six speech and language therapists provide services to the general population of children in primary care.  Five speech and language therapists are assigned to the children's specialist disability services in Waterford.  The remainder look after adults, mental health and other needs.<\/p><p>In addition to these dedicated posts in Waterford, the Central Remedial Clinic regional service provides more specialised speech therapy for particular children with physical and sensory disability across the whole south-east region.  I understand three of the 15 speech and language posts are vacant at present in Waterford.  The filling of a permanent replacement post has been approved and a new post holder is due to take up duty next month.  The local HSE community health organisation management in Waterford has prioritised the filling of the other two posts which are temporarily vacant due to maternity leave.  I understand, however, it has proved difficult to secure appropriately qualified staff to take up these temporary positions.<\/p><p>I also understand there are currently three psychologists employed in Waterford disability services.  In addition, a number of psychologists are employed in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and in primary care services in Waterford.  The HSE has advised that 13 assessment of need applications under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 were received in Waterford for the first quarter of 2015.  A total of 12 of those were commenced within the statutory timeframe.  A total of 22 applications, which have been on hand for over six months, are overdue for completion in Waterford.  On this point, I wish to stress that while any delay in the assessment of a child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any interventions deemed necessary, and guidance to this effect has been issued to front-line staff.  I would be interested to hear from Senator Cullinane whether that is happening.  I will explain the situation in a little more detail later.  Importantly, the HSE has commenced the reconfiguration of children's disability services into geographically based children's disability network teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme.  The objective of the programme is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children from zero to 18 years old, irrespective of the nature of their disability or where they live or attend school.  The transition to this service delivery model is governed by a consultation and engagement process with all stakeholders, including service users and their families.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> A number of HSE community health care organisations are successfully implementing this programme, which requires significant preparatory work in engaging with families, schools and local communities.  It also involves implementing new policies, procedures and protocols in respect of multidisciplinary and multi-agency working.  Once this preparatory work has been completed, additional posts will be provided to support the implementation of the new model of service.  Waterford, which has been working with the other counties in the local HSE community health organisation area, has put in place the required governance structure to allow for the provision of additional posts in 2015.  Additional funding of &euro;4 million has been allocated to the programme in 2015, equating to &euro;6 million in a full year.  In all, 120 new therapy posts will be provided across the country in 2015 and work on finalising the specific allocation of these posts is nearing completion.  The HSE has informed me that, in this context, Waterford and the south east are being prioritised for therapy posts in 2015.<\/p><p>I will explain the reason for the parallel operation of services that sometimes occurs.  Strict compliance with the law would require a diagnosis before an intervention may take place.  It has been made clear to front-line staff - I have stated this several times in this Chamber and elsewhere - that intervention at an early age should not be delayed because a diagnosis has not yet been provided.  When a child has a difficulty with speech it should not be necessary to wait for a diagnosis before speech therapy services are provided.  Similarly, physiotherapy services should be provided to a child who lacks balance or cannot sit up.  I could rattle off a list of difficulties children may experience but it is not necessary to do so.  The necessary interventions should not hinge on the provision of a diagnosis, as occurred in the past.<\/p><p>The progressing disabilities programme for children aged from birth to 18 years has been rolled out in several areas.  It is an incredible programme which does exactly what I have described.  For example, children are not required to be signed up for a specific service or visit a particular service provider and intervention takes place in the community.<\/p><p>Once the 120 posts in this year's allocation have been provided, we will identify gaps in services and assess what further supports are needed to fill these gaps.  We have already done this in the area of mental health.  While no one denies that we are still far from where we should be, we should be able to do things better and in a more smooth manner.  The progressing disabilities programme is the way forward in this regard.  I fully agree with the approach of ensuring governance is in place before assessing which areas have the greatest need.  In that context, Waterford has been prioritised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#H00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's response and the decision to prioritise Waterford city and county once the 120 new posts have been delivered.  I am concerned, however, that 22 applications have been on hand for more than six months and their completion is long overdue.  Perhaps some of the cases I cited are among this group of 22.  If I may, I will forward to the Minister of State e-mails I have received asking questions and expressing concern as they provide evidence of the heartbreaking struggle of parents.  They would also allow her to make up her mind as to whether children are receiving the treatment they need while assessments are ongoing.  From my contact with parents, including e-mails I have received, it is clear that this is not always the case on the ground.<\/p> <p>I do not wish to make a political football of this issue.  My only objective is to ensure the necessary capacity and posts are in place and the children in question receive the supports they need.  When people contact with me to tell me these types of stories I have a duty, as a public representative, to raise the issues directly with the relevant Minister. <\/p> <p>I appeal to the Minister of State to consider the case of the centre in Lady Lane, Waterford, which provides a fantastic service for children.  My view, which is one shared by many parents, is that the building in which the service is located is not fit for purpose and a new, state-of-the-art facility is required.  I am informed that children receive early intervention and support until the age of six years, at which point they lose their supports.  A holistic review of services is required and the centre in Waterford should be replaced with a state-of-the-art facility to ensure children have all the resources they need in the best possible setting.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#J00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I will examine any information the Senator forwards to me.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am not in the habit of making promises which, I suppose, the Senator knows.

I remind Members that 15,000 pensioners and members of the IASS pension scheme are suffering savage cuts to their pension benefits, which allowed Aer Lingus and the airport to wipe away a &euro;740 million pension deficit in order to fatten the company up for sale.

On 7 May, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions produced a report stating that the direct provision system must be made subject to the Ombudsman for Children and the Freedom of Information Acts.  On 22 May, the Ombudsman for Children's report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which will be looked at the week after next, raised specific concerns about mental health services for children in direct provision.  Yesterday, HIQA published the report of its inspection of child protection and welfare services for children living in direct provision centres.  We heard very startling reports.  Today, at the ISPCC inaugural lecture, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, talked about the cultural norm we must have of protecting all children.  We have, in a way, accepted that these children are treated differently.  In this era of equality, we need to say it is no longer good enough.  Given this focus on direct provision - I know we have a cross-party group and our group of nominees has put forward many motions on the issue - I ask the Leader to seek a commitment from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to introduce the working group report on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers, into the Seanad for debate, given our cross-party work on this issue.

Angus MacNeil, the transport spokesman, said that British Airways neglects Scotland.  It has no routes to North America.  We are trying to develop this country, yet we are handing over the national airline to an airline whose track record is not to provide services from Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham or any other region of the UK to North America.  We need that North American investment.  I am calling for the suspension of Standing Orders to make the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, come to the House and say what he is doing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sean D.

Why is a 21% share in an airline which we, the citizens, owned being given away for a paltry sum by the Cabinet today?

This is something on which Senator van Turnhout and I have been working.  It was also the subject of a Commencement debate in the House.  The Minister and the departmental officials met with Senator van Turnhout and I to try to move this forward.  Last night I was delighted to hear that the Minister had announced funding of &euro;1.3 million to provide security for at least 12 months.  However, I believe these organisations should be put on a more sustainable footing.  The Department of Health must move into this area and take over the disability and health organisations that should come under its remit.  It should put proper funding in place for them to give them security, rather than have them not knowing whether they will be in their jobs in a year's time or whether they will be able to provide a service.  Perhaps the Deputy Leader would invite the Minister for Health to the House so we can discuss it in detail.  Otherwise, this will be before the House again this time next year.  Some of us might be back here again too, although some of us might not, and we will be seeking funding again for these organisations for the future.  Now is the time to act and to put it on a more sustainable footing before then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#Q00600","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Aylward on his re-election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

I also second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Barrett.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the tsunami victory that the \"Yes\" campaign achieved over the weekend.  I was very interested in the remarks made by the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin.  As a practising Catholic, I believe that unless the Catholic Church takes heed of the seismic shift in Irish society it will decline further into the abyss.  His remarks were encouraging and acknowledged the situation in which we find ourselves.  It is important that this is done because, historically, the Catholic Church has buried its head in the sand.  I would like to see a move in the Catholic Church to a more centrist position and to an acknowledgement of how society is evolving.  If it does not do that, unfortunately, the church to which I have been attached since my childhood, and as a practising Catholic I will probably die a member of it, is certainly going nowhere and on a hiding to nothing.<\/p> <p>I also rise to acknowledge the tremendous work done by my colleague, Senator David Norris.

I admire his tenacity and his courage in holding out.  He won a very successful court case in Europe, which led to the then Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, taking on board the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  At the request of the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in 2002 and 2003, I chaired a committee on the Constitution, which was the first group to examine the whole area of the family and to recommend civil partnership.  It was a big step in that direction.  At that time I had many discussions with Senator Norris both on and off the record.  It was my view then that a referendum to change the situation at that time would probably have failed.  That was my view and it was the majority view of the committee.  It was a large committee.  I specifically requested the Taoiseach to bring on board the Independents, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party.  Our work was acknowledged, but it would be remiss of me today, as the deputy leader of this group and on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, not to congratulate the \"Yes\" side.  If any person in this country was the catalyst for change who often ploughed a lone furrow, that is Senator David Norris, and I bow to him here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#Q00700","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Before I ask for a debate, I congratulate Senator O'Donovan and the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on the farm safety report, which will be very useful.  We look forward to debating it in the House.<\/p> <p>It is less than 100 years since this country gained independence.  The momentous decision at the weekend shows how much we have moved on in that 100 years.  It has vindicated the work done by Senator Norris, Senator Zappone and many other people in this House.  With regard to the result of the by-election in Carlow-Kilkenny, I wish to congratulate my old adversary from Kilkenny County Council, my good friend Bobby Aylward, on his election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I look forward to working with him as a constituency colleague.  I also congratulate my colleague, Councillor David Fitzgerald, who put up a good show on the Fine Gael ticket.<\/p> <p>It is with regard to the by-election and the referendum that I raise this matter.  I ask the acting Leader to request a debate on the electoral system.  It can be seen that the referendum captured the imagination of the people when one notes that more than 65,000 people registered to vote and more than 2,500 of those were in Carlow-Kilkenny, whether for the by-election or the referendum.  However, what concerns me is that in the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election there were 2,066 spoiled votes, that is, 3% of those who voted, whereas in the referendum vote the proportion of spoiled votes was 1%, over 600 votes, which is the national average.  I saw the boxes being opened because I was helping with the tally, and I saw the spoiled votes being counted and sorted.  More than 1,000 of those spoiled votes had no preference marked on the paper.  Therefore, there were people who wanted to vote in the referendum but did not offer any preference as to whom they wanted as their representative for Carlow-Kilkenny.  Besides the 1,000 papers which showed no preference, there were also spoiled votes that had the usual comments written on them.  Perhaps people are entitled to do as they wish with their vote, but in my view, young people need to be educated on how our PR system works.  As seasoned politicians, we are often baffled as to how voting preferences work.  I noted that some voting papers had 12 preferences indicated for 13 candidates.  It is important that people vote down the list on the voting paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#R00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Time, please, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015052600002#R00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1432647000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Other speakers were given liberty today because it is a momentous day for this country.<\/p> <p>The elimination of the Sinn F&eacute;in candidate resulted in 9,990 non-transferable votes.

I acknowledge, too, all the citizens who voted, whether \"Yes\" or \"No\", for their engagement and the depth of their reflection on their values and on the arguments from both sides.  My Dublin South-West Yes Equality team visited approximately 25,000 households in the course of the campaign and had at least 10,000 conversations with residents on the doorstep.  I was deeply moved, time and time again, by how Irish people engaged in those conversations and showed their care for this State.  I had the wonderful opportunity yesterday to speak with our former President, Mary Robinson, about the referendum.  One of the things she said to me was that it feels like we are back to the early years of her Presidency, when there was great engagement, hope and a vision for change for Ireland, and a consideration of how we might offer that example of change to the rest of the world.<\/p> <p>I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the spokespeople for the \"No\" side, particularly those who sit on the opposite side of this Chamber.

I take this chance to express, one final time, our profound gratitude to that legal team.  It included Senator Ivana Bacik, who sits in this Chamber with me today.<\/p> <p>When we saw that the decision on this fundamental right was to move from the courts to the people, it was not easy in the beginning.  However, we came to the view that if the majority of the people were to say \"Yes\" to equality, freedom and love, it would far outweigh the import of any judicial decision, even that of the highest court in the land.

She intends to seek Government approval for the final draft of the Bill in June and the aim is to introduce it into the Oireachtas immediately thereafter so it can be enacted before the end of this term in July.  The Bill will include a provision to enable couples to convert a notification of intention to enter a civil partnership into a notification of intention to enter a marriage.
