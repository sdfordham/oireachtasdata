We have structured our document to reflect that request and will be delighted to answer further questions members may have.<\/p> <p>  In 2012 Bord Bia developed and launched Origin Green, Ireland's national sustainability programme for the food and drink industry.  The programme was developed in response to international market research which had been commissioned by Bord Bia that confirmed the positive perception internationally of Ireland as a green and natural food producing country.<\/p><p>However, the market research also showed that, in future, ongoing proof of our sustainability credentials would be required.  Origin Green is the programme to provide such proof.  <\/p><p> The Origin Green programme is a voluntary programme that operates across the food chain, from farmers to food manufacturing companies to retailers and food service businesses.  Farmers are members of Origin Green by being certified members of Bord Bia&rsquo;s sustainable farm assurance schemes.  The two largest schemes, the sustainable beef and lamb assurance scheme and the sustainable dairy assurance scheme, have 51,507 and 15,913 members respectively.  This represents over 90% of all beef produced and 90% of dairy farmers.  All farms are audited at 18 month intervals and must meet all of the requirements of the schemes before they can be certified.  Additional sustainability data is also collected at audit that enables the carbon footprint of each farm to be calculated.  To date, over 170,000 carbon footprint assessments have been completed.  Feedback reports to farmers highlight where improvements can be made.  All of Bord Bia&rsquo;s sustainability assurance schemes are independently accredited to the European standard for product certification, ISO 17065.  The carbon footprint models have been developed in partnership with Teagasc and are also independently accredited by the Carbon Trust to the PAS 2050 standard.  Over 36,000 audits are conducted annually.  <\/p><p> At food manufacturing level, producers become members of Origin Green by signing up to the Origin Green sustainability charter and developing a multi-annual sustainability plan for their business which must include setting and achieving targets under three key areas: raw material sourcing; manufacturing processes; and social sustainability.  Achieving the sustainability targets helps to reduce a company&rsquo;s environmental impact, makes the daily running of its operations more efficient and positively contributes to its impact on society and the local community.  In order to become a verified member of Origin Green, food and drink manufacturers must undergo a rigorous initial audit process with plans that are verified independently by the SGS Group, a world leading auditing body.  Thereafter, each annual progress report is verified by SGS, to ensure that timelines and targets, committed to in the plan, are being met.  There are currently 282 verified members of the Origin Green programme which represents over 90% of all of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink exports.  Approximately another 300 companies have registered an interest in the programme or are in the process of formulating plans and setting targets.  <\/p><p> Membership of Origin Green was extended, on a pilot basis, to the retail and food service sector in 2016.  Participation for these companies is, in a similar way to the food manufacturers, through the development and delivery of ambitious targets as part of a five-year plan.  To date, two retailers and four food service businesses have become verified members.  The first years of Origin Green have been very successful as outlined above.  In addition Origin Green has become firmly established as the brand for Irish food and drink internationally and is now used on all branding of Ireland&rsquo;s stands at international food and drink trade events.  Bord Bia and Irish companies will attend 24 this year.  Bord Bia will continue to evolve the Origin Green programme.  We are currently reviewing the first five years and developing a strategy for the next five.  International market insight will again play an important role in informing the strategy.  This market research is currently under way.  <\/p><p> Climate change is one of the major challenges of our generation.  There is scientific consensus that climate change is happening and that it is largely caused by human activity.  Over the past 250 years the burning of fossil fuels, land use change and agriculture has contributed to altered global average temperatures by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, CO2, methane, CH4, and nitrous oxide, N2O.   With the global population projected to increase by more than 2.4 billion people by 2050, the world will need to produce up to twice as much food from increasingly limited resources in uncertain climatic conditions.  This is leading to long-term fears over the security of food supplies in many parts of the world.  <\/p><p> Sustained pressure on the world&rsquo;s already strained resources is also being exacerbated by the ongoing challenges presented by climate change and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  In order to meet these challenges, it will require everyone involved in the agrifood industry to produce more from less and decrease the environmental impact of production, which necessitates the adoption of more sustainable practices.  The FoodWise 2025 strategy of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, while setting ambitious targets for the growth of the agrifood sector, acknowledges the importance of balancing production with environmental management and protection.  It identifies over 70 actions to achieve agricultural sustainability.  Collaboration and co-operation from all stakeholders in the industry will be required to achieve this ambition.  <\/p><p> The Irish food and drink industry has shown an impressive ability to diversify its exports over recent years with almost half of the growth in the value of food and drink shipments since 2010 coming from markets outside of Europe.  Some notable achievements over the period include a six-fold increase in exports to China and more than a doubling to the rest of Asia and North America.  The industry now exports to 180 markets annually.  Reflecting the further growth ambitions of the sector and the uncertain backdrop created by Brexit, Bord Bia has adopted a data-driven approach to help identify potential opportunities for further growth in new and existing markets.  This is being led by a market prioritisation study that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine commissioned Bord Bia to undertake in mid-2017.  The study undertakes a detailed assessment of potential growth markets for meat, dairy, prepared consumer foods, beverages and seafood and selects 15 priority markets for further examination.  <\/p><p> The findings of this work will help Bord Bia and our client companies make decisions on where we invest our resources with a view to delivering the best return for all involved in the sector.  The findings will drive the on-the-ground activities of Bord Bia&rsquo;s international network of 13 offices which work directly with client companies to build market understanding and facilitate business development opportunities.  Our upcoming marketplace event in April will attract 550 to 600 international buyers to Ireland to engage with up to 200 Irish food and drink companies.  It aims to identify potential business opportunities and position Ireland as a source of high quality, sustainably produced food and drink products.  More than half of the international buyers will come from emerging markets outside of Europe.  <\/p><p> The need for the food and drink industry to attract and develop the right talent is critical to its future success, particularly as market demand and consumer needs continue to evolve rapidly.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s industry talent programme currently involves over 100 participants taking part in five key programmes that focus on core areas such as sustainability, marketing and sales and supply chain.  The success of the programmes to date are highlighted by a few key figures: over 80% of participants are being retained in the food and drink industry once they finish their programme; our market fellows work with 40 client companies across 13 export markets; and, in 2017, the expected value of sales attributable to the programme was almost &euro;60 million.  Our Origin Green ambassador programme has seen ambassadors placed in the sustainability teams of 35 of the world-leading food and drink organisations.  The strength of demand for our programmes is demonstrated by the fact that in 2017 our marketing fellowship and Origin Green ambassador programmes attracted 600 applicants for 30 places.  <\/p><p> Bord Bia launched two new programmes in 2017, namely the market placement and MSc in design innovation.  The market placement programme sees participants placed in the operations teams of leading retail and food service customers in export markets for a period of up to 15 months.  The MSc in design innovation, in conjunction with Maynooth University, involves ten participants undertaking a two year design-thinking led approach to insights and innovation.  Participants will be placed with Irish food and drink companies for a period of 20 months to help further embed design thinking into their insight and innovation teams.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, Bord Bia is currently planning and developing its next three-year strategy for the period 2019 to 2021.  This strategy will be based on extensive stakeholder consultation and will be positioned to support the further growth of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink industry.  Origin Green will continue to be a central pillar in delivery of this strategy.  In an increasingly competitive and demanding global marketplace, Ireland can continue to grow its exports through the provision of high quality, sustainably produced food and drink products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCarthy.

I think 89% called for a tax on greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture.  Was Bord Bia invited to present at the Citizens' Assembly?  What is its view in relation to that particular proposition and, to me, the very negative view put on the efforts being made by farmers to address greenhouse gas emissions?<\/p> <p>  The other issue then is on the Origin Green side.  I understand that 60% of the feedstuffs fed to dairy cows, beef cattle, pigs and sheep is imported.  That is increasing year-on-year.  How confident is Bord Bia that this will not affect our food standards?<\/p><p>How can we stand over the quality of the foods we are bringing in when we are promoting our own for export?  We are promoting foods of a certain standard in the context of sustainability, etc.  Of particular concern is the fact that, in respect of the 9 million tonnes of feed consumed, most of the 6 million tonnes imported is made from genetically modified soya and maize.  Is that correct?  If that is the case, surely we need an increase in output from the tillage sector to counter this trend.  I understand that already in the German market there are demands that no food, including cheese, butter and beef, be tainted by genetically modified feed.  The food chain is already being examined there.  I would welcome Ms McCarthy's observations on the matter.<\/p><p> How does Ms McCarthy foresee the tillage sector growing in the future?  Representatives of the sector outlined the challenges and the committee drew up a report.  The sector is making a very positive contribution in the use of the environment as a carbon sink.  I would appreciate Ms McCarthy's response on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#D00300","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCarthy for her excellent presentation.  Bord Bia is one of our standard bearers.  I had the privilege of being on its board for six years.  Its personnel do a very professional job.  It has always promoted the food and drinks industry excellently and done a lot to establish markets for our produce.  In that context, I refer to the reduction of our reliance on the UK market.  Today we talk about Brexit, but 15 or 20 years ago our reliance on the British market was reflected in a far higher percentage of exports.<\/p> <p>  Leaving that issue aside, I refer to the challenges presented by Brexit and Origin Green.  Bearing in mind the fact that a significant amount of the produce we process could soon come from a non-EU member state, what challenges does Ms McCarthy foresee in our promotion of Origin Green status?  There could soon be different standards applied in Northern Ireland and the Twenty-six Counties.  How does Ms McCarthy think this could impact on the good trademark we have developed in Origin Green?<\/p> <p>  We have increased Bord Bia's budget.  Supplementary amounts were allocated in the last two budgets.  If we are serious about reducing our dependence on the UK market and sourcing alternative markets through our offices around the world, what would be a sufficient budget for Bord Bia in the post-Brexit period?  There has been a lot of attention focused on the problems we have had in producing cheddar in the context of Brexit.  We would have the same problems in the beef sector if UK buyers were to turn to South American countries to source beef.  If Bord Bia was to mount a serious drive to divert 30% or 40% of the product exported to the UK market, what resources would be needed?<\/p> <p>  The Bord Bia quality mark has been a success story, although I have a few cribs about the scheme.  On a quality assured farm animals are produced to a certain standard, but only a certain percentage of the animals that leave the farm attract a premium.  A consumer can go into a McDonald's restaurant to buy a burger and see the quality mark, but the farmer who produced the beef does not receive a premium for producing it to that standard.  We have all bought into the need for quality assurance which retailers and consumers are demanding.  However, processors have been allowed to get away with it for too long.  I am not saying every animal produced should attract the same premium, but there should definitely be some premium paid on all animals leaving a quality assured farm.  The quality assurance scheme in place in the dairy sector is roughly a year and a half old.  The dairy sector is different from the beef sector in that a lorry will go to every dairy farm.  We will have 100% compliance within a short time.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to ask a question about the use of antibiotics in the dairy industry.  The vast majority of dairy farmers use them as a preventive measure.  How will this affect the level of quality assurance in the future?  Questions have been raised about the level of antibiotic resistance in humans.  Will this become a condition of the dairy quality assurance scheme?<\/p> <p>  When I was a member of the board of Bord Bia, I was always concerned about the lack of focus on live exports.  How much of the money spent in the beef sector goes towards developing live export markets?  How much money has been spent and how much does Bord Bia plan to spend?  An increasing amount of the stock is coming from the diary herd.  Live exports are of more importance to us than ever before. <\/p> <p>  I also have a question about the fifth quarter.  Thankfully, its value has increased dramatically, while Bord Bia has played its part in securing markets.  As farmers, we find it very hard to determine the value of the fifth quarter to the industry.  I would, therefore, like to see greater transparency on its value to processors. <\/p> <p>  I have two more questions.  We have had a discussion about putting a health warning on alcohol products, similar to the one attached to cigarette packets.  Bord Bia is trying to promote Irish whiskeys and beers in foreign markets.  What is its view on the putting of a health warning on drink products?<\/p> <p>  The last question I want to ask is related to products which are free of genetically modified organisms.  Is there a genuine demand for GMO-free products in the markets we supply?  If there is, is meeting that need a practical aspiration for us?  Will it create a problem?  I refer to the German market, in particular, as we have heard that there is such a demand in Germany.  Is it for what the consumer is asking?  If it is, are we in a position to fulfil that requirement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#E00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCarthy and her colleagues for the presentation.  I have always been a very strong supporter of Bord Bia.  In a cost-benefit analysis it would stand up particularly well to external scrutiny.  As Ms McCarthy said, it has played a pivotal role in ensuring we now have more than 180 markets.  Are there others in the wider world, particularly Asia, which might present opportunities to diversify and Bord Bia could explore?  In the context of Brexit, we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.  What resources does Ms McCarthy think will be required in that regard?  There is an international network of 13 offices which operate directly with client companies.  Are more resources needed to ensure Bord Bia can penetrate and open up other markets?  Even when the economy was on the ground, Bord Bia was not left behind because it was seen as integral to recovering lost and securing new markets.<\/p> <p>  Has there been any notable increase under the beef genomics scheme?  I know that it is a recent development, but has it had any impact on the quality of beef products coming onto the market, which is absolutely critical?  It is probably too early to say, but I hope it is having an impact because I am a very strong supporter of it.<\/p> <p>  Ms McCarthy is clearly concerned that the value of the UK market was undermined by third country imports.  In that context, an initiative could be facilitated by a future agreement negotiated by the United Kingdom.  Will she outline a view on the issue?<\/p><p>Would Bord Bia be in favour of an extended transition period to allow companies to bed in and meet demand in the market?  Coming from a midlands county in which the level of beef farming is significant, there has to be a concern about the significant decrease, a little over 6%, in cattle numbers nationally.  The figure has gone down from 917,000 to a little over 860,000, which is significant.  It is the seed stock of the industry and I am sure the delegates are examining the issue critically.  Even in County Westmeath, the figure is down by approximately 3%, while in County Longford it is down by approximately 5%.  Some of the beef farmers in question are switching to dairy production.  We can see the evidence and I am sure Senator Paul Daly will back me up.  It would have been unheard of a decade or two ago for beef farmers to switch to dairy production.  Is there any way to reverse the trend, perhaps by making payments based on meat yields, with top prices guaranteed for the heavier U and other carcase grades which present a significant difficulty for some farmers, particularly in the midlands, who try to finish cattle in the best way possible?  That has to be a concern; otherwise we will not have seed stock and be able to compete in many markets.  We have increased significantly the quality of our beef stock.  Not too long ago, only one in four animals was of sufficient quality to achieve the price charged by supermarkets across the European market.  <\/p><p> These are matters about which I am concerned and we have to keep our eye on the ball.  If the seed stock drops away, I know that there is an argument that the suckler cow subsidy should be restored which might be one way to address the issue, but it may not be the only way to ensure it.  Making payments based on meat yields might be a more positive way to achieve the same result with reference to the economic return for farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#E00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I will start with Senator Michelle Mulherin's questions.

Our perspective is that they will feed into policy discussions.  We would have had many other comments to add from the perspective of Origin Green which was not deeply discussed at any stage.  At a similar time, we undertook, independently of the Citizens' Assembly, a campaign in order that the public in Ireland would be aware of what was going on in the context of Origin Green.  We invited people to learn more about the campaign and the work being doing by the food industry by visiting the Origin Green website.  It was viewed as a successful campaign in generating a strong level of awareness among the public.

We are confident, therefore, about the feed being used on quality assured farms.  Under our quality assurance schemes, Bord Bia has responsibility for the quality assured farms, including 50,000 beef farms and nearly 18,000 dairy farms, all of which must source their feed from quality assured sources.

We commissioned this work last year which was part of a review that we were undertaking.  It was to look at the matter from the perspective of both dairy and beef producers.  We wanted to understand whether it was a consumer or a trade issue.  The Senator's comment on Germany not wanting to accept any non-GM product was not exactly accurate.  Lidl has launched a private label product in Germany.  It has called its private label range, with a very limited range of products, non-GM, on which it is not paying any premium to any supplier.  It is counted as a discount product which has created some concern for the Irish suppliers involved.

While the most recent figures show a decline in our exports, from 37% to 35%, the British market is still our fundamental export market.  There is a logic to it in that it is our closest market, we speak the same language, have a similar taste profile and it is an efficient market to deliver products with a short shelf life.  There is movement towards the managing the risk attached to overdependence on any one customer or particular market.  Our budget has been increased significantly again this year.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine announced an additional allocation of 32 staff to Bord Bia.  In an organisation that has a headcount of 110 to date we believe we will be very focused on ensuring we properly absorb the additional 32 staff and value of money is achieved for the additional funding received.  In the short term there has not been an additional ask as we seek to make sure we will get value for money.  <\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Maloney to address the quality assurance issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will address the cribs about quality assurance and the percentage of animals on which premiums are paid.  It is not fully understood that it is called a quality assurance premium, but there are additional requirements over and above being a member of a quality assurance scheme to be met to allow animals to qualify for the premium.<\/p><p>However, there are additional requirements over and above being members of a quality assurance scheme to enable animals to qualify for the premium.  That leads to a certain degree of frustration.  It is called a quality assurance premium and quality assurance is one of the criteria required to be met to enable the premium to be paid, but there are other criteria related to the age of the animal, the fat score, the confirmation of the animal, the number of movements and so on.  If he or she meets all of the criteria, the farmer qualifies for the premium.  We have set up the quality assurance scheme in such a way that all animals from a quality assured farm are quality assured.  To qualify for the premium, the additional requirements have to be met.<\/p><p> Reference was made to dairying and the concerns about antimicrobials and antibiotics.  That is a concern, but we have addressed it in our quality assurance scheme.  There is increasing concern and we continue to promote and monitor the responsible use of antibiotics on farms.  A big part of the focus of auditors when they conduct an audit is ensuring the correct remedies are used, as well as the correct dosage.  If antibiotics are under or overused or not used for the correct period, it leads to antimicrobial resistance.  A significant part of the audit is focused on the correct use of antibiotics.  A national action plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance has been launched by the Government.  Bord Bia is part of the plan.

There will be a number of key export and commercial meetings facilitated during the visit.  We will also undertake a number of advertising campaigns to support what Ireland is doing.  The Dutch market will be targeted particularly.  It is an area on which we have focused, but the focus will increase significantly.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned GM.  As per the previous response, we are researching the issue, particularly because of some of the market activities in Germany and because of the claims Ireland wants to make.  We are liaising significantly with the industry because it is a complex matter when it comes to the food industry and costs are associated with it.  We want to ensure before any recommendation is made on what the market requirements may be it will be profitable for the industry also.  Current operations undertaken by retailers in Germany would not generate a premium, although they would add costs for anybody in Ireland looking to do so.  Our concern is to ensure what is going on there is an absolute market fact and to understand the dynamic behind it both from a consumer and a trade perspective because sometimes the two diverge.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the health warning carried on drink products, we will respect whatever legislators come up with and work with the law within the land in which we are operating.<\/p> <p>  On the fifth quarter, there has been an increase, particularly in markets in the east.  As we have developed these markets and the Deputy may have seen in our performance and prospects, we are looking to call out the identification of from where the market values are coming and explain it to exporters and producers with as much transparency as our figures will allow.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Penrose's questions.  Other markets, new opportunities and new resources are a key priority for us.  We undertook with funding from the Department a complete project on market prioritisation mid-year and we did this not just from the perspective of looking out for Ireland and its food industry.  We divided the industry into key sectors to identify where the opportunities are for beef, pork, lamb, all other meats, and dairy products such as cheese and powders.  We subdivided those by our seafood exports, prepared consumer foods and commissioned separate studies into each.  We looked at the top 30 exports to 180 markets by sector.  We divided that to look at the top 15 markets and now, in collaboration with industry, we are looking at the top five markets.  We are trying to create a targeted approach to market access conversations as well as to our own priorities.  We will put in new resources with the additional headcount for which we have been approved to help us to exploit the opportunities that are identified.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, Brexit is a huge concern.  We have met to discuss the issue every single week since the referendum.  We are looking to manage every element of the risks Ireland faces.  The risks we face are multifaceted, ranging from organising our supply chain to understanding the route to market and the dynamic that will change in the UK market also.  We have maintained close relationships with our key retail customers, from whom the feedback tells us that their brands are very much built on the trust that they have earned with consumers and that, therefore, their supply chain must be trusted by consumers also.  That gives us some solace regarding Ireland's position both from the perspective of the British consumer and the trade.  However, we would appreciate as extended a transition period as possible throughout the negotiations.

I have two questions about Brexit and climate change.  <\/p> <p>  Ms McCarthy has said the feedback from producers is positive in maintaining supply following Brexit.  However, the feedback does not account for tariffs, controls and so on, which will impact on businesses.  I wonder about the possibility of developing alternative markets.  Realistically, France and other countries in continental Europe are the alternatives, but the quality and standard of products are totally different.  For example, there is no market for cheddar cheese other than England.  How much work is being done to make this change?  It will probably have to happen.  Ms McCarthy has said the United Kingdom accounts for 35% of our trade.  Which country accounts for the next highest percentage?<\/p> <p>  Ms McCarthy has explained how Origin Green works, but climate change and sustainability were dealt with in a different section of the presentation, whereas they should have been discussed with Origin Green.  Origin Green and climate change policy should provide protection for the food sector, but do they?  Why do they make up two sections of the presentation?<\/p><p>How is climate change feeding into Origin Green?  I think that is vitally important.  Is Origin Green just a marketing tool rather than an effective tool that will make a difference to producers and to this country's climate footprint?  It is vital for Irish agriculture to recognise that climate change is an issue.  While recognising that it is an issue, we can develop our markets in a manner that counteracts it in some way.  We can that accept there are high emissions in this sector and attempt to counteract that by trying to reduce them in another sector.  At least we should be able to say it and do it.  That is very important.  I am aware that some companies that previously had Origin Green marks were challenged by the Environmental Protection Agency for reasons associated with pollution, etc.  How does that square with the whole Origin Green project and with climate change as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#G00700","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCarthy for her comprehensive presentation.  I would like to ask a couple of questions about the market prioritisation study she mentioned.  Origin Green is well established and has developed many markets.  Is there a strategy for developing new markets, as opposed to extending existing markets?  Are there comparisons to be made in that regard?  It is sometimes suggested that it might be best to pursue a policy of \"what we have, we hold\".  In other words, if we take our eye off the ball by trying to increase the number of new markets, we might not be able to look after existing markets.  Have any studies been done to ascertain which strategy yields the best or most development from exports?  Are exports increased by focusing on new markets, or does a concentration on the development of existing markets provide more opportunities?<\/p> <p>  I would like to follow up on what has been said about quality assurance with specific reference to the importation of grain under Origin Green.  I ask Ms McCarthy to comment on the markets that might become open in the event of a total focus on organics.  If it proves possible to source and tap into such markets, will we have sufficient supply here?  Do we have enough organic farmers?  If not, why not?  Do those who have experience on the global market believe there is a future for Ireland in the event of a move from Origin Green to full organic?  If so, what can we do to encourage more farmers to take the extra step and get fully involved in organic farming?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#H00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the capable and comprehensive presentation that has been made.  I would like to refer to a few particular issues.  Most of the topics have been covered.  A review of the Origin Green strategy from 2019 to 2021 is taking place.  I think sustainability is the big stumbling block in the agriculture industry at the moment.  We need to consider where we are going with the current model.  The Minister has spoken extensively about this issue, particularly over the last six months.  Will sustainability be a major plank of the Origin Green strategy as it goes forward?  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on whether, as we seek to make sure the Irish agriculture sector is sustainable, we will need to monitor the sustainability of the carbon footprint of the sector.  It should be acknowledged that an increase of 32 in the number of staff is very significant.  I suggest it shows a great commitment on the part of Bord Bia to what is required for it to do its job on the international stage.<\/p> <p>  I do not think the poultry sector has been mentioned today.  I would like to get some figures as an update on the development of Origin Green in the poultry sector.  Ms McCarthy provided some comprehensive figures for the beef and dairy sectors, but I would be interested to know how the poultry sector is tied into the Origin Green effect.  There have been phenomenal successes in the dairy and beef sectors.  This is obvious in every supermarket.  I wonder whether the poultry sector is enjoying the same take-up at market level.  Is there an issue with produce coming to this island to be remodelled or processed and then exported, perhaps not with the Origin Green label but with a Republic of Ireland label or with the Tricolour attached to it?  Is this becoming a major factor in the poultry market?  I refer to the practice of bringing in produce from France or Germany to be chopped up, remodelled or repacked for export without the Origin Green branding.  Do housewives and people on the street know that produce that is manufactured in this way is not Irish?  I am very interested in where we are going with the poultry sector and in how we can close any marketing loopholes that exist, particularly in the context of the proposed Origin Green strategy from 2019 to 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#H00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I will begin by responding to Deputy Pringle.  He is absolutely right that tariffs are a significant concern for companies in the context of Brexit.  If we were so inclined, we could do nothing other than look at the many possible Brexit scenarios.  We are trying not to get blocked into that one.  We are looking at doing the risk analysis for companies.  Last year, we did a significant piece of work called the \"Brexit barometer\".  We spoke to representatives of companies that account for approximately 70% of exports to the UK about their key areas of concern.  The Deputy is absolutely right when he suggests that tariffs, the calculation of tariffs and non-tariff barriers are key areas of concern.  We need to look at the complexity that Brexit will add to the supply chain.  Delays at borders will cause new costs, perhaps because of decreases in product quality, longer hours worked by lorry drivers or other time factors.  New challenges will be faced on the route to the market.  New competitors will be encountered as well.  Other challenges relate to currency issues and the associated volatility.<\/p> <p>  We have been looking at helping companies to calculate tariffs.  As many of our exporters export predominantly to the UK, or even to the UK and Europe, they have not had any experience of touching tariffs for many years.  We have two objectives in mind.  We are working out the risk, but we are also looking at market diversification, which means we will need new skills in our industry.  As the idea of going outside the EU becomes more realistic, skill sets will need to be developed.  We are piloting a new training programme with companies so that they understand how to work with tariffs.  We want to make sure that is bedded into their system.  While Brexit is not considered desirable or helpful within the industry, it is accepted as a market reality.  We need to know we can deal with it.  We are introducing a training programme for companies with that perspective in mind.<\/p> <p>  We are also looking at it from another perspective.  Companies that import certain products, such as some of the ingredients they use, are facing a realistic threat as well.  They need to know how to calculate the import tariff.  They need to understand the consequences of such imports from the perspective of VAT refunds, for example.  They need to know whether Brexit will increase the cost of doing business with their suppliers.<\/p> <p>  I am not suggesting nobody is worried about Brexit.  There are multiple concerns when it comes to Brexit.  We are trying to break it down into manageable and realistic chunks by focusing on skill sets, on what people can do about Brexit and on the scenarios that might have risks associated with them.  The focus on scenarios has led to the market diversification projects we have been looking at.  That has not resulted in a suggestion that we should all move to France or Germany.  We are dealing with very different stories in each product category.  Some sectors have very few options as they decide what to do.  Approximately 95% of the exports in the horticulture industry go to the UK.  There are quite a few options in that industry because its products tend to have a seven-day shelf life and, thankfully, attract low tariffs.  We are trying to ensure we add as much value as possible in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Particular reference has been made to the cheddar market.  Clearly, 50% of our cheddar exports go to the UK.  We do not envisage that the first opportunities for those products will be in France.  That is why we specifically called out cheddar within the market prioritisation process.  We are finding that we need to look at where food service products are growing.  Rather than focusing on the kind of high-quality mature cheddar that is produced today, we are looking at the use of processed cheddar in products like burgers and pizzas, etc.  We are looking for such base opportunities in various markets in the first instance.  We have already found that the Japanese market is potentially a strong market for importing cheddar into.  As a result of the new Japan-Europe trade deal, the tariffs on those products will decrease significantly in the coming years.  We are looking outside the box at such opportunities.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier, we want as long a transition as possible to facilitate the negotiations on Brexit.  It will take time for Ireland to build its reputation in these markets.  It will take time to recognise who the right contacts in those markets are.<\/p><p>We would appreciate having as much time as possible, as would our exporters.  <\/p><p> The Deputy asked where the next market after the United Kingdom was.  We export over &euro;4 billion worth of goods to the United Kingdom.  The United States is our second largest market.  It hit the &euro;1 billion mark this year for the first time.  Some 50% of our exports to the United States are alcohol products.  Dairy products account for the second highest percentage.  We consider Europe to be one group of countries, to where 33% of our exports go.  <\/p><p> The Deputy asked which markets were growing the fastest and where there was growth.  Last year there was 8% growth in exports to the UK market, 16% growth in exports to the European market and 17% growth in exports to international markets.  Growth was very robust.  As Deputy Jackie Cahill knows, dairy prices, particularly butter prices, skewed a lot of the figures because, given our butter exports to the Netherlands and Germany, butter export values increased significantly and that had an impact.  There are multiple factors that influence the where, what and why in all of these markets.  We are trying not to ask to what country we will go but rather what sector will be the most attractive in what location.  We are merging the two scenarios and looking at the macroeconomic forces, the ease with which we can export to a particular country and its track record with Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The very simple reason climate change and sustainability are under a separate heading in our submission is we were asked to submit under four headings - Origin Green, climate change and sustainability, market diversification and talent.  The Deputy is correct.  Sustainability is an integral part of the Origin Green programme which operates at two levels.  It operates for food companies and at farm level.  At farm level, farmers are members of Origin Green by being part of our sustainable assurance schemes, our quality assurance schemes with sustainability added.  Farmers are required to give us data that allow us to calculate the carbon footprint on their farms.  As mentioned in our submission, to date we have made over 170,000 of those carbon footprint calculations.  The provision of that information allows us to feed back to the farmer his or her carbon footprint relative to his or her peers and we can demonstrate where improvements can be made.  We are moving on to look at other areas surrounding biodiversity, water quality and all of that.

We must get it from them.  We have also developed, with Teagasc, a carbon navigator tool, a tool that combines the economic performance of farms with their greenhouse gas emissions.  With the carbon navigator tool, we can demonstrate what effect achieving certain efficiencies on a farm would have on its carbon footprint and profitability.  A good example to illustrate what I mean is looking at the length of the grazing season, which in part of the country might be 290 days.  If it could be increased to 300 days, it would have an effect on the carbon footprint because animals on grass have less of an effect on the environment than animals which are housed indoors.  It is also cheaper and more economic to keep animals on grass.  It increases the efficiency of the farm and also profitability.  That is how farmers are members of Origin Green.<\/p> <p>  Companies are also members of Origin Green.  We have mentioned that there are 282 companies that are verified members of Origin Green and that account for over 90% of exports.  For a company to be a member of Origin Green, it has to sign up to a charter.  It has to set targets to achieve sustainability.  Companies must set targets for raw material sourcing, manufacturing processes and social sustainability, including health and nutrition, worker welfare and so on.  They are not targets they can just set by themselves and get a pass on them.  SGS which is internationally recognised as a world leader in auditing and verification analyses the targets for individual companies and only if it is satisfied that they are stretch targets, realistic and credible can a company become a verified member of Origin Green.  Companies have to meet these targets; set out a three-year plan and submit them to us for analysis on an annual basis to show they have met the targets.  In addition to the 282 companies that have been verified, we have another 300 that are registered but not yet over the line because they are in the process of toing and froing with us on the setting and credibility of the targets they are setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Maloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>What would make a company lose its Origin Green status?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#J00500","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>It would lose it if it did not meet the targets it had set out to achieve, unless there was <i>force majeure<\/i>or something like it which had caused it not to reach its targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Maloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Would that include spillages, failure to deal with effluent pollution and stuff like that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#J00700","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>They are particular areas that involve environmental licences and ensuring they meet the requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Maloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Is that not part of the Origin Green programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#J00900","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>No, EPA licensing is separate from Origin Green.

On new and current markets, our approach is to invest in market insight initiatives to understand the dynamics of a particular market.  In some of our mature markets there is a level of sophistication in our understanding which shapes the promotions we undertake in them.  In some of our newer markets there is much more exploratory research.  Very often those involved in them do not know where Ireland is and we are looking to understand how best we can make a pitch for Ireland to them.<\/p><p>A clear example of that is when we were looking at the Chinese market and trying to understand whether China respected Ireland and what assets Ireland had that we could communicate to the Chinese consumer.  We were looking to position in that market because we do not have the funding of a branding company to conduct huge branding campaigns.  We need to use our assets as much as possible and to leverage Ireland's values as much as we can.  We have a thinking house facility, which is an insight centre that we have invested in over the past year and half, particularly in our office in Dublin.  We have researchers in that facility whom we send overseas.  They went to China and spent time with Chinese consumers in their homes, speaking to them about what is important to them, and, in particular, about the dairy products they consume and what makes them choose one product over another.  Their awareness of Ireland at the time was low but they linked Ireland to Europe and European regulation and standards were important to them.  We then researched in a number of different cities to explore in-depth the language that should be used when speaking about Ireland, the respect they would have for tradition versus technology and making sure that we were understood within that market as we tried to communicate to those consumers the benefits of a sustainable food production and the traceability systems we have in a simple way.  We found with Chinese consumers, which is different from European consumers, that they wanted us to demonstrate the merging of technology and tradition.<\/p><p> With regard to the images we used, they were not interested in seeing Irish rain, for example, because in China pollution is very often associated with rain and, therefore, why would rain be connected to food?  They were impressed with images showing the clarity of rivers, etc., that we could share with them.  They wanted the farmers that we were illustrating to them not to be the traditional farmer, which we have often used in imagery.  They wanted to see a young farmer with an iPad beside a modern tractor.  Again, one is talking about an industry that has tradition and respects the farming culture but uses technology well so that the consumers can trust the technology.  It is about the merging of modernity and tradition and how we can position that to show what Ireland does best.  They could respect and understand that.  The approach we took there, compared to the approach we take in the German or UK market, which we know much better, was much different.  We can go straight to product category in Germany given the respect consumers have for Irish traditions and their knowledge of Ireland whereas in newer markets, we first have to ground where Ireland is and then introduce the systems the country has before getting into marketing the product.<\/p><p> With regard to quality assurance and the move towards organic farming, Origin Green welcomes organic products within it.  It is not an either-or of a journey.  Organic producers are members of Origin Green and we hope that will add to their proof points or credentials.  There are further opportunities for organic products in the market, particularly for organic dairy products.  There is huge demand in eastern markets for organic infant formula, for example, and many organic dairy products.  It might also explain the backdrop to us looking at grass because sometimes natural is a short cut to organic.  We are looking for consumers to understand that natural equals grass fed whereas organic adds to that and attracts a higher premium.  What we are trying to understand in our research all the time is how to position Ireland to best fulfil its commercial potential.  There are further opportunities for Ireland to increase organic production and there are markets for organic products but the pricing needed to make organic production profitable is not as obvious as people sometimes assume.  For example, many continental retailers discount organic products in the same way they discount mainstream products.  It is not the \"Eureka\" that it is positioned as but it is definitely a space that has huge opportunities.  Ireland competes successfully in markets for organic salmon and most of the salmon we export is organic.  That is one of the main categories we operate in on an export platform and there are not that many other categories that we export organic in on any scale.<\/p><p> Senator Lombard asked about our strategy and the journey we are on.  We have two major projects under way.  The first project is looking at the next five years of Origin Green.  Over the past five years, there has been a sustainability agenda.  If we conversed five years ago, the Citizens' Assembly would not have been in operation and would not have been as eloquent in speaking to the challenges around sustainability in comparison to today.  The market has significantly changed, as have the expectations of both the consumer and the producer.  We logically expect it to change even further over the next five years.  We are conducting significant research in our main markets and in new markets to understand where the sustainability agenda is going.  We want to bring that information home in order that we can build our sustainability credentials and build Origin Green to ensure it is ready for the next five years of its existence.  While that research will feed into our strategy work, we are engaging widely with our stakeholders in this work, particularly Irish companies as well as acknowledging the politics that surrounds Bord Bia ranging from the producer organisations to the EPA or the Department, as they have a perspective on the future of Irish agriculture, and we want to ensure that we find out what is meaningful to them.  It will be very much informed by the market drivers and we will have detailed research looking at the key forces of change from a consumer and a market perspective.  A coalition of those forces will decide our new strategy.  We have every expectation that sustainability will be at the heart of that.  We had a small business event earlier and sustainability was highlighted in every market force that we described at it.  We have no doubt that sustainability will be a major underpinning of our future strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#J02100","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>The Senator asked about poultry.  I focused on dairy and beef because they are our largest schemes.  However, we have quality assurance schemes across the board.  At farm level, we have schemes for poultry, eggs, pigmeat, and horticulture.  We are in the process of converting the schemes from our traditional quality assurance schemes to sustainability assurance schemes.  Our beef and dairy schemes have been converted to sustainability assurance schemes and they are fully accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Board.  Our egg scheme has just got over the line to be converted as well.  We are in the process of converting the poultry and pig schemes but that process takes time because the conversion has to be done with input from key stakeholders.  We cannot, therefore, change schemes and impose them.  Under the rules of accreditation, which are important because they are recognised internationally, we must involve stakeholders.  We want to do that anyway because the schemes are for them.  The technical committee on the poultry scheme has met a number of times and we expect that the scheme will be converted by June or July this year.  A total of 95% of the poultry produced in Ireland is processed under our existing quality assurance schemes and it is a similar scenario for pig production.  While the number of producers may be much smaller than the number of beef or dairy farmers, almost 100% of the product is covered.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also raised the issue of the concern relating to imported product being chopped up and relabelled.  There is concern about whether the consumer is being misled when the product is sold with a tricolour on it.  We can speak for the 95% of the product that is processed in Ireland under the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme.  If it is produced under the scheme, it can carry the Bord Bia quality mark, which has \"Quality Assured\" and \"Origin: Ireland\" on it.  One will see that on all the products that come through under the scheme in supermarkets.<\/p><p>That means that the product was born, reared and slaughtered in Ireland.  At over 90%, consumer awareness of the quality assurance mark is extremely high.  We have carried out quite a bit of research with consumers because all of our advertising in the home market is very much based on the quality assurance mark.  We encourage consumers to look for it and know from where products come.  They are the messages we send and they are getting across to the consumer.  As I said, there is very high consumer awareness of the quality assurance mark and what it stands for.  It stands for quality but also origin, as consumers understand.  The message we are driving home is that they should look for it.  If a consumer is concerned and wants to support what is produced from start to finish in Ireland, he or she must look for the quality assurance mark.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Maloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>On the review due to take place on the poultry side which I hope will be completed by June or July - it will be followed by the Christmas period only a few months afterwards - is Maloney proposing a marketing campaign to ensure the multiples and the major buyers will buy into it?

In terms of animal welfare and achieving sustainability and strong environmental standards, there is a very strong brand that benefits farmers immensely.  I am very impressed by it and in due course will place some recommendations before the committee.  This touches on the questions asked by Deputy Thomas Pringle.

Farmers often say to me that it is a niche market and too limited.  It has not been accepted that if people want to have sustainable farming and rural communities, they will have to pay a little more than they are for a range of produce.  I want to get a sense that the consumer is being so educated.  This is applicable globally, not just to Bord B&iacute;a.  Are we really engaging with and explaining to consumers that if they want to know about animal welfare and achieve environmental standards and the sustainability of rural communities, they will have to pay a little more for that quality produce?  If they want to make sure climate change and environmental standards are adhered to, they will have to pay a little more.  How are the delegates joining up the dots?  Deputy Thomas Pringle's question was fair, as was Mr. Maloney's response.  The committee presented that structure to the delegates.  How does one ensure consumers are educated in order that they understand they will have to pay a little more?  Where does the plan all fit together?

The Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are talking about the need to ensure there will be no barriers to trade and that there will be an all-Ireland approach to the agrifood sector, but I am picking up on criticism of Bord B&iacute;a's approach in that it seems barriers are being put in place in adopting a genuine all-Ireland approach.

Do they have any worry that 10,000 extra cattle are being killed to have the same tonnage of beef?  They are the latest statistics.<\/p><p>Bord Bia had a system with the dairy farms and then came into the beef farms.  Farmers in the dairy sector had an opportunity to sort something out and come back a few weeks later, whereas the quality assurance lasted for a certain length of time on the beef sector.  Is that still the case or has it been rectified?<\/p><p> Ms McCarthy spoke about the carbon navigator earlier.  Farmers are being charged fairly heavy prices for doing these carbon navigators.  Is it a concern that at the end of the day the farmer is paying for nearly all of these new add-ons to make things better?  I know it is in the interest of food, but generally they are not getting any more for what they produce.<\/p><p> Ms McCarthy mentioned the organic sector.  Senator Mac Lochlainn and Deputy Pringle also mentioned it.  I know of many people who go to the ordinary mart because it does not pay them to go to the organic sales.  They go to the ordinary commercial marts with their stock.  There does not seem to be a niche market for that.  I believe the hill lambs are organic because when they are up on hills they are not getting too many injections or anything.  They have no good market for the hill lamb at the moment.  Why are we not doing something on that end?<\/p><p> We are hearing stories that the China market is close to being open for us.  Does Ms McCarthy have any update on that?<\/p><p> Restrictions on the movement of cattle are causing problems for farmers.  If an animal was in two or three different farms, provided it was looked after properly, it is the same animal that gets eaten.  We have the 30 month requirement.

If we had more resources, could we do more to reduce our dependence on the UK market?<\/p> <p>  A point was made about quality assurance and the different add-ons there are to qualify for premium.  The reality is that processors are using quality assurance as a marketing tool.  They are being disingenuous to farmers in not paying a premium for all animals coming from farms that are quality assured.  In some cases only 30% or 35% of the animals coming from a farm are getting the premium even though all the meat would be marketed as quality assured.  That issue needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Of the money Bord Bia spends on the beef side, what percentage is devoted to live exports?  As a promotional body, what is Bord Bia's view on the consequences for our sales in foreign markets of the proposed health warning on drinks?<\/p> <p>  There is one other point on which I felt I did not get a satisfactory answer.

In many of the sectors Ireland plays in a very small niche when we look overseas.  As I mentioned earlier, salmon is the only category we would have any volume of organic exports.  We do a lot of work on the home market to help organic producers to understand the route to market for organic food.  We have done a lot of work on farmers' markets in particular to ensure they are able to communicate the value of what they offer within their organic range and to assure where possible they can get that premium for their product.

If meat origin is being misrepresented in the marketplace then that is an issue for bodies other than Bord Bia.  We do not have responsibility for policing how meat is stamped, sold or portrayed in the marketplace.  That is not a role for us.  Other agencies have that remit.  As I said earlier, we have responsibility for the products that carry the Bord Bia quality assurance mark.   We promote them and police the system.  We  police it at farm level and, particularly, at factory level.  When we go to the meat processors we carry out extensive audits to ensure that, in terms of traceability and reconciliation, it is only quality assured products that come out of the meat factory that carry the Bord Bia mark.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the beef quality assurance scheme.  I think it is the closed-out model for beef.  We had a situation in our previous beef scheme whereby, if non-compliances were raised at farm level, then the farm fell out of certification and had to reapply.  Last April we introduced a new scheme and changed the rules to have a closed-out model in line with our other schemes.  Therefore, if a farmer gets a non-compliance notification, following an audit, he or she gets 30 days to rectify the problem.  Provided the matter is resolved within 30 days, he or she remains certified for the 30 days and will continue to be certified.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that farmers are charged a heavy price for carbon navigation.  In actual terms, farmers are not charged.  There is no fee to be paid by the farmer to be part of the programme.  I presume he was referring to the things that farmers have to do to pass the audit.  In terms of all of those things, and particularly since we moved to the closed-out model for farms, there seems to be very little negative feedback on the schemes.  Farmers appreciate that the criteria for the quality assurance schemes are criteria that reflect good practice at farm level.  There is also an appreciation that being part of a quality assurance scheme, and a sustainability assurance scheme, is important for market access and trying to access better markets.<\/p> <p>   In terms of the movement of cattle and whether an animal aged 30 months and three days tastes better or worse than one aged 30 months less three days or one that has not reached its 30-month birthday.  That is an issue for the meat factories and their customers.  If their customers demand a product that is less than 30 months of age then that is a specification individual factories must meet in order to meet the requirements of their contracts.  As far as Bord Bia is concerned, we have left our quality assurance as broad as possible so as many animals as possible can qualify.  We insist on animals spending 70 days on the final farm or farms but they can move a number of times and still be quality assured by us.<\/p><p>The marketplace will dictate in certain markets, and in certain higher spec markets, that the number of movements are restricted and that the age of the animal is restricted.  I mention confirmation, the fat score and the weight as well.  That would reflect an earlier comment about extra cattle for the same tonnage of beef, and smaller carcases being required in regard to that.  Our schemes try to keep it as broad and as open as possible.  Then it is really a matter for the meat factories and their customers to work out the details of the contracts and which animals meet particular contracts.  I do not know if Ms McCarthy wants to pick up on any other matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#N01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Maloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>There are two other matters, namely, organic and Connemara hill lamb.

We do a number of campaigns promoting lamb, and the particular markets which we have been looking to grow within that have been the French, German, Swedish and Swiss markets as we move our dependency away from the UK market and, in particular, the French market.  It is in those newer markets that we are looking to create a premium for the product and to really market the naturalness of our product.  We have been doing European campaigns as well in order to amplify the spend we have so that in partnership with the French and the UK we have been able to get funds from Europe to market European lamb and then within that, obviously, to have a position for Irish lamb.<\/p> <p>  Lamb, as a product this year, had a reasonably good finish to the year.

We are in consultation with industry at present in order to undertake a new meat strategy.  We will look specifically at the products - again this is dictated by the challenges Brexit will pose for us - and at where the best places and the best value for Ireland Inc. will be in terms of its promotional campaigns.  We are sitting down with industry, and in partnership with Meat Industry Ireland, as part of that stakeholder consultation to get their guidance and input as to where they believe the best bang for our buck will be achieved, as we look at the different positionings and marketing opportunities for Ireland, first, for quality assured lamb, and then for different opportunities for niches within that.<\/p> <p>  We were asked for an update on the Chinese market.

We will we have challenges within that.  Would I say a 32 headcount for an organisation of 110 is not a huge investment and vote of confidence from the Government in it?  Absolutely not.  One cannot do every single job in year one.  What we are trying to do is to phase ourselves and our budgets are given to us on an annual basis for the jobs that we have described to the Government that we need to get done this year, in addition to the &euro;6.7 million we were given in September of last year.  We are adequately funded to get us through this year.  We will obviously keep dialogue going with all Government parties to ensure that adequate funding takes us step by step through it.  What we do not want is to given funding that we cannot spend with a good value-for-money head on us.  If one threw money at a problem, one would not get good value for money.  Each of the projects we have presented have been funded by Government.  What we would regularly do is to keep dialogue going during supplementary budget discussions.  If there are new jobs to which we have resources to allocate and if we have resources we can disseminate back out to industry, all these will be influences on the asks we have of Government.

The culled cow coming off that farm is meeting the same standards as the 18-month old heifer coming off the farm.  The processor buying that culled cow is using the fact the animal is quality assured to help sell the product but the farmer is getting no return for that.  There are farms that are quality assured but would have no animals coming off them attracting a premium.  That is wrong.  Quality assurance was the brainchild of Bord Bia and it has worked very well.  I am not questioning the scheme at all, but factories are using the quality assurance, which is what it was brought in for, to promote our beef.  However, they are not being genuine with the people who participate in the scheme.  I accept that they say that in order to qualify for the top level of premium, the animal must be under 13 months and be graded in a certain grade.  However, I refer to the culled cow going out the gate and the farm which is meeting all the standards required and the O minus bullock or the O minus heifer going out the gate, which is what many farmers are producing.<\/p><p>Where a culled cow, or an O minus bull or heifer, which a lot of farms produce, goes out the gate, the farmer is paid nothing for adhering to the standards.  If those farmers opted out of the scheme in the morning, it would give processors a very severe headache.  They should look at that seriously.  We met the representatives of the milk promotion body.  They have a lovely glossy brochure, but it did not contain one picture of a black and white cow, yet those cattle are producing more than 50% of our beef.  That should be recognised.  For example, one sees Aberdeen Angus beef on the shelves and all these standards apply.  However, a significant number of Aberdeen Angus cattle that are killed do not qualify for quality assurance.  Factories are being short-sighted in their approach.  Farmers are brought well into the scheme.  While I am not saying there should not be a different level of premium, all animals that come out of a farm should attract some premium.  Quality assurance has served the industry well and factories are being short-sighted in failing to incentivise people to adhere to those standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#O01600","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut across, but it is probably a question for the factories also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#P00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516721400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018012300002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Maloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1516721400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>It was Bord Bia's brainchild and it has worked well.

We have no problem looking at that.  Anything we do must be linked to a market requirement and buy-in from the industry.  If we create a quality assurance scheme into which the industry does not buy, we have wasted our time and our money.  We are going into deep stakeholder consultation on all of our work and, having read the recommendations somewhat briefly, we have no issue committing to asking industry, within our strategy development process, to come together to find out the appetite in the market, among distillers or drinks producers and among farmers, for something workable within this.

The Bill, not having been subject to a regulatory impact assessment or cost-benefit analysis, is lacking in what we would require for detailed scrutiny.  We are also concerned that the Bill may be in contravention of European rules on the freedom of movement of goods and Article 18 of the packaging directive.  We are concerned that the Bill provides, by way of regulation, for ministerial action without any further stakeholder involvement.  CSNA does not consider that Bills discussed in a pre-legislative format should have amendments suggested that may materially alter their substance without a requirement for re-engagement with stakeholders.<br\/><br\/>We would like to discuss three elements pertaining to this Bill: the banning of non-compostable tableware, the deposit-return scheme, and the possibility, <i>in lieu<\/i>of a cup-banning section, of the introduction of an environmental levy on hot beverage containers, the so-called &quot;latte levy&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The CSNA questions whether the proposed ban would materially affect the levels of littering and, if so, how the committee could ensure there would be adequate bin facilities for compostables placed throughout the country.  We are aware that EU targets for recycling would not be improved for many involved in home composting and we query how success would be measured.  The very considerable changes in every workplace to accommodate separate bins for compostable beverage containers need to be evaluated properly and costed.  In many cases, we are aware that the contents of bins within local authority collection areas are mixed with ordinary waste, thereby defeating the effort of the consumer.  It is a rarity to find any separate bins for recycling waste in our cities or towns.<br\/><br\/>The cost to industry of providing compostable tableware is currently six times higher than that of ordinary tableware.  There are no guarantees that these costs would reduce solely on the basis of increased demand, leaving the retailer or the consumer, or both, with additional costs.<br\/><br\/>The Department has indicated that its preferred option, instead of a ban on tableware, would be the introduction of an environmental levy.  We would like to make a number of observations on this.  Initial reports have suggested that such a levy would be based on a percentage of the retail value of the product.  The CSNA, while not advocating a levy, suggests, in the interest of equity, that a unit price be charged rather than a percentage.  There need to be very clear rules on the levy's application and exceptions.  We are concerned that the levy may give rise to difficulties for retailers with regard to product contamination and their HACCP obligations.<br\/><br\/>We are concerned that the introduction of the proposed levy, unlike the very successful plastic bag levy, could lead to significant additional costs to retailers.  Machines might need to be recalibrated, tills and back-office systems would have to have additional product lines applied to accommodate a two-tier system, and there would be significant additional training costs.  If such a scheme is being considered, and assuming the Revenue Commissioners are involved in devising rules for its implementation, detailed consultation is required as a matter of urgency to ensure retailers are not affected negatively in their businesses.<br\/><br\/>One of the areas the CSNA would be most concerned about would be the lack of an even playing field if a certain style of beverage reseller could avoid charging the levy.<\/p><p> With regard to a deposit return scheme, the CSNA does not believe such a scheme is necessary, given the comprehensive existing shared responsibility scheme, Repak, in place across the country.  However, we ask the committee to consider how such a deposit return scheme could be put in place which would not act as a barrier to small manufacturers and distributors in getting into the marketplace.<\/p><p> There are many styles of deposit return scheme.  The type that would be put in place in Ireland might be for plastic bottles, plastic cartons, aluminium cans and glass bottles.  If that is the case, it will be important to ensure it is not limited to retailers but also captures hotels, bars and restaurants.  We make reference to this because there is always a possibility that partial systems can lead to returns being made of products on which no deposit has been charged.  Similarly, the CSNA is most concerned that products purchased outside the State may be subject to the reclaim of unpaid deposits.  If a deposit return scheme was in place, it would need to be sufficiently robust to ensure any retailer would not pay out more than the deposit taken in by him or her.  If a retail store was the nearest store to a sports gathering or a music festival, the prospect of enterprising groups returning thousands of bottles to a store in which very few deposits had been taken demonstrates the importance of having adequate responsible controls in place.  If the module is being designed to be revenue neutral at a macro level, sufficient consideration must be given to ensure that, on a micro level, individual retailers will be rewarded, not penalised, for their involvement in the scheme.<\/p><p> The majority of our members meet their existing packaging obligations through membership of Repak.  We do not believe we should be subject to what might be considered to be double taxation were we to be obligated to maintain our Repak membership and incur additional packaging costs for the same products.  It is our concern that if implementation of a deposit return scheme were to lead to a reduced income stream for commercial operators, such a reduction could lead to an increase in Repak fees for members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Jennings","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516707000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jennings for attending.  It was unfortunate that owing to time constraints he was not able to present at an earlier hearing.<\/p> <p>  When introducing new measures to increase the level of recycling and cut out the wasteful use of plastics, it is important that we work with retailers and everyone involved in the supply chain to make them work.  I was taken by one of the statistics given at the last hearing that 34% of plastic packaging was recycled.  We know that this figure needs to rise dramatically for reasons such as developing a circular economy, reducing the wasteful use of plastics, environmental emissions, littering problems, the volume of plastics in the environment and so on.  That will not be easy, but it is an essential policy objective which we all share.<\/p> <p>  The plastic bag levy was a huge success.  As much as anything else and the 15 cent charge, its success was that it changed the public's perception of the wasteful use of plastics.  While I am sure there were difficulties at the time in switching to the use of paper bags and so forth, does Mr. Jennings agree that one of the beneficial effects was the change in public attitudes?  My sense is that there is a similar possibility to change our attitude to the use of plastic cups and bottles.  A significant number of retailers now sell coffee.  I can think of half a dozen newsagents near here, all of which have a coffee machine.  There must be reasonable regulations for its use.  It is dangerous enough as one is using boiling water and so forth.  Is it as simple as plugging it in and not having to worry about it?  Do retailers have obligations on the health and safety or food safety side?  We do not want to over-regulate and make it impossible for businesses.  However, I would have thought that in that aspect of the retail trade, there would already have been in place extensive health and safety and food safety regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#E00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1516707000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jennings for attending.  The main concern is the significant volume of plastic and paper cups being used and what happens to them.  Mr. Jennings has made some valid points about the practicalities of a working scheme in that regard as proposed in the Green Party's Bill.  Several months ago I brought forward a similar Bill for Sinn F&eacute;in to introduce such a scheme and which compared other schemes in European countries.  I would welcome Mr. Jennings's views on it.  Our Bill proposed that the scheme be self-funding and that every shop would not have recycling units but that they would be located in prominent areas or large shopping centres.  We could have a situation where we would return to the use of closed glass bottles or cans.  There would be practicalities in how CSNA members would manage such proposals.  My Bill proposed that returns be to larger units.  For example, if someone was to bring back ten plastic or ten glass bottles, he or she would receive a credit in return.<\/p> <p>  Do the CSNA's members have views on how we could reduce the use of plastic cups or change to another type of material?  In January, as hedgerows and the grass on the side of the road die back, thousands of discarded plastic cups are revealed.  In turn, they will be washed into rivers and out into the ocean.

This is a cultural issue and their use has expanded rapidly in the past decade.  Some say corner shops are making more on coffee than on anything else.  It has become the cash machine in the corner.  Should plastic cups be recyclable?  Will it be like the plastic bag levy whereby one will be bringing one's own cup to a coffee dispensing unit?  How would CSNA members work with that scenario?  Has it been thought out?  This is one of the big dilemmas coming down the tracks and it is only a matter of time before the area is regulated by the industry or the Oireachtas.

We acknowledge that we are part of that problem; we are a conduit.  As long as I have been around - I am older than most here - there has been education on litter in schools.  All of us remember it from fourth class onwards.  We were very proud and our teachers were very proud in bringing us up.  However, at the same time people feel no difficulty in opening their window and throwing things out, including things we have sold and things that others have sold.  There is a fundamental problem here.  The crux of the matter is that people are behaving inappropriately.  Having a deposit-and-return scheme for glass and plastic bottles would most certainly meet some of the requirements in pushing people in another direction and making it economic.<\/p> <p>  However, the matter relating to litter and people thinking nothing about tossing a coffee cup out of the window will not be addressed because there is no return scheme for that.  I have suggested that receptacles for those products be more widely available and also that our littering laws be enforced more fully.  Local authorities should make a big thing about compliance.  At the moment the fine is &euro;150.  In addition to local authorities, the Garda should also be involved.  We need to use CCTV or whatever.  We need to make it very clear that this society does not stand for littering.<\/p> <p>  Relating to small stores, the Deputy may think that his Bill was designed to facilitate and make it an easy streamlined thing.  I can assure him that whatever solutions are being planned by this committee, the Department or others, small retailers need to be part of that solution.  We cannot end up effectively exporting sales.  If there is only one area - and it is attached to a shopping centre - where one can return the product and the vouchers are only available to be cashed in at that point, it becomes the norm for people to make their purchases there.  We do not want to see that.  We need to be part of the solution and that may require grants to assist us in the reverse-vending machines.  It may require consideration on being rewarded for taking part if it is on a manual basis rather than reverse machines.  However, if there is such a scheme the small retailer needs to be part of it because otherwise we are leaving it go over to the multinationals and we cannot afford that.<\/p> <p>  On the composition of the cup, there is no doubt that the cup could be changed.  Whether it will retain the same level of heat is a matter for the scientists and others.  I return to the fact that even if we meet all of those and there is no product contamination and no difficulties in the taste or anything like that, we still have the question of what that person who leaves my store and finishes his coffee walking down the street will do with the cup.  How can we ensure that, following very significant investment in time and resources to devise a compostable cup, it actually does what it is supposed to do and becomes composted, and does not just end up in landfill or being incinerated?  That is the important thing.  There is an education requirement.  I may not have answered all the questions; I probably did not.  I would like to leave one message.  We the small retailers want to be part of the solution.  We acknowledge that there is a problem.  We do not have our heads in the sand.  We are not saying: \"It's not our fault.\"  We are all part of that, but we also need to be part of the solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Jennings"},{"type":"speech","time":1516707000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jennings.

I will focus primarily on retrofitting homes.  To remind members, our 2050 climate change targets are essentially that we achieve 80% to 95% less in carbon emissions.  In light of the situation in agriculture and aviation, we will need to decarbonise our homes.  The context of my presentation will be the question of how to do that.  It is important to point out that we are far off trajectory and that we will not get back on it unless we make a significant change in what we do.<\/p> <p>  A deep retrofit means that a home will no longer use carbon fuels, will be energy efficient and - given that homes can be retrofitted poorly, leading to mould, damp and so on - healthy to live in.  In collaboration with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the national energy agency, the ESB and others, we established a programme that we originally titled the nearly zero energy building retrofit.  Our communications officer decided that was not catchy, so we called it SuperHomes.  Its aim is the 2050 home.  Approximately 75 homes have been retrofitted to date with support from the SEAI.  Under it, the average home is heated for &euro;200 to &euro;300 and is healthy inside.  People who have spent &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000 under the programme are telling us that, even if they save nothing, it is the best money they have ever spent.  A retrofitted home means it is lovely, warm, comfortable and healthy.  It is important for people to understand that this is what we need to do to every home.  Small amounts of attic or wall insulation are insufficient to get us to where we need to be.  Consumer acceptance of that is high.<\/p> <p>  We set up and trained an independent, expert-led renovation contractor panel.  We are using heat pumps.  We have a research arm, with three Limerick Institute of Technology researchers working full-time on improving SuperHomes.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, has given us a substantial amount of money to scale us upwards.  As such, this is not a small project.  It has global aims.  From the EU has emerged the idea of a one-stop-shop, where homeowners can access information, grants, finance and so on.<\/p> <p>  It is a question of how to get to where we need to be and ensuring that everyone understands.  Slide No. 3 of my presentation shows the carbon intensity of heating a home using gas, oil and heat pumps today and in 2035 based on EirGrid's analysis of where our grid will be.  Using oil, solid peat, coal or gas to heat homes while also trying to meet our climate targets is not an option.<\/p> <p>  To make this happen, we need to consider finance and the levers that we can use.  For example, we can use grants, which we have in place, and taxation in the form of carbon taxes.  These taxes are not particularly popular, but we need to understand that, if we do not price carbon, we will not remove it from society.  The third lever of low-cost finance is an important one.  If someone can pay to upgrade a home for &euro;60 or &euro;100 per month after the energy savings, it will be easy to convince people to move from a D energy rating to an A rating because of the comfort benefit.  That is the point we need to reach if we are to get finance into the market, including low-cost finance from the banks.  The EIB has a great deal of money to put into this space.  We need to have market demand so that financiers will supply the right products and services.  To do that, we need a stable policy framework, carbon pricing and a long-term plan.  Low-cost finance will get this to happen.<\/p> <p>  Last week's discussion focused somewhat on solar energy.  The average Irish home uses 4,000 units of electricity, to which solar could contribute, and 18,000 units of heat.  We need to focus on the latter because Ireland has done little in that regard as opposed to electricity, in which regard we have done much.  I would be supportive of solar, but it must be approached in line with the decarbonisation of homes.  A building's energy transition entails getting rid of its fossil fuel boiler rather than just putting up a bit of window dressing in the form of solar panels on a roof.  Solar is still necessary, but it is only a part of the solution.  That solution involves heat pumps, electric cars and solar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1516707000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kenny.

Regrettably, it is also one that we have not yet utilised to any significant extent.  It must be emphasised to committee members and others that the development of offshore wind as a resource would achieve a number of aims: reduce or avoid fines by contributing to the reduction of our emissions; increase security of energy supply; and, particularly important in light of the potential adverse effects of Brexit, create a significantly expanded indigenous industrial sector across Ireland, not just in the Dublin area like much of the industrial and service development that has occurred to date.  It would also provide activity, jobs and exports.<\/p> <p>  Four companies have been active for some time in developing offshore wind projects in the Irish Sea and advancing the necessary work.

When we reach full development, we will have a capacity of up to 330 MW.

My company, SSE, is the largest renewable generator in Ireland, with over 700 MW of onshore wind under operation, including Ireland's largest wind farm, the 169 MW Galway wind farm.  It is also a leading developer and operator of offshore wind energy.  All told, we are involved in over 8,000 MW of offshore wind projects in the UK and Ireland, 900 MW of which is already generating, providing energy to customers and contributing to the achievement of the UK's targets.  Closer to home in Irish waters we co-developed Ireland's first and only operational offshore wind farm in 2004, namely, the seven turbine, 25 MW Arklow Bank Phase 1.  This was delivered at the time as a demonstrator project to prove the opportunity that offshore energy could represent for Ireland but almost 15 years later this opportunity has not been seized.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, we have one of the strongest wind resources in the world yet we are the only country in northern Europe not currently developing offshore capacity.  SSE believes that offshore wind can play a key role in bridging the gap to Ireland's 2020 targets and beyond.  Onshore technologies have served us extremely well to date but we must be realistic that social acceptance to onshore energy developments is challenging and greater grid and planning constraints are now in place.  What has been successful for us in the past does not guarantee future success.  If we are to make up ground on 2020 and beyond - and we believe we can - then we need to fast-forward the build-out of large-scale renewable energy capacity.  Offshore wind energy can deliver large volumes of renewable electricity in the short term and also set us on the right trajectory for more ambitious 2030 targets.<\/p> <p>  SSE is actively progressing plans to fully develop its Arklow Bank Wind Park project.  This would represent an investment of over &euro;1 billion and deliver a minimum of 520 MW of capacity.  Most importantly, this project can be delivered in a timescale, from construction through to commercial operation that would qualify towards Ireland's 2020 targets, offsetting or potentially eliminating any fines.  The Arklow Bank project and other Irish Sea projects are an efficient and realistic way to take the big strides we need to hit our targets.  Looking beyond 2020, we are very excited that new floating foundation technology will allow Ireland to harness the resources off southern and western coasts and thereby stimulate very significant regional development.  However, we can only do this as a sector if the right market conditions are in place.  These conditions include, having a support scheme that supports offshore wind, an effective connection policy and efficient management of the consenting process.  As the committee is aware, the Department has consulted recently on the design of a new renewable electricity support scheme.  In our response, SSE called for the inclusion of offshore wind as a separate category in the first of the new support scheme auctions.  The technology-neutral approach proposed will not give offshore wind projects investment clarity in the timeframe required or enable a local supply chain to develop.  We fear that it will result in an over-reliance on onshore technology and, as I mentioned, we have doubts that a sufficient quantity of this technology can be delivered in the timeframe required.  A technology-neutral approach fails to capture the diversification benefits of offshore wind.  These benefits include, typical load factors of in excess of 40%, which is considerably higher than most other renewable electricity sources; delivery of consistent and predictable power to our national grid, providing significant system demand benefits; only connection is required to bring big power to where it is needed, which is simpler than developing lots of small decentralised projects; potential scale and strategic location of offshore wind can meet the future energy demands of clean-tech multinationals, particularly, large-scale load from data centres, the majority of which are located on the east coast; economic investment benefits in coastal regions and consequent employment opportunities and, upskilling for more ambitious 2030 targets and demand growth as heat and transport decarbonise through electrification.<\/p> <p>  From a cost perspective, following several years of innovation and de-risking offshore wind is now a scalable, proven and maturing technology which offers considerable benefits to consumers and society.  Costs continue to fall and I believe Ireland should be part of this story.  While offshore wind remains more expensive than onshore wind this gap has been narrowing and I believe that support is justified in light of the challenges of developing onshore wind, the climate change backdrop, Ireland's international reputation and impending fines, not to mention expected grid cost efficiencies and reduction in the wholesale cost of energy.  As a supplier of energy through our SSE Airtricity brand we are acutely aware of the need to keep costs to a minimum but as a society we also need to decarbonise.  While decarbonisation does come at a cost, not doing anything will cost us more and mean missed opportunities for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We have a window of opportunity right now to transform the way to transform the way in which we generate power in Ireland and to do so in a way that reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to its EU targets and accelerates the deployment of new and diverse energy technology.  Aside from the climate imperative, we can also avoid unnecessary costs to the Exchequer from failure to meet our targets domestically.  In so doing, we can restore our reputation as a leading low carbon economy in Europe and the world, proudly supporting greener energy and attracting inward investment from across the globe to support jobs and our economy as a result.<\/p> <p>  I ask the committee to support our efforts in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Wheeler"},{"type":"speech","time":1516707000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I will now open the discussion to members.

It is a no-brainer that we should be backing these initiatives.  I am very interested in the deep retrofitting of homes.  The quality of some housing in this country is very poor owing to shoddy building in the past.  Houses in many of the old council estates require deep retrofitting and this should be strongly recommended in the committee's report not only because this would help in terms of our climate change targets but because it is sensible in terms of ensuring the long-term healthy lifestyle of our population and it has the added benefit of creating tends of thousands of sustainable jobs.  This issue should be a strong feature of our report, as should wind energy, solar energy and so on.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make an observation.  One could not say \"No\" to anything that has been said here.  From a scientific and societal point of view, all that has been said is very sensible.  How we do force the Government and successive Governments to take this issue seriously and to ring-fence the financing required to ensure that it happens in a timely way.  We are in a race against time.  Mr. Wheeler mentioned in his opening statement that almost 15 years on from the construction of the Arklow offshore energy bank an opportunity has not been seized, which is shocking.  To continue to do what we are doing is insane.  We need to listen to the scientific and technological submissions on all options and we need to have a discussion about how politically we can force this onto the agenda in a way that ensures the Government takes it seriously.<\/p> <p>  The committee previously looked at a project on the Arran Islands off the west coast.  Small scale community projects like this and the St. Fintan's high school project, which involves students trying to solar power their school, matter as much as the big projects.  If we are not being listened to at the top, politically, then this has to be driven at grass-roots level, using the examples of schools and communities that are trying to get us to change and working with the companies which are leading the advances in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#H00500","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1516707000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I have a question for each of the witnesses who made opening statements.  Mr. Kenny is correct that heat is a key issue but we have potential in solar heat to tackle it.  I support the work being done by St. Fintan's high school in terms of promoting solar PV because it has the potential to provide one power supply for the heat technology mentioned by Mr. Kenny.  Solar has a role on the heat side as well as on the electricity side.  Energy efficiency is always the best lowest cost form of decarbonised.  We have more than 1 million houses with oil fired central heating systems that we need to switch.  We also have many houses that are poorly insulated.  In recent years, the EIB has been offering finance to people operating in this space.  Why is it that we have not got the financing together?<\/p><p>As impressive as the work is, at this stage 75 houses should be 75,000, with an aim to provide 750,000 in a ten year period, at least it would be if we were ambitious.  Is there any sign of finance being made available to package this in a way that would wrap solar, heat pump, electric vehicle and retrofit programmes together?  Is there any straw in the wind that a financing package is finally on the horizon?  <\/p><p> I agree with Mr. Teahon on the potential for development offshore.  If there was separate offshore technology, will he outline how it would be structured?  I agree that we should do it.  I am conscious that all of the spectacular reductions in costs in recent years have come from the likes of the Danish, Dutch and German bidding systems.  We will obviously have to follow them.  However, very large international consortia, including Vattenfalls, DONG\/&Oslash;rsted and so on, have brought forward lower bids.  How will smaller Irish operators connect to such developments in a way that will allow us to avail of the cost reductions that have occurred elsewhere?  How would the auction be structured? <\/p><p> In respect of our colleagues from SSE, after thinking about what I had said before, I agree with Mr. Teahon in saying we should be aiming for a power renewal figure of 75% by 2030.  It is absolutely the level of ambition we should have.  EirGrid studies assume the use of a certain amount of biomass in our system which I do not think we will see happen.  <\/p><p> In respect of SSE's international expertise, are there certain services the wind energy industry would be able to provide in terms of inertia or frequency voltage stability?  Is there any development that would allow us to start clutching these wind turbines in a way that would gives us some of the system services?  Have the delegates carried out any research into what the level of renewables could be by 2030 by adjusting the technology, particularly wind energy and other flywheel technologies, to help it to happen?  Do the delegates have any expertise in that regard?<\/p><p> Again I agree that there is potential to use offshore wind energy to benefit this island.  However, do the delegates agree that the level of power generated will require us to interconnect with our near neighbours, particularly Britain?  Does their company have any perspective that it might be able to share with us on the Brexit negotiations and how we will manage the volume of wind energy produced offshore in terms of interconnection and trading with the United Kingdom?  Has any assessment been made of the implications for Ireland in developing large-scale offshore wind energy projects in the Irish Sea and off the west coast?  We should do so.  However, we will have to sell it to make the process work.  What reassurance can be provided that it will survive the Brexit talks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#H00600","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516707000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>A lot of questions have been asked.

The issue of offshore wind energy is one in which I am interested.  I was looking at the Arklow project about a year ago.  It is very interesting.  Will Mr. Wheeler tell me how much Government support was available for the project which involved the use of seven turbines in Arklow?  Should there be more Government initiatives in developing the offshore sector?<\/p> <p>  I also want to ask Mr. Wheeler for his views on the issue of planning permission.  Many agencies have to be dealt with when multiple consents are needed.  Scotland has a simpler more streamlined system involving the use of one agency.  Sinn F&eacute;in sees wind energy as part of the solution, but we have a concern about its intermittent nature.  I know that there are differing views, depending on to whom one talks.  At different times we have had different views at this committee also.  However, there are two problems.  One is that on the nights of the two big freezes five and six years ago there was no wind.  The temperature was -16 degrees Celsius in the area in which I live.  The  other aspect is the potential overheating of the grid because of power surges.  How can this be regulated?  There is a view in the electricity industry that only so much wind energy can be handled.<\/p> <p>  The project in Tipperary is interesting.  The full cost, as stated in the presentation, is &euro;33,000.  I have been raising the issue of deep retrofitting.  A lot of homes have some insulation.  Unfortunately, there is none in some houses dating from the 1800s and early 1900s which means that an elderly person may be living in a house with no insulation.  The heat is flying out through the windows and doors.  It is an issue we have to tackle.  <\/p> <p>  The construction industry has left not only a financial hangover but also an energy hangover.  Most of what was done was bloody awful.  I have talked to people who have climbed into the attic of their rented accommodation which was built in 2006 and 2007 only to discover there is no insulation.  Insulation is also missing from some of the walls.  It is dreadful stuff.  How does Mr. Kenny see the cost being funded?  Does he see a role for a green bond type system?  In other words, pension funds or the credit unions which have funds of between &euro;8 billion and &euro;11 billion might provide funding for an upfront grants scheme?  The funds would be paid back over time with some interest on top.  There would be a premium to make it attractive.  Not too many people can put their hands in their pocket and pull out &euro;33,000, particularly if they are paying a mortgage, etc.  <\/p> <p>  I recently introduced a Bill on microgeneration which refers specifically to solar energy.  Students might be interested in having a look at it.  I would be interested in hearing their views on that Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  Political support might be generated from other parties to try to get it through the House, something we would also welcome.  However, what other renewable resources do the delegates believe could be used?  Solar energy has been mentioned, with solar panels on a roof, but I can see them having very little effect in some places.  On what can we make the big win fairly quickly?  There is no quick fix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#J00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1516707000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time, but the delegate will have a chance to respond to all of questions asked.

We have engaged directly with the banks which have told us that they would be delighted to lend money, as that is their business.  However, it cannot be done without scale.  We have tried desperately hard to scale up and 33,000 homes is a large turnover in two years.  What we need to do is have a strong stable commitment at a policy level.  About 500 people have already applied to us and we are trying to deal with them.  Obviously, there is a capacity issue in the marketplace.  However, a carbon tax is very important to drive people into it because only some will understand the grants scheme and so on.<\/p> <p>  The other key aspect, looking at green bonds and what other countries have done across Europe, is that the models at we have looked more or less combine public good banks such as KfW in Germany with local parties such as local energy agencies and others like them.

I strongly encourage the committee to consider a slight rebalancing from capital grants towards capital grants and current expenditure support.<\/p><p>I encourage the committee to consider a slight rebalancing of supports from capital grants to capital grants and current expenditure.  We need advisers.  Upper Austria has gone from 2% to 50% renewable heat and in a region the size of Munster they have 45 publicly-funded advisers to give advice to homeowners and so on.  That is what we do and, thankfully, with the likes of the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Electricity Supply Board, ESB and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI we have been able to fund some of it.  We need a lot more of it because people do not know.  <\/p><p> What is the big win in terms of microgen?  Solar is very important at one level; of the super-homes, I think about 80% would have solar PV.  It is very much part of the solution and will generate roughly 2,000 units of energy for what we usually put on homes.  However, it is just a part.  The other main microgeneration technology is heat pumps.  A heat pump is coupled with a solar panel on the roof.  The sun hits the solar panel and powers the heat pump.  That provides a huge amount of energy from the sun, essentially.  This goes back to Deputy Eamon Ryan's comment that solar should not be overlooked.  It is really important that the two go together, with the solar heat from the pump and the solar panel coupled together as part of a retrofit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516707000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Floating wind turbines are on the way.

As Mr. O'Connor has just said, they are already interested in Ireland.  We have to show our credentials to really be part of this industry.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley raised wind intermittency.  Members may have seen that over Christmas we reached record levels on the island of Ireland, when over 67% of our energy requirement was delivered through renewable resources.  That was for one half-hour period.  However, it really does show the fantastic work that companies like EirGrid have done in allowing renewables to penetrate the system and work within it.  The Deputy is right that the wind does not always blow.  However, it actually blows a lot.  To avoid intermittency issues, we need what we already have, namely, VS3 programmes that are already kicking off to support and drive flexibility.  As well as wind, we also own and operate thermal stations.  Great Ireland has a 460 MW combined cycle gas turbine, CCGT, in Wexford, which is the most efficient in the plant.  When the wind is not blowing, it is about ensuring we have the flexibility that the traditional, cleaner plants can actually come on in the time that is required.  We are world leaders in how we adopt renewables and bring them onto our system without causing significant issues.  EirGrid should be given a lot of credit for that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about our seven turbines at the Arklow bank.  That was done with GE back in the day.  It is disappointing that we are sitting here today and still have not seen that grow.  It could potentially be delivered well within the 2020 timelines but we need the decisions now.  There is no point in 2018 or 2019 saying we are going to have an offshore option.  We will not hit the 2020 timelines if that is the case.  It is really important that we see action now as distinct from a couple of years down the road.  As I said in my presentation, we have had huge success in delivering onshore wind to date - nearly 4 GW of onshore wind on the island of Ireland.  We should be incredibly proud of that.  I have been in this business for over 15 years.  I have been on the ground and have seen the challenges and complexities, whether they be social acceptance, grid, or planning challenges.  It is becoming more and more difficult.  The future is not about one technology but many complementary technologies in onshore wind, solar and offshore wind.  The big advantage of offshore wind is the scale.  This can be deployed at scale by big international and local partners over a very short period.  That is something we now need to be a part of.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan asked about Brexit implications with regard to interconnection.  To keep the interconnectors up and going is incredibly important.<\/p><p>The east-west interconnector has proven it is already a really important part of infrastructure.  We also need to be clear that it is one thing to talk about exporting but first and foremost we need to look at our domestic demand requirement and as targets grow beyond 2020 out to 2030 we are talking potentially 30% to 35%.  We will have a job in its own right to deliver against those targets locally before we even get to thinking about exporting.  The reality right now is that we are off our target for 2020.  We need to accelerate the delivery to 2020 to hit that target and then go beyond that.  Brexit will play out and at this stage I do not know what the outcome of it will be.  Most important, there is an opportunity here to deliver on our domestic targets and we need to make sure that all the technologies are supported to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018012300002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Wheeler","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516707000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I want to reiterate the speed with which offshore wind projects can be delivered.

We are here to provide the committee with an update on the tracker mortgage issue, the progress to date and the work being done to bring this to a conclusion for our impacted customers.  I am joined today by members of my executive team, Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, Mr. Robert Mulhall and Mr. Tom Kinsella<\/p> <p>  Since 26 September 26 when we last discussed the tracker mortgage issue with this committee, there has been ongoing and understandable public and political criticism of the banking industry&rsquo;s handling of the matter.  In the course of that debate, many questions have been raised about how we got to this point.  Fundamentally there are three areas where key questions arise.  The first is how the problem arose, the second is how the bank has responded and the third is the current status. <\/p> <p>  In terms of how the problem arose, it is helpful at the outset to articulate the circumstances, as we understand them, that existed at the time the original decision was made.  The tracker mortgage product was introduced in 2002 at a time when wholesale market funding for banks was readily available and referenced off European Central Bank, ECB, rates.  The tracker product had its interest rate based on ECB rates, plus an appropriate margin.  As the 2008 financial crisis devastated economies globally, banks across many countries, including Ireland, were experiencing severe liquidity difficulties and the wholesale markets effectively closed or radically repriced credit causing the dislocation of funding from the ECB rate.  Faced with this reality, AIB, initially in the second quarter of 2008, began to increase the tracker product margin.  Things moved very rapidly and a month after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the introduction of the Government guarantee scheme, the tracker product had very quickly become unsustainable.  The tracker as a new product offering became redundant due to the scale of the margin increase required to reflect the rising cost of funding.  The decision which was taken in late 2008 was to no longer make the product available for new customers.  In other words, tracker mortgages were no longer offered to new customers but remained in place for those already holding one.  Contrary to a widely held view, approximately 104,000 AIB and Educational Building Society, EBS, customer accounts, which at the time of the decision were on tracker mortgages were not affected by this decision and retained their rate.  The unforeseen and unintended consequence of this decision was that certain customers who held a tracker product at some point previously but had already moved off the tracker product prior to this decision were not able to revert to the tracker product.  It is clear that the potential fallout of the decision to stop offering the tracker product to new customers was not considered in terms of how existing customers might be impacted in the future, as some of these customers had a right to revert to a tracker product.  This clearly should not have happened. <\/p> <p>  In terms of how the bank responded, the differential that would later develop between the bank&rsquo;s standard variable rate, SVR, and historical tracker mortgage rates and the unprecedented duration of the historically low ECB rates clearly amplified the initial error.  In addition, the difficulty was compounded by limited legacy IT systems and operational failures in AIB and EBS when it merged with AIB in 2011.  The systems did not record the bank's proper commitments and obligations to its customers.<\/p><p>While the failure to consider the impact on customers was not deliberate, it is a failure that should not have happened and we apologise for this.  Where complaints occurred, they were initially infrequent and were dealt with by the bank on an individual basis as each arose.  Legal advice and the initial outcome of cases taken to the ombudsman supported the bank&rsquo;s position.  With the benefit of hindsight, this was a too bank-centred approach.<\/p><p> In August 2015, following the identification of a particular issue involving certain EBS customers, and in the context of wider industry developments at the time, an analysis of the tracker issue was conducted within AIB.  We commenced a significant programme of work which ultimately scaled up to 500 bank personnel dedicated to the programme.  The bank over time conducted an analysis of circa 650,000 accounts to establish what we were dealing with.  From the outset, we conducted our review by looking at contractual obligations but also examined whether proper levels of transparency and information were made available to customers that would enable them to make appropriate decisions in their own best interests.  We sought to establish how the product was designed, administered and ultimately discontinued.<\/p><p> Issues identified included contractual breaches and-or unclear marketing, as well as process weaknesses.  Eventually, more than 30 different customer groupings were recognised as impacted across AIB and EBS.  Thus it became apparent that while we wanted to build early momentum in the programme, we would not be able to arrive at a one-size-fits-all solution.  Essentially, impacted customers fell into three broad categories: those not on a tracker rate but who were entitled to revert to a tracker; those who remained on a tracker rate but were incorrectly charged a higher margin for a period of time; and those who were never on a tracker rate but who had a contractual option to be offered a prevailing tracker rate at the end of their fixed rate period.<\/p><p> On the basis of what we believed to be the scale of the problem, the bank set aside a provision of &euro;190 million to cover the anticipated costs involved.  We worked to ensure full compliance with the Central Bank framework that issued in December 2015, which included a fully independent third party review and an appeals process.  We submitted to the Central Bank in 2016 our approach to rate rectification and compensation.  Since then, we have continued to implement that programme, completing all the required steps under the Central Bank of Ireland framework.<\/p><p> Members will have seen from information provided directly to the committee and from other recent bank statements that by the end of quarter 1 2018, all 3,509 customers who were identified as not on the tracker rate as they should have been will be redressed and compensated.  Approximately 96% of these been completed.  By the end of quarter 1 2018, all 939 customers incorrectly charged a higher margin for a period of time &ndash; most impacted by less than &euro;500 &ndash; will be redressed and compensated.  A total of 81% have been completed.  For these categories, customer accounts have been returned to their own historic tracker mortgage rate.  In addition, as noted in our December 2017 review, the following are now included and will be redressed: by the end of quarter 1 2018, the customers who were never on a tracker mortgage - our initial estimate of 4,000 was published in December - but who could not avail of one because it was withdrawn, will each receive compensation of &euro;1,000 plus &euro;615 towards independent advice.  This group was included in the review in December 2017.  By the end of quarter 2, a further 900 customers will be reverted to their own tracker rate and will be redressed and compensated.<\/p><p> I fully accept the need for real urgency in bringing this issue to a close, most especially in the interests of the impacted customers.  AIB continues to focus very significant energy and resources to ensure we reach a conclusion as quickly as possible.  The bank has many challenges and opportunities as we face into 2018.  Resolution of this tracker issue is clearly a priority.  I am not in a position to make any new financial disclosures today as we are in a close period, but in our trading update issued in December, the bank reported that it is on track to deliver a full year financial performance materially in line with market expectations.<\/p><p> As I have said to the committee previously, AIB is deeply conscious of the adverse effect this issue has had on impacted customers.  Many people are angry as a result of the treatment they encountered and I apologise again for this on behalf of the bank.  AIB's culture and reputation can only stand on the foundation of fair treatment for the customer.  Where we fall short of this standard, it undermines our values and the credibility of the bank.  We cannot allow that as we seek to put the interests of our customers first and to rebuild the bank and its reputation.  We will continue to work hard until the programme is finished and we intend to reach that point by mid-2018.  Customers are assured that payments they receive under the redress scheme will not compromise their right to appeal and, therefore, we can reasonably expect that cases might flow on from this for some time after the date we have indicated.  However, AIB, for its part, will have concluded the overwhelming majority of its redress and compensation programme within months.<\/p><p> I thank the committee again for inviting us and we look forward to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516723200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Byrne and his colleagues and I thank him for his opening statement.

There was no consideration based on what we can see of consequences of that decision elsewhere.  The decision was around whether the tracker product would remain for new customers.

In addition, we look at their affordability to see if customers would have been able to afford that rate.  The homes that were lost were all sales as opposed to repossessions, so they would have gone through a forbearance process and identified the sale of the property.  In identifying that grouping, we identified the tracker rate, calculated the affordability of the customer and, to allow flexibility, we built in 15% extra affordability because of the nature of the issue we were facing.  We looked at what was the most favourable forbearance option that could have been provided to the customer so that we minimised the repayment amount as much as we could.  If we put them through the forbearance structure, what we would then get to would be the minimum repayment amount versus the maximum affordability that we could find related to it.

The reference rate for what was likely to happen given the funding environment makes clear that it would have been a very expensive product.

In the scheme of where the organisation was and where things were, there was a tiny number of complaints.  A number of those complaints were made and passed on through the ombudsman, and the ombudsman did find in favour of the bank in terms of its position.  At that point in time, people understood the position that the bank was adopting and, principally, these were around rate-type issues, and that actually there was a reasonable position that the bank was adopting in respect of that offering.<\/p> <p>  It was only later on, and the period that we are talking about now is into the 2015 period, when the prevailing rate issue started to emerge more in the ombudsman-type issue.

It is a price promise offering, which also sat on a 3,500 group that Mr. Kinsella has talked about.

Historically, effectively, 100% of assessment would have been on the what side.  We have a net promoter score system that allows us 30,000 individual customer contacts every quarter to understand the customer's perspective in respect of each of our product offerings and each of our customer journeys and we rank, rate and track those.

Surely in cases in which there is full disclosure by the borrower, there are up-to-date valuations on file and there has been a thorough assessment made, it is far better to deal with them in a non-adversarial and non-litigious manner and reach an agreement, even if it involves writing off debts rather than securing an asset in a very messy way that leaves a sour taste in the mouth?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012300002#O00900","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516723200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Again, if there are specific cases, we are very open to dealing with them if the Deputy wishes.

We did that twice to make sure we got it right and then we passed it on to KPMG, who assured it for us.  Later in the process it was assured again by EY, on behalf of the CBI.  We then refund overpayments to the customer and give the customer a time value of money on the overpayments, which worked out at about 6% on average.  In line with that, we provide compensation based on a percentage of the interest overcharged.  We have four tiers of compensation, with 85% falling within tier 1, these being performing customers who were never in arrears.  The figure for these is 15%.  The next tier is customers who might have been in the legal process at some stage, who get 22% and the next set, where the property may have been sold but the rate was not causal, also get 22%.  Finally, the most seriously impacted customers, where the property was sold and the rate was causal, got a 30% compensation level.  In the case of the last group, we also compensate for the future value of the tracker and any uplift in the value of the house since it was sold, and we write off any residual debt refund and any payments made on it.  We make a &euro;50,000 incremental payment on top of that and finally, where applicable, we offer them the opportunity of a new tracker mortgage based on their old historic rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012300002#Q02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Kinsella"},{"type":"speech","time":1516723200,"counter":660,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Kinsella send us a briefing note with an outline of his reply?

We meet them all the time because they stay in the same hotels that many Deputies stay in.  It is shocking to think that AIB, a bank into which we put billions, has 900 empty houses.  The people who are homeless now put money into the bank.  It is next to unforgivable.  I raise this every time we meet and the figures are actually increasing.  The number of houses that the bank has in its possession is increasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012300002#S01300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516723200,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I think all stakeholders involved understand the challenges.

I also thank the committee for allowing me to bring along colleagues from my Department and from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We are all here to answer questions, if at all possible, later.<\/p> <p>  In the context of exempted development, each of the proposed regulations is aimed at amending provisions in the principal Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2017 concerning development that is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Each of the proposed regulations deals with a specific type of development.  Under the Planning Acts, each House of the Oireachtas is required to approve draft planning regulations relating to exempted development by way of positive resolution before they can be made by me, as Minister of State.  The consideration of the draft regulations by the committee is part of that approval process.<\/p> <p>  The first set of draft regulations is the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2018.  They relate to the provision of a number of exemptions for development works undertaken by Irish Water in the provision of water services.  This involves the insertion of a dedicated new class of exempted development - class 58 - in Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the principal regulations.  These proposed exemptions will permit Irish Water to undertake works relating to its normal day-to-day operational activities without the need to obtain planning permission from the relevant local planning authority.  Previously, and prior to the establishment of Irish Water, the provision of water services and related works was undertaken by local authorities that had broad planning exemptions under which they could operate.  As Irish Water has now taken over the water services functions of local authorities and cannot avail of the exemptions available to local authorities, it is appropriate that Irish Water should have similar exemptions to those previously given to local authorities.  These proposed exemptions are also broadly similar to those given to other statutory utility providers such as those involved in the provision of electricity, gas and telecommunications services.  I also propose amendments to the existing telecommunications services-related planning exemptions.  I will address them separately in a few moments.<\/p> <p>  The exemptions proposed will essentially enable Irish Water to undertake development, such as that relating to the general maintenance, repair and installation of pipes, cables and water mains - typically along public roads - as well as the provision of underground water pumping stations and holding tanks, without the need to obtain planning permission, thereby helping to ensure continuity of water supply for households and businesses and that such water supply is not disrupted to any major extent.  The majority of the proposed exemptions relate to works that would be carried out within the confines of existing water services sites, including the upgrading and maintenance of water structures, the installation of equipment in the event of critical infrastructure failure, and works required to comply with statutory licences issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The proposed exemptions also include other minor works within such water services sites, for example, the provision of fencing and telecommunications apparatus or structures for testing water.  I would particularly like to point out that these draft regulations do not propose to provide blanket exemptions for development works by Irish Water.  Any works proposed by Irish Water that are not specifically exempted by these exempted development regulations will still require planning permission in the normal course.<\/p> <p>  The second set of draft regulations is the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2018.  They propose to provide an exemption for the change of use, and any related works, of certain vacant commercial premises to residential use without the need to obtain planning permission.  The draft regulations propose to amend Article 10 of the principal regulations that deals with changes of use.  These draft regulations propose that the exemption will apply for a temporary limited period from when they come into operation until 31 December 2021, concurrent with the lifetime of the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  They will apply to commercial buildings that have been lying vacant for at least two years.  The proposed exemption relates primarily to works to the interior of such buildings.  It is proposed that some limited alternations to the exterior of buildings will also be permitted, subject to their being in keeping with the building and neighbouring buildings.<\/p> <p>  It is proposed that a number of restrictions will apply to these exempted development works, including that a maximum of nine residential units can be provided in any one building, and that certain minimum standards relating to floor areas, storage space and the provision of natural light are met for each unit.  It is important to note that these proposed exemptions relate to planning permission only.<\/p><p>Development works to vacant commercial buildings which are being converted to residential use also generally need to comply with the requirements of the building control regulations in respect of fire safety, structural stability, ventilation and so forth.  In this regard, the relevant building control regulations require a competent qualified professional to be assigned by the owner or developer to be involved in the design of the proposed development works, oversee the construction phase and to certify that the finished building works are compliant with the requirements of the building control regulations, thereby ensuring that the relevant works meet the necessary safety and standards requirements.  In effect, these draft exempted development regulations will not in any way change the relevant building control requirements which will continue to apply.  I know that is an issue of concern for some members so I will be very clear that the building control regulations still apply.  I should also mention in passing that the building control standards generally relate to new build construction.  Recognising the possible need for some dispensations from the building control requirements in respect of development works on existing buildings, specifically to better facilitate the conversion of existing vacant commercial buildings for residential use, a working group chaired by my Department was established in late 2017 to develop new building control guidance with a view to providing clarity on what regulatory requirements should be applied in this area and to provide advice on how best to facilitate the re-use or development of under-utilised older buildings for residential purposes.  I understand that the committee has had discussions on this previously in the context of another Bill.  The working group, which includes expertise in building regulations, fire safety, planning, design, and heritage from within and external to the Department, has identified a number of common existing building typologies on which to base its guidance.  It is intended that the output of the working group's deliberations in the form of revised guidance will be finalised in the coming months and will supplement the exempted development planning regulations we are discussing here today.   <\/p><p> The background to these draft regulations is the commitment in action no. 5.9 of Rebuilding Ireland to bring forward proposals to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground-floor premises, to residential use without having to go through the planning process and thereby help in the rejuvenation of inner urban areas which have been particularly adversely affected by the recent economic downturn.  This proposal is also incorporated in action no. 6 of the Action Plan for Rural Development.  I know this proposal is of particular interest to committee members and having regard to the circumstances outlined, I would hope that they will support its approval which, as I have indicated, has a sunset clause to end in 2021.  <\/p><p> I commend these three sets of draft regulations to the committee.  They are each very important in their own right and they have the potential to have a real and positive impact on people's lives.  They will support Irish Water in the efficient delivery of the water service, facilitate the re-use of the many vacant buildings in our cities and towns for housing purposes which will revitalise our urban centres and they will assist in the accelerated roll-out of broadband and mobile services generally.  I look forward to what I know will be an engaging discussion with the committee this morning and I will endeavour to answer any questions that committee members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#D00200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":774,"content":"<p>Thank you Minister.

I am in two minds on these regulations and the questions I have are very similar to those I raised in the context of Deputy Pat Casey's Bill on over-the-shop developments.  Specifically with regard to the water infrastructure and the over-the-shop developments regulations, I absolutely understand the need to have exemptions for emergency works, for example, or for routine or basic works.  However, I have a concern that the list of exemptions in the first regulation is broader than that.  What reassurances can the Minister of State give that we are not going to have a situation where a more significant piece of work that is more of a planned infrastructural investment rather than response, maintenance or emergency maintenance is not going to end up in a dispute with people who feel that an application for planning permission should have been required?<\/p><p>How certain is the Minister of State that the list is as restrictive as it should be?  <\/p><p> On the proposals for the development of residential accommodation over a shop, my big concern, although I support them in principle, is that if we grant these exemptions, how will we ensure all of the minimum standards for fire safety will be fully adhered to?  No one wants to stand in the way of streamlining and fast-tracking developments to get units back into use, nor do we want to see a situation where the minimum standards are not being met when property is subdivided into nine units.  The regulations state the minimum standards must be met, but how can we ensure this will actually happen when planning permission is not required for the redevelopment of a property into nine units or less?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#E00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I want to deal with the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations and change of use.  Will the Minister of State outline the logic for stating no more than nine individual housing units can be provided for the purposes of conversion? This is to avoid Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  I do not like the language to avoid Part V because it is an important aspect of planning.  In some of the larger towns one could create more than ten units in some of the properties to be redeveloped.  That is not something we should have ruled out.  We are effectively saying this measure relates to places which have fewer than ten housing units.  There is potential in some larger towns to provide a percentage of social housing units in this type of development.<\/p><p>In respect of protected structures, the proposals shall not be permitted unless there is a section 57 declaration, which is a strange condition.  This morning I spoke to three planners who told me about the process of self-regulation.  Effectively, people are telling local authorities that their proposals are related to exempt development.  The planning authorities neither have the resources nor the staff to check all of them and a person can claim the proposals relate to a pre-1963 development.  We really need to tidy up the conditions that apply to section 57 declarations.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, in the context of ensuring public confidence in the planning process and public engagement which is a really important part of the planning process, no elected member of a council or member of the public would be aware of a section 57 declaration.  I am not sure whether the Minister of State would be fully aware of one.  A section 57 declaration does not involve the erection of a site notice or the publication of a public notice and does not go up on the council's website.  Who actually knows when a section 57 declaration has been sought?  We are proposing changes to section 57 declarations, but there is no official public log.  I logged onto a number of local authority websites today to investigate and also spoke to a number of planners about section 57 declarations, about which I have a concern.  If a local authority refuses a section 57 declaration, which is its prerogative, what is being proposed?  Is there an appeals mechanism?  Is there a grievance procedure when somebody who makes an application for a section 57 declaration is refused?  Traditionally, an application for a section 57 declaration has been referred to a heritage officer, a conservation officer and a raft of officials in a local authority and, in some cases, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I flag this as an issue.<\/p><p>My major concern is about county development plans.  I looked at the 1999 telecommunications antennae and support structures guidelines.  I found two paragraphs alarming.  They read:<\/p><blockquote>Planning authorities should not include separation distances (i.e. from houses, protected structures, schools etc) in development plans as they prevent case-by-case analysis and can inadvertently have a major impact on the roll-out of viable and effective telecommunications networks.  This will have implications for a number of planning authorities around the country who include specific distances, often up to 1 kilometre, from schools, houses etc.  <br \/><br \/>It will also have implications for local communities who wish to object to proposed masts as they often could rely on policies which required such separation distances to be met in order to get the application refused.<\/blockquote><p>The previous Minister also included two reminders to the planning authorities, \"namely that health grounds should not be considered as part of a planning application and, all future Development Contribution Schemes must include waivers for broadband infrastructure provision as per the recent draft guidelines on development contributions.\"  <\/p><p> The Minister of State has been around politics for a long time, as have I, and I can tell him of at least ten objections to masts in the area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, where I live, in respect of which members of the Minister's party, members of other parties and people not affiliated to a party mobilised huge groups of people.  I recall one case in respect of an addition to a mast on top of a Garda station on Tubbermore Road in Dalkey.  I can understand the reasons and the concerns.  Health is a huge issue in respect of telecommunications.  Guidelines with regard to schools are particularly important.  Many schools have been in touch with us over the years.  I have met a number of them.  They mobilise.  I can think of two cases in Meath about which people contacted us and expressed great concern.  These are big national schools and primary schools.  They want to know how they can have their voice and their say.  They want to know how they can be assured that an antenna or a piece of telecommunications equipment will not have health implications for children.  Local elected Members must now put up their hands and say that the Minister of State signed regulations and that they have no role or function.  We just need to be careful.  I would like to see tighter guidelines on the use of antennae and on additions to antennae.  <\/p><p> I will tell the Minister of State of a situation.  I know of a woman who was very ill and commissioned very interesting research.  She worked for the Defence Forces.  She was very much involved in engineering and telecommunications.  She had independent research carried out on antennae and on the accumulative effect of the 30 or 40 antennae attached to a particular church.  By the way, the church did not have planning permission.  It said it was exempt.  That was pursued and it was found not to be exempt.  The antennae required planning permission, which was granted.  The permission was appealed, An Bord Plean&aacute;la accepted the appeal and all the equipment had to be taken down.  That is a very long process which is also not very satisfactory.  There were serious health issues in respect of the antennae, the radiation and the accumulative effect of the combined network, which was a high-radiation network at one particular point.  It would not be right of me to come in here and not to voice those concerns.<\/p><p> Public health and the location of these antennae near schools and hospitals has to be an issue.  I am not a scientist.  I do not know enough about it.  I have read enough about people's concerns to feel that it warrants some attention.  What am I going to suggest?  There is no point in bellyaching without coming up with a proposal.  My proposal may possibly not be suited to these regulations but it might be a possibility in the broader legislative framework.   I am calling for a register of approved telecommunications structures and their locations, which would be supported by a relevant database.  I will email this to the Minister of State.  A database should be created and maintained by each planning authority in co-operation with the telecommunications operators.  Such a register would provide an important input in the assessment of future telecommunications developments and would also be useful in maximising the potential for future mast sharing, possible co-location and all that is associated with it, bearing in mind the accumulative effect on which we need more research.<\/p><p> Furthermore, I suggest that planning consent - and I am saying planning consent, not planning permission - should include a condition stating that when the structure is no longer required it should be demolished, removed and the site reinstated by the operator - not the applicant, but the operator at its own expense.  That might address the issue if it was introduced through some other form of legislation.<\/p><p> I will wrap up on this final issue.  In the Minister of State's statement he spoke about changes to the permitted height of poles for antennae and increases in the permitted number and size of dishes on structures.  He said that he will facilitate an increase in the number of antennae permitted on large structures and spoke about the deployment of smaller cells.  I understand the need for the national broadband plan and its roll-out in rural parts of the country.  It is critical for economic development and all that goes with it.  That is all to be welcomed.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment but a balance must be found.  It will be the public representatives, including the Minister of State as a Deputy for Meath West, who will have to face the next backlash when we see a massive set of structures put up right beside a school or hospital.  I am not suggesting that this is the mechanism to deal with it.<\/p><p>It was suggested for many years that we should establish a national database mapping all antennae.  This morning, three planning authorities have informed us that no such database is in place.  Effectively, this means they do not know where antennae are located.  They learn about the locations of antennae, for example, on a church steeple, when a resident telephones the local authority asking why a vehicle from company X is parked at a particular location.  The company in question will then inform the local authority that an antenna has been in place in the location for years and staff were repairing or upgrading it.  This means the planning authority does not know about it.  All these structures must be mapped out and communities informed of their locations.  While local people should not be the arbiter of decisions on locations, they should be able to express a view on this infrastructure.<\/p><p> My local authority has received an application to erect three of these structures.  The planning authority has confirmed it is considering the application and indicated its decision will be open to appeal, which is democratic.  Let us not water down the powers of citizens to engage.  As I stated, these structures are fine when they are not on our doorstep but it is another story when one is erected in Navan and people bang on the Minister of State's door asking what he will do about it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#F00400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516705200,"counter":782,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":783,"content":"<p>On Senator Boyhan's final point, these structures are a double-edged sword in many respects because we also want to improve communications.  Members of the Oireachtas use communications every day.  People want technology to progress and we need the best available technology.  The visual issue may be a concern for the Senator and some of my constituents.  Before one has a surfeit of masts and antennae, we must first ensure proposed new infrastructure cannot be piggy-backed on existing masts.  In other words, we should try to have four separate masts working from one item of physical infrastructure.  Notwithstanding the commitment, if that is what it is, to increase the numbers of masts, new masts should only be erected if the companies in question can show it is not possible to piggy-back on the existing system.  I expect the issue is one of security, for example, a logarithm or similar, and may not be a physical issue.<\/p> <p>  Years ago, people were afraid they would be fried by these masts or that a chicken placed beside one of them would roast overnight.  These fears were not realised but they affected the capacity of communities to obtain proper reception for their mobile telephones.  People in some parts of County Louth do not have good mobile telephone reception, for example, on the approach to Monasterboice.  Every county has its problems.  We must use best available technology but the companies must first show that the communications cannot be carried on existing infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  I recently received complaints from people in County Louth about a decision to reject an application for a new mast in County Meath.  I was not familiar with the details of the case as it involved a different county.  The complaints were made by residents of a particular part of County Louth which has very poor broadband coverage.  From their perspective, the mast would have improved broadband and delivered a major benefit to their community.  It would be useful in cases involving applications to increase the height or number of antennae to assess the community benefit as well as the benefits for commercial users and private companies.  We should ask whether broadband coverage in the local area could be improved and, if so, whether it would be a good idea to do so. <\/p> <p>  In many cases, it is not necessary to install pointed antennae on top of a building because they can be hidden within a structure or constructed in a way that they do not protrude visually.  <\/p> <p>  I apologise for arriving late.  I understand the Minister of State was speaking about over-the-shop developments and planning when I arrived.  This area offers significant scope to deliver material benefits to hundreds of households, particularly single people and couples who do not have children.  It is not easy for families with young children to live above a shop because of the need to go up and down stairs and so forth.<\/p><p> Let us consider our town centres.  My own town centre is practically empty at night.  It is not that they are no-go zones but they are more like no-people zones.  There is no one living over the shops; there is no one there.  Anyone who has the wisdom and time can examine the 1901 census and see all the people and families who lived in the centre of towns and all the activities that went on there.  All that is gone.<\/p><p> It makes sense to bring people back to the centre of towns.  The physical infrastructure is in place, including water services, sewerage, public lighting and proximity to shops and services.  There is a bonus in it.  There is a downside and we are dealing with the associated problems too.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin's concerns over fire regulations.  There should be mandatory standards.  Property owners should have to get a certificate from the fire officer to say that what they are doing meets the requirements.  I support making it easier for people to develop dwelling space over shops.<\/p><p> Certain areas near older transport hubs have potential.  I am not suggesting it applies in every case but there are areas near railway and bus stations and so on.  Often these are in older parts of cities and towns.  Fast-track developments in such zones are important.  We could zone areas where there is no habitation - these include abandoned shopping areas or areas that are no longer active commercially.  I would welcome fast-track zoning for development in such areas.<\/p><p> We should consider what happens in the United Kingdom.  I have looked at the website of the empty homes organisation in the United Kingdom.  It has plenty of examples of abandoned bank buildings, shops, garage forecourts and so on that are now occupied by families and have been turned into apartments.  There is constructive living and urban renewal.  There are major benefits.  That is why I welcome the advances from the Department with the assessment provisos that people are suggesting.<\/p><p> The lack of housing needs to be met with increased urgency from the Department.  Whatever the initiatives are, I would welcome greater initiatives.  Those responsible in the UK appoint empty homes officers in local authorities.  I am not suggesting that is the destination the Department has in mind for Ireland, but it might be helpful to have people who could map the centre of the town, knock on each door and ascertain who owns each premises.  If there is no one there, they could use the Louth solution, which is to slap a compulsory purchase order on the property if it meets the requirements.  We need active on-the-ground officers, whose job it could be to report to the county manager and the Department on a quarterly basis.  That is one of the things missing from our housing policy.  It is not that we do not care, but the sense of urgency is not being transmitted.  I believe that could change with the appointment of such officers.  A website like that operating in the UK may be the type of constructive engagement we need to create the sense of urgency and crisis.  I do not get the same sense when I walk around my town because I am still looking at premises.  I welcome the support of Louth County Council.  I looked at a place where we could have 16 people living.  The problem is that is an old building and would require more money than usual to do up  but I think we should do it up because it is in the centre of the town.  The old Central Hotel in Drogheda is right in the centre of the town.  There were 15 or 16 bedrooms in it.  It is abandoned now and there is no one in it.  We should get in there and turn it into habitable dwelling space.<\/p><p> Finally, I welcome in particular the engagement of organisations like the Peter McVerry Trust in tackling derelict buildings in cities.  I welcome this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#H00200","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming.  I want to talk about part 2 of the statutory instrument.  I am a little disappointed because I thought we would have worked through our vacant housing Bill.  It took a more holistic approach to converting vacant properties into residential units because it dealt with planning, fire and disability certification, as well as final certification.  In its response to the Bill the Department stated: <\/p><blockquote>Separately, there is a concern about the proposal in the Bill in relation to making the sub-division of a dwelling into two or more dwellings exempt from planning permission.  This conflicts with the Planning Act which provides that such development is a material change of use requiring consideration by a planning authority through the planning application process, with particular regard to protecting residential amenity and other considerations. <\/blockquote> <p>The Minister of State's statutory instrument is proposing allowing up to nine sub-divisions within each dwelling.  We all have concerns about the fire and safety regulations.  As pointed out and acknowledged in our Bill, there are no technical documents on fire and disability certification when older buildings are being converted.  The Minister of State is acknowledging that the technical guidance documents are not and will not be there for a few months.  Is the proposed statutory instrument premature until the documents are available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#K00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":786,"content":"<p>We have been through the vacant housing Bill here and in the Department and also discussed it in the D&aacute;il.  It is a worthwhile Bill which is aiding our work, but our approach to it and tackling this issue and an issue raised as Action No. 5.9 of Rebuilding Ireland is two-pronged.  First, it deals with the exemptions in respect of what we are putting forward today.  We all agreed that ideally commercial buildings such as shop on main streets should be turned back into housing.  There is permission for up to nine units because it applies to commercial buildings only.  The difficulty the Department had with Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill was that it would allow the sub-division of an existing house.  Where would it stop?  There are houses all over the country.  People would try left, right and centre to make two houses out of one, which would not be conducive to good planning.<\/p> <p>  This measure refers to a commercial building of a size in which, under all of the regulations, up to nine units could be fitted in.  That is what we are allowing for.  We are working on a version of the sub-division of a house such that under existing planning laws space can be made available to share a house.  The winning proposal in the competition in the Homes for Smart Ageing Universal Design Challenge involved dividing a house in a certain way to allow one person to occupy that house; it is not two houses.  It comes under the exempted development legislation and I will bring it forward here later.  It has almost passed through pilot stage.  It is worth considering.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill was a little different and we could not agree to it because of the planning authority.  We are willing to discuss it further later, but this discussion is about bringing commercial buildings back into use.  <\/p> <p>  The second part which is intended to make it easier and viable for anyone who owns commercial buildings to bring them back into use involves issues concerning fire safety, the building regulations and the heritage regulations which do not make it easy for someone to bring a property back into use.  In counties Wicklow and Carlow and other places where I visited properties on the high street that could be brought back into use, it is very complicated and people are afraid to touch the system.  In the light of Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill and our own discussions, in late 2007 we set up a working group across all Departments to consider these issues and bring forward new guidelines for local authorities.  It was important to have the Department of Culture, Heritage and Local Government on board to make it as easy as possible to cut out some of the unnecessary red tape, not to renege on safety and health measures but to make it easier where we could give better guidance in this area .  That is what we are doing.  I hope the working document will come out in the next couple of weeks.<\/p><p>It will aid the work that is carried out here.  In light of that document, these exemptions are not premature.  People can still work away under the existing planning regulations and certification process.  Any guidance we have, if it changes that, will kick in for this as well.  As of today, it is the existing planning regulations continue to apply.  It is not premature.  The other document will be useful.  The working group, which is chaired by the Department, will hopefully report quite soon.  I think it will bring forward many resolutions similar to those discussed by this committee and with which I would agree.  It is important that we do it in a co-ordinated way and ensure that all Departments - not just mine - will be involved.  I assure the Chairman that the committee's good work on that Bill will not be wasted.  It is best to take the two-pronged approach with which we are trying to proceed.  That deals with the Chairman's questions.  I will move on to those from Senator Boyhan shortly.<\/p><p> Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin also raised two questions, the first of which relates to his concern regarding whether we are giving a blanket ban to Irish Water.  We are absolutely not.  Are we confident that we do not go too far in what we are doing here?  We are confident because it is exactly the way it was with the local authorities for I do not know how many years but for a long number of years, as long as I can remember.  The same exemptions are there.  We are not changing any of that.  It is just giving Irish Water the same exemptions that were there for local authorities, with which most people were happy.  To my knowledge, there have been no cases of concern.<\/p><p> To be very clear, under the section 5 process, people can appeal exemptions.  That is the issue that Senator Boyhan raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#K00300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I referred to section 57.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#L00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":789,"content":"<p>Section 57 as well.  We are mainly dealing with section 5 today.  Section 57 relates to protected structures.  Under both, there is an appeal mechanism to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Either side can bring that appeal or review and the board will give a decision.  That mechanism is available.  I can get the Senator a note on that if he wants the position clarified.  This is an issue with which, for many reasons, I am very familiar as a result of what has happened in my county, not just in the context of telephone masts but for other reasons as well.  The process is there and it is useful because it gives people the right to raise concerns.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin's other question was about building control and the fear or perception that giving people exemptions gives them free rein to go and do what they like.  That is not the case.  These exemptions are for buildings that already have planning permission.  Also, the building process, building regulations and the certification process kick in for any development being brought forward.  There has to be an assigned certifier and all the professionals involved, so there is no way of coming under the radar or escaping the rules.  They are there for any building and for anyone who wants to develop a home.  From analysis, most people would say that our system of regulation is quite strong now.  The certification process that was introduced a few years ago is working very well and gives us much greater assurance that building control is followed.  There are always inspections and that as well, of course.  I reassure members that these exemptions will not allow anybody to escape that.  That is not the case, at all.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan asked about social housing, Part V and our reasons for choosing the figure of nine units.  That figure was chosen specifically with regard to the Part V requirement for up to 10% of social housing development in excess of nine units.  It is only above nine units that the 10% kicks in.  The Part V obligations involve engaging with the local authority and are normally dealt with in tandem with the planning process.  It would be important that we do not exempt buildings above nine units because then we would lose the opportunity to have Part V requirements adhered to.  That would letting developers, builders and owners of properties out the gate.  It is specifically to achieve what the Senator wants that people do not get away from their obligations in this regard.  It is quite likely that many of these properties will come back into use.  Certainly, those located in town centres would be ideal for social housing because they have access to all the services a town provides.  These properties are ideal for the repair-and-lease initiative.  I must say I am disappointed that the repair-and-lease initiative was not taken up by more people.  We made changes to it yesterday to make it less complicated and more straightforward, with an earlier payback of money.  I hope that will encourage people to come forward.  It is an ideal mechanism to fund the work that could be carried out under these exemptions in some cases because it is up to a certain amount of money per unit.<\/p> <p>  What we are changing here will not allow anybody pass under the radar in terms of their Part V obligations, unlike what is happening in other countries where there was no limit on the size and properties were put forward with a couple of hundred units and with no social housing provision.  We are making sure that does not happen here.  I hope that puts the Senator's mind at ease.  I understand his question and hope I have made it clear to him as to why we picked the figure of nine.<\/p> <p>  The issue of staff resources in general was raised.  This goes back to the powers of local authorities and being in authority.  This is something I have discussed with the committee previously, as well as in many other places.<\/p><p>Resources are better than they were in the past thanks to people being back at work and more taxes coming in.  Therefore, we have to allow more money for local authorities to be in control of planning.  That involves having enough staff to deal with all questions, exemptions, checks and so on. <\/p><p> On substandard accommodation, our aim is that by 2019 properties will be inspected every four years.  We are putting more resources in place to allow for this to happen, which means more people across the planning system.  I agree with the Senator that, as a Department, it is our job to work with local authorities to make sure resources are in place.  It is probably fair to say resources have not always been in place and that this might be an area which does not receive the full attention it needs.  <\/p><p> Exemptions will not affect the situation to which the Senator referred because the properties are exempt.  Local authorities are notified when people register and we will keep an eye on the numbers.  If local authorities consider they need more staff in certain areas, they can bring forward their requests to us and we will deal with them.  In general, when it comes to tackling derelict, neglected or vacant properties, local authorities need to be strengthened.  We had a discussion on this matter yesterday and most people have the same view.<\/p><p> On the development plan, national guidelines have been set down for telecommunications, telephone masts, wind farms and so on.  We ask that development plans respect the national guidelines.  Like previous Ministers and Ministers of State, I will have to step in if development plans try to undermine the national guidelines when it comes to important infrastructure.  Very often we have to advise local authorities that a blanket ban on any development within one mile of a school is not permitted under the national guidelines. <\/p><p> We publish national guidelines for consultation purposes.  There are guidelines for wind energy projects passing through the system.  They will change matters and make things easier for people.  Likewise, guidelines have been set down for telecommunications.  We are making changes to small rather than large structures which will be very clear in respect of field strength.  The guidelines state the field strength of any small antenna shall not result in the non-ionising radiation emitting from the radio installations on the site exceeding the limit specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation.  The commission brings forward all of the standards and recommendations based on EU law and best practice.  It deals with many organisations in that regard, but the national guidelines are clear.  My colleagues from the Department can clarify any issue the Senator may have.  It is my understanding the regulator has a register of all planned telecommunications infrastructure and that it should be up-to-date at all times, but I will check the position for the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#L00300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":791,"content":"<p>No; I have referred to local authorities which have overall responsibility for planning.

All mobile phone operators have infrastructure and mast sharing arrangements in place.  They may have tried to avoid this in the past, but generally they have come to arrangements which are cost-effective and managed to deal with most of the issues involved.  The sharing arrangements promote co-ordination of the use of mast infrastructure and reduce the number of masts used.  For planning purposes, as well as other reasons, we like to see infrastructure being used wisely and shared, where possible.  I am well aware that this did not happen in the past, but we have moved on in the past couple of years and it is something we can address in the future.<\/p> <p>  All planning applications are not judged on the community benefits, but when it comes to telecommunications and other infrastructure, generaly community gain overrides other considerations.<\/p><p>I do not know what they were, but I presume there were some reasons for what happened.<\/p><p> I welcome the support for the exemption for commercial properties.  Deputy O'Dowd hit the nail on the head.  Breathing life back into parts of our towns and villages that have been neglected over the years is exactly what we are trying to do here.  There are shops that have been lying empty for years.  This affects properties that have been vacant for two years, so it will not encourage vacancy in order to achieve exemption from planning permission.  It is designed to deal with vacancies of over two years' duration.  It is common sense, and I absolutely agree that it will breathe life back into many parts of towns and villages.  The people who own these properties need to be jolted into doing something with them.  What we are trying to do is make it easier to work with local authorities in the context of the building control mechanism.<\/p><p> Apart from simplifying the planning process, the other benefit of doing that relates to development fees and development contribution levies.  They can sometimes take effect when there is a change to the use of a building.  That can make it less attractive to bring forward plans for development or it can mean that owners need a certain level of resources in order to do so.  Generally, the owners of these properties are exempt and that makes it easier to bring the properties back into use.  That is exactly what we want to happen.<\/p><p> The UK was mentioned as an example.  Many of these initiatives in urban rejuvenation are in operation there.  We have a similar example in Waterford with the strategic development zone, SDZ, which is developing the urban area similarly to the manner that has been suggested.  We have set up a fund which can be used to aid major urban renewal schemes, and we will be bringing forward the details of that scheme in the weeks ahead.  Resources were allocated in the recent budget to help us tackle dereliction and vacancy and to co-ordinate different Departments to do so.  There are various initiatives across the different action plans to do that.  The challenge is in finding the resources to do it.<\/p><p> I am of the view that local authorities need to be front and centre in this.  We are trying put them in a strong position so that they can drive this agenda.  We had a lengthy discussion at our housing summit yesterday about dealing with properties that have been lying idle for many years.  Along with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and all of my Department colleagues, I stressed the importance of local authorities to this.  We discussed the local authorities that are doing this well, Louth being one example, and we encourage all of them to come at this with the same urgency.  I made it clear that we will not tackle a vacancy problem or under-utilisation of property without local authorities fully taking it on.  We have committed resources to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#M00700","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":798,"content":"<p>Is there a system whereby there are reports back to the Minister of State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#N00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":799,"content":"<p>Yes.

Very often, owners need to be encouraged to bring properties forward.  We want local authorities to knock on doors, inquire about properties and try to encourage their development.  Councillors have a role in doing this because they generally know who the people involved.

I was delighted to hear about the meeting that took place yesterday.  It is important to get the officials in all the local authorities together because a problem exists in this area.  The Minister of State referred to the repair and lease scheme but, in general terms, it is not working because of a funding issue.  Carlow and Waterford were two of the counties to which it was rolled out.   There is an imbalance when it comes to rural Ireland in that the owners of small commercial shops are barely taking home a living and they are finding it very hard to come up with the necessary funding.  The issue of funding is the main reason that scheme has not taken off.  Unless a funding stream can be put in place that would provide an incentive for the refurbishment of commercial units in town centres, this proposal will not work.  The three-year timeframe for it - up until 31 December 2021 - is very short.  I believe that will be a big problem, and that needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State met all the chief executive officers - or county managers as I and many people would refer to them - of the local authorities yesterday.  How many people do they believe will take up this proposal, how many will invest in it, and how will it work?  As we are aware, there is a massive issue in our small urban areas.  We need to get life back into our town centres, particularly in rural Ireland where the owners of small commercial units are finding it very hard to exist.  We can put in place as many regulations as we want but unless there is an uptake of this proposal, it will not work.  The Minister needs to sit down with the owners of the commercial units.  The council officials need to meet them.  How many does the Minister think might take up the proposal?  I note he said that only some of the councils have come back to him with those figures. <\/p> <p>  This can be compared to imposing compulsory purchase orders.  Efforts have been made to apply compulsory purchase orders to buildings in town centres for many years.  There are no regulations in place in that respect.  There are a great number of issues involved in town centres that are not been addressed.  If this exemption will apply for only three years, it is crucial that the Minister of State ensures that it will work because unless it will work we might as well not provide it.  I would have massive concerns about it.  The regulations propose an exemption for a change of use, which I welcome.  I am in favour of renewal and factors such as buyer safety and building regulations are crucial.  However, there is the matter of the way this proposal will work and the way the incentives will work for the people concerned.  Funding is the biggest issue facing everyone who has a commercial property.  That is the reason many of them are derelict.  Two years is a very small timescale.  I could advise the Minister of State of buildings that have been derelict for ten or 15 years.  We need to make sure that there is something in place that can with worked with.<\/p> <p>  If this proposal goes ahead and I hope it does, working through the local authorities, what will be the exact timescale for it?  Can the Minister of State give us three or four pointers with respect to working with the local authorities and the commercial owners to turn their properties into viable housing units?  What role will each of those parties play?  What exactly is the Minister of State going to do for them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#O00400","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":812,"content":"<p>I want to pick up on two or three points, and I am mindful of what the Minister of State said in his responses.  Regarding section 5 and section 57 declarations, and I have had a look through the Planning and Development Act, a copy of which I have in front of me, members of the public and politicians would not know if a section 5 or a section 57 declaration had been submitted.  We need to look at that again and have a register.  Reference was made to an appeal.  I have been to a number of local authorities today and no one seems to quite know what happens.  Declarations are not laid before anyone.  The only way one will find a declaration if one is clever enough, through chief executive's orders, or what we would have known as the county manager's orders and many local authorities are not even getting these.  Section 57 and section 5 declarations would be included in them.<\/p><p>On foot of section 57 and section 5 I rigorously and meticulously month in and month out had people hauling trolleys into county hall and I went through everything.  At one stage in my office I had thousands of manager's orders and the chief executive used to ask me how I knew everything.  It was because I took the bloody time to look and read, but one cannot expect all members to have that amount of time.  We have a listing system for planning applications every week in every local authority.  We need a system to flag section 5s and 57s because it is about openness and transparency and that is important.  How can one have an appeal?  It is all on websites.  Let us imagine that I am in a little place such as Johnstown in Meath and I live in a little cottage, am 57 years of age and have two lamps, I do not have any IT or a son or daughter to access the Internet.  We must be user-friendly for a whole generation of people who want to engage.  The first thing they see is something in the sky outside their door and they are told they did not appeal it.  What is the process?  Who does one register with first?  What is the fee?  The case then goes to the board.  I do not say we must do it all today but let us tease out how section 5 and section 57 declarations come to the attention of the public.  I was a councillor for years and I could not find out.  One would have to ring up on a regular basis or one would see something or hear a man with a big truck putting something up and that would be the first one would know about something happening.  That is an important point.<\/p><p> I wish to reiterate my concern to the Minister of State because I know I will be back to him in a few months.

I know that before the close of business the media will be asking me to comment on that.  I have flagged at this public meeting public health considerations.  My quote referred to the Minister including two reminders to the planning authorities, namely, that health grounds should not be considered as part of any planning.  It is important to make that point.  I think we are going to have a lot of concern about it and the Minister of State will have people getting on his case within a week asking him about it.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the importance of national broadband and mobile phones, which all feed into economic development and prosperity for our people and country, which is marvellous.  I see where the Minister of State is going but let us set out public engagement, ensure there is a process and deal with the fees in terms of how people can appeal.  I have read a lot of documentation about this issue.  I call for a register of approved telecommunications structures and locations, supported by a relevant database.  I have spoken to senior planners across the country who tell me they are not aware of there being a relevant database to be created and maintained by the statutory planning authority in each case.  Proper planning and sustainable development is very important and a national database mapping out who all of those are is required.  Such a register would provide important input for the assessment of future telecommunications developments and would also be used from the point of view of maximising the potential for future sharing, co-locating and managing the structure.

I know we cannot amend the regulations so the Minister of State must proceed with them, which I presume he will do.  Could he tell us that is what he will do and the timeframe he envisages?  In that case it is a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  That begs the question of what we are doing here, but that is another day's work.

Local authorities were not asked to give us any indications on this.  This is not a scheme that will be driven by local authorities.  It is a scheme aimed at the owners of the properties and involves giving them a planning exemption to make it more viable and more straightforward for them to bring their properties back into use.

I have also asked the local authorities to put people in charge of making this happen.  We need people to drive this because if it is not driven by the local authorities and by councillors of all parties and none, it will not happen.  I must disagree with Senator Murnane O'Connor on the question of funding.  A cash payment of &euro;40,000 per unit, upfront, to renovate a property is quite attractive and in most cases would make the proposition viable.  The majority of these properties, based on analysis, would need less than &euro;30,000 to be brought back into use.  In that context, I disagree with the Senator's assertion that the funding is inadequate.  In some cases, with the changes we have announced, permission can be granted to go a little bit above the limit.  If the property was previously a bedsit and it is an attractive proposition to return it to use, there is scope for local authorities to go above the &euro;40,000 limit.  That said, I believe that a sum of &euro;40,000 is quite attractive.  The issue for many property owners was the ten-year commitment that was required.  I always felt that was too long and that has now been changed to a five-year commitment, which will make the scheme far more attractive to people.  The scheme is attractive but people just do not seem to know about it or understand it.  That is why I repeatedly ask Members of both Houses to advertise this deal in their constituencies and among councillors, to let people know it is there.  The Department will conduct a national advertising campaign but people need to hear about it and to be told that it is a good scheme.  In my opinion, it is a very good scheme.  It was introduced because people told us that they did not have funds to spend on their properties to bring them up to a standard that would allow them to be rented out.  This scheme provides those funds and is logical.  It is, however, separate to what we are discussing today which is the exemption.  There is a bit of a kick-on but they are not totally linked.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure what the Senator's concern is with regard to two or three years.  This is in line with commitments made in Rebuilding Ireland.  It is an exemption that will apply up until the end of the term covered by that document, that is, to the end of 2021.  We are trying to drive on change today, not in ten years' time.  We want to see activity now and most of the actions we have in this document are about driving activity in the present because we need more houses today.  We want to tackle dereliction and vacancy but we also want to solve homelessness and the housing shortage.  We are not introducing changes that will help in 20 years' time.  This is about now as well as the years ahead.  I am not sure what the Senator's concerns are in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan made reference to health grounds but the planning authority is not the judge of health related matters.  There are national guidelines set down by various commissioners and regulators.  Their job is to analyse all the WHO documents, the European directives and so on.  The guidelines are then set by Departments in conjunction with regulators.  Planning authorities are concerned with planning matters and are not there to make judgments on health matters.  The same principle applies to development plans.<\/p><p> I like Senator Boyhan's suggestion - there is merit in it - of public awareness and engagement around section 5 and section 27 provisions.  Again, they are in place and there are hundreds of exemptions throughout the pages of legislation.  Most have been in place for many years for good reason.  The system enables exemptions under certain classes and categories in order to move forward.  That is what they are there for.  We can take a look at Senator Boyhan's suggestion of a register or public notice, but I have no wish to defeat the purpose either.  Anyway, I will look at it to see if we can get the balance right.<\/p><p> Planning permission is required for anything substantial and people have to go through the whole process.  Exemptions can make an application viable.  If we make it too cumbersome or awkward, it will not happen and we will achieve nothing.  I know what Senator Boyhan is saying.  We can discuss the balance.  It is something we will review.  There is logic in it.  A register of section 5 applications is kept although it is not always talked about or seen.  Perhaps we can look at making it a more public document or more-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#R00900","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":837,"content":"<p>It should be more transparent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012300002#S00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1516705200,"counter":838,"content":"<p>Yes.

Others own properties and have the necessary cash but have no wish to spend it.  That is their choice.  The scheme was brought forward to aid people who have qualifying properties and would like to see them utilised but cannot borrow the money or have no means to pay it back.

We believe that in the majority of cases it is attractive and would work.  People can add to that from their own resources if they wish.

This amendment provides for his or her removal from the Judicial Appointments Commission, with a view to keeping a healthy distance between Government and this first stage of the process when the Judicial Appointments Commission selects and recommends a three person short-list.  In any event, the Attorney General as legal adviser to the Government will naturally be involved at the second stage of the process when the Government considers and decides which of the three names to nominate to the President for appointment.<\/p><p>It would be procedurally unnecessary and incorrect to duplicate the Attorney General's involvement at both first and second stages of the process.  Both the Law Society and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, in their 2014 submissions as part of the consultation process suggested the removal of the Attorney General for this and other reasons.  The ICCL referred to the Attorney General as a political appointee.  Replacing the Attorney General with the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, would improve the balance of the commission as the IHREC chief commissioner cannot be regarded as either a wholly legal or a wholly lay person.  Initially when we had a balance of six and six plus one, it would bring a bit of extra balance.  Given we are looking at getting rid of the smaller subcommittees, the numbers are going to work out a bit different.  I still think that getting rid of the Attorney General from this section will help us to reach a good place when we reconfigure the full commission, now that we have voted to get rid of the subcommittees.  It adds a welcome human rights perspective to the selection and recommendation process, ensuring that section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 is adhered to.<\/p><p>It is a statutory body established by the State in accordance with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  It has a statutory function to advise the State in regard to compliance with human rights standards, both domestic and international.  It is particularly appropriate that its chief commissioner would have input in regard to the appointment of judges, which is a fundamental rule of law issue in any democracy.  I refer to the Law Society's submission in March 2017.  It stated:<\/p><blockquote>If the new Commission is to be genuinely independent in its function, there should be no reason for the Attorney General, who also sits at the Cabinet table to participate in discussions of the Commission.  The Attorney General should give his or her perspective at Cabinet or in the course of discussions with relevant Cabinet members following receipt of recommendations made to Government by the Commission.  Furthermore, as the Attorney General is a major purchaser of legal services in the State, there is a risk of conflict of professional interest in the Attorney General being the central element at each stage of the judicial selection process.  There is no good reason why the Attorney General must be a member of the Commission.  It is not the standard practice in comparable jurisdictions.  It diminishes the independence of the Commission and the Government will have the benefit of the advice of the Attorney General at a political level in any event.  The Society has one of its central functions an ongoing vigilance for the protection of the independence of the legal profession.  When an obvious conflict of interest such as this arises, it is the duty of the Society to challenge it.  This is a brand new system and as a result assumptions about the merit of the status quo must be challenged.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#G00500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendment No. 31, which is an enabling amendment allowing for the more substantial amendment No. 50.  That amendment is not included in this grouping, so it is necessary to explain the amendments.<\/p> <p>  One of the points raised on Second Stage was that, while the issue of a lay majority was favoured by many, a lay membership alone would not suffice, in that lay members would need to be more than the traditional State board appointees.  They would have to have a wide range of perspectives and experiences and be representative of society as a whole, covering various organisations and sectors.<\/p> <p>  The amendments propose three different models.  If I understand Deputies Daly and Wallace correctly, one model replaces the Attorney General with the Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  I support that.  They also propose replacing two of the six lay members with a representative of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and a representative of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL.  Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers propose that there be six specific nominees for lay appointment.<\/p> <p>  My approach is that there needs to be flexibility.  While the ICCL, FLAC and the IHREC are worthy organisations to nominate people, there are other bodies.  For example, the National Women's Council of Ireland might have an interest in the manner in which violence against women is treated in the courts and, consequently, be interested in judicial appointments.  There is any number of other relevant organisations, including the Migrants Right Centre Ireland and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Rather than be prescriptive, my proposed approach is for six lay nominees to be divided into two categories.  Three are described in amendments Nos. 31 and 50 as \"the General Lay Appointments\" who would be appointed through the traditional Public Appointments Service, PAS, approach.  The others would be what I have called \"the Diversity and Social Inclusion Appointments\".  This would allow for any organisation that is interested in nominating persons and can demonstrate its relevance to the objectives of diversity as outlined in section 7 and-or the nine grounds in the Employment Equality Acts to be considered an organisation that can nominate.  The PAS could maintain a list of organisations capable of nominating.  It would then be for the judicial appointments commission to choose between their nominations to the three lay positions.<\/p> <p>  The advantage of this flexibility is that a call can go out to interested organisations, such as those I have mentioned, for nominations of persons whom they believe to be suitable for appointment to the judicial appointments commission.  Those persons would have to demonstrate their capacity in terms of the eight criteria outlined in the legislation.  Although I favour this approach over those favoured by other Deputies, I have a preference for that of Deputies Daly and Wallace.  While there is merit in the approach taken by Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers, it is more restrictive.  The flexibility of the other amendment is preferable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#H00100","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":912,"content":"<p>In some ways, we are probably trying to do the same thing by reconfiguring the lay membership and striking a better, more representative balance as part of that.  Amendments in the preceding group - they could not be moved because Deputy Sherlock was not present - overlapped with this in some respects.<\/p><p>I am not sure what the final configuration will be and so we probably will not be able to deal with this issue until Report Stage.<\/p><p> Under the current system, lay people are very much particular types of individuals and they come, in the main, from the commercial and financial sectors and their curricula vitae would reflect those of senior civil servants or business big-wigs, which is fine but we need more than that.  The amendments deal with some of the aspects around how laypersons are configured.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire stated, Fianna F&aacute;il has said that all of the laypersons should come from organisations.  However, we would prefer a mix, with some coming from organisations and others coming by way of appointment through the PAS.  I acknowledge there is a bit of a middle ground in that proposal.  In our rush to get the amendments in, which is many months ago now, we may not have properly added up our sums.  For example, the four should perhaps be a three to ensure balance.  However, we are not fixed on that for the moment.  The PAS, for all its good work, cannot be viewed as being entirely independent.  There are issues of potential explicit political influence and, moreover, the subtle influence of a particular world view of the types of people who would meet the criteria.  Our amendments seek to correct the current loading of the commission with a certain type of person that the PAS would have to consider.  We want to ensure that the commission is a lot more diverse and has a range of views and voices.<\/p><p> I agree with the point made by Deputy Wallace.  We are proposing to replace the Attorney General with the Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which may have to change in light of the consensus for the inclusion of the presidents of the District Court and the Circuit Court.  As Deputy Wallace pointed out earlier, the elimination of the Attorney General would free up a space for one of them.  We would be happy enough on that score.  However, the fact remains that there is no reason that the Attorney General should sit on this commission.  I do not see what expertise he or she could bring to the role of appointing judicial members.  The Attorney General is already involved in the appointments process at Cabinet in any event.  No other model replicates that.<\/p><p> In light of the changes made earlier, I do not think any of these amendments will achieve what we are trying to do.  However, we remain adamant on the Attorney General not being a member of the commission.  If he or she is not a member, it would free up space for others to serve on the commission.  We are not overly hung up on the lay versus legal issue, rather we are more concerned about the type of layperson that would be appointed in order to ensure the diversity needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#H00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":914,"content":"<p>What we are debating is how laypersons are appointed.  This could be done by asking the PAS to select the individuals but we are proposing that they be nominated by particular bodies.  For example, the Act which currently governs the appointment of the Garda Commissioner states that the PAS shall run a competition to select a new person for the role.  We all would be very fearful of that but, fortunately, within that legislation is a role for the Policing Authority.  It is important to have a body with the experience and expertise to advise on the type of person for which the PAS should be looking.  If we allow a situation whereby the PAS can nominate a person based on competition or open application, we will not then be able to mould the commission in a way that is reflective of society.  It would be much better to have bodies that are reflective of different aspects of Irish society yet have a knowledge and involvement in the courts nominate who they would wish to be a member of the commission.  It is a role they would take very seriously.  They would be able to cajole people who may in the ordinary course of events not apply to the PAS to take on the role.<\/p> <p>  I support amendment No. 26, which seeks to do two things, the first of which is to remove the Attorney General from the commission.  I recently put forward legislation on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il that provided for a judicial appointments commission of which the Attorney General would not be a member.  The reason for the latter was not that the Attorney General lacks the relevant expertise or knowledge but because we thought it was inappropriate for him or her to have two bites at the cherry.<\/p><p>The Attorney General would not only be a member of the commission, which would recommend to the Government who should be nominated to a position, but would also be present when those names came to the Cabinet, advising the Government on who should or should not be appointed.  That would have entailed too much of a governmental involvement in the commission.<\/p><p> The Attorney General, whoever that may be, has significant expertise in terms of advising on judicial appointments, but that is a function played by the Attorney General in Cabinet when he or she is advising the Minister on who or should not be appointed.  If the names that come from the commission are not adequate or acceptable or if the Attorney General believes that they are not appropriate for appointment, he or she can say so and the Government can refuse them.  Notwithstanding all of this structure, the Government maintains the prerogative to appoint or not appoint people recommended to it.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 26 proposes to replace the Attorney General with the Chief Commissioner of the IHREC.  I would have preferred that body to be able to nominate someone.  Notwithstanding that, I will support the amendment and may table a further amendment on Report Stage.<\/p><p> Regarding the other significant amendments, I note with surprise Deputy Wallace's amendment No. 30.  I support it fully.  He is proposing to include the President of the Circuit Court on the commission.  I note it with surprise because my amendment No. 25 was ruled out of order.  However, I am pleased to see that Deputy Wallace's proposal has not been ruled out of order.<\/p><p> I have concerns about Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment.  It would complicate the process a great deal if some members were appointed under the diversity and social inclusion heading while others were appointed under the general lay person heading.<\/p><p> I will support Deputy Daly's amendment seeking to reduce the number of lay people from six to four.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#J00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":916,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 26, which was moved by Deputies Wallace and Daly and debated by other Deputies, proposes to replace the Attorney General as a member of the commission with the Chief Commissioner of the IHREC.  I cannot accept the amendment.  One needs to acknowledge the importance of the role of the Attorney General and the manner in which that officer operates.  One also needs to acknowledge the fact that the Attorney General has been a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, since it was established more than 20 years ago.  Given that the Office of the Attorney General is the constitutional legal adviser to the Government and the Government has a constitutional role to play in advising the President on the persons to be appointed to judicial office, it seems that the presence of the Attorney General on the new commission would provide a key line of continuity between the design, oversight and management of the selection process for appointees to the office of judge and the ultimate decision by the Government as to the persons who are to be appointed.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman will appreciate, the Attorney General has a unique position as the recognised head of the Bar, plays an important function in both legal professions and is a key user of legal services for and on behalf of the Government.  Forming views as part of the commission process as to which candidates are or are not appropriate for appointment to judicial office, the perspective and focus of the Chief Commissioner of the IHREC would be different in nature from the Attorney General's.<\/p><p>With the greatest of respect to the office of Chief Commissioner, that person would not have the same perspective in terms of members of the professions.<\/p><p> Under section 15(7), which outlines the areas of desired professional expertise and experience for the selection of the lay members of the commission, we already have a specific reference to human rights.  I am somewhat amused by Deputy Daly's continued reference to this process as being occupied, directed, orchestrated or in the possession of civil servants and officials.  I see no reference to that in the legislation.  I invite members to examine section 15(7).  None of it makes any reference to anyone other than persons connected with areas of importance throughout the NGO sphere as well as agencies and stakeholders across the gamut of appropriate and necessary organisations within our society.  To suggest that the Civil Service has in some way an inordinate amount of influence under the new proposals is misleading.  Regarding amendment No. 26, though, there is an important role for the Attorney General in the process.<\/p><p> Deputy Daly's amendments Nos. 27 and 28 have been discussed and seem to propose that the practising solicitor and barrister, along with the lay members of the commission, be selected by the PAS.  I am unsure as to whether that would be an advantageous position.<\/p><p> In amendment No. 30, Deputy Wallace seeks to remove the lay chairperson selected by the PAS under section 15, but it is the Government's view that having a lay majority and lay chair is important.  We should continue along those lines.  Therefore, I am not prepared to accept that amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#K00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":918,"content":"<p>Has the Minister concluded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#L00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":919,"content":"<p>I have a rather extensive speaking note on the other amendments to which reference has not been specifically made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#L00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":920,"content":"<p>They are included in the group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#L00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":921,"content":"<p>It is important that I refer to them.  Members might then respond, if the Chairman agrees it is appropriate to do so.  The group includes a number of important amendments to which specific reference has not been made.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware of the commitment in the programme for Government to replace the JAAB with the new commission, which would have an independent chairperson selected by the PAS and approved by an Oireachtas committee - presumably, that would be this committee, which I would regard as the appropriate one - and a majority of laypersons, including persons of independent disposition, all of whom would have some form of specialist qualification to which reference has been made.<\/p><p> It is essential that the reforms open up the process to ensure a more meaningful and effective input for and on behalf of those persons who are effectively consumers of the services of the courts.  They rely, on an ongoing basis, on the fairness of the judicial system and on those who, through the expertise and specialties, can make a substantial contribution to the selection process.<\/p><p> When considering the chairperson role for the new commission, it must be acknowledged that the role of the commission goes beyond the rather narrow remit of the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board regime.  All those wishing to be considered for appointment, including serving judges, will be required to go through the commission.  The shortlist work will be far more onerous and will reduce what is practically an unlimited number of names at present down to only three names for one vacancy.  A range of new procedures, skills and attributes will be drawn up in the form of published statements.  Relevant committees for appointment will be expected to engage in the associated operations.  Commission members will design the requirements as the commission takes foot.<\/p><p> I envisage an important role for the new chairperson.  I believe it is important that the role is undertaken by a person with an appropriate skill set.<\/p><p> The board is changing into the commission.  I believe the lay involvement in the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board currently is inadequate.  I welcome the contribution of members in respect of the lay or non-legal contribution to the commission and the status of the non-legal or lay chairperson.  Again, it is important at every remove to acknowledge that the functions under the Bill are far more extensive than the existing functions of the appointments board.<\/p><p> We have considered the neighbouring jurisdictions of England, Wales and Scotland.  The appointment boards in those jurisdictions are chaired by persons who are accepted as being eminent non-legal or laypersons.  I acknowledge that in Northern Ireland the chief justice presides over the appointments commission there.  England and Wales have non-legal and non-judicial chairpersons of their appointment commissions.  In Scotland, the judicial appointments board has a non-judicial, non-legal or lay chairperson.  These systems are working well.  I am not suggesting they are perfect or ideal, but they are working well.  It is important to look to designs, models and systems that have been working well.<\/p><p> I believe that we are striking at the heart of the legislation.  We need to address certain issues to ensure that ultimately we bring about the best in this endeavour.<\/p><p> Section 15 provides for an independent, detached and objective process that will secure the services of the appointees.  A Public Appointments Service model has been operating in our public services for some years now.  Appointments to State boards are open to scrutiny.  The system is effective and transparent.  I do not subscribe to the views that I have heard that appear to question the integrity or process in the matter of the work of the Public Appointments Service.<\/p><p>Moreover, I believe that the Public Appointments Service is the appropriate body in the selection of lay members.  This ties in with what I said earlier in respect of section 15(7).<\/p><p> The Opposition amendments do not provide for a role for the Public Appointments Service and their acceptance would involve the deletion of section 15.  They envisage a mechanism for securing the lay membership of the commission based on a nominating body approach.  The bodies referenced include the Citizens Information Board, the Free Legal Advice Centres or the Top Level Appointments Committee.  I am concerned at Deputies putting forward a nominating body mechanism that is focused on specific number of organisations, including the Citizens Information Board, An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Free Legal Advice Centres and the Top Level Appointments Commission.  It is fair to say that there are many other mechanisms that may well be considered.  I hope that we could do so in a way to ensure the broadest possible base of participation.  Vital bodies in this context include, for example, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, victim support groups, Traveller representative groups, community Garda divisions, the Rape Crisis Centre, Amnesty International, domestic violence action organisations, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, refugee networks, the Children's Rights Alliance, Ruhama and many other similar groups that one could consider.  I do not believe that the best approach involves going for a list of nominated bodies, as suggested in the amendments.  Indeed, at one stage Deputy O'Callaghan indicated that potentially a number of bodies could be considered as appropriate nominators.  It is important that, in the context of these amendments, we give appropriate consideration to these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#L00500","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":924,"content":"<p>The Minister is making these arguments.  Our argument for taking the Attorney General out of the first stage process is based on the fact that the Attorney General is involved in the second stage process.  It is not a question of undermining the Attorney General.  We simply do not see why the Attorney General should be involved in both stages.  It does not seem to stack up.<\/p> <p>  The Minister made a comparison between the expertise of the Attorney General and the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  First, we are not doing away with the expertise of the Attorney General given that the Attorney General will be involved in the second stage.  Second, given that we are keen to get extra bodies on the full commission, namely, the President of the District Court and the President of the Circuit Court, I am prepared to look at whether we insist on the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission being part of the final commission when we go to Report Stage.  This is because we have no wish for the commission to get any bigger than it needs to be in order to be workable.  Certainly, we will consider that concession given our determination to ensure that the presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court are involved.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address amendment No. 30 as I have not yet done so.  The amendment removes the proposed Government provision to appoint a chairperson through the Public Appointments Service.  The Minister has addressed this already.  The Minister has expressed his dislike for our questioning of the position of the Public Appointments Service.  I do not believe any of us has undermined the service.  Having said that, the service is made up of political appointees.<\/p><p>If Napoli were playing Torino in a cup final next week, and Napoli were allowed to appoint a commission from which the referee would be picked, we would be a little bit concerned as to which side the referee might be on.  The proposed amendment to section 15 envisages that the commission shall elect its own chairperson from among its membership and that the chairperson may or may not be a lay person, depending on how the members vote.  I am not overly concerned about whether the chairperson is a legal or lay person.  The point is that I think it would increase the independence of the commission to allow its members to elect the chairperson.  If we did that, I would lay money on it that the members would pick a lay chairperson in the first instance.  It would give the members a greater sense of ownership and a greater role in the direction of the commission, encouraging a more independent and original statutory body rather than having the commission steered from the outset by a possible career civil servant, which would be the likely outcome of the Public Appointments Service, PAS, competition envisaged in the Government's proposals.  Given the membership of PAS, there is the potential of channelling political influence, directly or indirectly, through the selection of lay members by the Public Appointments Service.  Although a chairperson elected in this way may or may not have the same experience of effective board management and corporate governance as one selected by PAS in accordance with section 15, as drafted by Government, the elected chairperson would have the assistance of a full-time director and staff of the commission, if there were gaps in this regard.  We argued in the earlier days as to whether this was overkill, given the cost involved, but now that we are considering getting rid of the subcommittees, there will be more work for them.  That gives it more merit.<\/p><p> The inclusion of the President of the Circuit Court as a permanent member of the commission reflects the recommendations and concerns of both the Association of Judges of Ireland, the Law Society and the majority of the committee at this stage.  The Law Society submission in March 2017 on the proposed heads of the Bill emphasised that it is in the Circuit Court and District Court where most citizens meet the justice system, a point which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan raised at a previous meeting.  These courts are where most of the vacancies are and to which appointments will be made.  There must be range of judges with suitable skills and personalities to meet the needs of these courts and to deal with the volume of people competently and sensitively and that the input of the relevant presidents would thus be of major importance to the commission.<\/p><p> We will stick with our amendment at present but we will review it for Report Stage in order to accommodate the need to prevent the commission from getting too large.<\/p><p> Will I get a chance to speak on amendment No. 39?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#N00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":926,"content":"<p>Yes, it is in the next group.

As a result, I have a difficulty with the amendment.  The provision applies to lay members, including the non-legal chairperson selected by the Public Appointments Service and the nominees of the professional bodies, namely, the Law Society and the Bar Council.<\/p><p>Under section 14(4), the Minister would, in certain circumstances, be permitted to appoint such a member for a further term without a fresh PAS selection process.  The terms of subsection (4) are based for all intents and purposes on the corresponding provisions of Part IV of the Court and Court Officers Act 1995.  These are the prevailing procedures for the legal profession nominees and lay persons.  In these instances, their terms may be renewed for a further three years.  I acknowledge that we are changing the basis upon which, for example, lay persons are appointed, moving as we are to the PAS process.  Assuming that the relevant person is willing and able to continue serving, however, and it is considered appropriate to do so, it is nothing other than common sense to reappoint him or her.<\/p><p> I invite members to agree that this is a standard board membership provision.  It is not mandatory, merely permissive.  It also makes some administrative sense.  I ask that the section be retained.  Even in terms of the different lay member composition or different means by which members can be appointed that Deputies Wallace and Daly are seeking, having made the appointments, it makes sense to allow for a potential turnover from time to time and it may be deemed appropriate for persons to serve a second term.  In this regard, I am minded to draw on Deputy O'Callaghan's remarks about how it could become a challenge to interest people in the process in the first instance.  In any event, it is only for one further period, so there could be no suggestion that these positions are being territorialised or occupied for an unduly long period.  It will be based on the member's interests or otherwise in the work of the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#T01300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>The Minister pointed out that these people could be capable and worth their places on the commission.

The purpose of that section is to ensure that nominees of the Bar Council and of the Law Society should cease to be members of the commission if they cease to be a practising barrister or solicitor.<\/p> <p>  The amendment would seem to have the effect of requiring the Public Appointments Services to recruit a practising barrister and a practising solicitor to be members of the commission, rather than allowing their own professional bodies to nominate them.  The amendment changes the reference to the two members from the Law Society and Bar Council to the two practising lawyers to be selected by the Public Appointments Service.  It seems to me, therefore, that whether the two practising lawyers are nominated by their respective representative bodies or recruited by the Public Appointments Service, they will cease to hold office if they cease to practise.<\/p><p>I think the main point here is the approach to the appointment of the two legal professional members.<\/p><p> In line with sufficient precedent - I mentioned the Court and Court Officers Act, 1995 - and for other reasons we have adverted to in the course of this debate, I am not inclined to accept the amendment, nor am I minded to change the basis of the appointment of the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#W00600","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>It is important to recall that one can only become a judge in Ireland if one is a practising barrister or solicitor.  There is very good reason for that.  One has to have, I think, 12 years experience for the superior courts in order to be appointed as a judge.  It is a job of expertise that requires legal knowledge and experience of the courts.  Around the world now, there are jobs that everyone thinks they can do.  This is a job which requires an expert level of knowledge in law.  The purpose behind the section in respect of Deputy Daly's amendment is that one person on the commission is going to be nominated by the Law Society and one is going to be nominated by the Bar Council.<\/p> <p>  This provision exists in respect of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  In general, what happens is that the chairman of the Bar Council sits on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It is democratic because there are about 2,000 barristers in the country.  They all have a vote every year to elect a Bar Council of 20 people, which body then elects a chairperson.  It is democratic in terms of being representative of the barristers' profession.  It is similar in the Law Society.  I am not sure how they do it but I think it is the president of the Law Society who sits on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and he or she has to be elected as well.<\/p> <p>  There is one area in which there may be a bit of unfairness in terms of who can be appointed.  One can be a practising solicitor in-house and be appointed as a judge but, in order to be appointed as a practising barrister, one has to be a member of the Law Library.  Maybe that is something the Minister should look at in the future in order to equate those sides, so that there could be an in-house solicitor and an in-house barrister.<\/p> <p>  If we had a situation in which the Public Appointments Service put ads in the paper for a barrister to sit on the Judicial Appointments Commission, my view is that most of the people who would apply might not be, I will put it politely, the best candidates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018012300002#X00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1516714200,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>I have some sympathy for the intention behind the amendment although I do not support it.

From my own perspective there has been a very discernible change in the use of Irish, particularly in this D&aacute;il.  The establishment of this committee has given an impetus to that.  In fairness it has also pushed us as an institution because we have always struggled in terms of our Irish-speaking capacity.  Sometimes a little bit of a push is needed to get things going.  The change in this D&aacute;il has given us that push.  We obviously see more Irish spoken in the D&aacute;il by all of the party leaders and group leaders.  There is this committee and also the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which is chaired by Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  All of these things are giving Irish a greater prominence within the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> From my own point of view as the Secretary General of the organisation, my desire is to have an organisation that is very proactive about Irish.  We met an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga recently.  He spoke to us about the concept of the active offer.  The active offer is essentially where facilities and services in Irish are offered to people without them having to be sought out.  That is something we have to try to put in place for Irish speakers over the coming years.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir had an interesting anecdote when he came to us.  We have five or so ushers who speak Irish and who are capable of giving tours in Irish.  It just so happened, by pure fluke, that on the day an Coimisin&eacute;ir came to Leinster House one of these ushers was on the gate on Kildare Street.  He told us that it made all of the difference, because he could speak Irish to this usher and it added to the experience of coming to Leinster House.  I would certainly like to see a situation where people who come to Leinster House whose first language is Irish or who are Irish speakers would have the facility to use Irish during their time here, whether they are on tours or dealing with front-line staff.  That is something we will be working on over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2018012300002#C00400","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516726800,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>Molaim leis na ushers a bhfuil Gaolainn acu.

We have someone in our Parliamentary Budget Office and in the Library and Research Service.  We have some coverage in most of the organisation in respect of conducting business in Irish.  We feel that is important because it provides Members and other people with the opportunity to use Irish.  It may be on a limited basis, but they can still do so.<\/p><p> In terms of the translation system, the first thing to say is that we are in the process of upgrading it.  For a long time only committee room 4 was equipped for simultaneous translation.  That was obviously quite limiting.  With the growth in the use of the Irish language, we felt that we needed to upgrade our committee rooms.  Last summer we upgraded committee room 3.  We would have done all four but for the fact that we were moving the Seanad Chamber, which caused a capacity issue.  We are going to upgrade committee rooms 1 and 2 this coming summer.  That means that all four rooms will have the capacity to host meetings in Irish.<\/p><p> That brings us to the question on the other side of putting in place the resources to translate proceedings.  Obviously, if four meetings are going ahead and all are using Irish-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2018012300002#D01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516726800,"counter":1093,"content":"<p>C&eacute;n uair a bheidh na seomra uilig r&eacute;itithe le haghaidh aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2018012300002#E00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516726800,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>Next summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2018012300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1516726800,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>An samhradh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2018012300002#E00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516726800,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>Yes.

That group developed the strategy for Bliain na Gaeilge.  It is our first attempt at an Irish language strategy and it is something on which we would like to build.  The key thing for us now is that we have the strategy developed.  The Ceann Comhairle will launch it next month.  We now want to fully implement it over the course of the year.

As I said, approximately 10% of our staff can deliver services in Irish.  This year we recruited seven new staff members who are fluent in Irish and who have the ability to provide services bilingually.  Our strategy for the future revolves around ensuring that core services that use Irish, such as Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, the Debates Office and the Committees Secretariat, have sufficient staff to be able to conduct business.  After that, we are focusing on front-line services such as the ushers, the education services and things of that nature.  That is the focus of our efforts.<\/p> <p>  The biggest challenge we have is actually getting staff with language skills.  To illustrate the scale of this challenge I might explain the situation in respect of the recruitment of parliamentary reporters the last time around.  We advertised for parliamentary reporters in 2017.  We had 331 applications in total, of which 34 were applications for the bilingual option.  Of these 34 applicants, 27 sat a simulation test, five of whom passed and proceeded on to the interview stage.  At interview stage, four out of five passed and were placed on the panel.  When job offers were made to those people, two out of the four did not actually take up the posts.  Of the people who applied for the bilingual option, the pass rate was 12%.  If one looks at it as a percentage of the overall number of applicants, 1% passed the test and were put on the panel.  It is illustrative of the scale of the challenge that we face in recruiting staff.<\/p> <p>  In terms of some of the other issues, it could be the case that the booklet is just out of print.

I think it would be helpful to people if we had that type of system in place.  We will take the Senator's proposal away and examine it.<\/p> <p>  It is well known at this stage that there is a backlog in Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in for a number of reasons.  It dates back to 1992, when there were issues with resources.  The requirement in the Official Languages Act for the simultaneous production of legislation put further pressure on the rann&oacute;g.  It is something we have to get on top of as an organisation.  At the moment, we have a capacity review which is taking place.  We have commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to come in and look at Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.  The review has two parts: there is a cultural aspect to the operation of the rann&oacute;g and then there is a capacity aspect.  The capacity aspect deals with a number of separate issues.  Essentially, it involves looking at the capacity of the rann&oacute;g to perform its statutory functions and all of the other functions for which it is responsible within the Houses of the Oireachtas service.  That entails looking at the overall number of staff, the systems that are used to translate legislation and the use of technology.  We are currently introducing a new state-of-the-art translation system, Trados, which is used in the European Parliament.  That will help us considerably.  Other models are also being looked at to determine whether some non-core translation work should be outsourced.  For example, we had a positive experience when we outsourced the translation of the website.  A considerable amount of text - I think I said earlier that 250,000 words have been translated - has been translated using an outsourced model.  We are waiting on the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which is due to be delivered at the end of February.  At that stage, we will have to go through the recommendations and put the required resources in place.  I envisage that there will be fairly significant changes in how the organisation functions.  We have to get on top of the backlog.  It is not sustainable to continue as we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2018012300002#H01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1516726800,"counter":1180,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a fh&aacute;il maidir leis an backlog sin.

One of the reasons the problem arose was that in the 1990s the emphasis was very much on quality, which was absolutely right, but the resources were not there to keep up with the output.  As a result the section fell far behind in terms of its level of output.  In recent years we have increased the staffing of Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in from 17 to 23.

The issue with the simultaneous translation of Acts was resolved with the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 which allowed Acts to be published on the web.  The difficulty was that once we hit 2010 or so, we had a moratorium because of the economic situation.  It took until approximately 2014 before we could begin working our way out of that.  In 2015 we sanctioned an additional three editors ar gr&aacute;d II and they commenced their work.  It has been in the last year or so that we have been getting our heads around the exact extent of the problem and what we need to do about it.  We took the decision collectively as a management team that, rather than operating on a piecemeal basis and introducing more staff, we needed to have an overall review of the area, which was why a capacity review was commissioned.
