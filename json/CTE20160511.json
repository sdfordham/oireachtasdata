It is proposed that on the basis that there are no apparent subsidiarity concerns, these proposals do not warrant further scrutiny by this committee at this time.  However, it is the opinion of the committee that further scrutiny is warranted by the appropriate Oireachtas committee, when established.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  COM (2016) 159 - adjustment rate for direct payments in respect of the calendar year 2016.  It is proposed that on the basis that there are no subsidiarity concerns, this proposal does not warrant scrutiny by this committee at this time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Regarding COM (2016) 198, the proposal is that this committee will request further submissions from interested parties to be considered by this committee at its next meeting.
