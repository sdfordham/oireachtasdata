This will bring the session to an end at 12.50 p.m. and we will adjourn until 2.45 p.m.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  This is the fifth session in a series of hearings that the joint committee is conducting over three days to discuss the implementation of the Government decision following the recent publication of the expert group report into matters relating to A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland.  Yesterday we began our hearing primarily on medical issues and the concerns of medical practitioners.  Each of the four sessions was constructive and there was positive engagement between members and witnesses which yielded an interesting and significant debate.<\/p><p>  At the commencement of today's session I reiterate that the purpose of the meeting is to discuss the implementation of the Government decision following the recent publication of the expert group report into matters relating to A, B and C <i>v<\/i>.

The Government has stated that its aim is to ensure clarity and legal certainty in the process for determination of whether a termination of pregnancy is permissible in cases where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a woman as a result of a pregnancy.  In doing so we must ensure that we take full account of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.<\/p><p>  I welcome Ms Jennifer Schweppe from the University of Limerick, Ms Ciara Staunton from NUI Galway and Mr. Simon Mills from the Law Library.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900002#A00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1357723800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>With regard to the Bar Council-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900002#A00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1357723800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I am not going to have any debate on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900002#A00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1357723800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>It should be clarified from the point of view of the clerk.

There is a need for the principles and policies of the issues to be set out in the parent Act to ensure that the legislation is constitutionally robust.  I will make a brief comment on the issues which I have identified and then I would be happy to answer any questions or clarify those issues later.<\/p><p>  The first issue I raised in my written submission is key to the decision in A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, namely, how it is to be established if there exists a real and substantial risk to the life of the pregnant woman.  I argue that this decision should be left to medical practitioners.  Where a woman disagrees with the outcome or decision of medical practitioners, I argue that she should have an automatic right of referral to an independent practitioner.  This is part of best medical practice.  In the context of this risk, there is no requirement of certainty that there be a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman.  It only needs to be established as a matter of probability.  Doctors should be satisfied as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman.  Furthermore, termination is only permissible where it is the only way that her life can be vindicated.  The X case operates in a very limited way in this regard.<\/p><p>  The second main issue I raised relates to matters of conscience and where a doctor conscientiously objects to treating a woman.  This position should be respected as it is respected in line with the Medical Council guidelines.  Further, I argue for the right of a woman to refuse life-saving termination.  This decision should also be respected in the context of her capacity.<\/p><p>  The third issue which I raised in my submission relates to foetal viability.  I argue that where medical professionals agree that as a matter of probability there is no prospect of life outside the womb, termination of pregnancies should be permissible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900002#A02500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer Schweppe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357723800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank you, Chairman, and Deputies and Senators for this invitation to present to the committee.  Like Ms Schweppe, I work on the assumption that we are discussing legislation and, perhaps, some regulation.  Guidelines are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the case of A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland.  This has been echoed by the High Court, Supreme Court and various Government reports.  The X case ruling states that if there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother she is entitled to a lawful abortion.  That is the law.  Therefore, we have a degree of lawful abortion within Ireland.<\/p><p>  For the rest of my presentation I will discuss the need to repeal sections 58 and 59 of the 1861 Act, the real and substantial risk test and the risk of suicide.  I will also make some general comments on the procedures for determining when there is a lawful abortion.  <\/p><p>  First, we need to repeal sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1961.  Nowhere in those sections are the rights of the unborn or the mother discussed, unlike Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  We need to amend legislation to complement Article 40.3.3&deg; and the decision of the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>  Second, the real and substantial risk test should be put on a statutory footing.  This is the only current exception to Article 40.3.3&deg;.  As Ms Schweppe said, it is likely, if facts come before the Supreme Court in the future, that we may find another exception to the general prohibition on abortion.  The committee should take consideration of these future issues which may arise.  The real and substantial risk to the life of the mother is a constitutional exemption and legislation must give effect to the test.<\/p><p>  What does the test mean?  A real and substantial risk does not mean an immediate and inevitable risk.  Mr. Justice McCarthy addressed this in the Supreme Court decision in the X case.  We can define the test in another way and say that where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman at some point during the pregnancy, an abortion is lawful in Ireland.  It does not have to be proved that death is inevitable and will be immediate, but simply that, as a matter of probability, a death is likely to arise at some point.  <\/p><p>  The committee must, therefore, consider the issue of time limits.  The introduction of time limits is standard practice in many jurisdictions.  For this very narrow exception, however, I recommend that we do not include a time limit.  We must, rather, trust the medical opinion of our doctors. <\/p><p>  Dr. Simon Mills may correct me on some of the following points.  Let us consider the example of a woman who is 30 weeks pregnant and whose doctors believe there is a real and substantial risk to her life at some point.  She is entitled to a termination of the pregnancy because that is what is putting her life at risk.  Her doctors must, therefore, terminate her pregnancy and save her life.  The doctors must then make every effort to save the life of the unborn.  In that way, both the right to life of the pregnant woman and the unborn are vindicated.  This does not mean death to the foetus but simply that we must first look at the right to life of the mother and then vindicate the right to life of the unborn.  I recommend that rather than inserting a cut-off point in legislation, the regulations should detail that doctors should save the life of the mother and then make every effort to save the life of the unborn.  These difficult cases will come before doctors and we must trust the clinical judgment of our doctors.<\/p><p>  The third issue is the narrow suicide test.  This has received much attention in the media and in other writings.  The real and substantial risk includes the risk of suicide, but only if the risk of suicide arises from the pregnancy and can only be averted by the termination of the pregnancy.  If a woman is pregnant due to rape or incest and is suicidal due to the rape of incest she is not entitled to an abortion.  That has nothing to do with the pregnancy.  However, if her doctors believe the risk of her suicide arises from the pregnancy which has arisen from the rape or incest and that risk of suicide can only be averted by a termination of pregnancy it is then, and only then, that she is entitled to an abortion.  Risk of suicide cannot be excluded from the medical issues.  Medical issues and suicide are to be treated as one and the same and be subject to the exact same test. <\/p><p>  Finally, I will consider the procedures for determining a lawful abortion.  First, legislation must take account of the real and substantial risk test.  I also echo comments that this is best left to our medical doctors.  By putting this statutory defence into legislation we are telling our doctors we will not criminalise them if they perform an abortion when they believe there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  This takes away the chilling effect which the European Court of Human Rights discussed in A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Staunton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357724400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Simon Mills from the Law Library.

I have a slightly unusual background.  For the purposes of a legal session, I wish to set out briefly my professional background and also the background on which my submissions are grounded.  My submissions are somewhat different from those of Ms Schweppe and Ms Staunton, although I agree with almost everything both of them said.  In fact, with regard to one of my views, I have been persuaded to change my mind on something, on which I suspect we may touch later.  The step I have taken is somewhat unusual in that my written submissions include a proposed draft Bill for the termination of pregnancy in accordance with Article 40.3.30 and existing Supreme Court jurisprudence, including but crucially not limited to the X case.<\/p><p>  I have been a practising barrister since 2002 and specialise in all areas of health care law.  From 1997 to 2011, I was a practising doctor and for most of that time a part-time general practitioner in an urban setting.  It may be helpful to the committee and the other Members present that during that time I dealt with a small but significant number of women who were seeking termination of pregnancy.  I retired as a medical practitioner in 2011 and no longer practise medicine.  As well as being a barrister and a doctor, I also completed an MSc in philosophical medical ethics.  Presciently, my thesis was on the topic of legislating for abortion in a pluralist society.<\/p><p>  I wish to comment briefly on the debate which has brought us here.  For the purposes of the discussion which I hope is a dispassionate analysis of the law relating to the termination of pregnancy, I adopt no position, one way or another, on the question of abortion.  However, I observe that, in general, public discourse on the question of termination of pregnancy - these hearings being a notable exception, judging from what I heard yesterday - very often frames the political and social debate as if it were a two-sided issue.  In public discourse there is an apparent assumption that the only conversation to be had - one would always prefer to avoid the divisive terminology - is between the pro-abortion-pro-choice side and the anti-abortion-pro-life side.  On this account of matters, it is assumed that \"pro-life\" means no more and no less than being opposed to abortion in all circumstances and that \"pro-choice\" means no more and no less than ultimately being in favour of abortion on demand.  <\/p><p>  I have always believed this is an inaccurate model and that views on abortion are far more complex than this type of simplistic analysis tends to suggest.  The constant reinvigoration of this account of abortion, debates characterised by pro-life versus pro-choice arguments, has continually frustrated the attempts to move from rhetoric to resolution on the topic.  A far more realistic account is that the debate is a three-sided discussion consisting of the strong pro-life position, the strong pro-choice view and the moderate position which attracts adherents from both the pro-life and pro-choice sides.  If there is a majority view on abortion in this jurisdiction - I believe there is - I suspect it is that which frames the majority view on abortion in this jurisdiction that there is a substantial overlap between moderate pro-life and moderate pro-choice views.<\/p><p>  I hope what I have done will assist the committee.  I have drafted a termination Bill which I hope steers a middle course between constitutional proprieties and the needs of women in this jurisdiction.  The draft termination Bill which I have prepared arose, first, from a need to clarify in my own mind what sort of legal regime would be permissible in Ireland, having regard to the Constitution; and, second, to establish whether such a regime was amenable to being drafted in compact and comprehensible legislation.  There would be some irony in a situation where we came before the committee as lawyers to say politicians had to legislate without at least having given some thought to how such legislation might work.  It can be guaranteed that, were politicians to draft unworkable legislation, we lawyers would be the first to pull it apart.<\/p><p>  I hope my draft legislation will at least provide a template for discussion.  I do not presume it amounts to any more than that, save for a number of points.  First, I believe it accurately reflects the state of law in this jurisdiction, with one qualification relating to viability, about which the Bill, as drafted, may need some thought.  I bear in mind in that respect the comments made by Ms Schweppe and Ms Staunton, with which, ultimately, I agree and think are not accurately reflected in the way the relevant section is drafted.  Second, I believe the Bill provides the clarity that the medical profession has stated it requires. Third, I believe it provides many of the safeguards required by those who are sceptical of the need for any codification of law allowing for termination of pregnancy.  In particular, in my reading of it and the opinion of those to whom I have showed it, there is no scope in the Bill for any scheme of abortion on demand.  Fourth, I believe it meets the recommendations of the expert group in so far as it provides for the combination of legislation and regulations.  Fifth, I believe it is a Bill to which all political parties which have called for the codification of law on termination can subscribe on the basis of their public pronouncements. Sixth, I believe it provides a clear basis for legal terminations within the scope of Article 40.3.30.<\/p><p>  The draft Bill does not include anything to do with rape or incest, that is, pregnancy occasioned by illegal circumstances, because in my view Article 40.3.30 precludes this, save in the circumstances identified by Ms Staunton where, by reason of the pregnancy occasioned by legal circumstances, there is a threat of suicide.  I adopt and agree with the remarks made by both Ms Schweppe and Ms Staunton on the question of legislation for suicide.<\/p><p>  I will set out briefly the contents of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 deal with a number of limited preliminary matters, including certain definitions.  In section 3 the legal position relating to the 1861 Act is restated in modern language, with alterations to the length of custodial sentences, in line with the last referendum on the question of abortion and the draft Bill contained therein.  However, having restated the legal ban on abortion, the Bill sets out a number of clear exceptions under which a termination will not be unlawful under the restatement of the 1861 Act.  <\/p><p>  In section 4 the first exception is the scenario where termination arises as a consequence of other medical treatment.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 deal with the question of the real and substantial risk to life, including the threat of suicide.  Section 7 specifically deals with the threat of suicide.  It applies the same test Ms Staunton called for, albeit a test executed through a slightly different two-step process, in order to give assurance to those who have certain concerns about the threat of suicide.  <\/p><p>  Section 8 deals with termination of pregnancy in cases of inevitable miscarriage of a non-viable pregnancy.  This was touched on by Ms Schweppe.  Again, I agree with her view that the non-viable pregnancy comes within the remit of a permissible abortion within Article 40.3.30.  <\/p><p>  Section 9 deals with termination of pregnancy in cases of lethal foetal abnormality.  I adopt and agree with the remarks of Ms Schweppe on that front.  <\/p><p>  Section 10 deals with the power of the Minister to make regulations as to the certification of medical opinions.  All of the grounds I have set out would be certified on the basis of no fewer than two medical opinions, at least one of which must come from an appropriately qualified medical specialist.  <\/p><p>  Section 11 affords certain immunities to doctors acting in good faith under the Bill, consistent with the wish expressed yesterday by, among others, Dr. Mahony of Holles Street Hospital.  It also imposes certain obligations on doctors to act in good faith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Simon Mills","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357725000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Mills.

Will Ms Schweppe clarify that it is her view that it is not necessary to have a constitutional change in order to address this particular issue, if it were deemed suitable and appropriate to do so through legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900005#D00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1357725000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their considerable contributions.  On page 16 of the document that she submitted to the committee in advance of today's meeting, Ms Schweppe talks about adults of sound mind refusing treatment, including a reference to the exception that arose where Ms Justice Laffoy sought a capacity test.  Our objective arising out of these deliberations is to assist in the drafting of legislation on a very complex issue.  Yesterday I tried to tease out the challenges of having precision in legislation, and my question to Ms Schweppe today relates to the scope of legislation.  We will never be able to second guess or anticipate all of the situations that can and, over time, undoubtedly will present.  Is Ms Schweppe of the view that the legislation to be drafted should anticipate and provide clarity for medical practitioners where there is agreed professional opinion that a woman does not have the ability or is not of sound mind and thus incapable of making a decision to refuse medical intervention?  I am interested in having her elaborate on that particular point in order to inform our understanding of the extent of what she might wish the legislation to address.<\/p><p>  Will Ms Staunton clarify her point regarding the narrow suicide test?  Is she referring to the current legal position when she states that a pregnant woman who is suicidal for reasons not directly linked to the pregnancy is not entitled to an abortion but a woman whose suicidal tendencies are due to her pregnancy is so entitled?  As I pointed out yesterday to the representatives of the Irish Medical Council, that seems to be what is outlined in its guidelines.  However, it seems clear that not everybody is aware of that being the case, including some of the expert opinion that presented here yesterday and may yet present before these hearings later today or tomorrow.  Certainly, not all legislators are aware of the fact.  Will Ms Staunton clarify that issue for us?<\/p><p>  I commend Dr. Mills on his drafting skills.  I have gone through the legislation he has offered us and thank him for the effort employed.  Going back to the point Deputy Kelleher raised, the Bill presented by Dr. Mills includes provision for the termination of pregnancy in the case of lethal foetal abnormality.  There is an assumption, which was in evidence in the discourse last night on the Vincent Browne show on TV3, that this is something which cannot be addressed in the context of the legislation the Government intends to present.  I am not convinced that is the case.  This committee has made a decision not to accommodate those who wished to articulate their very disturbing experiences in this regard.  However, nobody could fail to be moved by the account of the young woman who spoke on the TV3 programme last night or the accounts of what many other families have been through.  Unfortunately, the Chairman has indicated that my time is up.  Will Dr. Mills indicate, with the benefit of his undoubted skills, whether it is within our compass to include provision for this particular matter in the legislation shortly to be presented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900005#D00400","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1357725000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their submissions and presentations.  I look forward to hearing their feedback on the questions posed by my colleagues on the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities and how it might be addressed.  Ms Schweppe made several very valid points in regard to the capacity of young people.  We should not forget that the X case was about a 14 year old child and her wish for a termination of an unlawful pregnancy.  Will she comment further in this regard?  I am not sure whether the public is aware of the quandary in which children in care may find themselves in terms of the status of their care order and how that might prevent them from obtaining the timely treatment they may require.  Some children are moving from a chaotic family life to a chaotic environment within the care system itself.  We are talking about a very vulnerable group of young people whose members may be more likely than children in other situations to face a crisis pregnancy.  Ms Schweppe has made a very welcome interjection in this regard and one we have not yet heard.  Of all the tests that may present under the proposed legislation, this is one of the most likely because it relates to a very high-risk group.  I look forward to further clarification in this regard.<\/p><p>  There has been some debate among the public and by commentators on the potential repeal of sections 58 and 59 of the 1861 Act, an issue to which Ms Staunton referred in her presentation.  In particular, a view is beginning to emerge that it is not as simple as repealing the old law but that something must replace it.

Do they support the legislation and regulation option?  Have they a position in regard to medical, nursing and other personnel who have a conscientious objection to abortion?  Yesterday afternoon I raised with the representatives of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists the question of fatal foetal abnormality and whether that can be seen as part of the legislation.

On the question of fatal foetal abnormalities, which was raised by Deputy Kelleher, my position on this, and I think I am correct in stating that in law, where the foetus has no capacity to survive outside the womb, that is not life for the purposes of Article 40.3.3&deg;.  When we refer to unborn life in the Constitution, what we are talking about, as the then Mrs. Justice Denham, now the Chief Justice, stated in the Roche <i>v.<\/i> Roche case, we are referring to a life which has the capacity to be born.  In that case it related to embryos that were implanted in the womb.  I think the logic of her reasoning on what the Constitution protects and does not protect applies to foetuses which have no capacity to be brought to term and produce a living baby.  I do not think that Article 40.3.3&deg; applies in that case.  Perhaps as a matter of clarity the legislation should in a declaratory manner state that.  I do not think we need a constitutional amendment where as a matter of probability doctors are of the opinion that the foetus has no capacity to be born.<\/p><p>  I think that is the legal situation in that case, but the problem arises where doctors are of the opinion the foetus has the capacity to be born but will survive only for a short period, be it a matter of days or weeks.  Tragically, in circumstances such as the that, the Constitution does not permit termination of pregnancy and, unfortunately, women in that position do currently need to travel to terminate those pregnancies.  I do not agree with this position.  I did not see the programme &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; last night but I think a constitutional amendment would be required in those cases, where there is a prospect of life outside the womb and the pregnancy is viable.  In cases of inevitable miscarriage, as Dr. Mills talked about, or where the foetus has no capacity to be born alive, I do not think a constitutional amendment is needed.  I think the legislation should include a declaratory statement to that effect and permit medical practitioners to terminate pregnancies in those circumstances.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's first question related to refusal of treatment.  As an academic, I like to think of all eventualities.  That is something I include because the debate assumes that where there is a risk to the life of a woman, she will want to terminate her pregnancy.  That is not necessarily always the case.  I wanted to highlight the fact that some women will acknowledge that their life is at risk but will want to continue with the pregnancy and would like the medical practitioners involved in their case to try to see the pregnancy through to term.  The only exception, as I see it, to the general position, which is a general position in law and does not just apply in the context of termination of pregnancy but arises in other cases, is in cases in which the woman does not have the capacity to refuse the treatment.  The Fitzpatrick case would be a narrow exception to that.  Again I suggest the Law Reform Commission's recommendations in relation to capacity for vulnerable people generally and for people altogether should be adopted in that context.  That is my position and reflects common medical practice.  I do not think we need to do anything new there.<\/p><p>  On the issue of the link between suicide and pregnancy, I wholeheartedly agree with Ms Staunton's position.  Just because one is suicidal in pregnancy does not justify a termination.  The threat of suicide must be linked to the pregnancy and I fully adopt her position on that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Conway raised the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities.  In relation to consent of young people generally, the Law Reform Commission has published a report and I commend it to the committee.  It is very detailed and sets out the legal issues exactly and recommends very robust legislation for dealing with them.  Quite simply, in relation to 16 and 17 year olds, there seems to be a presumption currently in section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 that a 16 or 17 year old can consent to medical treatment in the absence of parental consent but it would appear that section 23 provides a defence to a doctor only in the case of criminal sanctions as opposed to civil sanctions.  For those under the 16 years, there is a presumption against treatment in the absence of parental consent.  I think this is an issue which needs to be addressed.  I refer to a paper by McMahon et al where they talk about the utter confusion of GPs as to whether they can treat somebody under the age of 16 years for anything.  Again this does not necessarily relate to this issue.  For example, it could apply to whether a doctor can treat a 15 year old for a broken leg in the absence of parental consent.  The Law Reform Commission's proposals are very clear on this issue.<\/p><p>  When it comes to children in care, the Deputy is correct that this issue deserves more attention.  These young people are, by definition, vulnerable and are treated in law very differently from children who are in the care of their parents.  A child in the care of her parents can be brought to another jurisdiction to terminate an unconstitutional pregnancy.  Children in the care of the HSE cannot, according to the decision of Mr. Justice Geoghegan in the C case, although the decision of Mr. Justice McKechnie in the D case does seem to throw a little bit of confusion into that entire issue.  I think that needs to be teased out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer Schweppe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357726200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>It was Deputy McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900007#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357726200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer Schweppe"},{"type":"speech","time":1357726200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I beg your pardon.

When we are drafting the Bill, we will have to give consideration to cases which have not yet been litigated.  The X case is the only exception we have at the moment.  It is the only case that has actually been litigated.  When this committee is drafting legislation, it has to be careful to take account of the cases we have discussed.  We do not want to have to come back here again if another case reaches the Supreme Court.  We do not want to have to wait for another 20 years for the introduction of legislation.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the narrow suicide test.  The test considers whether there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman.  I mentioned suicide on its own simply because there is a fear that the floodgates will open.  That fear is completely unfounded.  It suggests that there will be some sort of collusion between the pregnant woman and the doctor.  That is not the case.  We trust our doctors in every other clinical judgment they make.  We must continue to trust our doctors when it comes to the issue of abortion.  It is very clear that a lawful abortion can take place only if the risk of suicide is linked to the pregnancy.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Conway, I would like to say I believe we should repeal sections 58 and 59 of the 1861 Act because they are outdated.  They do not take account of Article 40.3.3&deg; or of the subsequent High Court and Supreme Court decisions.  Furthermore, they do not make any reference to the right of the mother and the right of the unborn.  The Act focuses on abortion.  I say we should repeal it and replace it with something else.  If the House wants to provide for criminal prosecution in the case of an unlawful abortion, that is fine and such a provision should be introduced.  Any comprehensive legislation dealing with lawful and unlawful abortion should reflect Article 40.3.3&deg;, the X case and any other issues the House might wish to discuss.<\/p><p>  Deputy Healy asked about the current legal position.  If there is a real and substantial risk to the life of a woman, she is entitled to a lawful abortion.  It is irrelevant whether it is a medical risk or a suicidal risk.  If the risk is directly related to the pregnancy, abortion is lawful in Ireland.<\/p><p>  I wish to echo what Ms Schweppe said about the views set out in the expert report.  Legislation, accompanied by regulations, should be introduced to give effect to those views.  Guidelines simply do not work.  They do not have the force of law.  Doctors are under no obligation to follow them.  Based on the Medical Council guidelines, there is no right to a lawful abortion if a woman needs it.  The Medical Council guidelines currently state that doctors can perform abortions, but there is no right for a woman to have an abortion at the moment.  Legislation will ensure that gap is overlooked.<\/p><p>  I wholeheartedly echo what Ms Schweppe said about fatal foetal abnormalities.  I will not comment further on that other than to say there is no right to life to vindicate if there is no possibility of the unborn producing a live birth.  I believe abortion is lawful in such circumstances.  However, if that child has the possibility of being alive even for a second, unfortunately a pregnant woman cannot have an abortion in that case.  It is not about time, quantity or quality - it is about whether it is capable of being born.  That is where the test should lie.<\/p><p>  The Law Reform Commission recently published a report on the issue of children and consent.  Its particular focus on people aged 15, 16 and 17 is very important when dealing with this matter.  I recommend that the House should read and consider the report and proceed on the basis of the recommendations in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900007#F00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Staunton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357726200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Perhaps Deputy Healy's final questions offer me a useful point from which to begin to reply to the totality of the questions.  He asked what the current legal position is.  Two aspects need to be considered when answering that question.  The first aspect, which has already been addressed by Ms Schweppe and Ms Staunton, relates to what we know from the X case.  That has already been set out.  There is slightly more to be said about what we can reasonably infer from the text of Article 40.3.3&deg;; from other Supreme Court decisions, particularly the Roche decision to which Ms Schweppe has already adverted; and from decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.  The decision that was handed down in the case of D <i>v<\/i>. Ireland is one such relevant decision.  In that case, the European Court of Human Rights found that the complaint was not admissible but made certain pertinent observations in relation to cases of lethal foetal abnormality.<\/p><p>  There are things we can infer from the state of law in general.  For two reasons, it is a mistake to confine our consideration of this matter to the X case, notwithstanding the terms of reference of this group.  The first reason, which has already been identified by Ms Staunton, is that the X case was about X.  That is all it was about.  That is all the court was asked to decide.  One might wonder what the courts would have decided if some recent cases in this jurisdiction had come before them.  If they had, we would be talking not only about X but also about E, F and G.  It is simply a fact of our proximity to the United Kingdom that more cases have not come before the courts.  In my view, such cases would amply identify the number of circumstances in which terminations are permissible within the meaning of Article 40.3.3&deg; and in a manner that is consistent with existing Supreme Court and High Court jurisprudence.  That is the second limb.  The first limb relates to what we know from Article 40.3.3&deg; and from the X case.  The second limb relates to what we can infer.<\/p><p>  Among other things, we can infer from the Roche decision and, in particular, from the judgment of the current Chief Justice, Ms Justice Denham, that the meaning of life in a constitutional sense - I am sure the committee will hear more about the meaning of life from the church leaders tomorrow - relates to the capacity to be born alive.  That is the basis for my decision to include two specific provisions in the draft Bill I have prepared.  The first provision would apply in the case of the inevitable miscarriage of a non-viable foetus.  When I say &quot;non-viable&quot;, I mean incapable of surviving by reason of its prematurity.  The second provision would apply in the case of a lethal foetal abnormality.  In this case, I refer to a foetus or embryo that is incapable of surviving outside the womb.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with Ms Staunton and Ms Schweppe about the foetus - or baby, once born - that will survive for a few moments outside the womb.  I have to say I think there is something disturbingly utilitarian about Article 40.3.3&deg; in that it comports an obligation to be born, only to suffer and die where the wish of a caring, prudent and loving parent might be for a different outcome.  However, I do not think that is a matter for this committee to consider.<\/p><p>  Like Ms Schweppe and Ms Staunton, I think the best of the options outlined in the expert group report is the last of the four that were proposed and recommended; namely, a combination of legislation and regulation.  That is why the draft Bill I have prepared for the assistance of the committee provides for legislation setting out a broad framework and providing for the Minister to be entitled to make certain regulations in relation to certain aspects of the operation of the Act for its smoother and better operation and to respond to any exigencies that may arise.<\/p><p>  The question of conscientious objection is clearly set out in the Medical Council guidelines.  However, I think it requires express statutory provision.  This is specifically provided for in the draft Bill that I have furnished to the committee.  I deal with conscientious objection in that Bill in two ways.  The termination of a pregnancy under that Bill or any Bill will be a two-step process, firstly involving the provisions of opinions that are sufficient to ground a lawful termination and secondly the performance of the termination itself.  With regard to the first element of that process, my Bill requires that opinions must be provided by a registered medical practitioner, who has a right of conscientious objection subject only to an obligation to refer the person in question to another registered medical practitioner who is prepared to provide an opinion.  Of course the Bill does not set out an obligation with regard to what that opinion must or should contain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900007#F01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Simon Mills","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357726800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank the panel for giving a comprehensive overview.  I refer to one or two points raised yesterday from representatives of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  The expert group report provided several choices for who should make the decision in the area of suicide.  It provided the option of two specialists and for the case to be referred on to a specialist obstetrician, and the option of an obstetrician or two specialist psychiatrists plus an obstetrician.  The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggested that the decision should be made by two obstetricians.  In deciding on the issue of suicide does the panel believe that two obstetricians can make a decision on the issue of suicide given that their expertise is in the area of obstetrics and gynaecology and not psychiatry?  The delegation referred to a psychiatrist being involved as well but they were referring to a panel of three and I wonder about the legal aspects of that.<\/p><p>  The second issue relates to section 8 of the draft Bill presented this morning.  It refers to two medical practitioners having to sign off on a miscarriage.  The evidence given yesterday included reference to smaller units where there is only one consultant on duty from 5 p.m. on Friday evening to 9 a.m. on Monday morning.  I do not believe section 8 could be operational in that situation.  Perhaps the panel will come back to me on this point because I have a concern in this regard.<\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of foetal abnormality, there is a fine line with regard to deciding whether a foetus or baby will survive for one second or ten seconds after being born, and deciding on the issue after five months of pregnancy.

Having listened yesterday and considered the matter overnight and having re-examined the Supreme Court judgment I do not see a necessity for a different procedure to determine whether a woman has a right to access an abortion where the risk to her life arises from the matter of mental rather than physical health.

Irrespective of whether the issue is one of mental or physical health she is entitled to a termination of her pregnancy.  If there is a viable child, because the pregnancy is at an advanced stage, the doctor must first save the life of the woman by terminating the pregnancy and then do everything he or she can to save the child.  The issue of guardianship has nothing to do with what we are talking about.  There are structures in place to deal with a child whose mother wishes to give him or her for adoption, but they have nothing to do with what we are dealing with here.<\/p><p>  In reply to Senator van Turnhout, I propose the repeal of sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 but also to replace them.  One cannot simply repeal legislation.  It must be replaced.  With regard to suicidal intent, my only reason to separate it from other threats to life is that there has been much discussion about it and about the danger that it will open the floodgates to abortion on demand.

It is important that the legislation acknowledge the importance of clinical judgment.  If a doctor believes a woman's life is at risk, even when eight or nine months pregnant, she is entitled to a lawful abortion.  At present, doctors are not sure whether the standard of proof is on the balance of probability or beyond a reasonable doubt.  There is much uncertainty.

I can also see that in drafting legislation that would attract general support and still not be unconstitutional there might be certain types of termination not expressly covered by the X case judgment for which time limits might be appropriate.  I do not want to put it any further than that.  It is something that is almost germinating in my head as I have been sitting here having this very helpful discussion, bearing in mind the submissions of Ms Schweppe and Ms Staunton.  It is something I would be happy to return to in future discussions of the draft Bill.<\/p><p>  Senator Van Turnhout also mentioned the question of treating suicide differently.  I largely agree with Ms Staunton that as a matter of broad principle there is no distinction to be drawn between a threat to the woman's life by reason of the continuation of her pregnancy as a medical or as a psychiatric matter.  Two distinctions, however, need to be drawn.  This is one of the reasons I treated suicide separately in the draft Bill.<\/p><p>  First, the required specialisation of the doctors making the assessment must necessarily be different.  Someone touched on this earlier.  Do we want obstetricians deciding on the psychiatric well-being of women?  No, we do not, any more than we want neurosurgeons deciding on the viability of pregnancy.  That is how one would deal with that.  One has different and appropriate experts.<\/p><p>  The second way in which one might treat it differently, and which I offer tentatively in the draft Bill, goes to the difficulties in suicidality which have been identified across witnesses, which is that its presence or absence my be fluctuant.  It may be there one day and not be there another.  I tentatively suggest in the draft Bill that, as distinct from scenarios of medical emergency or crisis, it may be appropriate that assessments for suicidality be carried out on two separate dates.<\/p><p>  Flowing from that and in reply to the question about rural hospitals where there may only be one doctor, I am reminded of what Senator Crown was saying earlier.  If we assume that the opinion of two doctors is generally preferable to the opinion of one, should we put women who are in rural locations or in poorly resourced hospitals at an effective disadvantage?  In drafting the issue of a serious and immediate threat to life, one may have to reflect on the question of the number of experts who would give an opinion where, for example, only one expert is available and in the view of that expert a termination, within the meaning of any available legislation, is necessary.  Provision could be made, by way of regulation of the reporting or certification of any termination, for an expert to explain why a second opinion could not be obtained although it would normally be required under the Act.  That is one possibility.<\/p><p>  There was a more general question about the need for clarity and whether legislation would provide the kind of clarity doctors require for their work.  I suggest that the Deputy read my draft Bill which I have provided to the committee.  I hope it shows that clear, workable, sane and sensible legislation that will guide doctors in a way they can live with is not an unachievable norm.  Doctors make life and death decisions every day.<\/p><p>  The last question I was asked was an important one.  Deputy Naughten asked if there was a difference between a foetus with a lethal abnormality who will suffer by reason of being born and a foetus who is delivered prematurely and must suffer as part of being delivered prematurely.  There is an obvious moral and legal difference.  The foetus born with a lethal foetal abnormality is being born solely to die.  The foetus who is delivered prematurely with a view to effecting its survival is being born to a wholly different purpose.  This seems to me to be a logical moral distinction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900009#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Simon Mills","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357728000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I wish to comment on a few issues.  I agree completely with Dr. Mills regarding the link between suicide and termination in that the decisions should be made by individuals - psychiatrists - who are qualified to make these decisions.  It is important to note with regard to any termination of pregnancy which is permissible under the Constitution that according to the X case, we are discussing a matter of probability.<\/p><p>  In reply to Deputy Dowds, there does not need to be any certainty as to the risk of a medical risk, be it a psychiatric or physical risk, or on the issue of fatal foetal abnormality.  I think the matter of probability test is one which should determine this.  I agree with Ms Staunton on that point.  I do not think there should be any different procedures aside from who determines the risk with regard to suicide.  I think to do so would be to bring us back to a situation where mental health is stigmatised.  I thought we had moved on from that.  To treat them completely separately would bring us as a country back a step.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout asked about consent.  I think the parallel legislation would probably be suitable, not just to deal with young people but also to deal with anyone for whom a proxy consent is required, such as wards of court, vulnerable persons, for example.  In reply to Senator Crown, I agree with Dr. Mills's assessment of our collective opinion on the definition of life.  We are just articulating the law on this issue, as opposed to a philosophical or moral position.  The reason we are here is because there is no definite agreement on what the law is.  Lawyers would be very poor if we all collectively and generally agreed on the law.  We are articulating what Mrs Justice Susan Denham said in the Roche case.

To some extent, it is an intellectual cul-de-sac which tells us nothing about whether we can formulate workable legislation.  Of course it is workable; it is more workable in large teaching hospitals where there is a plethora of specialists, sub-specialists and super-specialists than it may be in rural hospitals.

The contentious issue is that of suicide.  Despite what the delegates opposite are saying, the clear evidence yesterday from the professionals in the field was that it was very difficult to predict the outcome for a patient who presented with suicidal ideation.  On this matter we have had the views of a psychiatrist on both the pro-life and pro-choice advocacy sides during the period of all of the debates.  One of the psychiatrist witnesses said in evidence yesterday that if a woman presented claiming to be suicidal, she would believe her.  We also heard evidence that a survey carried out in Britain showed that 97% of suicide predictions were false positives.  The architect of abortion in Britain, Lord David Steel, recently said:<blockquote><br \/>It would seem the mistake being made in Ireland is to try to define the circumstances in which each abortion may be carried out and that is a hopeless road to travel down.  I never envisaged there would be so many abortions [in Britain].<\/blockquote>In fact, there were 6.4 million abortions in Britain between 1986 and 2011, only 150 of which took place to save the life of the mother.

If it could be achieved in this and other matters, we would be able to resolve contentious issues much more quickly.<\/p><p>  Section 9 of the draft Bill deals with the issue of foetal abnormality, a very clearly and scientifically defined issue.  However, the issue of contention for most people in regard to this matter is that of suicide, a matter dealt with in section 7.  In fact, whether one agrees or disagrees that the threat of suicide should be a ground for termination, the difficulty arises in the context of the evidence we heard yesterday, namely, that one psychiatrist will say a threat of suicide is not and never will be a ground for termination, while another will disagree.  In that context, how does Dr. Mills see the provisions in this section working in practice?

However, the argument has been and will be made again in the course of these discussions that the results of these referenda cannot be seen strictly as a decision on whether suicide should be removed as a ground for an abortion, in so far as some of those who voted &quot;No&quot; on those occasions were, in fact, opposed to the provision of abortion on that ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900011#K01000","speaker":"1104"},{"type":"speech","time":1357728600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The Supreme Court has stated there must be a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother.

Senator Bacik inquired as to whether we should have different legislation for emergency and non-emergency situations.  Her argument in this regard is quite compelling.  When we look to introduce legislative change, we often look not to our nearest neighbours but to our next nearest neighbours in England and Wales.  That is the sort of framework I had in mind in the context of legislating for this issue.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Terence Flanagan's point, in the same way that some doctors did not feel restricted by the current legislation, other doctors did.  The fact that there is a difference needs to be addressed.  Do I believe the unborn child is entitled to any rights?  I respect the constitutional position that the unborn has a right to life.<\/p><p>  Senator Walsh referred to the issue of language.  I am of the view that we should use constitutional language, certainly in respect of foetal life, that is, to use the term \"unborn\".  The term \"pregnant woman\" does not have any emotive, moral or ethical undertones.  In the context of viability in the period between 20 and 24 weeks, foetal abnormalities are generally picked up at an early stage of the pregnancy.  Foetal abnormality scans generally take place at approximately 18 weeks.  I am of the opinion that any issue would be raised before that stage.<\/p><p>  In reply to Deputy Timmins's point, I hope I state in my submission that the issue of when life begins has been addressed.  The issue of when unborn life ends has not.  I just wanted to clarify that.<\/p><p>  In the context of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's point, doctors make assessments in respect of the risks and benefits of medical treatment every day.  It is what they do for a living and we trust them to make those assessments as to what risks and benefits are associated with treatment.  We need to simply apply what they do every day in this very narrow context of medical treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900012#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer Schweppe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357729200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I will begin with the final point.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n inquired as to what constitutes a real and substantial risk.  We have addressed this on numerous occasions.  We must trust their opinions.  On the matter of probability, there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman at some point during the pregnancy.  That is what is a real and substantial risk.  As Ms Schweppe stated, doctors make these decisions all the time.  They do not really deal in percentages and they base their decisions on their clinical judgment and experience.  We must trust and respect their decisions.<\/p><p>  Deputy Timmins referred to suicide and whether it should be included.  The discussion in this regard is actually relevant because that is the law.  If a woman is suicidal as a result of her pregnancy, she is entitled to an abortion.  Whether we include it is not debatable.  We must include it.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the 12th and 25th amendments to the Constitution.  The 12th amendment related solely to suicide and it was very clearly rejected.  The other two amendments were passed.  The people clearly indicated that they were happy with the amendments relating to travel and information but that they were not happy with that which related to suicide.  There has been a great deal of academic commentary on why the 25th amendment was rejected.  Again, the discussion in this regard is irrelevant because the amendment - which also dealt with suicide - was rejected.  The people rejected it and this reinforced their position on the 12th amendment.<\/p><p>  Senator Walsh also referred to suicide.  I repeat what I stated earlier, namely, that it is already catered for and that the threat of suicide must be included.  We have a very different regime from that which obtains in the UK.  We are concerned here with an extremely narrow test.  The UK is completely different and we should not look to what has happened there.  We are referring to situations where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of a woman.  That is not abortion on demand and it should never ever be seen as such.  The only time an abortion is lawful in this jurisdiction is when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  I really cannot overstate that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Terence Flanagan referred to language relating to the mother and child.  Our Constitution includes the term \"unborn\".  I am of the view that we should follow the Constitution and opt for the terminology used in it.  I did not hear the Deputy's question in respect of my submission, as there was a lot of movement.  If he wishes to repeat it, however, I would be quite happy to provide an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900012#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Staunton"},{"type":"speech","time":1357729200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>What is Ms Staunton's personal view in respect of the current situation?

This is a place for, in so far as is possible, our dispassionate legal opinion to be offered.  I hope we have furnished that.  I will now deal with the matters raised by the various Deputies and Senators.<\/p><p>  I find myself in agreement with both Senator Bacik's position and the contrary position that has been presented.  There may well be circumstances in which a Bill such as that which I have presented to the committee envisages that a two-doctor system may require deviation in certain circumstances.  It may, for example, require deviation in favour of a single-doctor opinion which - as I said in reply to Senator Crown - may involve, for example, the making of regulations and an explanation of why, in the circumstances of a case, only a single opinion was furnished.  The draft Bill I provided uses language such as \"no fewer than two doctors\" because there may be circumstances in which, in order to obtain a properly circumspect view of the totality of an individual pregnant woman's care, more than two opinions may well be required.  I certainly do not exclude that possibility in the draft Bill I prepared.<\/p><p>  Deputy Terence Flanagan referred yesterday to doctors not feeling restricted by the current situation and asked members and us to infer that there is no requirement for legislation.  He must have been listening to different hearings to those to which I was listening.  I heard a doctor say \"I do not want to go to jail\".  It is difficult to imagine any greater restriction on a doctor than a fear of losing his or her liberty.  I also heard a doctor say \"I need clarity on this\".  I think I heard another doctor say \"I need clarity on this\".  I think I heard the Medical Council state that it needs clarity.  I am pretty sure I have heard the Legislature say that we need clarity and legislation on this.  There is a chance that at the inquiries Deputy Terence Flanagan attended yesterday, what he contends was said was actually stated.  However, it was not said at this inquiry and it has not been stated in public discourse.<\/p><p>  The Deputy posed two specific questions, the first of which related to whether doctors have a duty of care towards the embryo, the foetus or the unborn child.  Yes, of course they do.  Any obstetrician or general practitioner involved in the care of a pregnant woman will inform one that in the generality of matters he or she has two patients in front of him or her.  I do not demur from that point of view in so far as it is held by doctors.  The Deputy's other question related to whether a foetus or embryo with a lethal foetal abnormality has any rights.  I am of the view that the termination of a pregnancy is always a morally serious decision.  However, what I know is that the Supreme Court has told lawyers and legislators everywhere in this jurisdiction that the born alive test is an essential index of the right to life as comported by the Constitution.<\/p><p>  Ironically enough, in his opening remarks Senator Walsh referred to the need for legislation, thus suggesting that he was at the inquiries I watched yesterday as opposed to those which Deputy Terence Flanagan was watching.  The Senator referred to quotes attributed to Lord Steel and the latter's concerns about the Act introduced in the UK and its consequences.  With the greatest of respect, there is a very simple solution to that - namely, to refrain from introducing the 1967 UK Act here.  We should introduce something different which contains safeguards and which is consistent with Article 40.3.3&deg; and with the needs of pregnant women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900012#L01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Simon Mills","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357729800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>As the time allocated has elapsed-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900013#M00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1357729800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Chairman, I would like to ask----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900013#M00300","speaker":"1019"},{"type":"speech","time":1357729800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Sorry, the time allocated is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900013#M00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1357729800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Chairman, the question-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900013#M00500","speaker":"1019"},{"type":"speech","time":1357729800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Staunton to give a three minute final summation followed by Ms Schweppe and Dr. Mills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900013#M00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357729800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank the committee again for inviting us here to give our independent legal opinion on the X case and any implementation of that.  When this committee begins to draft the heads of the Bill, the most important thing we must do is give effect to the X case.  We must ensure that the legislation states when an abortion is lawful in Ireland in accordance with the X case.  However, I urge the committee to consider the other issues and situations which may arise from Article 40.3.3o.  We do not want to come back here again if we can prevent that.<\/p><p>  The second issue is that the legislation must be prescriptive to a degree to ensure that doctors have as much certainty as possible as to when an abortion is lawful in Ireland.  However, the legislation must give effect to the fact that doctors are making hard choices.  These are a very small number of cases and decisions will be hard.  We must trust the clinical decisions of our doctors in the best interests of both the pregnant woman and the unborn child, in accordance with the legislation and Article 40.3.3o.<\/p><p>  I reiterate that there should be no floodgates.  Suicide is not a catch-all for women who want abortion on demand.  A woman is only entitled to an abortion if there is a real and substantive risk to her life, which includes a threat of suicide, and it is only if that suicide is directly linked to her pregnancy.  If she is suicidal prior to the pregnancy or just suicidal in general, she will not be entitled to an abortion.  It is only when that is very directly linked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900013#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Staunton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357729800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I thank the committee and the Chairman again for an opportunity to express my views on the current legal situation as I see it.  I will briefly reiterate three points in my final summation.  First, what we are doing at the moment is legislating for the law; we are legislating for the current legal situation.  There is no question to answer in regard to whether suicide should justify the termination of a pregnancy where that suicide, as Ms Staunton said, is linked to the pregnancy.  To question its justification is to both stigmatise mental health and to diminish our respect for medical practitioners who work in this incredibly difficult area every day.<\/p><p>  The second issue is in regard to fatal foetal abnormality.  I believe that the law as it currently stands is that unviable foetal life is not life for the purposes of Article 40.3.3o and that a declaratory section should be included to that effect in the legislation.  Where the life is viable, a constitutional referendum would be required to allow for termination in those circumstances.  There is no requirement of certainty in either the X case test or the viability issue.  It needs to be established only as a matter of probability.  There is not a 99%, 80% or 60% requirement.  It simply needs to be established as a matter of probability in accordance with the views of the relevant medical practitioners.<\/p><p>  I would also echo Ms Staunton's recommendation that we use this as an opportunity to be proactive rather than reactive in regard to this issue as a whole.  Academics and the courts have come up with scenarios where we are still not entirely clear on what the law is and we have spent huge amounts of money commissioning reports which have simply been ignored.  The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction would be the most obvious one which requires immediate incorporation.  <\/p><p>  There are still some straggling issues regarding travel and information which must be addressed.  For example, can the husband of a pregnant woman be entitled to know that his partner is seeking to travel to terminate her pregnancy or is seeking information in regard to that pregnancy?  Do asylum seekers have a right to leave this jurisdiction to terminate a pregnancy in circumstances which would not be constitutional?<\/p><p>  I have already talked about the issue regarding consent for those individuals who by reason of age or capacity require proxy consent to be made for them.  In certain circumstances this will be made by a guardian; in other circumstances it will be made either by the District Court or the High Court.  On the question as to whether the High Court can allow an individual to travel to terminate a pregnancy in circumstances which are unconstitutional, Mr. Justice Geoghegan said that should not be allowed and that issue requires clarification.<\/p><p>  The issue of third party foetal assault remains entirely open in this jurisdiction.  It is not terribly complicated to legislate for that but it needs to be included in the Bill.  I thank the committee once again for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900013#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer Schweppe"},{"type":"speech","time":1357729800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Before Dr. Mills begins, in fairness to Deputy Flanagan, he is genuine in his commitment, commentary and participation here.

It was a question put to me by Deputy Naughten who asked if I had ever seen a suicidal pregnant woman when I worked as a general practitioner.  The answer to that question is \"Yes\".  I recall seeing women who were pregnant and suicidal but the question of whether they were suicidal within the meaning of the X case was not a matter for my clinical judgment and therefore I cannot answer the question with any more precision other than to say that I did attend at various times depressed and suicidal pregnant women during my time as a general practitioner.<\/p><p>  It is worth the committee observing that Ms Schweppe, Ms Staunton and I have worked entirely independently on these matters save for the fact that I took the liberty, because I had her e-mail address, of furnishing Ms Schweppe with a copy of the draft Bill yesterday.  I had no idea what she intended to say.  I had no idea what Ms Staunton intended to say.  They had no idea what I intended to say and they had no idea what would be the contents of the Bill.  It is interesting and informative that there is a coherence and a coalescence of our views and that as a matter of fact the Bill I have presented for the committee articulates the vast majority of the views that have been so cogently expressed by Ms Schweppe and Ms Staunton.  That is something the committee should have some account to when considering the evidence its members have heard today.  It is an interesting coalescence of views.<\/p><p>  I will make last one comment on the Bill I have commended to the committee as the basis for the starting point of talking about this issue more and about the form the final Bill will take, and I say it in the light of what I heard said yesterday.  The Bill I presented to the committee deals with a number of issues that were raised.  It deals with clarity, which was called for by Dr. O'Mahony from the National Maternity Hospital.  It deals with the requirement for specialist doctors, which was called for by Professor Kieran Murphy of the Irish Medical Council.  It deals with the question of conscientious objection, which was called for by Dr. Mary McCaffrey.  It deals with the fear of floodgates, which was warned against by Professor Patricia Casey yesterday.  It deals with the question of abortion on demand by precluding it in so far as that appears to me to be possible in the drafting of the Bill.<\/p> <p>It deals with late-term pregnancies, an issued raised by Deputy Flanagan yesterday in his questions.  It ensures, by protecting doctors acting in good faith, that doctors will not go to jail.  The Bill does not quantify risk in accordance with the X case and the call for clinical judgment to be allowed.  In respect of all of these circumstances and without having known what the doctors were going to say yesterday, I believe we have a starting point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900013#M01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Simon Mills","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357730400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>That concludes this session.

It is important to note from the council's written submission and Dr. Brady's contribution that we, as legislators, are being asked to consider the need for legislation to give, as Dr. Brady said, meaningful effect to the existing constitutional rights of pregnant women whose lives are at risk.  That has to be emphasised time after time.

He also outlined several additional points that need to be addressed, not least the issues arising around fatal foetal abnormalities.  Will he elaborate on this?  In circumstances where foetal life cannot be born alive and will not survive outside the womb, can it really be said the right to life of the unborn is constitutionally equal to the right to life of the woman?  There is also the added position of the Government in the D <i>v.<\/i> Ireland case where it was acknowledged that this particular matter could be legislated for with the existing constitutional position in Article 40.3.3&deg; standing and that there would not be a conflict with these two positions.

Coming back to the European Court of Human Rights judgment, it made the point there needs to be reasonable or practical access to a termination in certain circumstances in Ireland and there is a responsibility on the State to put that process into place.  That is why we are dealing with and debating this today.  It had been inferred earlier that sign-off by three doctors would run contrary to the European Court of Human Rights judgment.  We had evidence from professionals in the field and obstetricians that a sign-off would require two obstetricians plus a specialist in a particular field.  In the case of suicide, it would be a specialist in psychiatry.  That means there would be a minimum of three doctors to sign off in some cases.  A perinatal psychiatrist gave evidence yesterday that in the case of suicide that it was their opinion that two psychiatrists should sign off.  In those cases, one is talking about a minimum of three and maybe up to four specialists having to sign off.  Would that run contrary to the European Court of Human Rights judgment in light of the fact that these are the professionals at the coalface making this point about signing off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900017#Q00500","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357731600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>On Senator MacSharry's concern with Article 3, there have been two recent cases involving Poland.  Both involved women who under Polish law were entitled to an abortion.  One was a 14 year old who had been raped and the other was a woman facing a very severe foetal abnormality.  I am not sure whether the abnormality was fatal although Polish law provides for abortion in circumstances of severe foetal abnormality as opposed to the bare fatality.  In both instances there were very substantial delays and much procrastination by doctors.  In the case of the 14 year old, her details were made public.  The European Court of Human Rights was very critical of the way the case was handled.  The upshot was that the court took the view that Article 3, the protection against inhuman and degrading treatment, was engaged.  Accordingly, if one looks at the specific person one is facing as opposed to some generic person, if the specific vulnerable woman is in circumstances whereby her treatment reaches the threshold required for Article 3, then an Article 3 violation is possible.  There are very few members of the Council of Europe who do not provide for abortion in cases of lethal foetal abnormality.  Ireland is one of the few that might be taken but we would suggest there is a strong argument that an Article 3 violation might be found.<\/p><p>  On Article 40.3.3&deg;, and to some extent this moves on to the point Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised, in the Roche case the Supreme Court found that the right to life of the unborn requires the capacity to be born.  In circumstances where there is clear medical evidence that the foetus will not be born, then, based on that assessment of the Supreme Court, it is strongly arguable that Article 40.3.3&deg; does not arise.  Even if it were to arise, the obligation on the State is to vindicate in so far as is practicable.  A court might take the view it arises, but in circumstances where the foetus cannot survive outside the womb, it may be asked what can the State be expected to do to vindicate that right to life, given that to some extent it is a cipher.<\/p><p>  The council would absolutely endorse the view Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in expressed on the need for clarity.  In the D <i>v.<\/i> Ireland case, recognition was given that sometimes novel interpretations of constitutional rights are required.  This is not something that is somehow aberrant but is inherent to constitutional rights.

Its analysis to date would suggest that denying abortions in cases of lethal foetal abnormality may be a violation.  Now that Article 3 has been found to be part of the analysis of abortion, an argument could be made that cases of rape or incest are also covered by it.  However, I do not think it would be permissible under Article 40.3.3&deg; at present to provide for abortion in cases of rape or incest.  That would require a constitutional amendment.<\/p><p>  Phrases such as \"floodgates\" are possibly unhelpful in these circumstances.  I am aware this was discussed in some detail yesterday.  The Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court states that where a doctor is satisfied there is a real and substantial risk to life and termination is required to avoid that risk, the woman is entitled to an abortion.  That is the test and we are going to have to trust our doctors to apply it in practice.  I understand that umbrage was taken yesterday at the suggestion that doctors would not be capable of applying that test.  The floodgates argument is something of a red herring.  <\/p><p>  In regard to Senator Crown's point, I am not going to take a position on a specific date.  As an organisation that bases its analysis on constitutional rights and legal expertise, the position taken in the Roche case was that the rights under Article 40.3.3&deg; enter into effect at the point of implantation.  However, it is important to distinguish between the right to life of the unborn under Article 40.3.3&deg; and the constitutional rights of a born person under the rest of the Constitution.  As the Constitution draws such a distinction, it is a right specific to an unborn child.  I realise I may not have answered the Senator's specific question but that is as far as I propose to go because I want to keep to the rights provided in the Constitution.<\/p><p>  In regard to sections 58 and 59, doctors in this situation are already making decisions about life and death and are faced with difficult choices.  Sections 58 and 59 provide for an additional and very unpleasant factor, namely, the possibility of going to jail for life.  Penal servitude was abolished in 1997 and the punishment would now be life imprisonment.  It is not helpful for a doctor who is making this kind of life-and-death decision to have that weighing in the balance.  The ICCL takes the view that the Act should be repealed, but it is not sufficient to repeal it on its own because Article 8 still requires us to establish an accessible mechanism for the constitutional right to be activated.  Removing that would not suffice in itself because in circumstances in which, for example, opinions differ on the existence of a threat to life between the woman and her doctor or among doctors, some mechanism is required for resolving the difference quickly.  <\/p><p>  As regards criminalising abortion outside the setting of medical treatment, there is no difficulty with replacing sections 58 and 59 to deal with what are commonly called back-street abortions, that is, any abortion not performed by an obstetrician in a hospital.  The State has a legitimate interest in ensuring such practices do not occur in order to protect the right to life of the woman.<\/p><p>  On the question of defining foetal abnormalities raised by Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, the particular cases we discussed included Edwards syndrome and anencephaly, but we are open to the views of medical practitioners in particular.  The core point is that if a doctor states that a foetus will not survive outside the womb, this is a circumstance in which we believe there would be no difficulty in providing for a termination under Article 40.3.3&deg;  As I am not a medical person I will not provide a specific list, but I hope I have gone some way towards answering the Deputy's question.  Once again, we need to trust our medical professionals in this regard.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Naughten asked about implantation.  The Roche case indicates that the right under Article 40.3.3&deg; does not arise until implantation.  There must also be the possibility of being born for that right to be engaged.  The Roche case deals with a frozen embryo rather than abortion, but it is all we have in terms of guidance from the Supreme Court on the meaning of the right to life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900019#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan D.

The recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, which has been commended, takes account of the fact that in most instances consent will be exercised through the parents.  It will be only in rare or exceptional circumstances that an alternative view is taken, and the best interest of the child should govern.  The X case is not a good example because the parents were in favour of their child having an abortion.  A better example for that purpose is the C case, because the child was in care and the parents objected to the decision being made by the HSE.  Substantial psychiatric evidence was heard in the District Court in that case.  After examining the transcript of evidence, the High Court stated that it failed to see how any court could have taken a different view on the need to allow that child to have a termination.  I do not want to second-guess the precise legislation to be introduced on foot of a Law Reform Commission report at this early juncture but our position is that the best interests of the child should be paramount.

As I recall how she described it to me, when she was pregnant with twins she was told they were the next stage to conjoined twins and she was advised to have an abortion on the basis of foetal abnormality.  She returned to Ireland and decided to carry those babies to full term.  They are now happy healthy six-year olds running around in a school playground.

Senator Bacik asked about the decision-making process.  We would endorse the expert group's proposal requiring two doctors at the specialist level.  I am conscious that medical evidence was given by doctors stating that in reaching their diagnosis they often require consultation with others.  I do not believe we want to impede that, but having regard to the ECHR case law on this, the key criterion is \"timely\".  I suspect a requirement of more than two doctors in legislation may cause a risk of delay, which would fall foul of Article 8 of the ECHR.  However, inevitably doctors will consult with their colleagues and we would certainly make no effort to impede that.<\/p><p>  Regarding whether Ireland might face a challenge over denying abortions in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, we believe it is very likely that such an action would succeed and in those circumstances I would absolutely endorse the position set out by Senator Bacik that rather than waiting until that happens we should be actively seeking to improve our Article 3 compliance by providing for abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality now.<\/p><p>  In response to Senator Bradford, I should first clarify that while we are very clear that we are a campaigning organisation with a position on this, we have come here today as a body that also has very substantial expertise on human rights law.

In regard to his concern around the diagnosis of suicide, the Supreme Court rejected in the X case the position that had been taken in the High Court, which is a requirement of an immediate risk.  The test that is set out is real and substantial risk to life, on the balance of probability, that can only be avoided by termination.<\/p><p>  In circumstances like this, we are dealing with life and death situations that, to some extent, involve predicting future human behaviour.  We are relying on the best judgment of our medical professionals and our view is that we should trust them.  Within the rubric of that test, sometimes they will get it right and sometimes they may perhaps get it wrong.  Again, however, the test that is set out does not require absolute certainty; it requires probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother that can be avoided by termination.  The constitutional position under the X case is very clear and I think we should trust our doctors in that regard.<\/p><p>  With regard to Senator Healy Eames' concern around the decision on whether or not to terminate a pregnancy, upon having medical advice that the pregnancy is not viable, I believe it is very easy to look at situations in hindsight.  This comes back to what I was saying about the fact we are trusting medical professionals to make difficult decisions about future events.  The key point the Irish Council for Civil Liberties would make in that circumstance is that the decision should be made by the woman.  This is certainly something that is emphasised in the expert group report in the principles set out in chapter 5 in regard to the test under the X case.<\/p><p>  At the moment, under Irish law, the woman does not make the decision; the decision is made for her by an 1861 criminal statute.  We have to trust women in that situation.  Some women, I have no doubt, will carry the pregnancy to term and, perhaps, even in circumstances where it is clear the child is not going to survive, some women may decide to go to term in any event.  Some women may not.  I do not think that is a decision that should be made for those women.  I have real concerns under Article 3 that the Irish State is seeking to make the decision for women who are faced with a clear medical diagnosis that the pregnancy is not viable, and that there is a real risk we will be found to be in breach of Article 3.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, as I have indicated already in regard to the question from Senator Crown, the Irish Constitution distinguishes between the right to life of the unborn and the right to life of born people.  That is a distinction that derives from the Constitution itself and I not really want to go beyond that.<\/p><p>  In regard to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s question, again, we are here today to provide the benefit of our expertise in regard to constitutional rights and human rights.  In our analysis, we have, of course, been cognisant of Article 40.3 throughout.  We are of the view that in cases of rape and incest, in cases where there is a substantial threat to the life of the mother, ultimately, it may be necessary to provide an abortion, and we are in favour of that as a campaigning organisation.  We are not saying at the moment that the European Convention on Human Rights requires that.<\/p><p>  In regard to the European Convention on Human Rights position, again, this is something that is considered in detail in cases like A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland and Tysiac <i>v<\/i>. Poland, whereby the court says there is an emerging consensus among the Council of Europe member states in regard to abortion.  The vast majority of Council of Europe member states provide for relatively liberal abortion regimes, certainly relative to Ireland.  At the moment, the position being taken by that court is that it falls within the margin of appreciation for a state to determine how it governs its abortion regulation itself.  In circumstances where Ireland has this constitutional right, however, it has failed to meet the Article 8 obligation.<\/p><p>  I do not believe we can discount the possibility that this consensus is changing over time, however, so we need to be live to the fact that, in terms of the development of ECHR case law, if we are looking at, say, a young rape victim who is not suicidal but who is asking for an abortion, in those circumstances, it is entirely feasible that, ultimately, the ECHR may determine it is a violation of Article 3 to deny it.  That has not happened yet and I want to be very clear that I am not saying it has happened yet.  However, in drafting legislation which will hopefully be in place for some considerable period of time, it is extremely valuable for this committee and for these Houses to have one eye to its human rights obligations internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900021#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan D.

I congratulate the Chairman and members of the committee on the wonderful job they have done in distilling the complex and challenging arguments on this very humane theme.  I will not speak on the points that I presented to the committee.  Members can read them in their own time.  I want to open on a few points which I am sure will be raised in our discussion over the next two hours.  The first point I wish to mention is the obvious one that, whatever our perspective, we are dealing with a human rights issue.  I have come to this issue and to the committee as one who believes in the human rights of the unborn and it goes without saying that I also believe very much in the rights of those who have been born and very specifically the mother of an unborn child.<\/p><p>  The evidence that the committee heard yesterday and the discussion that developed were interesting because they established, broadly but definitely, that what is going on in Irish hospitals is wonderful.  The doctors treat the mother and the unborn child as two patients.  They do their best for both and they make sure that mothers do not die.  That is wonderful news.  We did not hear that doctors are holding back or are nervous about intervening, or that the law is getting in the way of what they do.  On the contrary, the doctors said they do exactly what they wish to do in order to bring about that result.  The net effect of that is that some unborn children regrettably do die.  They are not targeted but if one carries out necessary medical treatment on the mother, the unborn child, in some circumstances, very predictably, will die.  The outcome is also that Ireland is one of the safest places in the world for a woman to be pregnant.  All of that we know.  I suggest that most people in Ireland want legal support for the actuality on the ground.  In other words, the argument I am putting forward is not a theoretical, abstract, metaphysical one but one that points to the maternity hospitals that are near us here, one of which is a stone's throw away - we could walk there in five minutes.  We are asking that what they do there every day and night should have the support of the law.  It is a very practical proposal that the present existing medical practice should be given legal support.<\/p><p>  The difficulty in this area is that unfortunately, 20 years ago, with the best will in the world but without having heard any expert evidence from a psychiatrist, the Supreme Court interpreted the amendment we had been dealing with for the past 30 years as involving a different legal and medical scenario, which would involve a change in existing medical practice.  I am not in any sense denigrating the judges involved.  What the Supreme Court articulated in that decision would, if implemented in legislation, very definitely involve a change in legal practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900022#V00300","nonspeaker":"Professor William Binchy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357735200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I now call on Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.

In 1983, the people's decision related to the life of the mother as opposed to her health.  Subsequently, the X case introduced the issue of suicide.  In recent days, experts with differing opinions have presented to us.  Some were pro-choice, some were pro-life and, as one could contest, some were in the middle ground.  They discussed the matters facing us as legislators in trying to address this sensitive issue.<\/p><p>  There are two key points.  We want clarity and it is important that we raise the issue of suicidal ideation.  Yesterday, psychiatrists and expert groups told us that this came in various forms, for example, suicidal ideation, suicidal intent and the finality of suicide itself.  Equally, they pointed out that it was only in the event of a woman being suicidal because of her pregnancy that a termination could lawfully be conducted.<\/p><p>  The masters of the various hospitals presented yesterday.  In particular, Dr. Rhona Mahony stated that she wanted to be guaranteed that at no stage would she or her patients be threatened with jail or criminal convictions because she carried out her duty to protect mothers' lives.  This profound statement resonated with many people.<\/p><p>  However, Professor Binchy is correct, in that many Members on all sides of the Houses and people in broader society have strong opinions on the issue of suicide.  Is he claiming that we do not need any new legislation and that the current structure is sufficient or is he asserting that a referendum is essential for addressing the issue of suicide?

It is the view of some who have come before us, and is provided for in the guidelines of the Medical Council, that this is the current understanding.  Can Mrs. Justice McGuinness shed any further light in terms of her understanding of it?<\/p><p>  I would like to focus on two particular points which arise from Professor Binchy's submission and were alluded to by him in his oral presentation this afternoon.  Professor Binchy states on page 2 of his submission that if the Oireachtas proceeds as it now proposes to do, then, as has been the case in most other countries, the law on abortion will change, with further extensions being demanded.  Surely, as it is only the Irish people who could make such a change, the constitutional protections remain in place.  No change that is in conflict with any article or subsections of the Constitution can occur without the expressed consent of the electorate in a referendum.  Professor Binchy rightly reflected on the high standards in our maternity hospitals.  Yesterday, we heard excellent contributions from the Master of the National Maternity Hospital, the Master of the Rotunda Hospital and Dr. Mary McCaffrey from Kerry General Hospital.  Why does Professor Binchy suggest - it is a suggestion because it is not a bald statement - that the situation would change on the introduction of the proposed legislation.  Those who appeared before us yesterday came across as exceptionally caring, compassionate and dedicated professionals.  I would have every confidence that this is exactly how they would continue to perform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900025#Y00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1357736400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their submissions.

I take it that is the people setting policy on this topic.  As that is the case, and in view of the fact that the vast majority, if not all, the medical people, including the obstetricians, who have appeared before us have sought legal clarity in this area, what is Professor Binchy indicating or suggesting the Oireachtas should do on this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900025#Y00400","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1357736400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

I admit, as a legislator, that there has been a failure to legislate in this regard for the past 20 years.  I would like to know why Professor Binchy refers to that Supreme Court decision as discredited.  With all due respect, Professor Binchy is here as a constitutional expert rather than to give political or personal conjecture on this issue.<\/p><p>  I have spoken previously about the issue of consent.  The children's rights referendum was recently passed.  The X case involved a 14 year old child.  We have all heard of the plight of children in care.  As legislators, we need to ensure the rights of children to appropriate medical treatment, if so required, are vindicated.  I would welcome some feedback from the witnesses on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900025#Y00500","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1357736400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I should point out that Professor Binchy is here also as an eminent academic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900025#Y00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357736400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Perhaps I will respond by coalescing a couple of points rather than reiterating what I said previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900025#Y00700","nonspeaker":"Professor William Binchy"},{"type":"speech","time":1357736400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Five other speakers have also indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900025#Y00800","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357736400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I will respond first to Deputy Conway's concern in regard to the political character of what I said.  That is important because it links very strongly into the legal dimension. The Irish people and politicians need to understand that it is not necessary under the A, B and C judgment to implement the Supreme Court decision.  That is a crucially important legal point.  Sadly, the terms of reference of the expert group, which were broad, were narrowed by the Minister.  This is crucially impacting on the legal solutions that are now before the committee.  I would definitely regard that as a legal issue.<\/p><p>  Questions were asked about how we proceed in this area and how the Supreme Court decision is discredited.  It was discredited by a number of commentators who wrote about it.  I would be hard pressed to name one commentator who unambiguously welcomed its analysis and said that it was right in every respect.  Commentators whose viewpoints would not be the same as mine but who would be neutral on the issue of the whole question of abortion or on pro-choice expressed a critique of the Supreme Court adjudication process at the time.  To give substance to that, I am happy to name one or two of them if the committee so desires.  It is true also to say that the facts are fairly obvious.  The Supreme Court in the 1992 decision heard no evidence from any psychiatrist.  In circumstances where it is proposed to introduce into our law a ground for abortion based on suicidal ideation, without having heard the evidence of any psychiatrist, it is not unfair to describe that decision as worthy of criticism. <\/p><p>  As regards how we proceed, reference was made to the children's referendum.  With the exception of the important value of treating everybody fairly and equally, which is a distinctive legal value, law has no values within its system.  Hearing both sides of a case is also a distinct legal process value, which is important.  Beyond that, law is a scaffolding around which one constructs a building.  The building constructed by society is based on the values which it wishes to see incorporated in law.  Law does not dictate to society what that building should look like.  The values infused into law are the product of social choice rather than of the legal system.  That is a crucially important point.  In that context, the children's referendum, which was passed a couple of months ago, states that the State recognises the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children.  I would like to raise a point, which would not necessarily succeed before the existing Supreme Court but which raises a question of constitutional interpretation.  Who are \"all\" children?  Does this include only children who have been born after 14 weeks of gestation or does the constitutional referendum embrace what the language on the face of it appears to do, namely, respect and acknowledge the inalienable, inherent and natural rights of all children.?  The short answer that many lawyers will give is that the Supreme Court refers to the pro-life amendment which defines \"children\" in terms of the unborn rather than children.  I recently reviewed the Supreme Court decision in the X case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900025#Y00900","nonspeaker":"Professor William Binchy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357737000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>There are four questions and I will try to reply to them as quickly as possible.  To be honest, I could not comment, as if it were handed down on tablets of stone, on the talk about a risk to life as a result of suicide related to her pregnancy as opposed to suicide unrelated to her pregnancy.  That question has not been put before the courts and has not yet been decided.  This is a difficulty people often have.  They say the courts ought to have said this or that, but the courts decide precisely on what is put before them.  The Supreme Court did not decide that one could have an abortion up to nine months.  It was not asked to decide on a time limit.  A time limit would be a matter for legislation.  The people who attack the court about that are completely wrong.  There can be things that are not decided.  The committee will have heard from other lawyers who perhaps would be more prepared to guess about this, as it were, but I am not prepared to guess about it.<\/p><p>  When one talks about looking at the current legal situation in this area, one must look at the entire legal position and the position set up by the various referenda.  The referenda in 1992 and 2002 rejected a very clear attempt to get rid of the suicidal or self-destruction ground.  It was specifically put to the people and, for whatever reason, they voted against it.  If one says that the referendum is the ultimate democracy, that was the ultimate democracy.  Again, the people voted for a right to travel and a right to information.  We would be naive if we thought that was not a recognition that people go abroad for abortions.<\/p><p>  When committee members are looking at the views of the Irish people on this issue, they should look to all the people who do not write to them and who do not carry out the robot telephone calls bothering them in their offices but who say: \"I do not really want abortion but what if it was my 14 year old daughter who was raped?\"  If the human dilemma is put before them, they are out on the streets.  They were out on the streets about the X case and about Savita.  People are more subtle than simply saying: \"This is our ideal and come hell or high water we will stick to it.\"<\/p><p>  As regards the discredited decision, it is a matter of opinion whether one discredits it.  With regard to the psychiatrists, it would have been preferable, perhaps, to have a psychiatrist but there was a very well known psychologist.  In fact, another well known psychologist was at a meeting of the Children's Rights Alliance that I attended this morning.  She said to me that she considered it a great pity that only psychiatrists and no psychologist appeared before the committee to give evidence, because psychologists have a great deal to say on this as well.<\/p><p>  In respect of children in care, it is to be hoped that the situation of children in care will be taken into account in the more detailed guidelines and regulations to be made.  This would be in accordance with the children's referendum.  I agree with Professor Binchy about the importance of the children's referendum.  \"I would, wouldn't I?\", as the saying goes.  However, it is interesting that among the people who most strongly opposed the children's referendum were the same people who are extremely, and much more violently than Professor Binchy, opposed to any possible move on introducing abortion.  That was a little strange.  They are terribly in favour of the rights of the unborn but they are not so enthusiastic when it comes to the rights of the born.<\/p><p>  I believe the committee must look at the middle ground and to the middle people of Ireland who do not keep going after the members all the time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900026#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1357737000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Seven members wish to speak and there is half an hour remaining, so I ask members to be precise and concise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900026#Z00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1357737000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The preface of the expert group report was written by Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan.

Is Professor Binchy suggesting that Mr. Justice Ryan was wrong in saying that?  He appears to say that in his submission.  The second question also relates to Professor Binchy's submission in which he asks, if the Oireachtas proceeds on the basis that it is permissible intentionally to terminate the lives of unborn human beings, what principled barrier there is to extending the circumstances in which lives may be terminated.

I have a few questions for Professor Binchy.  The five minute walk he referred to with respect to the National Maternity Hospital was taken yesterday in the opposite direction by people who came here and told us what they wanted at the end of that walk: legislation.  I am glad Professor Binchy is in agreement because he also suggested, if I understand his opening statement correctly, that there is a need for legislation to clarify the issue with respect to life saving abortions where the mother's life is in danger.  It appears from what he is saying that we should somehow specifically exclude suicidality from this.  As a lawyer, could he put this in the context of the Supreme Court judgment and two referenda?  I am sorry if we sound like a broken record but that is as high as it goes in civil authority in civil society, the ultimate court of appeal.  Unless I seriously misunderstand Professor Binchy, and I mean him no disrespect when I say that perhaps I do, is he suggesting that we, as legislators, should ignore what has been said in our Constitution, confirmed in two referenda and interpreted by our Supreme Court?  If so, who is the authority we should be answering to, if it is not we, the people, <i>vox populi<\/i>?

It is absolutely nothing personal, although I did sense a certain tinge in his presentation.  Senator Crown mentioned that we have had two referendums already and asked how many more times we need to hear what the people have said.  With respect, that is a serious reduction of the history of Irish constitutional referendums over the past 20 years, and I am surprised.  I do not particularly like the term \"pro-life\", as opposed to \"pro-choice\", or any of these terms.  The debate will not be won on the label, as members will appreciate.  However, of those who describe themselves as pro-life, many - indeed, the majority - actually opposed the referendum that proposed the type of change the Senator mentioned in 1992.  In 2002, a certain segment of that pro-life constituency also opposed the referendum in question.  That is an important point, and if we are to give a nuanced history, it would be an injustice not to mention those facts.  I also point out that one referendum took place 20 years ago and the other ten years ago, but we are now discussing a situation that has been precipitated by the European decision which asks for clarification in the law.  It does not ask or insist - I say this again - that Ireland implement the decision in the X case.  That is an absolutely crucial point.<\/p><p>  Senator Colm Burke asked whether I am suggesting that the judge got it wrong or that, in his introduction to the expert group report, he said something that was not true.  I am saying something different, which is that the judge, in the statement the Senator read out, gave the truth but it was a partial truth, because he quoted some of the decision and invited the reader to draw a conclusion.  I think it is fair to say the reader would be likely to draw the conclusion that therefore we must implement the X case decision.  That is the manner in which that quotation was used.  If that is the effect of reading that particular text, it is a mistaken effect.  I am simply pointing out the mistaken effect in question.<\/p><p>  Finally, a point was made about principle.  I made the argument, and I stand over it, that if we change the practice in Irish hospitals so that obstetricians are carrying out abortions on women who have no physical illness whatsoever and on unborn children who have no physical difficulty whatsoever on the basis of suicidal ideation, we very definitely will have changed the principles on which medical practice operates in this country.  That shift in principle may not happen overnight but if, in those circumstances, it is possible to take an innocent unborn child's life, that constitutes a shift.  As Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness mentioned - I hope I am not misrepresenting her by giving a summary of her summary - the X decision was packing in certain other grounds under the life ground because it was the only ground that was available in the circumstances.  I hope I am not doing Mrs. Justice McGuinness an injustice in saying that.  Already we can see the principle: if we can do it in one particular context, why not do it in other contexts?  We are dealing with tragic human conditions.  Any person of a humane disposition feels tremendously for the circumstances of the pregnant woman, and if one feels tremendously for a particular pregnant woman and agrees that one can take an innocent life in circumstances in which there is no medical condition, then I would respectfully say the principles have been changed and the culture will have been changed for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900028#BB00800","nonspeaker":"Professor William Binchy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357738200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>There have been a number of questions and I will try to deal as quickly as I can with as many as I can.

I think the view was expressed this morning that existing Irish law would be interpreted as providing for abortion in those circumstances.  The short answer I would give is that I do not agree that is how the law would be interpreted.  Nothing is certain in this world but that is my view.  I take the point about the D case, but my view is that a speculative argument was made which succeeded in that case but that the law would not be so interpreted in Ireland.<\/p><p>  I pick up on what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said a second time, and it is a fair point.  I thought I had answered the first time but perhaps I did not answer the question clearly enough.  It is said, \"Well, are we not locked into the X decision here and, therefore, there is no problem in terms of a rolling development of the law into further areas\".  The answer I gave, and which I would give again, is that the change of culture involved in transforming Irish medical practice to allow for the provision of abortion, for the actuality of abortion, for no requirement of due care to the child and for the requirement that suicidal ideation would be a ground for abortion, would have an effect.  Let us not exaggerate these things.  Not tomorrow or the next day but over a period of time that would have an effect on medical practice in this area such that the attitude towards abortion would be transformed.  It is reasonable to project that the net effect would be that the actual interpretations of the grounds would change over time.  <\/p><p>  We have experience not only in England, although the experience in England is striking on this point, but in many countries that when a change is made in the law, for the best of reasons, to allow for the intentional destruction of the life of the unborn child, a cultural change is made and it is very difficult to stop.  We heard of the tragic example mentioned by Deputy Catherine Byrne of a young girl who may have been raped or subject to sexual abuse.  Should we not have an abortion in those circumstances?  I believe Deputy Byrne was saying it would be appropriate to do so.  Already, we would be discussing these matters and extensions for these hard cases.  It would be very difficult to have a principled basis for opposing them.  That is the point I am making about the cultural change in this area.  This is a human rights question.  Sometimes human rights are difficult and the actual experience of protecting human rights is difficult.  <\/p><p>  The final point links into that very difficulty.  If, as legislators and society, we are going to say unborn children are to be protected, making absolutely sure the lives of mothers during pregnancy are equally protected and that no mother dies, there is a solemn, real and tangible economic and social obligation on our society to provide the support for women who find themselves in crisis pregnancies, not just lip service but actual social and economic support.  That is a practical question and not one, perhaps, to be addressed in detail today, but when we talk about changes in the law that is an area where legislators can introduce changes to provide the social and economic support for women who find pregnancy a challenge.<\/p><p>  On the human rights issue, let us not change our culture whereby we recognise that to be a human being, at all stages from the very beginning to the very end of life, is to be part of an important, crucial, valuable enterprise, the human experience of life.  Our culture is built on the notion that every person has equal dignity and entitlement to equal respect and equal rights.  Let us not throw away that very important principle, for the best of reasons and motivations, but rather do what I mentioned in my first remarks to the committee and look down the road 500 yards, see what they are doing in those hospitals and give legal protection to that.  Do not change the law so as to bring in an abortion regime.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900030#DD00400","nonspeaker":"Professor William Binchy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357739400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Catherine Byrne for her kind remarks.

I would not be certain that a doctor would be protected in the case of foetal abnormality.  I do not think foetal abnormality would come under the X case judgment.  It is highly doubtful that a doctor would be protected in such a situation.  Doctors need to have that clarified, at least.<\/p><p>  What doctors are looking at is extreme abnormality where the child is incapable of being born alive.  They are not asking to be allowed to abort children who are suffering from Down's syndrome, for example.  It is not about that.  It is about cases where the child is already destined to die in the womb and that situation must be dealt with.  It is highly doubtful what the law would be.  <\/p><p>  Professor Binchy said that if we are going to do this we will have no requirement of due care for the child.  I do not believe legislators are going to approach the passing of legislation in such an uncaring manner.  If legislators are approaching the issue as they suggest, by having an outline law and regulation, they have the opportunity to look at the question of due care for the child and balance that, as is required, against the life of the mother, and they should do so.  That can be dealt with in the regulations.<\/p><p>  When we look at the values of Irish society and whether we are going to change them - members of the committee will understand what I am saying - our values are considerably more subtle than one might think.

He stated that irrespective of what proposal comes forward, it may end up in the Supreme Court.  Based on the experience of the issue over the past 20 years, is there merit in splitting the decision?  There is almost unanimous agreement that the 1861 Act should be repealed and replaced, and that legislation on the guidelines for medical procedures should be introduced.  I suggest these issues should be dealt with.  The issue of suicide and any related issues, as well as the need for a constitutional amendment, could then be considered separately.  The Government has already decided to bring forward legislation.  It is hoped that the legislation for dealing with the medical procedures could be enacted without an appeal to the Supreme Court, although the other issue will almost certainly end up in the Supreme Court.

Is there an obligation on us as legislators to be just?  I ask this question purely in the context that we now know from evidence that suicide cannot be predicted with any great degree of accuracy.

They sound fascinating.  If I am reading the newspaper reports correctly, the State papers seem to say that Mr. Sutherland, whose public response to the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal in early 1983 is in the public domain, was opposed to the whole idea of a constitutional referendum on several grounds before Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward its actual wording.  The reasons he gave against the very idea of a constitutional referendum bore a striking resemblance to his critique of what emerged under the Fianna F&aacute;il wording in 1983.  This is a novelty to me - certainly, as far as I remember, not one word was said in 1981 or 1982 to show that Mr. Sutherland was opposed in principle to the very idea of a referendum.

Senator Katherine Zappone spoke about the references in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland to the need to implement in accordance with the existing constitutional provisions.  Forgive me, but I think I have dealt with these points before.  I will, however, make them again.  The Supreme Court judgment in the X case, like any Supreme Court judgment, is of course the law of the land.  There is no dispute about that; we are not challenging the legitimacy of the decision at a fundamental constitutional level.  There are no constitutional coups here, to use the expression of Senator John Crown.  That does not deprive us, however, as part of the democratic process, from critiquing a decision.  I will return to history for a moment, if I may, because it is enlightening.  There was a case, some 35 years ago, in which the Supreme Court interpreted the Adoption Act in a particular way.  We had a referendum and everything was fine thereafter.  It is absolutely reasonable for the democracy to respond to a Supreme Court decision.  I beg members not to proceed on the basis that they have to implement the Supreme Court decision.  They emphatically do not.  With respect to Senator Zappone, who has read the judgment from the European Court of Human Rights, nor does that court require us to implement the X decision.  On the contrary, it requires us to have clarity in our law.  Moreover, it specifically says that it is up to states to develop their law in this particular area.<\/p><p>  There is no right under the convention to abortion and we are perfectly free in this area to bring in a legal system which, going back to what I mentioned again and again, corresponds to the existing practice in medical hospitals.  Our side of the argument is emphatically empirical, emphatically on the basis of what is happening already in Irish hospitals.  Those who are proposing that the law be changed are proposing a change of culture in this area.  That change of culture will involve the intentional taking or termination of the life of an innocent human being.  It is a radical change in Irish society.  Since independence, no such proposal has come before the Oireachtas; nor, indeed, has it come from the wider community that there should be such a proposal.  I strongly repeat that what we are looking for here is something emphatically simple to provide, namely, that existing medical practice be given legal support and there be no change to the system and culture in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013010900032#FF00800","nonspeaker":"Professor William Binchy"},{"type":"speech","time":1357740600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor Binchy.
