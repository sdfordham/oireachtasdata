We have received more information and more details this time.  The total spend is now looking at &euro;96 million.  I said at a previous meeting that over &euro;600,000 will be spent between now and June this year alone and this situation is continuing.  We cannot deal with it at this meeting.  I think the committee needs to make a move on this to put it on the agenda and also to ensure that we can investigate it properly, not just with the Secretary General of the Department but with any of the relevant officials.  Perhaps the Chairman has suggestions as to how we can proceed in order to get Poolbeg properly on the agenda.  I know the committee is prevented from following some of the spend at the moment because it goes through local government.  I do not know if the committee can change its terms of reference for one particular piece of work or change the committee's terms of reference more generally, if we can see a way to do a proper investigation.  The spend continues and over a decade nothing has been built.

We wanted to have an indication of the other organisations such as Rehab Care, etc.  I was surprised to see that there are 25 organisations receiving &euro;344,699 between them.  In case anyone would think we are picking on Rehab or any other organisation, I believe we should write to each of those 25 organisations asking for the full remuneration package of the chief executive and of anyone earning more than &euro;150,000 - as requested from Rehab - and the number of people receiving salaries between &euro;100,000, &euro;120,000 to &euro;150,000.  Enable Ireland receives &euro;36 million, the Irish Wheelchair Association receives &euro;36 million and Western Care receives &euro;27 million.  This is a phenomenal amount of money which is taxpayers' money and which is being given by the HSE.  In our view they should comply with public sector pay guidelines if they are in receipt of such money.  I am surprised that some of those organisations are what we know as out-of-hours and GP services.  One such organisation receives &euro;8 million and another receives &euro;7.3 million for the out-of-hours GP service.  I know much of the money goes to the doctors and drivers and administrative staff but for us to be effective in our job we should write to all those 25 organisations who are all in receipt of substantial payments of taxpayers' money and ask for details of the remuneration packages of the senior people.  It is a full 12 months - March of last year - since the HSE produced its internal audit report on the section 38 bodies.  We have not got to the end of it after 12 months.  I do not want to spend another 12 months getting to the end of the section 39 organisations.  I am starting with those in receipt of over &euro;5 million although some might argue I should start at a lower amount but in my view this is a good starting point.  It is in the public interest to find out.  We may find out that they are all in receipt of reasonable salaries in line with public sector pay guidelines.  If that is the case we would be very happy with that situation and I think we should do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300003#B01000","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1396515600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It was around whether there was an exercise of discretion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the cancellations or being manifest in the cancellations.  What we tried to do was to split out the cancellation rate by reference to where the ticket actually issued from.  There was a difficulty because in the report we looked at the whole data set for 2011 and 2012 but to drill down into it we needed more information about why tickets were cancelled and so on.  That was only possible from April 2012 to December 2012.  It is still quite a significant number of tickets in total.  The total number of offences detected in that period was nearly 300,000.  One can see the split in the table as between the intercept cases, where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have spoken to a driver and engaged with a driver and the non-intercept cases which are all speeding ticket cases where cameras were involved.<\/p> <p>When we examined it, we discovered that the number of offences terminated varies significantly as between intercept and non-intercept.  There is a higher level of cancellations in respect of the non-intercept cases.  When one removes cancellations that relate principally to processing errors, cancellations for emergency vehicles and so on, it switches the balance so that the cancellation rates for exceptional and discretionary reasons, as recorded on the processing system, were 1.6% for the hand-held detection devices used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and notepads - where drivers are interviewed - and 1.7% or 1.8% for speed camera cases.  This means that there was not much difference between terminations relating to Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cameras and GoSafe cameras.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300003#B01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396516200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Are there any questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300004#C00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1396516200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>So the overall figure relating to terminations for exceptional and discretionary reasons in respect of the offences detected is 2%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300004#C00300","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396516200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Yes, particularly when one removes the processing errors and cases were something was wrong.

It certainly addresses the issue of a use of public money which has entered the public arena in recent times.  The issue to which I refer is that which relates to a tender for what is termed a \"digital recorder logging system\" for use in taping telephone conversations in Garda stations.  A large contract was awarded in 2007 to cover a period from 2008 onwards at three-yearly intervals and to be renewed at yearly intervals.<\/p> <p>It also includes a maintenance contract and the parties to that contract are the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and whoever got the contract.  It is important that since the Garda Commissioner cancelled these activities that we look at them and at whether there was a waste of public money and whether it was being properly used.  The issues involved here are very serious.  They include, first, why this particular service was needed; second, whether value for money was given; and, third, whether it was illegal.  In other words, was this money being used for purposes for which it should have been used?  All those issues are matters which should be addressed by the Committee of Public Accounts.  This applied to at least, as everybody knows, 20 Garda stations or more.  It is a matter we should address as a matter of urgency, particularly in the light of what the Garda Commissioner has done since last November when he cancelled these activities.  The people we should ask in are the people involved and the people I specify in my letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300004#C03100","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396516800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Do any other members wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300005#D00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1396516800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I direct this question to the Comptroller and Auditor General.

The main issue in this regard is that trying to get information has been akin to pulling teeth.  Had Rehab been upfront months ago, members would not be here.  While the committee may still have had the same issues to face, Rehab has been extremely secretive about the whole thing.  No matter what question one asked, one did not get the answer.  While Deputy Deasy is correct in that the greatest need is for the information, certain people obviously know more than others.  The point is that I understand what Rehab is going through and all members are aware of the issues facing the charity sector.  However, the blame falls solely on Rehab itself because had it been upfront and had it told the committee exactly what it did and did not know, members would not even be having this conversation this morning.

Some &euro;23.8 million was spent on activities related to public service management and reform.  Some &euro;18.8 million was spent on management of the system of public expenditure.  At the end of the year, the Department had underspent by &euro;4.6 million relative to its budget, and that amount was accordingly liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  Vote 12 presents the expenditure in relation to Civil Service and prison officer pensions.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged to other votes, including those for Education, the HSE, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The total spend on Vote 12 in 2012 amounted to &euro;520 million.  Appropriations-in-aid amounted to &euro;88 million, and mainly comprised employee pension contributions.<\/p><p>  The costs of administering Civil Service pension payments is borne by the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance.  Costs of policy formulation in relation to civil and public servants are borne by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Vote.  The non-inclusion of administration costs is reflected in the format of the appropriation account for Vote 12.<\/p><p>  In 2012, I recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should regularly estimate the State's accrued liability for future pension payments, especially given the significant changes in recent years in pension contributions, entitlements and employment numbers.  The last published estimate relates to the position at end 2009, and put the liability at a total of &euro;116 billion.  When I reported last September, the Department had begun an exercise to update the estimate which I understand will be reported annually in the finance accounts.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in that regard.<\/p><p>  Chapter 3 focuses on central government's financial commitments under contractual public private partnerships.  At the end of 2012, there were five central government Departments and agencies with financial commitments under a total of 38 major PPP contracts.  The total expenditure already incurred on those projects by end 2012 was just over &euro;2.6 billion and the outstanding commitment was estimated at nearly &euro;4.2 billion.  One new PPP contract, the Schools Bundle 3, was awarded in 2012.<\/p><p>  The central PPP unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform facilitates the PPP process centrally by setting the general policy framework and provides guidance to Departments and agencies on appraisal, procurement and evaluation of projects.  The Department's guidance stipulates that a post-project review is mandatory for all projects with a capital value greater than &euro;20 million.  When I reported, only one PPP deal had so far been subject to a formal post-project review.  The Courts Service commissioned a review of the Dublin criminal courts complex contract.  The complex came into use in late 2009, and was fully operating from January 2010.  The review, which was completed in October 2012, concluded that the project processes had been satisfactory but suggested that further analysis should be carried out on the impact of the project on court business, for example, the effect on court waiting times, cost savings, etc.  As previously reported by my office, the original business case for the criminal courts project identified potential benefits in general and qualitative terms, but more could have been done to quantify the expected business benefits.  As a result, there will be difficulties in carrying out a meaningful post-project review of the extent to which expected benefits have been realised.<\/p><p>  Both the Department of Education and Skills and the National Roads Authority indicated to us last summer that reviews were in progress on certain projects.  I am aware that some of the roads project reviews have been completed.  We will examine these and may report further on the outcomes.<\/p><p>  Contracts for some PPP projects provide for benchmarking of operating costs to be undertaken from time to time.  These potentially afford the relevant public bodies the opportunity to secure savings in respect of contract services.  For example, following a benchmarking exercise, the Courts Service secured annual savings estimated at over &euro;160,000 a year.  The chapter recommended that Departments and agencies engaged in PPP projects be reminded by the Department of the importance of engaging in periodic benchmarking of costs, where this is provided for in the contract.<\/p><p>  There are two main elements in Chapter 4 dealing with Vote accounting in 2013.  The first element is the standard aggregation and reporting on the outturn for appropriation accounts.  Figure 4.1 indicates that total gross voted expenditure in 2012 amounted to &euro;49 billion &ndash; a reduction of &euro;4.8 billion or 9% from the peak level in 2008.  All Departments and offices managed within their voted 2012 allocations.  Overall, the surplus relative to the amount appropriated was around &euro;750 million.  Of this, Departments and offices carried over to 2013 just over &euro;100 million, with the sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The balance was surrendered to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  The chapter also draws attention to a small number of issues arising from the audits of appropriation accounts that raise specific accounting or control issues.  These relate to duplicate payment of salary over a long period to an individual who initially went on secondment and then transferred from the Central Statistics Office to another Department; contributions from both a Vote and a departmental fund in relation to the same service, making it more difficult to identify the full contribution, and weakening the vote control function; and pre-payment of Ireland's 2013 UN contribution on the last day of 2012 out of funding that would otherwise be surrendered, and contrary to the general government accounting principle that charges on votes should be \"mature for payment\" within the year, which was discussed with the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade when he appeared before the committee.<\/p> <p>The chapter also presents the final financial outturn following the disposal of e-voting machines.<\/p><p> Chapter 5 is an examination of how well central government Departments and offices manage the budgets they are allocated by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann each year.  It also assesses whether appropriation accounts present adequate explanations of the extent to which outturns differ from the original budgets.<\/p><p> Estimates are presented to the D&aacute;il with varying levels of detail as to how the money sought will be used.  The Estimates of expenditure presented to the D&aacute;il for approval early in the year should reasonably accurately represent the amount that it is expected will be spent on each departmental service.  They also effectively serve as cash limits.  Departments are required to monitor and manage expenditure within the programmes and subhead allocations approved by the D&aacute;il.  If spending begins to run ahead of the profile, or threatens to do so, Departments are required to take action to bring it back into line with the approved estimate.  If large adjustments to the budgets for programmes or subheads are required as the year progresses, formal approval must be sought from the D&aacute;il, through the Supplementary Estimate process.<\/p><p> In practice, only a small number of Departments seek Supplementary Estimates in any year.  Figure 5.4, in chapter 5, shows the Votes that regularly have required Supplementary Estimates in recent years.  These include the Votes for the HSE, Army pensions, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service.  There is a separate chapter dealing with budget management in the HSE, which the committee is scheduled to examine on another date.<\/p><p> Chapter 5 also deals with a general issue affecting Vote accounting.  In the past, appropriation accounts were required to explain significant variances from amounts appropriated by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann which occur in December of the year of account after any Supplementary Estimate adjustments.  Explanations were rarely given about expenditure lines that were adjusted as a result of a Supplementary Estimate.  Consequently, some appropriation accounts gave only partial explanations of their performance relative to budget.  I have recommended that, in future, explanations should be based on the variance from the original budget.  The Department agreed to review the accounting policy, and the Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300008#G03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396519200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to make a short statement.  I would like to talk briefly about the role of the Department, and then discuss in detail relevant aspects of the 2012 appropriation account and the 2012 report that the Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined.<br\/>A key aspect of our Department&rsquo;s work since its establishment in 2011, which work has been carried out in conjunction with the Department of Finance, has been the strategy for fiscal consolidation.  This has involved very significant reductions in Government spending.  Since its peak in 2009, gross voted expenditure has been reduced by 13.5%, from &euro;63.1 billion in 2009 to &euro;54.6 billion in 2013.  Consolidation measures to date have ensured Ireland's successful exit from the troika programme.  A further reduction of &euro;1.7 billion is budgeted for this year, 2014.  This consolidation has required effective budgeting and it is worth noting that gross spending has been broadly in line or below profile in each of the years since the Department was established.  In 2012, the year we are debating this morning, the variance was 0.2% on gross expenditure of &euro;98 million.  That is out of a budget over &euro;60 billion.  It is a very modest variance from the Estimate.<br\/>I would like to highlight this morning two aspects of this consolidation: reform of the budgetary and Estimates process and the ongoing reform of the public sector.  With our colleagues in the Department of Finance, we have implemented a set of reforms to Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary architecture.  We hope they will improve the management of public resources, increase transparency in the budgetary process, and deliver greater value for money for public spending.<br\/>A new medium-term expenditure framework, setting out multi-annual ceilings for each Department, has been implemented.  The amount of information provided in the annual Estimates has been increased as part of the implementation of our performance budgeting initiative.  We hope that is useful for committees, particularly this one, when examining public expenditure.<br\/>A new public spending code has been introduced to ensure that both current and capital expenditure are subject to more rigorous value-for-money appraisal in advance of public moneys being spent.  The website <i>www.irelandstat.gov.ie<\/i>&ndash; the whole-of-government performance measurement website &ndash; was launched.  The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service was established to support better policy-making across the system.  We know from previous reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, including the one we are discussing this morning, that a lack of capacity in policy areas led to mistakes, which led to value-for-money issues when it came to particular programmes.  We are very determined to improve the capacity and policy capacity across the Civil Service.  We will shortly be commencing a second comprehensive review of expenditure to examine spending and inform the next three-year cycle of fiscal targets and expenditure allocations, for 2015 to 2017.<br\/>Along with the work of this committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General and internal audit committee, these reforms continue to embed a value-for-money culture across the public service.  Of course, we are happy to work with members of this committee to see what further steps can be taken.  I am happy to hear suggestions based on the work they undertake.  I will speak in a moment about some of the specific Vote budget management issues that have been raised.<br\/>The ongoing reform of the public service has been necessary to ensure that important services continue to be provided as spending is reduced.  In a recession, demand for public services increases.  Our latest recession was no different.  Demands on our public services have increased and we have maintained service provision while reducing staff numbers by over 30,000 since 2008.  The public service pay bill has fallen from &euro;17.5 billion in 2009 to &euro;14.1 billion last year.  Further reductions are scheduled for 2014.  New working arrangements have been introduced, including longer working hours.  Some 15 million additional hours are in the system on foot of the Haddington Road agreement.  New rosters and standardised arrangements for annual leave and sick leave have been introduced.  We are making good progress on increasing efficiency in areas such as public procurement, shared services, digitalisation and property management. Further details of these reforms are set out in the second progress report, which the Minister, Deputy Howlin, published in January of this year.  At that time, the Minister also published a new public service reform plan for the period 2014 to 2016.  It sets out a new phase in the reform programme and our ambitions for the period ahead.<br\/>Reform has been enabled by a climate of industrial peace that we have worked to maintain over the past three years.  The Croke Park agreement delivered on its objectives.  The Haddington Road agreement sets out measures to deliver further savings out to 2016.  As I mentioned, it provides for a total of 15 million additional hours annually across all sectors of the public service, which will help to deliver long-term and sustainable increases in productivity.  Reform is about productivity, and we can see significant gains in productivity across the system.  That is an important point worth highlighting.  When people talk about reform, their meaning is sometimes a little nebulous.  What we mean is that we do more or the same with less.  It is ultimately about productivity and delivering more.<br\/>I would also like to highlight to the committee some further aspects of our work in the Department that may be of interest.  The Civil Service - that smaller part of the public service with a staff of 35,000 - has gone through a period of change and we, as leaders in the Civil Service, recognise that further change and renewal are required.  Last year, we started a Civil Service renewal process.  The purpose of this process is to set out a new, clear vision for the service and the actions required to deliver on this.  We are looking at areas where capacity and capability need to be developed to meet current and future challenges.  These include areas such as leadership, change management, policy formation, and project and policy implementation.  Enhancing our HR capacity, different recruitment models and increased investment in training and skills are integral to the agenda.<br\/>As part of a broad consultation process, a series of town hall meetings are taking place across the country to brief civil servants on the issues being addressed and to seek their input and ideas.  To date, almost 1,700 staff have engaged with this process.  This is the widest process of this type we have ever undertaken.  On another day, we will be very happy to come here to brief the committee on what is happening with and planned for this process and on some of the findings.<br\/>In January, we published a consultation paper on strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance.  Greater clarity, transparency and common understanding of responsibilities will accelerate improvements in how the Civil Service works and how performance is assessed.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, intends to publish the outcome from these various processes in July before the summer break.<br\/>Let me mention a few other developments of interest to the committee that relate to our Department.  The Office of Government Procurement has been established to improve how public procurement is structured and managed, and we have targeted savings of over &euro;500 million over the next three years.  The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has also been established within the Department to build on our performance on e-government and to maximise the potential benefits of digitalisation and open data to deliver services in a more efficient and innovative way.  PeoplePoint, the Civil Service HR and pensions shared service centre, was established and it now provides services to 24,000 civil servants across 19 organisations.  When fully operational, PeoplePoint will deliver savings estimated at &euro;12.5 million per annum and, critically from our perspective, improve the quality of information for managers across different Government Departments.<\/p> <p>The Civil Service payroll shared services centre is being established under our Department.  Twenty-seven of the 53 in-scope bodies will transition into the new services centre this year.  When fully operational, this service will also deliver savings each year.<\/p><p> We have also undertaken a base-lining and business case exercise for a financial management shared service to assess the potential for streamlining and improving the processes in respect of financial management that currently operate across 48 bodies in the Civil Service, defence and justice sectors.  On completion of this assessment, a further submission will be made to the Government to proceed to full implementation of a shared services approach to financial management.  An estimated &euro;14.6 million in savings could be delivered and the project, if implemented, will also yield benefits in terms of improved financial management information, adding value to both financial analysis and decision-making across the system.<\/p><p> Moving to accrual accounting is an important related issue.  Our Department is engaging with stakeholders to identify the relevant issues and will be engaging with this committee in due course.  The process needs to take account of a number of related developments, including proposals for EU harmonised accounting standards, the recommendations of the IMF fiscal transparency assessment report and the financial management shared services project.  These will be important changes affecting the management of public money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is involved with us and we are very happy to brief the committee in detail as the project advances.  <\/p><p> Turning to the political reform agenda, our Department is supporting a range of initiatives in this area.  We have drafted changes in legislation to give greater powers to the Ombudsman and for the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries within the current constitutional framework.  We are also participating in the Open Government Partnership, which includes a number of countries.  Other legislative reforms being advanced include the regulation of lobbying, a reformed Freedom of Information Act, legislation to protect whistleblowers and the further strengthening of the ethical framework for officeholders and public servants.<\/p><p> In addition to these political reform measures, the Department has prepared and published five pieces of legislation in the past 12 months.  I have set them out in my speech.  Last year, we dealt with a total of 1,956 parliamentary questions and are hoping for more than 2,000 this year.  We also dealt with 1,699 representations.<\/p><p> I would now like to turn to some specific items on the agenda today.  Listening to the Comptroller and Auditor General's remarks, I should say that we accept all the recommendations listed in the report.  In most cases, they are being implemented.  The first item is the 2012 Appropriation Accounts for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department had an outturn of &euro;37 million in 2012, compared to an estimate of almost &euro;42 million, leaving a surplus to surrender of &euro;4.6 million.  This variance arose largely because of savings on administrative budget pay of over &euro;2 million due to a large number of retirements in February 2012 and slower than anticipated appointments to key posts as we sought to ensure the necessary skills were recruited and savings of almost &euro;1.8 million arising from the timing of funding draw downs on cross-Border PEACE and INTERREG initiatives.<\/p><p> Vote 12 provides primarily for pension benefits for civil servants and pension payments to their dependants.  The original gross 2012 Estimate for the Vote was just over &euro;500 million.  This was subsequently increased by way of Supplementary Estimate to a revised gross Estimate of some &euro;525 million to accommodate higher retirement levels in 2012.  The gross outturn under Vote 12 for 2012 was &euro;520.5 million.  We agree fully with the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation that from now on, variance should relate to the original budget as opposed to the budget augmented by a Supplementary Estimate.  We think that is a good suggestion and we have written to Departments by way of a new circular, which will be reflected in future accounts.  The higher than anticipated numbers retiring in 2012 impacted significantly on the A4 subhead from which once-off lump sum pension payments are made.  The original 2012 Estimate had been &euro;116 million against an outturn of &euro;83.4 million in 2011. However, expenditure of &euro;134 million had taken place on the subhead by November 2012.  It was against this background that a Supplementary Estimate was required.<\/p><p> A new single public service pension scheme for new entrants to the public service has been introduced which sees pension benefits based on career-average earnings rather than final salary for all new entrants since the start of 2013.  There is a new minimum public service pension age of 66 for these \"new joiners\" which will rise in step with changes in the state pension age to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  In addition, with effect from 1 July last year, there has been a further reduction in the rates of public service pensions of between 2% and 5% for those in receipt of pensions of more than &euro;32,500.<\/p><p> At my appearance here last October, I stated that following discussions with the Comptroller and Auditor General, my Department had commenced a major actuarial exercise with the intention of updating the accrued liability in respect of public service occupational pension schemes.  I can inform the committee that my Department has now completed an exercise to estimate the accrued liability in respect of public service occupational pension schemes.  The key result is that the accrued liability in respect of public service pensions is estimated at &euro;98 billion as at end December 2012.  This figure is &euro;18 billion lower than the previous estimate of &euro;116 billion that was arrived at by the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2009.  Therefore, over the three years from 2009 to 2012, the accrued liability has fallen by &euro;18 billion or 16%.  This reduction reflects the effect that expenditure control and containment in respect of pay and pensions have had on the overall liability since the last valuation.  Further details of this work are on our website.  If policies had not been changed on a \"no policy\" basis, the accrued liability would have been over &euro;130 billion by now.  The measures we have taken have reduced it by &euro;18 billion against the 2009 Estimate but if we had done nothing, the Estimate would be over &euro;130 billion.  <\/p><p> Ireland currently has 17 operational public private partnerships, PPPs.  Two additional PPPs have reached financial close and are currently under construction.  Expenditure on PPPs to the end of 2012 was almost &euro;2 billion.  Future unitary charge commitments, including the two additional projects now under construction, were almost &euro;6.6 billion at the end of 2012.  That represents the total liability from the PPP projects.  In July 2012, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced plans for an additional &euro;2.25 billion investment in public infrastructure projects in Ireland, which included the new &euro;1.5 billion PPP phase 1 programme.  This investment is additional to the Exchequer public capital programme, as it is primarily funded by the private sector.  Due to co-ordinated efforts by many Departments and agencies over the past 18 months, particularly the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, the Irish PPP market has made a significant turnaround and has finally reopened to Irish projects.  Phase 1 PPPs are progressing well and in line with market capacity.  Seven of the nine projects announced in the stimulus plan have issued to market.<\/p><p> Dealing now with Vote accounting, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report shows that departmental spending funded from the Exchequer fell from &euro;49.3 billion in 2008 to &euro;44.9 billion in 2012, a reduction of almost 9%.  Each Vote stayed within the allocation appropriated by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for 2012, with Departments surrendering &euro;641 million back to the Exchequer at the end of the year, having regard to Supplementary Estimates.  <\/p><p> While the management of expenditure within voted allocations is the responsibility of each Department and Office, the reforms to the medium-term expenditure framework implemented in the past year will assist with the control of departmental spending.  The arrangements for ministerial expenditure ceilings have been placed on a statutory basis.  An administrative circular issued by my Department details the rules and arrangements for planning and managing current expenditure within these ceilings.  Under the common budgetary timeline introduced as part of the EU two-pack regulations, the annual budget was published on 15 October.  In line with this new timetable, the Revised Estimates volume for 2014 was published on 18 December 2013.  This new timetable allowed much earlier consideration of the Estimates by the relevant Oireachtas committees.<\/p><p> I hope I have been able to give some examples of the work of the Department.  Once again, I would like to acknowledge the work and commitment of officials in the Department who continue to deliver on a very significant agenda for the Minister and Government.  We look forward to working with the committee as we continue our work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396519800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Watt.

We were interested in having the IMF stand back to examine our approach to budgeting and financial management.  Generally it is very positive about our financial procedures and approach to budgeting.  It made a series of recommendations which will bring it to the next level, the level of the best countries in the IMF.  We need to improve in a number of areas.  We are currently looking at fiscal risks, fiscal forecasting, accrual accounting and preparation of balance sheets.  The figure I announced today in respect of future liabilities is an example of that work.   We can publish the recommendations and set out our current position in respect of a number of them.  However, its key recommendations on accruals and the format of accounts will have to dovetail with the EU's harmonised accounting regulations, which are not yet ready.  We do not want to commit to a particular approach on foot of the IMF assessment only to find that the EU is taking a different approach if it means we have to reset the systems.  Part of the work will therefore have to wait until we can see how it can be dovetailed between the two systems.<\/p><p>  One change we introduced which has not received much attention relates to the quarterly Exchequer statements, the most recent of which was issued yesterday.  We now present information on a gross revenue and expenditure basis, in addition to the traditional Exchequer statement.

The Deputy raised a number of issues and perhaps I can give a bit of a flavour.  First, in relation to the proportion of spend we are targeting to save each year, it is of the order of 2.5% to 3%.  Yes, there will be winners and losers in that regard, but the winners will create employment and create jobs.  The losers will have to contend with loss of business.  There is no doubt in relation to that.<\/p><p>  We are looking at this thing holistically, though.  We are working on a number of different themes and part of that is around engagement.  We have set up a high-level group in conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to drive and enable SME access to public procurement.  We are working with a number of agencies that sit within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in that regard, including InterTradeIreland and Enterprise Ireland.  I chair a group that meets regularly to drive initiatives in that regard.<\/p><p>  The thrust we are working on are things like information and education.  For example, in 2013 we ran two very large meet the buyer events where SME businesses could meet public sector buyers and try to understand public procurement better in order that they could compete and win business from the public sector.  We had about 1,200 suppliers at the event in Dublin and we had about 800 suppliers at the event in Belfast.  We are getting SME engagement with regard to looking at how to win public procurement.<\/p><p>  As we centralise more, there is always the risk that people feel crowded out.  We are working with bodies like Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland to help educate suppliers around building consortia in order that smaller businesses can come together and win the larger offerings that the State is putting out to the marketplace.  We are working with the Competition Authority as well to keep everyone safe in that regard.<\/p><p>  There is a lot happening here in terms of the education front.  This year we will be transposing into law the new European directives which are very business friendly and very SME friendly.  They will come into force next year.  As part of that, we have engaged with industry.<\/p> <p>We have set up a working group as part of our group with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to engage with the Small Firms Association, SFA, Chambers Ireland, IBEC, etc., to get their input into how we can better shape procurement.  We want to ensure that small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, can be successful in terms of public procurement.  We are also changing and investing in our systems to standardise more and remove some of the bureaucracy.  The Secretary General mentioned Department of Finance circular 10\/10 on promoting SME access.  We are in the process of reviewing that circular against the backdrop of the new EU directives to determine which measures we can accelerate so as to reduce barriers for SMEs and enable access for them to compete for business in the public space.  We expect to be in a position to produce a new circular in the next one to two months.  This will give guidance and set rules for the public sector so as to enable SMEs to compete for business better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300014#N02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396522800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Mr. Quinn stated that there would be winners and losers in this process.  I have no problem with that when there is change, but the SME sector is afraid that the winner will be a large, global company with unbelievable resources that can make a crazily low bid for a public procurement contract, blowing everyone else out of the water.  That winner would not give a hang for Irish jobs and so on.  The Department is focused on making savings.  Consider the Irish School Arts Supply Federation, which supplies small schools.  It cannot compete at that level.  Mr. Quinn mentioned helping SMEs to understand better how public procurement works.  Understanding is not the issue.  Rather, they cannot tender competitively.  How will the Department make it possible for them?<\/p><p>  What quality controls does the Department have in place in respect of the services being procured?  The arts supply federation works with many schools and has built up commitments and relationships.  A school knows it will get value for money and quality and there is an after-sales element.

As I understand it, his point is that the offerings will be so large that SMEs cannot compete for them.  It is important to reflect on the available data from 2011, even though they are not fantastic.  They indicate that less than 3% of the tenders for goods and services are above the threshold.  This means that, of the amounts being tendered, 97% are less than &euro;125,000.  A significant amount of business that the State puts into the marketplace is relatively small.  The threshold for works is much larger at &euro;4 million.  The State will continue putting a significant amount of small business into the marketplace.<\/p><p>  I disagree in part with the Deputy's comments on the hunger for information.  Much of the sector's feedback to us has been to the effect that many bidders need information on how public sector procurement and how to answer the exam questions.  Public procurement is predictable and asks standardised questions.  Through bodies like InterTradeIreland and Enterprise Ireland, our organisation provides direct support to businesses in terms of education.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's last question was on quality control.  As part of the roll-out of my new office, we are standardising our contracts more.  We will also put in place more standardised processes for managing all suppliers and holding their feet to the fire in terms of performance.  We have discussed performance under another guise today.  We need to manage all of our suppliers to a good standard of quality.  We are not simply focused on price.  Our guidance to the public sector is to evaluate tenders on what is called the most economically advantageous price.  This brings into play both price and quality.  It is not a question of compromising quality in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300015#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1396522800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>If SMEs grouped together to tender for a job and a much larger organisation tendered at a much reduced price, would the office even investigate why it could be that cheap?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300015#O00400","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396522800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>That is a good question.

While it was not mentioned in Mr. Watt's opening statement, I understand the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform may be taking the lead in this regard, with the involvement of the NTMA and the Department of Finance.  As I understand it, this is a &euro;6.8 billion fund, previously the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which has been turned into an investment fund and is seeking commercial investments from the private sector.  It is hoped that this &euro;6.8 billion will be matched by a further &euro;6 billion or &euro;7 billion of private money.  It is proposed - this process may already have started - that private equity funds in Dublin and London will seek commercial investments.  That is fair enough.<\/p><p>  I am interested in hearing whether any thought has been given to where this money will be spent, or if this process will be random in terms of the commercial investments arising.  Has any consideration been given to investment in parts of this country that are stagnating?  If, for argument's sake, there is some truth to the idea that there is a slight recovery in Dublin and not in other parts of the country, given that this is potentially the largest stimulus fund this country has ever seen and will see for years, has consideration been given to diverting some of this money, as a critical policy measure, towards those parts of the country that are stagnating and in some cases regressing when it comes to unemployment?  Given the amount of money involved, has any consideration been given to that possibility?<\/p><p>  Mr. Watt referred in his opening statement to past public private partnerships, PPPs.  Many of them were strategic projects targeted around the country for various infrastructural reasons.  At that time there was a different mindset and thought process involved in terms of the targeting of the billions involved to different parts of the country.  I have a suspicion that the &euro;6.8 billion in this case and the money that may come in by way of private sector investments will not be targeted country-wide.

All I am asking Departments to do is consider the figures, as 82% of investment is going to those three urban areas.  We are talking about what could be the only stimulus package this country sees for many years and there is a risk that the areas which have not seen investment in the past ten, 15 or 20 years will be excluded, as everything almost automatically goes to the urban areas.  It is a problem that seeps into social issues in this country, as everything done about the spend of the Exchequer has a bearing on these other issues.  We must think about this before the legislation is published.  It is a basic point.<\/p><p>  There may be another way to come at this.  Is there a way of substituting Exchequer funding?

In the past, when more of the investment was funded by Structural Funds and the European Regional Development Fund, there was a regional element.  There was much more emphasis on the different regions, with the Border, midlands and western region being one and the south and eastern region being another.  With the capital programme there is not necessarily a clear breakdown.  We are doing a review of capital priorities from now until 2020, taking in what we should spend, what should be the priority projects, etc.  Perhaps as part of that we could consider if there is any sense of the regional split of the existing spend, as I do not know off-hand what it would be.  It would vary over years, and some dominant projects may skew figures in a particular direction.  As part of an overall review of capital priorities we could see if there could be more of a regional angle in the next five or six years.<\/p><p>  An important task for us is to ensure public-private partnerships, commercial semi-State and Exchequer investment dovetail with the new fund's investment.

For example, there is the third level sector.<\/p> <p>We know the number of students going through every year and we know how much is being allocated in terms of lecture hours or inputs.  We know the costs to the Exchequer versus what we are getting out of it in terms of pure volume.  There is obviously a quality issue which is a matter for third level.<\/p><p> If one looks at the health system, the pages we have are on the following: the number of people who work in the system; the cost of the system, which has come down; and the increase in activity, where one can see the number of procedures, operations and the number of people who were seen.  Massive increases in productivity have taken place over the last three or four years.  The Minister, Deputy James Reilly, has mentioned this on various occasions at various committees.  We measure whenever we can.  The Deputy can also see the different measures for the Garda, such as the reductions in numbers and the various measures of its performance.<\/p><p> Across the system one can see that we have downsized very dramatically, yet we are providing more services and dealing with more people all the time.  In the social welfare area, since 2008 and 2009 several hundred thousand more people have turned up seeking support, be it income or job support, but there has not been a dramatic increase in that Department's administrative budget or the numbers.  Across the measurement of outputs or outcomes, when one looks at the inputs one can see gains in productivity.  Those gains have been facilitated by necessity, that we just do not have the money, so people have got on with just delivering more even though they do not have more resources.  There are more hours, changes in rosters and changes in work practices.  The changes in the rosters for the Garda, for example, mean there are more garda&iacute; rostered on Thursday, Friday and Saturday when they are needed on the streets compared to the position in the past.  That is an enormous change.  Some figures show there is a 20% to 25% increase in the number of garda&iacute; visible on the streets on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  Changes such as that are having a big impact.  We are working as much we can with colleagues to see how much further we can go.<\/p><p> We challenge the notion that they have been imposed on the system.  Okay, there has been a sense of imposition inasmuch as we have reduced the numbers of people, so those who remain have had to do more.  There have been changes in work rosters, more hours and changes in sick leave, annual leave and so forth.  Ultimately, there were formal negotiations and we ultimately got agreement with the 27 unions through the Haddington Road agreement.  Whether they were imposed or negotiated to a happy conclusion depends on how one looks at these things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300017#Q03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396524600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Mr. Watt mentioned education, health and policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300018#R00200","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396524600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>There is also the local authorities and justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300018#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1396524600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Is there any sector where there have not been productivity gains?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300018#R00400","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396524600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Some sectors are harder to measure than others.

The reason I asked him the question is that on 2 April it produced a document which it gave to each member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have listened to what he had to say and was left with the impression that everything is hunky dory but there is room for change.  As Mr. Watt always says, the section is moving on in a positive direction.  The delegation has talked about this matter.  I feel that I am not going into a policy area because I shall give him its comment on the matter.  The Small Firms Association says &quot;policy is now to effectively prohibit small companies from tendering for public contracts&quot; but the organisation works with the Department on a working group.  It further states that the policy &quot;has the potential to eliminate small business from the tendering process&quot; and one should operate &quot;from a think small first perspective&quot;.  Case examples were also given and one said:<blockquote><br \/>When I tried to contact the person responsible for raising this tender to establish which instruments were included in &quot;measuring instruments&quot; &ndash;  I didn&rsquo;t receive the courtesy of a reply !  <br \/>Our public sector procurement personnel should be much more helpful &amp;amp; co-operative to potential suppliers &ndash; especially small firms. <\/blockquote>Case 5 referred to the most recent Irish Water tender where the company heard about it from a UK source in spite of the fact that it were attempting to get business from the State.  Case 7 referred to attempts to convince the Department to streamline its definition of what it was buying.  A firm stated the following opinion: &quot;I know I am wasting my time trying to compete with this behaviour.&quot;  In that case he is talking about the behaviour.  Case 8 mentioned that one cannot be a tenderer unless one tenders for all of the products listed in the tender.  Case 9 states that companies could not &quot;meet the turnover requirements for larger tenders even though the company has the capability to meet all the requirements of the tender&quot; and they were excluded.  These are relevant cases in terms of what has been said.<br\/>Mr. Quinn gave me the idea that the Department is working directly with all of these organisations and things seem to be working okay but then the SFA highlights all of these cases.  The SFA referred to Irish Water, in particular, regarding a number of issues that simply cause huge problems for the SME sector.  When the SFA attempts to deal with the problem it meets the dead hand of bureaucracy and does not get anywhere.  That situation has been reflected in a number of comments made here.  I am not saying this; the Small Firms Association has said it.  All of this is in direct contrast to what Mr. Quinn described to us at this hearing this morning.  <br\/>I want to raise procurement issues with Mr. Watt.  The SFA has outlined the procurement issues.  Mr. Watt raised the issue of third level institutions.  He also spoke about the cost to the Exchequer and productivity gains in answer to comments made by Deputy Deasy.  What we have seen here, at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts, since we started in 2011, was a continuation of what I consider to be a scandal in terms of governance of various organisations in this country.  One sees the same people on boards and the same chairman or make up in most organisations.  It seems those organisations have not taken any interest in the direction that the Department is going in to improve governance.<br\/>What would Mr. Watt say to a third level organisation that has not changed its auditors or legal services for a dozen years?  What would he say to a third level organisation that spent &euro;21 million on such services in a five-year period?  What would he say to a third level institution that is not fully collecting its student fees?  What would he say to a third level institution that pays thousands to have a painting of its president?  These are issues that are real, they are live and exist.  I was not going to go into this matter this morning but Mr. Watt raised the issue.  Someone is not listening to him and as a result the governance and procurement issues are being ignored.  The message that he is delivering is not being listened to by the organisation that I quoted and by others.  The small firms and their procurement interests are not being looked after because they simply cannot get in as it is a closed shop.  I thought that we were trying to break the <i>status quo<\/i>and give firms an opportunity to do business.  A lot of this has been a waste of taxpayers' money.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300019#S01000","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396525200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I would like to respond, initially.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300019#S01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396525200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I shall just take a second.

Basically what we were saying - which I think is a fact - is we have reduced the cost to the Irish taxpayer.  The subvention that goes to the third level sector is way down and the number of students that they are producing and the number of enrolments have gone way up.  On a basic matric of cost per student, the system has improved productivity by upwards of 20%.  One needs to adjust what that means for the quality of graduates and there might be issues about how that impacts.  That was the general point I was making.<\/p> <p>The Chairman commented on auditors' fees and legal fees of &euro;21 million and talked about our governance.

However, there are lots of complications in the context of the structure of grades, increments, incentive structures and so forth.

We have communicated with Departments about the need to minimise the amount of money that is in accounts.  When it comes to issues from the Exchequer to the Departments, money is only issued when it is needed and it is spent fairly quickly.  However, there is a problem when one goes outside Departments, into agencies and further afield, in terms of cash balances.  We have made it very clear to Departments that this is inefficient, given the opportunity cost of raising funds.  I know that cost is down to 3% now but the last time we debated this issue, it was at 5% or 6%.  That is a cost and it can be significant.  We have made it very clear that it should not happen now.<\/p><p>  We did an analysis of the possibility of moving to a shared services banking system whereby, rather than issuing money from the Central Fund into accounts, we would have a single account and a much more consolidated banking approach.  We looked at that for Government Departments and the in-scope bodies that are close to the centre.  We found that there would not be enormous efficiency or gains because there was not that much money sitting around.  Funds were only in accounts for a day or two.  The Department of Finance is now looking at the potential of consolidated banking outside the core Departments involving, for example, local authorities, State agencies, universities, the HSE and others.  There is the possibility of some solution there which will save money.  The Department is working on that at the moment and doing an analysis of the potential.  In the meantime, we have made it very clear that there should not be cash balances lying around.  If any Department sees evidence of this, it should reduce the grant-in-aid.  It should tell the relevant bodies that it will reduce their grant-in-aid and that they should not look for more money until they have spent the money they already have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014040300021#U01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1396526400,"counter":413,"content":"<p>Has the Department examined the historical tendency for Departments and agencies to do an enormous proportion of their spending during the month of December to keep their budgets up?

In the past, there was an incentive to spend the money or it would be lost.  So, on the capital side, we have moved to a carry-over system whereby we allow Departments to hold off on spending and that adds to their volume of money for the next year.  That has created the right incentives.  Under recent legislation to which I referred earlier, we now have provision for that to happen on the current spending side as well.  That is something that we want to look at.  We will look at envelopes over three years.  If there is unspent money in year one, Departments should be allowed, without reference to the D&aacute;il, to carry that over into the following year, thus creating the right incentives.  However, given that we are still in this very difficult fiscal situation, we need to manage money very carefully every year and meet our budgetary targets so we have not activated that system.  We would like to move to a situation where there is much more carry over between years so that we do not have the spending peaks to which the Deputy has referred.  Our concern is that we do pre-payments and the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned such a pre-payment in one of his reports on the UN money, which is not allowed.  The current system leads to that type of practice, which we do not like.  It can also lead to the spending of money in a way which is not appropriate because of the need to spend.  We are trying to manage the peaks at year end but ultimately we need to get to the multi-annual approach to spending and funding.

All of my questions revolve around the area of procurement and perhaps I should address them to Mr. Quinn, but I will let the Secretary General decide who should respond.<\/p><p>  On the Order of Business today, I raised the issue of the new directive on public procurement which was agreed approximately three months ago.  I am aware the State has yet to bring forward the enabling legislation, but is there a sense of urgency in regard to bringing this forward?  The Department is probably aware that under the current regime, many small and medium-sized enterprises are, essentially, locked out of the procurement process.  The new directive, with its focus on social benefit and on loosening up the regime and making it more comprehensive is welcome.  This committee has received a submission from the Irish School Arts Supply Federation, some of whose members are here in the public gallery.  They are very welcome.<\/p><p>  Having made the general point regarding the directive and the procurement regime, I want to speak now about the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in particular.  The group represented here today is representative of 70 micro businesses.  The group here is in the business of supplying stationery and supplies to schools.  Everybody understands the imperative of efficiency and cost savings and we will take this as a given.  However, under the new regime, these enterprises find themselves in a difficult situation, one that many believe could endanger their existence.

I welcome and note the Deputy's comment on the directives.  We have a team which has been working on them, even prior to its publication a couple of weeks ago.  As the Deputy may be aware,  the directives were largely negotiated under the Irish Presidency.  We are already working on measures, in advance of the lengthy transposition process.  I mentioned earlier that we are working with bodies such as the SFA, ISME, etc., to get their input into a redraft of Circular 10\/10, concerning facilitating SME participation in public procurement, which we should be in a position to accelerate in the next month or two.  This will be helpful for small businesses.<\/p><p>  I am somewhat precluded from discussing the detail of a contract that is currently under way relating to stationery.  The Deputy may be aware that the last iteration of that contract was offered to the market as one contract.  In the current tender process, we have broken that into four lots, as we are trying to break down bigger elements of business.  The smallest of those lots runs to the order of hundreds of thousands of euro rather than millions of euro.  We are trying to enable smaller businesses to compete for those contracts.<\/p> <p>However, there will be a requirement at the micro level for businesses to create consortia and work together to win business from the State.  There is a tension between aggregation value for money at one end, and in terms of inclusion and getting down to micro businesses at the other end.

The difficulty that presents for micro businesses is quite considerable, because that principle carries not just the administrative burden but the primary responsibility on behalf of the group.

Part of that is in respect of potential consortia, but also working with larger suppliers, where they can form part of a supply chain.  In other words, they work with another group bigger than them and feed into that.  We have examples of that in the managed print area, where a number of smaller players have worked with much bigger players to be part of a bid process and a part of the supply chain.

As part of our procurement processes, we always encourage contracting authorities to look at the most economically advantageous tender, and not simply at the lowest price.  There is typically a weighting between the quality of the goods and services and the price at which they are offered.  Depending on whether we are buying IT services or vehicles, the weighting applied between those two may vary because of the nature of the goods and services.  We always encourage and evaluate quality as part of any tender process.  If specific health and safety issues have been raised relative to something that is in train, I would prefer if they were raised separately.  That would be in order, because we are in the middle of a competitive process and I cannot really discuss the details of that here.<\/p><p>  There are standard processes on predatory pricing, which I mentioned earlier in the meeting, which deal with abnormally low tenders.

I would be concerned if that were the only prism through which the office examined a bid.  Someone who knows the industry might consider, for instance, what is charged for a whiteboard and say there is no way the bidder could come in that low.

My career of more than 30 years has been spent in the agriculture and food sector in Ireland, in both the public and private sector.  In many ways it has not been too far from the natural resource base on which the Coillte Teoranta business is based.<\/p><p>  My background will give members a sense of the experience I can bring to Coillte Teoranta.  The core of my career was spent in the Irish dairy industry.  I joined Waterford Co-op, as it was then known in 1987, having spent the six years prior to that with the then Department of Agriculture and Food.  I held a number of senior positions in the co-op, which merged to form the Avonmore Waterford Group in 1997, and I joined the board of that entity in 1998.  In 2001, I became managing director of Glanbia plc.  I stepped down from that position in November 2013.<\/p><p>  I have spent a considerable amount of time in the dairy and food sector based in Ireland.  As members know, 80% of dairy output is exported, so it is a significantly outward-looking industry and business.  In my time in the dairy sector we have been through significant change and reorganisation, which was focused on improving the competitive position of the business and enabling it to compete in international markets and to expand internationally.  Today, more than 70% of Glanbia's earnings come from international operations, and in 2012, in advance of the removal of milk quotas in Europe on 1 April 2015, we restructured the Irish milk processing operation, setting up a new entity, Glanbia Ingredients Ireland, which has now undertaken the largest investment in the history of the Irish dairy industry at Belview in south Kilkenny.  It is almost across the road from the SmartPly plant owned by Coillte Teoranta.<\/p><p>  I am a non-executive director of Glanbia Ingredients Ireland as well as DCC plc, Greencore plc and the Smurfit Kappa Group.  When the Minister asked me if I would take on the role of chairman of Coillte, I saw an organisation that was consistent with my activities during my career - in other words, seeking to create added value from an Irish natural resource base that is sustainable over the longer term.<\/p><p>  Coillte was established 25 years ago as a commercial State company and has been on a journey of change and transition from being a division of a Department and the core Civil Service to a profitable, innovative and customer-focused State company.  At the core of the business is custody of 7% of the land area of Ireland, or approximately 450,000 hectares, close to 1 million acres.  From this stems the core activity of commercial forestry operations, with related activities, based on the location of the land, around wind energy and telecommunications.  The business has revenue of &euro;270 million and directly employs 900 people across the country.  There are approximately 600 in the forest and forestry-related businesses and about 320 in the processing businesses and the panels business, with plants at Clonmel and Belview, south Kilkenny.  There is also significant indirect employment - for example, in timber haulage and harvesting services.  We estimate that the indirect employment amounts to another 1,300 people.  <\/p><p>  The business sits at the upper end of the supply chain of timber to the saw-milling sector in Ireland, and much of that output is destined for export markets.  The timber produced in Ireland, having gone through a processing supply chain, goes to markets across Europe.  The business is also integrated, as members may know, with its own manufacturing and operations producing panel board - medium-density fibreboard at the plant in Clonmel and oriented strand board at the plant in Belview in south Kilkenny.  It is important to recognise that these board mills provide an important market outlet for the first thinnings from Irish forests - that is, the first crop that is harvested in a succession of harvesting operations before the clear fell stage.  More than 90% of the output of those plants is exported to over 30 countries, with Coillte panel products having sales and marketing operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.  These markets for pulp wood are becoming more important because there will be an increased supply of that raw material coming onto the market as the private forestry plantations that have been developed in the main by farmers in the past 20 years start to come to the first thinning stage.  The wood panels are subject to an ongoing market-focused innovation programme, which has impressed me, having had an initial look at it in Coillte, as to how the panels can be adapted and the manufacturing process developed to produce solutions for low-carbon, energy-efficient buildings.  The raw materials from the board mills and the logs from Coillte forests are generated from responsibly managed forests under the sustainability chain certification of the Forest Stewardship Council, FSC, an independent NGO with headquarters in Germany.  This certification is recognised worldwide.  In a world that is correctly focusing on energy and environmental sustainability, Coillte products and practices have never been more relevant.  I know some of the executive team will follow me to discuss the impact of this in terms of land use and so on.<\/p><p>  Apart from the commercial forestry operations and related activities, the Coillte forest estate plays a key role in enabling and supporting other activities across the economy.  These include outdoor recreation, tourism, water protection, community development projects and nature and cultural heritage preservation.  These impacts have been valued at close to &euro;600 million per annum.  They enable a considerable amount of rural development through tourism - for example, the mountain bike trail provided in the Ballyhoura mountains has enabled spin-off rural development initiatives around tourism.  It is important to note that in recent years, visitor numbers to Coillte forests have approached 118 million per annum.<\/p><p>  Building on the history and experience the organisation has accumulated in the 25 years since it was taken from the Department and set up as a commercial State body, the business has now set out a strategy for the next five years of sustainable value from sustainable living.<\/p> <p>At the core of that is maximising the potential of the forest estate and transforming it into products that fit with a low carbon agenda for the future, both in structural terms and in terms of a wide range of applications across the construction and related markets.  It is a question of maximising the effectiveness and efficiency of the key resources of the business, which are forests and land.  In light of the long-term global trends around the environment and energy sustainability, it is clear that the markets for Coillte products, while still focusing on maximising commercial value, can deliver a rise in the enterprise value of the business to the benefit of the State as a shareholder, as well as paying dividends over the next five years.<\/p><p> It is right that the State expects a business performance from Coillte that is on a par with the best in the private sector and that it expects the State assets vested with us - the net asset value of Coillte's balance sheet is approximately &euro;1.3 billion, broadly speaking - to deliver sustainable returns over time.  In light of my own experience of reasonably large organisations, I hope to be able to make a contribution in supporting and challenging the management to drive the business forward.  I think we can maximise the commercial performance without compromising the environmental and social dividend that Coillte delivers to society at large in Ireland.<\/p><p> In summary, the core demand for what we produce - high-quality wood fibre from sustainably managed forests, low carbon building products and renewable energy from wind and biomass - will grow over time.  The very committed team I have met in Coillte can help the company to avail of these opportunities and take the business on over the next stage of its life.  I refer particularly to the next five years, on which the next iteration of the strategic plan is focused.  That concludes my statement.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396516200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moloney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300004#C00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1396516200,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Moloney to this meeting of the joint committee and wish him every success with the important position he is assuming.

He will agree that this is considerably lower than the European average, despite Coillte's best efforts since its inception 25 years ago.  I have always been fascinated by the reasons for our low afforestation rate.  Does Mr. Moloney believe it can be attributed to historical factors?  Would the position be different if a body like Coillte had been in existence from an earlier stage?  What plans, if any, does Mr. Moloney have to try to increase the percentage of forestry in Ireland?  The points he made in his presentation were well made.  He spoke about the need to reduce our carbon footprint, for example.  We all know about the benefits of increased afforestation.  It seems to me that many parts of the country are still available for these purposes.  I wonder whether Coillte has taken its eye off the ball in this regard by focusing on other areas, such as its existing assets.  How does that work?  How can Coillte expand?  It appears that the percentage figure has remained stubbornly at the level I have mentioned for some time.<\/p><p>  Mr. Moloney quite rightly drew attention to the enormous contribution that Coillte forests make to the tourism economy of this country.  I have often wondered why Coillte appears to hide its light under a bushel.  Perhaps this is purely a perception on my part.  While it is impressive that 18 million visits are made to our forests each year, it seems to me that this is an area of potential growth.  I am aware that Coillte links with tourism interests here.  Can it find a way of marketing this asset towards particular markets, just as it markets its other assets nationally and internationally?<\/p><p>  There has been a regular stream of complaints over the years about people dumping waste in Coillte forests.  It might seem like micro-management to bring this up, but it is not helping the tourism industry.

I join other speakers in wishing him well in his tenure as chairperson of Coillte.<\/p><p>  It seems to me that Coillte, as the largest producer of biomass in the country - it is way ahead of every other producer - has been very slow to develop this sector.  A project that is ongoing in England involves the conversion of the largest coal-fired power station in Europe so that it will run solely on biomass.  Apparently, the potential could exist to do the same thing here in the case of Moneypoint.  It seems to me that Coillte is well placed to be the lead agency in looking at how that can be developed for the future.  I read somewhere in recent years that enough offcuts are available from the felling of trees - forestry waste material - to heat every house in the country regardless of the availability of more valuable products.  What does Mr. Moloney intend that Coillte will do over the next couple of years to see how this can be developed?  I understand that North American producers are currently exporting huge volumes of wood chips and pellets into Europe.  I suggest that Coillte should engage in a strategic examination of this possibility.  This work needs to be started very quickly because technology is developing to allow coal-fired stations to be converted.  It seems to me that this is an obvious way for Coillte to go.<\/p><p>  I note that Mr. Moloney is a director of Smurfit Kappa.

I thank Senator Mooney for his comments.  I hope I can live up to them.  The percentage of land in Ireland that has been afforested has improved.  It is greater than 7%.  The figure of 7% relates solely to the Coillte estate.  There has been a significant expansion in private afforestation over the last 20 years.  I cannot give the Senator a precise figure.<\/p> <p>On an issue linked to the question asked by Deputy Ferris, Coillte operates approximately 700 partnerships with farmers in the context of assisting them develop their holdings for forestry and to work with them in maximising their value over time.  The development of the private forestry sector has been positive.  However, it has not grown at the rate or extent it could or should have grown.  There are a variety of reasons for this.  For example, farmers want to expand their land for farming, however poor the land is and the impact of various grant aid schemes on land availability and the need for acreage.  There are also historical reasons, such as we have not had a forestry culture.  We had in the past, but not in recent years, although the position has improved steadily.  Coillte has not expanded to the same rate in the private sector forestry arena because it was largely driven by grant aid and under state aid rules, Coillte was prohibited from participating.  There is nothing wrong with this, once the private sector and farmers are encouraged to see forestry as a viable alternative land use. <\/p><p> In regard to tourism, we have tried to get over the hiding our light under a bushel attitude.  Quite a successful event was held in a well known hostelry across the road from here and public representatives were invited to a presentation on public goods.  This presentation gave a good perspective on what is done to support the generation of public goods that enables tourism.  Coillte manages 2,000 km of marked trails, 150 open sites and 11 forest parks.  There is a net cost to the organisation of doing this, of approximately &euro;4 million a year, but this is part of the dividend that flows back from the business.  The marketing of Coillte is linked to specific regional projects and this probably gives them the best advantage.  Something for Coillte to consider down the road is where there could be a broader open forest marketing designation.  The dumping of waste in forests is not good, but I will leave it to my colleagues to comment on that.  It is difficult to control access over 445,000 ha.<\/p><p> In regard to the question put by Deputy Ferris on the number of people employed, we have 900 people employed, but I cannot say whether that number will be maintained.  The organisation must continue to try to be as efficient as possible.  We maintain a significant asset base and must balance the number employed with an asset base which generates relatively low returns, as is the nature of forestry, over a long period.  The real return from forestry net of inflation is somewhere between 4% and 5%.  Therefore, we need to be very careful regarding the costs involved in managing such a business.  Second, inevitably forestry and forest output is linked to the construction industry cycle.  The business must be managed very prudently to remain efficient.  Therefore, as technology moves on, it is difficult to give commitments.<\/p><p> In terms of indirect activities, it makes sense for Coillte to contract many indirect activities to the private sector, because this activity is dispersed around the country and is linked to harvesting.  As the harvesting of saw log increases over time, there is potential for this activity to grow.  Technology has moved on.  Some 40 years ago or so, harvesting a hectare of forestry would have meant tough, hard, physical labour, but the development of harvesting machines has changed this radically over the past 25 years.  As forest estates mature, there is potential in this area.<\/p><p> In regard to a mineral survey, to the best of my knowledge the answer is we have not carried out such a survey.  As far as I am aware, the mineral rights to land, apart from sand and gravel, are held by the State.  Coillte has looked occasionally at the potential for sand and gravel extraction on the land base, because we maintain a road network of 9,500 km.  Therefore, if we can source some of our own material to support this at first cost, this is a cheaper alternative where we have that land.  The only area that would have been looked at in the past was the location of sand and gravel, particularly with a view to maintaining our road network, which is extensive.  This network is expensive to maintain and is coming under more pressure as we extract heavier loads of timber from it.<\/p><p> On the issue of our relationship with farmers, we have 700 farm partnerships.  I believe there is scope for Coillte to deliver advice to farmers, in partnership with Teagasc and the Forest Service as farmers experience with forestry grows, particularly as they come into the challenging phases of harvesting the first thinnings, maximising the value of the crop.  A good example of this would be the partnership work done in recent weeks between Coillte, Teagasc, the IFA and the Forest Service on managing the effects of the storms of recent months - advising on how farmers can deal with storm damage, clearfelling and how to maximise the value of this.  For many with no experience, the storm damage seems a catastrophe, but Coillte staff have been through this many times and know what to do.  Sharing this advice with farmers has been a good initiative for the organisation.<\/p><p> Deputy Pringle asked about biomass.  To some degree, Coillte has output and thinnings that could go to biomass.  Currently, this material goes to the panel mills.  A study completed a number of years ago indicated that putting first thinnings into the panel mills was a better economic proposition than burning it.  That is not to be disparaging about biomass.  Looking at the situation in Europe, the issue in regard to biomass is that combined heat and power plants using biomass have been driven by grant aid.  Support for that has emerged in the UK in the past number of years and in Austria, in particular, approximately 15% of the thinnings of timber output goes into combined heat and power plants.  This market is driven by grant aid and needs this aid because of the high capital cost of combined heat and power plants to support that kind of raw material and plant set up costs.<\/p><p> Perhaps a programme like the REFIT scheme that applies in the area of wind or renewable heat incentives in Ireland could have a game-changing effect on this market.  Coillte has significant experience on both sides of this.  At the Medite combined heat and power plant in Clonmel, we generate over 40 MW of heat equivalent.  This is probably the biggest plant of its type in the country.  It burns a significant amount of forest waste, sawmill residue and brash, which is the residue after clearfell.  I should point out that brash can be expensive to assemble and bring together in sufficient volume and in a format that can be shredded for use.  However, if we had a network for that, the transport costs could be reduced which means there may be some opportunities for this in the future.  Coillte remains a big buyer of wood chip from sawmills for the panel plants and provides an outlet for that.<\/p><p> I do not believe there is any conflict in regard to Smurfit Kappa, because what we are dealing with there is what is known as product for craft liner from virgin forest.  There is no such paper mill in Ireland.  The nearest one is in France.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300004#C01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396516800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I should remind members that the document we have received is from the chief executive and his fellow directors and that the purpose of this meeting is to hear from the chairman designate his vision for the company.

We cannot wait to see where he will take Coillte.<\/p><p>  I am sure when Mr. Moloney arrived in 2013 and looked at the financial figures, he saw that the see-saw effect from 2009 was astonishing, when it went from a turnover of &euro;206 million to &euro;250 million, and the profit went from &euro;19 million to &euro;44 million, and then recovered slightly.  The see-saw effect was quite alarming, but particularly in the area of profitability.

He certainly has left Glanbia in great order and it is a very professional organisation with which I have dealt quite a bit.  The return to the State from Coillte has been dismal.  I think there was a return of &euro;2 million and then &euro;10 million was added to that when Coillte was under pressure because it might be sold off.  Does Mr. Moloney see that profit or those moneys returning to the State being more reliable and consistent?  Is it his intention to make sure that prime timber goes into logs, as opposed to being sent into lower value products?<\/p><p>  Coillte may have sites that may be wanted for development in the public interest or for job creation.  I am thinking of the likes of Bottlehill, which was sold to Cork County Council for &euro;15 million at the time.  Admittedly that was during the Celtic tiger period, but the taxpayer has to bear the burden of excessive costs for forestry land.  Could there be a fairer pricing structure for these sales?  I know there is a pricing structure in place with the ESB for leeways going through lands with forestry.  Would Mr. Moloney consider changing that structure to a more realistic pricing?  We had a situation a few years ago where an elderly man who was living on land with forestry wanted to get power and he was asked for around &euro;80,000 so that power could be brought to his house.  Situations like that caused a lot of trouble at the time.  Perhaps Mr. Moloney could provide his views on that.<\/p><p>  As a person who uses a wood gasification boiler myself, I am a great advocate of using timber for heating.  Would Mr. Moloney consider promoting the renewable heat incentive schemes, similar to what they have in the UK?  I think one penny per kilowatt hour is supplemented by the British Government.  That could be two cent in this country.  We need Coillte to come on board for this in order to have a continued supply chain.  It is really important at the moment given that 38% of European gas comes from Russia and there is a serious concern about that supply at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300006#E00300","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I will go back to Mr. Moloney before we move on to the next set of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300006#E00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396517400,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Senator O'Neill asked about partnership with farmers.  There are 700 farm partnerships, but since the advent of the private forestry sector, a considerable number of private forestry companies have emerged as well.  Many of them have former employees of Coillte who left the organisation for various reasons.  There is quite a lot of support out there for farmers who want to develop their land for forestry.  The use of land for forestry must be encouraged.  Every individual will make the decision about the use that will maximise the value to him or her in his or her own farming situation, and depending on how constrained they are.<\/p><p>  The development of forestry and wind in upland areas, either in carbon offset or carbon sequestration, is also a significant strategic development as the national herd may expand as the dairy sector expands.  That is a relevant issue to consider in encouraging forestry, as is the use of upland for renewable power generation under wind, something in which Coillte has been involved.  That is part of the land use issues that need to be considered.<\/p><p>  In answer to Senator O'Brien's question on the financial performance, Coillte manages a forest estate, and the net asset value of the business made up of the value of the forest and the land is about &euro;1.3 billion.  Traditionally, the returns to forestry are deemed as reasonably reliable but low, perhaps 4% to 5% after inflation.  In nominal terms, that would be 6% to 6.5%.  The outputs of the business are fairly strongly linked with the fortunes of the construction sector across Europe.  Some change is occurring in refitting housing with better quality, low carbon materials, such as the panel mills and the new investment we propose to make at SmartPly in Kilkenny.  Part of the strategy for Coillte to buffer that volatility has been to use the land resource for other activity such as wind generation, where under the REFIT programme with sites we could develop over time, and which could provide a steady income stream into the future.  We could then create a new product range, particularly in the area of panel mills, that can target niches.  This is one of the big issues around converting and modernising the SmartPly facility in south Kilkenny.  It was designed for an amorphous American market.  It is not designed for a multi-niche, valuable niche European market.  The intention is to transform the plant with a significant capital investment, for which we have received consent, into a business capable of buffering those cycles.  That will not eliminate them, but it can help to improve the financial performance.  The third element is to look at the overall efficiency of the business in terms of the costs of managing the forest estate.  The AGM will not be until next month, but I can inform the committee that the financial performance for last year will be improved on the following year.<\/p><p>  Deputy Barry asked about the return to the State.  It depends on how one looks at the return.  If one looks at it in raw cash terms, Coillte has paid out around &euro;13 million in dividends over the past three or four years, with &euro;2 million the most recent payment.  We have pretty clear evidence, from a number of studies carried out, that the public good aspect of Coillte, in terms of enabling tourism and enabling outdoor activities dispersed across the country, is worth about &euro;600 million to Ireland.  That supports an awful lot of rural communities in developing tourism initiatives.  In terms of a direct cash comparison, we probably have a total cost of maintaining those activities of about &euro;5 million.<\/p> <p>The total cost of maintaining all those activities is approximately &euro;5 million and we recover &euro;1 million from various sources, entrance fees to forest parks and so on, which leaves a net cash cost to the business annually of approximately &euro;4 million, on top of any dividend.  It is our intention, as we continue to improve the business over the next five years and the proportion of saw log we produce tends to rise, that the returns should and will improve, together with the development of several ancillary activities.  We hope to be able to improve the net cash dividend but also to sustain the public good element of the business.  That includes the maintenance and development of other networks supporting tourism  which is driven in particular by the increased conversion of mature saw log from the estate, but that is linked to construction cycles across Europe and the 30 countries in which Coillte trades its product.<\/p><p> Coillte has been involved in buying and selling parts of its land over its 25 year history.  Since 1989 it has acquired 64,000 ha and sold 16,000 ha.  Much of that land was dealt with locally to enable farmers expand their holdings.  Some sites have been converted or sold for wind generation in upland regions.  Whether the market value is appropriate, Coillte has a balance sheet and has to try to protect that.  What is being sought is the market value for whatever the land or issue is.  That is the approach the business must take.<\/p><p> In several European countries, and the UK, in recent years, financial support has emerged for renewable heat.  That is what will drive it, which I think is what Deputy Barry alluded to.  Coillte has an interest in seeing that kind of market develop because potentially it has a raw material supply for that.  Part of that raw material and potential raw material goes to the panel mills and will continue to do so, otherwise there is no point in investing in it today.  We see a market for those products.  Coillte already sells a significant number of cubic metres output into the firewood sector in Ireland.  There is potential to develop that in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396518000,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Moloney.  He has demonstrated great success in his previous role, as everyone is aware.  This is a particularly important position and I genuinely wish him well.  As one who opposed the sale of Coillte and wanted to ensure it remained in State hands, I look forward to hearing Mr. Moloney outline a vision that will achieve that for the benefit of the people.<\/p><p>  The dividend returned to the Exchequer has been disappointing.  It has been as low as &euro;2 million and it has always seemed to be a fight to extract any significant dividend.  I hope that will improve.  Mr. Moloney says there are off-balance sheet dividends in respect of the cultural, heritage and recreational contribution.  Goodbody Stockbrokers has evaluated that at &euro;180 million and &euro;200 million.  It is important if the State is a significant investor that there be a return.<\/p><p>  Relatives of mine worked in forestry between the 1950s and the 1980s.  It employs approximately 900 people and there are approximately 1,800 indirectly employed in haulage and other areas.  The 900 is, however, a declining number.  I would like to see that decline reversed because this is important to the sustainability of rural economies, particularly in areas where the Office of Public Works, OPW, Coillte and local authorities provide work.  Many areas may be left unplanted for a long time.  Why is that so?  It does not have the wherewithal or the people to do it.  We must continue to replant and resow.<\/p><p>  Coillte has existed for 25 years as a semi-State body and commercial organisation.  It now has a five year plan for 6,000 ha.  That is approximately 1,500 ha less than was set out, which was not achieved.  That is my big bugbear.  Mr. Moloney set out objectives for Glanbia for diversification and achieved them all, with the help of his executives and everyone else who worked hard.  That played a pivotal role in the sustainability of rural economies across the south east and further afield.<\/p><p>  Coillte will play a critical role in carbon sequestration and reduction.  What particular incentives does Mr. Moloney feel should be put in place to ensure the promotion and development of biomass as a renewable energy source?  It is important for dealing with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  What can be put in place?  It is also important in promoting sustainability in the rural environment because there is a large quantity of raw material available.<\/p><p>  I am not as taken with wind energy as everyone else is, because I think it is grossly inefficient and ineffective.  I particularly dislike the way it has been imposed on communities without consultation and participation to ensure communities see its benefits.  Coillte has a role in this area but I hope Mr. Moloney will take a holistic view of it, that it should be to the benefit of the community and offer a dividend where possible.  Energy should be provided to hotels, hospitals and community centres.  Let us look after our own before talking about export.  I urge Mr. Moloney to ensure Coillte participates with communities.  There is significant opposition to the way some corporate entities, which have no feeling for communities, imposed plans on communities without proper consultation.  That has led to tremendous antipathy and annoyance and to people doing what they like.  The little man or woman in the house or tig&iacute;n has no say.  Corporations think they can do everything.  I hope Coillte will not join their paternalistic chorus that they know best.  I look forward to Mr. Moloney&rsquo;s leadership ensuring it does not.  Coillte can play a positive role in wind energy but it is not the be all and the end all.  It could make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability through biomass and other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300007#F00200","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1396518000,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Moloney and wish him the best of luck.  I agree with him that a dividend is more than cash.  The dividend for tourism and related recreational activities has been relatively small.  It is important and expanding and many local managers in Coillte do a lot of work in this area.  Does Mr. Moloney think there is a problem in the way the dividend is calculated because the legislation provides that Coillte should pay a cash dividend but if it spends money on the development of tourism related activities and resources, that will not generate a huge income for Coillte but will generate one for the locality, whether the Cratloe hills over Limerick or the Wicklow hills?  Does that need to be examined or has Mr. Moloney considered whether there might be an expansion of the tourism and recreation related activities?<\/p> <p>The dividend of employment generally from the forestry sector in Ireland is pitifully small compared with other EU member states, given the amount of forestry in the country.  There seems to be a much larger timber industry and forestry sector in other countries.  Perhaps Mr. Moloney wishes to comment on this aspect.  Forest management is a much more advanced craft - perhaps I should describe it as a skill or occupation - in countries such as Austria, which Mr. Moloney mentioned in the context of biomass.<\/p><p> Moving on to biomass Mr. Moloney stated there was a perception in Coillte that better value could be obtained in using those first thinnings in the manufacture of boards in the Medite plants, for example, than in burning it.  I have no doubt that is true if Mr. Moloney says so and it would seem logical.  Can Coillte absorb all the first thinnings into the Medite plants or is there a surplus?  One of the difficulties has been supply contracts.  Mr. Moloney is correct in pointing out that the financial incentives are probably not sufficient in this country to set up biomass plants, given the capital start-up costs.  Beyond that there is a difficulty in securing supply.  We had a discussion about securing supply and Coillte seeks to maximise the cash payment it gets for any crop on any given day so it will not want to tie itself up in long-term contracts.  Anyone setting up or wishing to invest in a biomass plant will want security of supply for a number of years at least.  Might Coillte be in a position to consider this, assuming that there is any surplus supply of thinnings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300007#F00300","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396518600,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I wish to make some points although I am conscious of time constraints.  Mr. Moloney was previously chief executive of Glanbia, a private entity which he developed and which worked with suppliers who were private farmers.

Deputy Barry referred to taxpayers' money buying off taxpayers' money.  Coillte is a commercial semi-State company which is also involved in research and product development which is probably on par or ahead of some countries with more developed forestry.  I refer to the added value of the recreational use of forests.  If that is &euro;4 million net cost to Coillte, I think it should be counted in the dividend and more should be allowed for further development.

It follows on from the Chairman's contribution.  I refer to the vision thing.  My view is that we are spectacularly under-performing in terms of the potential for forestry, notwithstanding that forestry makes a significant contribution both economically and in employment terms.  We are massively under-performing in all sorts of areas such as in the potential for employment and particularly in afforestation.  We are nowhere near the European average, despite the fact we have the capacity to grow trees faster than anywhere else.  We cannot meet those targets and this is urgent for all sorts of reasons such as economic and environmental reasons and reasons associated with climate change.  Climate change was highlighted in the recent UN report.  It seems to me that forests are an answer to a lot of the problems but we have absolutely failed.  If we are to succeed, Coillte has to play a central part.  How does Mr. Moloney see us changing things so that Coillte can play its part in that delivery?  What would he say to me and others who are deeply concerned that there is a problem in Coillte about its identity and focus?

A number of speakers asked about whether the return to the Exchequer is in the form of cash, employment or the public good.  I would like to reach an understanding with the shareholder about what is possible from Coillte.  It is a business that is relatively low-returning in terms of a return on asset business.  One could say it is asset rich and cash poor to a level.  That is one of the challenges in saying that X amount of cash is required when the business has a statutory obligation to replant every site harvested, even though some of it might be sub-optimal from a commercial forestry point of view.  It may be a case of modification to a lower stocking rate.<\/p> <p>We must have a clear understanding with the shareholder about what is required and what is possible from Coillte in terms of a dividend.  I refer to \"dividend\" in the widest possible sense of the word - in terms of cash, public good and supporting other areas from our asset base.<\/p><p> In regard to employment, there are 900 people employed directly in the business and there is very little Coillte area left unplanted.  This comes back to the common thread that it is a matter for individual landowners as to what use they put their lands to; that is a decision for them.  Clearly, we would be supportive of people planting because we have a vested interest in processing.  We take our replant obligation seriously.  In terms of employment potential, I referred only to the 900 employed directly in Coillte and the 1,300 or so indirectly providing services.  However, there are a further 15,000 to 20,000 jobs in the downstream sawmill and related timber-processing businesses, for which we provide a significant proportion of the raw material.  The continuation of that provision into the future is very important.<\/p><p> I do not have a view today about what type of incentive for biomass should be pursued.  It seems to me that what has been introduced in the United Kingdom in the past two years has already achieved significant traction in terms of converting to biomass usage.<\/p><p> Deputy McNamara is correct that there is a surplus over what is required in the panel mills.  The question of whether Coillte should sign up for exclusive supply agreements is one that will have to be reflected on given the volume of timber Coillte has.  In the first instance, such agreements could only be for volume because the market price will evolve over time, but it is possible to work out mechanisms in that regard.  Practically, there is a surplus over what is required in the panel mills; theoretically, one could engage in long-term supply contracts, with price being adjusted on an annual basis based on where the market is.  I have responded to the Deputy's point about the dividend in the broader sense.  It is important that we have a shared understanding about what the dividend from Coillte means as we move forward.<\/p><p> The Chairman is correct that we control a significant part of the forest asset and a significant part, in a concentrated business, of the available sawlog going into the future.  It is important that this is delivered to the downstream processing industry, which has also become more concentrated.  In fact, five purchasers account for 84% of sales from the organisation.  That is a fact of life and it has enabled those purchasers to compete internationally.  Again, it goes back to the need to have a definition of the Coillte dividend and what is deliverable across all of the facets.<\/p><p> In response to the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett, the reality is that underperformance in forestry is a national issue.  Coillte has a block of land of some 445,000 ha which it is tasked with managing.  In addition, there is a whole private sector element which has evolved and developed to the extent that individual landowners have taken a decision that for their type of land and their location, forestry is a good development.  That is to be encouraged.  We have not been able to partake in much of that development because we were prevented, under state aid rules, from accessing the grant aid that has driven this forest establishment.  Nevertheless, the business is absolutely supportive of providing advice and support - I responded to a question about this just before the Deputy arrived - by, for example, supporting Teagasc and the forest service and helping farmers to assess how to deal with the wind blow from the recent storms.  It can seem like a disaster to a new forest owner when that type of blow-down happens, but it can be managed.  Coillte staff have been very much involved in that effort.<\/p><p> In terms of our long-term focus, there is almost an advocation that we should get into buying land.  My view, however, is that Coillte cannot compete against other land users.  We are an advocate of forestry as a viable land-use option for lands of a particular type.  In all of this, the trade-off is cash, but we have to replant and recycle capital in the business.  When a hectare is cut down, it costs money to put back 2,500 plants.  That capital is being recycled in the business on an ongoing basis.  It is why cash throw-off in the business is relatively modest.<\/p><p>In regard to species mix, Sitka spruce is the predominant commercial species in Ireland, but there have been developments, particularly on the margins of plantations, in regard to other species, which is helping to take the amorphous look off it.  That is to be encouraged.<\/p><p> There was reference to the Irish Forestry Union Trust, IFUT.  As I understand it, Coillte did hold a couple of units in that some years ago, but not at this time.  IFUT was about a bringing together of a number of Irish pension funds, and Coillte put in some 10,000 ha over 25 years to be run for one harvest cycle.  Coillte retained the land and provided management services and, in most instances, sold the timber on behalf of the pension funds involved.  At this stage, some 10% of the forestry rights connected to those lands have come back to Coillte, with the remainder to revert in the future.  I am not against our involvement in Irish pension funds; it is a legitimate way for Coillte to bring cash into the system under a process whereby it retains the land, sells small quantities of the rights from year to year, manages the land on behalf of the pension funds and facilitates them to sell the timber.  Essentially, all the funds are really doing is investing to get the final clear fell, with the rights then reverting back to Coillte.  This is helpful in terms of managing the business's cash and the return in the business over time, versus waiting 40 years for it.  That is one of the benefits this strategy can bring, as well as supporting a stable, long-term, Irish-owned pension asset within the State.  It is not a bad idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300008#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396519200,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moloney for his engagement with the committee.

Coillte is the largest landowner in Ireland, with an estate extending to some 445,000 ha or 7% of the land area of the country.  We have a presence in every county and we employ over 900 people directly.  Our log supply is the lifeblood of the Irish forest products sector, which supports 12,000 jobs mainly in rural locations.  We export our forest products to over 32 countries worldwide.  We are at the heart of Ireland's drive to deliver 40% of electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2020.  We provide valuable public good benefits to the people of Ireland, ranging from recreational facilities to landscape protection to nature conservation.<\/p><p>  Our understanding is that the committee is considering how to optimise the potential of Ireland's land, particularly in the context of achieving the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.  The overall vision relating to this is to act smart, think green and achieve growth.  One of the key challenges set by Food Harvest 2020 is how to achieve the targets envisaged in respect of growth - for example, an increase in the value of primary agricultural output of &euro;1.5 billion by 2020 - while also delivering on Ireland's environmental commitments, such as a reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions.  We are of the view that Coillte's land bank can play an important role in squaring this circle.<\/p><p>  Our natural resource assets and skillsets can be deployed to support the objectives of Government with regard to Food Harvest 2020 and to underpin other key policy objectives in a number of ways.  In the first instance, our forest asset can deliver a range of benefits for Ireland including increased carbon sequestration from the trees we grow; low-carbon energy-efficient building products from a vibrant sawmill and panel products sector; and by enabling the development of a highly efficient supply chain from forest plants to harvesting to routes to market in order to encourage more afforestation by landowners.  In addition, our land is ideally placed to support the roll-out of the Government's renewable energy agenda, which, in itself, will contribute strongly to lowering our greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.  Coillte has substantial wind energy potential and a pipeline capable of producing 500 MW will be constructed in the envisaged timeframe.  We will facilitate the build-out, by third party developers, of significant additional wind energy capacity in the coming years through the provision of lands, rights of way over access routes or way-leaves.  We are also working to enable the growth of a high-efficiency bioenergy sector in Ireland.  To this end, we recently made a strong case to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in respect of the introduction of a renewable heat incentive.<\/p><p>  I will now hand over to Mr. Gerard Murphy, the managing director of our forest business, who will expand on the benefits which our forest asset can deliver for Ireland.  Mr. Mark Foley, managing director of our enterprise business, will then provide more detail on the renewable energy benefits we can contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Britchfield"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396519800,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I wish to take the committee through the activities of the forest division of Coillte and its role in helping to achieve the objectives relating to Food Harvest 2020, particularly in respect of climate adaptation, carbon mitigation measures and biodiversity.  The forest division is responsible for the management, protection and stewardship of the State's forests, a resource which is very important in helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.  This assertion is underpinned by a national forest inventory statistic which shows that the Coillte estate has a stock of over 200 million tonnes of carbon locked in its forests and soils.  In the context of the 445,000 ha it manages, the division carries out a wide range of activities from planting, tending and protecting the company's crops to forest road building, the harvesting and sale of roundwood and providing public goods.<\/p><p>  I have included a number of statistics in slide No. 4 to illustrate the scale of our operations and the importance of what we do in supporting the wider forest industry and rural development.  The lands for which Coillte is responsible represent over 7% of Ireland's landmass and the company sells almost 2.5 million cum of roundwood to a diverse range of industrial users.  This accounts for approximately 80% of the total roundwood available in the market.  Each year we plant approximately 6,000 ha of forests with 15 million trees.  We maintain 9,500 km of forest roads and trails, building a further 100 km of new roads each year.  In total, we reinvest over &euro;30 million into our forests every year in the context of replanting and tending trees and building roads.  Some 18 million recreational visits are made to our forests annually.  A total of 20% of our estate is managed primarily for the purposes of biodiversity.  Our sustainability credentials are certified by the international and independent Forest Stewardship Council, FSC, which is very important in the context of accessing international markets for the industry's finished products.  This year, we hope to be endorsed by the programme for endorsement for forest certification, the PEFC standard, and to have our environmental management systems certified to ISO 14000 standard.<\/p><p>  Coillte has a presence in every county in Ireland and is a very important contributor to rural development.  The forest division alone employs over 450 staff and engages approximately 460 contractors who, in turn, employ over 1,300 people.  The division is organised into regional units - business area units, BAUs - in order that decision making is decentralised as much as possible.  We developed a new strategy for the division last year and our ambition is to become recognised internationally as a leading sustainable and commercially successful organisation - delivering roundwood and public goods in a manner that will be highly valued by the shareholder, our customers and our stakeholders - in the next five years.  There are five central themes to our strategy and these are very closely aligned to the Food Harvest 2020 themes of acting smart, thinking green and achieving growth.  These themes include being more efficient, investing in our people and systems and ensuring we are competitive on a sustainable basis.  We are aiming to be smarter in what we do in the context of improving the performance of our estate, mainly through optimising the use of our estate through a flexible set of silvicultural regimes and plant material, improving the productivity of our estate and aligning all our compliance and certification requirements.  We provide significant public goods to society.  Our strategy is to seek recognition for these goods and thereby ensure that the value of the forest estate will be recognised in a more substantial manner.<\/p><p>  We want to unlock the considerable value of the private forest estate through supporting the mobilisation of the private supply which is due to become available during the next ten years.  I will elaborate on this strategy, particularly in terms of how it supports and assists in the development of the carbon stock in our estate.<\/p> <p>The mitigation benefits of forests as a carbon resource and a sink for carbon sequestration is well documented but also forests can provide a role in offsetting the negative impacts of climate change such as reducing flood risks.  We have seen that in the recent months with the level of flooding that has occurred here.  I have identified four areas of Coillte forests that can support the State's policy on carbon mitigation and sequestration.  It is well documented that establishing forests increases the capacity of carbon sequestration.  For example, for every hectare planted three to 15 tonnes of CO2 per annum is removed from the atmosphere but, obviously, that depends on the soil, the species and the age of the crop.  We plant 5,500 to 6,000 hectares annually under our reforestation programme which ensures that the carbon pools locked in our estate are maintained and enhanced.  We also support the national afforestation programme, which is driven through incentive schemes, to encourage farmers to plant their lands by providing specialist management services, markets for their thinnings, advice and access to our road network.  The latest wind blow is an example of where we have worked very closely with local forest landowners to deal with the aftermath of the storm.  We also have more than 700 farm partnerships in managing approximately 12,000 hectares of forests.  <\/p><p> Another area that is very important in increasing carbon sequestration, especially as land becomes more difficult to source for forestry, is to increase the productivity of the existing forest estate.  This can be achieved by utilising the right species and using properly adapted forest reproductive material.  We have found that improved material of the right provenance can improve growth productivity of the estate by 20%.  There is a direct correlation between forest productivity and increased carbon sequestration.  Coillte has an advanced tree improvement programme for our major species that have been developed over 25 years as well as maintaining a range of seed orchards, the seeds of which are available for the wider industry.  I believe there is significant uplift potential in the productivity of both the private and public estate through the proper use of the right forest reproductive material.  Another way of increasing forests productivity, as well as the benefits of replacing fossil fuels, is to investigate the possibility of using fast growing forest energy crops.  We have hundreds of hectares of trials in eucalyptus and other species which produce significant yields of wood in short rotations.  We are investigating whether they are adaptable to Irish conditions.  <\/p><p> To ensure that forests capture carbon on a net basis, it is also crucial that there are sustainable supply chains developed across the industry.  Having a strong chain of custody in independent schemes like SFC or PFC gives the confidence that forests are being managed on a sustainable basis.  Over the last ten years we have also supported the development of a viable contractor base in harvesting and haulage and work to ensure that proper training regimes are in place, especially in health and safety.  Training in harvesting and haulage will remain a key challenge for the sector over the next number of years.  We are also developing supply chains for energy wood that replaces fossil fuels and my colleague, Mr. Mark Foley, will expand on this later.  <\/p><p> The final pillar of carbon mitigation is in the use of low carbon building products.  Wood after harvesting continues to lock in carbon, as is the case with sawn wood produced by our sawmill customers or panel boards produced by our Coillte panel board mills.  The increasing demand for energy efficient construction is driven by carbon mitigation measures such as the EU directive on energy performance in buildings.  We believe concepts such as zero carbon construction in reducing carbon emissions are driving significant change in the market.  This concept seeks to have a yearly net carbon footprint of zero and is achieved, first, by reducing the energy consumption needed in buildings and, second, utilising materials with low carbon emissions related to the manufacturing process.  The OSB and MDF products that we produce contribute very favourably to this type of construction due to their use in highly thermal efficient off-site construction systems and through the carbon locked in the material.<\/p><p> I would like to conclude by showing how the forest estate further contributes to the \"thinking green\" theme of Food Harvest 2020 in the area of public goods.  While more than 25% of our forest estate has statutory environmental designations, nearly 40% of our estate is managed with some form of environmental designation.  We manage and protect these areas using an environmental management system which we proactively develop and improve.  However, our strategy is to be even more proactive and to create a greater awareness of the type of public goods we provide and to seek recognition for them.  In association with the Heritage Council, we commissioned an independent study to quantify the economic value of biodiversity, cultural heritage and landscape protection.  The study, which has just been published, calculated that the value of these public goods was more than &euro;500 million.  A previous study on forest recreation showed a direct value contribution of &euro;97 million and a further &euro;270 million generated to the local community in terms of visits to the forests.   <\/p><p> Our policy is to work with local communities and local authorities in developing these facilities.  A number of significant examples in this area on which we have worked include the Ballyhoura Mountain trial bikes, Lough Key forest park, the Dublin Mountains Partnership, Wild Nephin and the Cavan Burren Park.  Another good example of biodiversity work, which has strong links into the area of carbon sequestration, is the work we have been doing in restoring bogs under an EU Life funded project.  More than 5,000 hectares are being restored back to their original state of bogs.  We believe there is a need to develop innovative means of recognising the value of these initiatives in order to use the potential of these public goods to further drive rural development.<\/p><p> In conclusion, we believe that forestry and Coillte's key role in the sector provide important contributions to the national agenda on climate adaptation.  We continue to be committed to playing a constructive part in national policy.  I will hand over to Mr. Mark Foley who will take the members through other contributions we make in reducing our carbon footprint, particularly in the area of renewable energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396520400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I am responsible for the division of Coillte which seeks to create additional value in terms of the land under our management where forestry is not the primary use.  This is primarily in areas such as wind energy, biomass, providing land for infrastructure projects and other land uses as well as telecommunications mast sites.  Slide 10 shows a map of Ireland and members will note that Coillte's 6,000 plus discrete properties reach far and wide into the heart of rural Ireland.  Attributes such as location, local geography, topography and elevation combine to make Coillte's land assets highly desirable for a wide range of end applications.<\/p><p>  Turning to renewable energy, particularly wind energy,  it is not widely known that Coillte has been a key player in the development of Ireland's renewable ambition since the pioneers of this vibrant sector unfolded a new vision for sustainable green energy in Ireland as far back as 20 years ago.  Before I talk about Coillte's portfolio and our five-year strategy, I will remind members why renewables are so important to Ireland, a peripheral country on the western tip of Europe with very limited natural resources.  There are four reasons renewables are important.  First, the 2009 renewables directive from the EU sets out a very clear and unambiguous ambition for Europe to achieve legally binding targets for 2020 and that European ambition cascades into very specific targets for individual countries including Ireland.  We have three targets.  Our targets for electricity from renewable sources is 40%, the target for heat is 12% and the target for transport is 10%.  I will deal with the first two in my presentation, which are relevant to Coillte.<\/p><p>  The second reason renewables are important is our excessive dependence on imported fossil fuels which today still exceeds 90% of all energy needs.  I do not need to spell out to the committee what this means in terms of the risk to Ireland from both the perspective of security of supply and that of the cost of energy.  The third reason is climate change.  The members no doubt will have read that the International Panel on Climate Change reported again this week with a very clear statement that \"It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming of the planet since the mid-20th century\".  Therefore, arguably, the preservation of our planet and the stewardship of our natural resources may very well be the greatest issue facing mankind in the 21st century.  The final reason renewable energy is important is economics.  The Redpoint study for IWEA and, more recently, the Poyry study, The Value of Wind Energy to Ireland, which was produced within the last two weeks, confirms that the increased deployment of wind energy does two things - it reduces the wholesale cost of electricity and, crucially, it stimulates employment.<\/p> <p>I will move on to slide 12.  I have included on this slide a screen shot from EirGrid's website at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 March.  Members will see that renewables accounted for 20.6% of all energy generated in the preceding 24 hours.  That is a very good story for Ireland.  Coillte has enabled 40% of current installed generation capacity, 2,000 MW of renewables, which blows on the grid today.  The way we have done that is by selling upland sites to wind farm developers to facilitate the construction of new generating plant.  We facilitated access to sites for construction and maintenance through the provision of rights of way across our lands.  We have provided way-leaves for developers and we have supported the ESB, as the distribution system operator, and EirGrid to connect wind farms and build grid capacity.  We have completed in excess of 80 transactions in this sector in the past 15 years and the revenue from this activity has enabled Coillte to fund the development phase of our own portfolio of projects.<\/p><p> One could ask what is Coillte&rsquo;s role as we look to Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to 2020 and beyond.  First, we intend to capture more of the value in this particular sector for our shareholder by developing and operating some of our own projects, including partnerships with strong companies such as the ESB and SSE plc, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy plc.  Coillte&rsquo;s development portfolio comprises nine projects across seven counties in Ireland with the potential to generate more than 500 MW of operating capacity.  Developing the projects will provide Coillte with secure REFIT-backed income streams for the next 15 years, helping to balance our income profile which is currently over-dependent on the construction sector.<\/p><p> The second point in terms of Coillte&rsquo;s role is that we will continue to be one of the largest suppliers of land to the sector in the form of high-quality sites, rights of way and way-leaves enabling the industry to deliver the necessary electricity generation and grid capacity to allow Ireland to reach its 2020 targets.  In that regard the next four years are absolutely vital as the REFIT incentive ceases at the end of 2017.<\/p><p> The third role for Coillte is that it is committed to open and transparent presentation of all facts and the best scientific data relating to its wind farm developments.  We believe that early engagement with communities is absolutely essential.  We believe that communities have a right to be heard and that an appropriate form of community benefit provision should be an integral part of all development projects.<\/p><p> Fourth, much has been spoken about the potential for a major export project whereby renewable energy from land-based wind farms in Ireland &ndash; the midlands in particular &ndash; would be deployed to provide green energy to the UK.  We believe such a project merits deep consideration as it offers the potential for very significant investment in the indigenous economy with the attendant benefits in terms of job creation, economic activity and returns to the Exchequer.  We are mindful of Government policy in respect of this particular area.<\/p><p> We believe that Ireland has a unique and exceptional opportunity to drive the renewables ambition to best-in-class levels giving real leadership in this space in Europe, maximising our potential for what is a free, natural resource and helping to mitigate CO2 emissions in other sectors of the economy.  Today, we are talking about the potential benefits we could achieve in mitigating the effects of agriculture.  Our provisional estimate suggests that 1,300 MW of newly installed wind generation capacity has the potential to mitigate a substantial proportion of the incremental emissions arising from the projected increase in the national herd between now and 2020 as part of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  In that regard, we would welcome a new gate process which prioritises projects of scale and with low planning risk which are capable of being delivered in the medium term for the benefits of Ireland Inc.<\/p><p> I will move on to slide 14 and talk about biomass, in particular small diameter round wood which originates from Ireland&rsquo;s forests and how it can contribute to the development of a vibrant and competitive manufacturing sector which generates its process heat requirements from a renewable feedstock rather than fossil fuels.  In that regard, I will turn to the Government White Paper on energy policy which sets a target of 12% of thermal energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.  The renewable heat sector, however, remains largely underdeveloped having grown very slowly to 5.2% in 2012, mainly as a result of wood waste utilised in the timber processing sector.  Based on our current renewable electricity standard &ndash; heating, RES-H, trajectory, Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target will prove very difficult to achieve.<\/p><p> We believe that the introduction of a renewable heat incentive, RHI, is now essential.  An RHI is a payment system for the generation of heat from renewable energy sources similar to the REFIT scheme for electricity.  Generators of renewable heat are paid an agreed rate per kilowatt hour for hot water or steam which they generate and use themselves.  The payment is for an agreed period and index linked.  We believe such a scheme would be self-funding from an Exchequer perspective.  The scheme was introduced in the UK in 2011 and has resulted in more than 611 MW of installed thermal capacity spread over nearly 3,000 accredited biomass installations.  The source of the data is the Department of Energy &amp;amp; Climate Change, DECC, in the UK.  The resulting benefits have been recycled through the UK national economy, stimulating economic activity, creating new jobs in engineering, design, installation and maintenance of biomass boilers themselves and through the associated operations such as logistics required to process and supply the local biomass.<\/p><p> There is now an imperative for Irish industry to adopt green energy solutions.  However, project economics for large-scale renewable heat investments are proving very challenging.  The relatively high costs of biomass boiler technology present a significant barrier.  An RHI would offset the higher capital investment required, thereby improving project economics and encouraging the wider deployment of biomass renewable energy technologies.  The benefits are very clear.  First, a reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on fossil fuels, a reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions and improving domestic fuel security.  Second, improving and strengthening the competitiveness of Irish industry by minimising carbon taxes, replacing fuel costs and protecting against fossil fuel price volatility.  Third, stimulating rural development and local job creation because it is a labour-intensive business and is very much rooted in the local community; providing a vital outlet for our growing private timber resource which will come to market in the next decade, giving it a market and a channel for growers of short-rotation energy crops; and reducing the future level of EU fines which may manifest in a situation where 2020 targets are not met.  The final point relates to helping offset emissions in other sectors such as agriculture.<\/p><p> Coillte is underpinning the future energy supply of one of Ireland&rsquo;s leading pharmaceutical plants.  It is biomass in action in the real world.  This is our flagship case study.  Having secured a five-year biomass fuel supply agreement with Astellis Ireland Limited in Killorglin, County Kerry, we now supply the plant with all of its biomass renewable energy requirements and have done so for the past 28 months.  We are successfully delivering both security of supply and lower energy costs to a world-class company.  Astellis is one of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies in the world and employs 1,600 people globally.  It operates a modern finishing facility in Kerry where it manufactures organ rejection drugs.<\/p><p> I will now turn to land generally and how Coillte has responded to the needs of customers and stakeholders alike through the deployment of our land asset for a wide range of end uses.  Coillte has a long and proud tradition of adding value to our land asset, thus ensuring that additional value is captured for the shareholder over and above that which our forestry activities generate.  Members will see from slide 19 that value creation is not just restricted to a Coillte context but of equal importance is the value we have brought to a range of sectors, customers and communities in the past decade.  I will refer to some of those sectors.  In terms of infrastructure, where our primary customer base has been State-owned local authorities, Coillte&rsquo;s land asset has helped unlock solutions to key infrastructure provision including water schemes, the construction of new roads and motorways, county road upgrades and various utility schemes.  Activity in this sector has been low since 2008 due to the recession.  However, we are very pleased to see activity recommencing in both County Donegal and County Galway as key county roads are being prioritised for improvement in 2014.<\/p><p> In terms of development, our activities have extended across many aspects of the sector.<\/p> <p>Irish Distillers' soon-to-be-commissioned state-of-the-art facility for the maturing of its branded Irish whiskey products near Midleton, County Cork, is a prime example.  These lands for this signature development were sold by Coillte to Irish Distillers Limited in 2012 and we are proud to be associated with such a successful export brand for Ireland.  Clearly, this market sector was buoyant pre-2009 but there are still occasional once-off transactions in this sector of which Irish Distillers Limited is a case in point.  Since the onset of the recession, activity in aggregate in residential property has been limited.  However, Coillte continues to support local communities in the form of land for sports and community facilities, such as the example illustrated in the slide on display, where Coillte provided allowance for Emo GAA club in County Laois.<\/p><p> Turning to agriculture, Coillte is mindful of Ireland's ambition, as articulated in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, and we have seen significant activity and strong pricing in this sector in recent years.  Our activities, in the main, relate to small to medium-scale transactions with farmers who seek to increase their holdings and thus increase their own output, typically by acquiring adjoining lands from Coillte.  Last year, approximately 85% of all land transactions were in the agricultural sector.  Coillte also plays an important role in connecting communities through the deployment of its land asset in support of telecommunications infrastructure across the length and breadth of Ireland.  Coillte has a portfolio of 429 telecommunications towers on its lands, of which 116 are owned directly by the company.  These new structures were built by Coillte to support 3 Ireland's requirements to deliver the national broadband scheme between 2009 and 2012.  The remaining sites are leased in the main to the major telecommunications operators.  I have no doubt but that Coillte's land assets have and will play a key role in realising Ireland's ambition to ensure that rural Ireland is not disadvantaged in securing high-performance broadband connectivity into the future.  I will conclude by drawing members' attention to a recent innovation whereby Coillte joined forces with a company called OCMS Ireland to market Coillte's estate as a prime location for film and television ventures, both home-based and, in particular, the big budget US productions.

By deploying our natural resources and our skills sets, we can deliver increased carbon sequestration from our forests, low-carbon energy-efficient building products, confidence for those landowners who wish to plant new land that an efficient supply chain is in place and renewable energy from wind and biomass, each of which will contribute to reducing Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, thereby providing headroom for growth in agricultural output to meet the Government's Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We have left members with a number of recommendations we believe could enhance further our ability to contribute, including a renewable heat incentive to encourage the growth of bioenergy, a clear signal of the Government's ambition for wind energy post-2020 and recognition for the provision of valuable public goods.  We hope the joint committee has found our submission to be useful and we will be happy to take any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300013#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Britchfield"},{"type":"speech","time":1396521600,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from Coillte for their highly informative presentation.  I am delighted Coillte has put so much stock into its renewable incentive scheme, to which I will turn in a minute.  If possible, it would be nice to have sight of Coillte's submission, which is a subject on which I have lobbied the Government extensively.  While I believe the future lies there, it is not without its problems.  Before returning to this issue, I have a few other questions.  First, have the recent storms caused much damage to Coillte's crop?  On a small albeit highly relevant housekeeping issue, I farm a lot of land close to Coillte properties and the quantities of wild deer and wild horses are becoming an absolute nightmare.  They are damaging produce and are very difficult to remove.  Has Coillte a policy to deal with this problem?  I ask because with these creatures coming out onto the roads on a regular basis, it will eventually become a public hazard.  Do the witnesses have any comment to make on the early plantations from 1995 onwards?  Many people, including myself, planted forestry back then and quite simply, we planted for the grant.  We did not have the skills of forestry management we should have had and, in hindsight, many of us are disappointed that we did not choose better in respect of tree type.  Is there a mechanism whereby this could be considered in the future or does Coillte have ideas in this regard?<\/p><p>  As for wind energy, I am not being negative here because I agree with the witnesses that it has great potential and there certainly are highly positive arguments for it.  However, I have attended many anti-pylon, anti-transmission line or you-name-it meetings and as the witnesses are aware, certain people hold very strong feelings and have fears in this regard.  They do not like wind turbines or transmission cables.  Some people make the point that they do not want them, either underground or overground.  In fairness to such people, they attend such meetings, where they make highly valid arguments.  The problem I perceive is that people such as the representatives from Coillte do not attend such meetings, although they should.  They should be giving the counterargument because the public is there to be informed and eventually people will make their own decision.  I believe that when they become aggressive, people are losing the argument.  I have been attacked physically at these meetings and it is just unbelievable.  However, if Coillte intends to make this a major part of its policy, it must attend such meetings and must begin to disseminate the facts because eventually, that is what people will deal with.<\/p><p>  On climate change, while everyone has heard about it, most people are not too bothered.  They might see a television programme and so on but when getting on with their general daily lives, they do not worry about climate change.  They worry about how to pay the bills.  I hear people talking about production and recently, one heard that wheat production would fall and no one would have enough wheat for their bread and so on.  The facts and the reality in Ireland is that last year, the price of one tonne of wheat fell by &euro;80.  That is what it meant to be a wheat farmer in Ireland.  Cereal farmers were almost forced out of existence until the crisis in Ukraine arose and introduced instability, thereby leading to the price of wheat rising by &euro;15 per tonne.  It is terrible to believe that one's existence is based on some other country having a crisis.  However, in respect of climate change, the world still is producing plenty of food and until I see differently and the price increases, that argument will still be there.<\/p><p>  On infrastructure, many of the arguments put forward by those who oppose pylons are based on their perception that all these developments are for the benefit of developers collecting money.  They argue they receive no benefits themselves from it.  As for wood gasification, I bought a wood gasification boiler a few years ago.  I apologise to the Chairman but I will be finished in a minute.  Of the wood gasification boilers brought in through the SEAI scheme a number of years ago under which one received &euro;2,000 in grant aid, only 30% of them still are in use.  The rest of them have been scrapped and that scheme has been closed.  The reason that scheme is finished is because there was complete exploitation of people buying boilers.  No expertise was available to fit them properly or maintain them.  I eventually bought a 75 kW boiler but initially was given a quoted price of &euro;7,000 by one person.  I was obliged to travel to Northern Ireland to get a person in the scheme to sell it to me for &euro;3,000.  This is unbelievable stuff and one cannot have differences in price of more than 100%.  It strikes me that Coillte may need to get into the selling and servicing of such boilers to make them work.  Moreover, on the introduction of the renewable heat incentive scheme in England, it was commercially-based at the outset but it then was discovered that 80% of total use was in the private sector.  Coillte should become involved in getting it into people's homes.<\/p><p>  As for Structural Funds from Europe at present, through the Common Agricultural Policy there is a push for small to medium-sized enterprises to become more carbon-friendly.  I believe submissions in that direction would be highly positive.<\/p> <p>One aspect I note - I have been involved in this in trying to get one of them off the ground - is that banking is a significant issue.  The banks view anything to do with a renewable project, because one must co-fund the Structural Fund, as a problem.  They are writing it off and they want full equity brought in.  They do not value the equipment because it is novel technology.  When one has this equity issue, there will have to be some way to credit-guarantee the investment by private companies.  While it is a great idea - so is world peace - the question is how we get to that point.  At present, for small businesses, it is difficult to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300013#M00300","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396522200,"counter":597,"content":"<p>In fairness, I am not quite sure what that last point has to do with Coillte.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300014#N00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1396522200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

No doubt the Coillte land will play an important role in land utilisation in the future.<\/p><p>  I will focus upon it as somebody who has been involved in this and has not been aggressive, but has argued logically against the invasion of people's space by corporate entities, which I hope is not done in collusion with Coillte.  I note Coillte has nine projects over seven counties in order to contribute to the 500 MW portfolio of renewable energy.  Everything is grand, except when things are imposed upon communities with no community dividend or benefit.<\/p><p>  More particularly, we all are aware of the additional guidelines, and that there are planning guidelines, and there are reviews of all of those taking place.  That is grand to a point.  Previously, the wind turbines that Coillte was looking at were approximately 54 m in height.  Now they are stretching up to 180 m or 185 m, which is 600 ft., and these are to be 500 m from a home.  There is fear about the impact and the diminution of value.  All of this happens without any strategic environmental assessment and disregarding the Aarhus Convention.  They just walk in as corporate bullies.  I want to ensure that Coillte will not be part of this corporate bullying that occurs.  It is corporate bullying.  Many of my colleagues will not understand that, but when one lives in one of the five counties of the midlands, one will see it at play.  There is sneakiness, with deals being signed overnight and behind people's backs, and neighbours being taken out of the system.  There is family against family.  This is what has resulted.  Nobody seems to appreciate it.  I have made the Minister acutely aware of this.<\/p><p>  The important point is this.  Coillte has lands way out in rural areas, well away from communities, where there is no problem.  Bord na M&oacute;na has also.  It is all right provided they comply with the planning standards that are brought in, but one must have respect for everything, including the habitats, the SPAs, the SACs, the NHAs, etc.  An ordinary farmer must have respect for these, and I hope the corporations that are involved with wind energy have it too.  Obviously, they can utilise the land for those projects and give way-leaves.  How many of these have taken place to date?  Have there been many of them in the midlands?  That is important.<\/p><p>  Is Coillte aware that we may not have any energy for export?  Let us look after ourselves first.  Coillte will be aware of what is happening in Britain.  I hope it is not devising schemes in isolation.  We all will be aware that in Britain they are moving to a different way.  They are now looking again at nuclear energy.  Surely, as a semi-state company, with the shareholder being the State in the person of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Coillte will be aware of the importance of this situation in a context in which the British Government will not allow its rural landscape to be devastated and destroyed.  The UK Minister for Energy and Climate Change, Mr. Davey, MP, has had to change course.  The UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, MP, has changed course.  They are now looking at fracking and nuclear power.  They now have all the other options.  That is why this intergovernmental agreement has not taken place, and with God's help it will not take place.  Let us look after what we have at home.<\/p><p>  Wind energy is 25% to 30% efficient.  When there is plenty of wind one gets nothing, and it needs a carbon-based, or fossil-fuel-based back-up to ensure continuity of supply.  Is it as big as all this great profession of achievement that is being laid out for it?  If it was not subsidised, would it be on the park at all?  These are questions that I hope Coillte is examining and I hope it is taking cognisance of the wider community view.  Otherwise, it is heading for trouble.<\/p><p>  Deputy Barry is correct; we are there at meetings.  Now I have a view.  I do not believe in this wind energy concept.  It was brought in in 2009 under the national renewable energy action plan.  There was no strategic environment assessment.  There was nothing on it.  It was merely foisted on us by then Minister, Mr. Ryan, and those people.  There is no use in Coillte heading down into the logjam.  For example, in one county 6,000 residents took out their pens and wrote to Westmeath County Council objecting to it.  That is considerable.  In any county development plan, most here who were councillors will be aware that there would not be 20 submissions.  In this case there were 6,000.  They reflected the community view.<\/p><p>  Coillte has a lot of land in Westmeath.  I am aware of it because my late uncle worked in the company.  It is right beside me.  I do not have any difficulty as long as Coillte works with Bord na M&oacute;na - which, I note, has a role - and as long as it complies with the various standards.  However, I want Coillte to know that this is not a done deal.  There is a lot of work to be done with Coillte and all the others, and I do not anticipate that there will be any more chance of going around and imposing projects on people.  They will have to bring the people with them and show the benefits.  They should show that there is a community dividend in it at the end of the day and it is not all for corporations to make plenty of money and then sell off in a couple of years' time and leave us carrying the baby.  We are already recovering from unfinished estates.  We will have another type of ghost estate, consisting of lands blighted with turbines, across the country - including, if Coillte is not careful, some of its land.  Who will pay the dividend then?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300014#N00600","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1396522200,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I am not entirely sure I agree with my colleague, Deputy Barry, that people are as indifferent to climate change as he claims.  As a result of storms, there are many frightened people living on the western seaboard of Clare.  Of course, it is difficult to pin down whether or not the storms are a result of climate change, but there is a considerable amount of scientific evidence to suggest that they are going to become more prevalent in the future.<\/p><p>  I am interested in much of what the witnesses said, particularly in regard to carbon sequestration from forests.  Do they have any statistics on how that compares to other carbon sequestration - for example, in hedgerows?  Are certain species better at carbon sequestration?  Are the native broadleaf trees better at carbon sequestration than Sitka spruce?  There is the Coillte estate, there is whole forest estate and then there are hedgerows.  What percentage of the total carbon sequestration is allotted to each of those sectors?<\/p><p>  I presume the majority of trees in Ireland are in forests but I would not be as certain that the majority of native broadleaf trees are in forests.  One might find a greater number of native broadleaf trees in hedgerows than in the forest estate.  Do they have any statistics on that?  I accept that much of what I have asked goes far beyond the strict mandate of Coillte, which is why they came here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300014#N00700","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1396522800,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I have a few questions, one of which follows on from the questions on species mix and biodiversity.  I would like to hear the delegates' views on the trade-off between heavily emphasising the production of Sitka spruce, because of its short-term commercial value, and developing forestry as an amenity and environmental asset.  It is self-evident that broadleaf trees have a much greater amenity value for walkers and visitors.  We are under-performing in this area given that Ireland used to be covered in oaks and other broadleafs.  What will be done to expand in this area?  This is very important at all sorts of levels.  Native species are far more conducive to ensuring biodiversity than conifers, in addition to their having a tourism and amenity value.  Sitka spruce is not particularly conducive to promoting biodiversity.<\/p><p>  Very serious questions must be asked about the impact of the overemphasis on Sitka spruce on soil and water.  It results in acidification.  A doctor in Galway has suggested the outbreak of cryptosporidium-related illness in the Galway water system had something to do with the acidification of water and soil around Lough Corrib.  I am no scientist and do not know whether this is correct.  However, I have certainly heard plausible arguments that the acidification of water and soil is bad for fish, biodiversity, and soil quality.  This has a knock-on effect in terms of flooding.  Trees could be extremely helpful in holding riverbanks together.  They prevent soil erosion and the more devastating effects of flooding.  It has been suggested to me that native species are far better at achieving this.  They have deeper roots and they are better for the soil because they enrich it.  Sitka spruce, on the other hand, essentially impoverishes the soil and does not have the same qualities and strengths that native species would have along riverbanks, etc.  What do the delegates have to say about that?<\/p><p>  Following on from that is the question of agroforestry.  This is linked to what Deputy Tom Barry was stating about farmers not having the expertise that is required.  The advocates of agroforestry say that if one plants native species in and around pasture fields, it results in a great improvement because the trees serve as a windbreaker, enrich the soil and increase biodiversity in a way that is actually good for farming.  Often, however, farmers do not see it that way.  They see forests as taking up land that could be used more productively although agroforestry has the opposite effect.  If one lines fields and areas that might not be best suited to cultivation with forests, it can have an enriching effect.<\/p><p>  I drove to Donegal via the North.  It was noticeable on driving through County Tyrone that, in the middle of farming land, there are big clumps of native species.  They were on the uplands and in places where one might not be able to grow anything else, or places that might not be suited to more commercial farming practices.  This phenomenon was much more evident than in County Donegal or elsewhere in the Republic, where I simply noticed field after field with very few trees.  What are the delegates' views on this?  What can Coillte do to encourage tree planting?<\/p><p>  On the wider issue of afforestation, when Coillte is asked what its role could be in reaching the European average of 30%, which should be the absolute minimum in a country such as ours, it states there is nothing it can do because it cannot get the grant aid and does not have the land.  That is crazy.  If this is the case, we will never meet the targets.  It is pretty self-evident that we are not meeting them.  It will cost the State if we do not meet them in the longer term.  How can we sort out this problem?  The body that owns 50% of the forest estate in this country &mdash; the biggest owner of land &mdash; is saying it can contribute nothing to meeting what are absolutely vital targets for afforestation.  Do we need to restructure Coillte?  Must we remove the commercial aspect?  I do not know what we have to do but it seems we have to do something if Coillte is to contribute to meeting our afforestation targets.  If we do not, those targets will simply never be met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300015#O00100","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396522800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I shall answer the questions in the order they were asked, beginning with those of Deputy Barry.

This means balancing the conservation, control and use of the species in a way that actually makes sense.

As regards how we approach it, we are rooted in communities and have to get on with them in order to be able to carry on our business.  We put a lot of time and effort into trying to achieve this.  When we are applying for planning permission for our wind farm sites, we are certainly on the ground and attend public meetings in communities in an endeavour to explain why and the benefits.  We have a clear view that there has to be a community gain, with which we agreed.  There is room for improvement concerning how much goes back to the community.  We are working on trying to develop better ways of doing this in the future.  In terms of our planning applications, we have been reasonably successful.  One cannot satisfy everybody and we are not pretending that we can.  There will be opponents of what we are proposing to do, but we make a real effort to engage with communities.

We are certainly seeking a lead from the Government in terms of whether this will get off the ground.  If it is to have traction, the first thing that needs to happen is that the intergovernmental agreement will have to be sorted out.  The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, have agreed that there is a period of three months in which to try to come to a conclusion and a solution, if one can be obtained.  If one cannot be obtained, we will not be exporting wind energy supplies.  If it becomes Government policy and the Government has taken it on as a key objective, we will try to deploy our land to achieve that objective.  We are a player because of the fact that we own 7% of the country's land area.  We have lands adjacent to Bord na M&oacute;na's lands and are working closely with it to see, if this thing gets legs, whether we can join forces to put some impetus behind it.  We work with people whom we regard as reputable players.  We work closely with the ESB which is a partner on three of our projects.  We also work closely with Scottish and Southern Airtricity on one project.  We want to ensure what we do meets our standards of corporate governance, that we engage with people and are not seen - as Deputy Willie Penrose described it - as corporate bullies.

We see a good position on renewable energy solutions for these industrial users.  We are focused more on the industrial rather than the domestic end.<\/p><p>  Deputy Michael McNamara asked about carbon sequestration in our forests and what different species could bring to the mix.

National statistics have been produced in terms of the Kyoto Protocol for carbon stock in different areas.  The question concerning species is a good one.  The rate of carbon sequestration depends on factors such as soil type.  For example, peatlands will hold more sequestered carbon.  There are also factors such as age and species.  For instance, in the early years faster growing species like spruce will sequester more carbon.  However, because there is a longer rotation period broadleaves tend to capture it over a longer period.  It depends on at what stage one measures the rates of carbon sequestration.  I am not aware of statistics for hedgerows, but we need to look at all of the different sources in accounting for total carbon produced.  They tend to look at forests - above and below the ground and what is captured in the soil.  That is my understanding of how carbon is measured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300016#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396523400,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Mr. Murphy had a figure which showed the overall position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040300016#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Britchfield"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396523400,"counter":617,"content":"<p>For our estate, it is 200 million tonnes of carbon, a lot of which is in the soil.

I agree with him that forests have a very important function which is often overlooked.  There is a need to consider more proactively and progressively the ways we can use trees to mitigate flooding such as we have seen in the last number of months.  There is work to be done in the area of agro-forestry to come up with more innovative ways of using agriculture and forestry.  In other countries, agro-forestry systems have been introduced to benefit livestock and improve and enhance soils.  It is a matter of providing the necessary incentives.<\/p><p>  The issue to which I come back is what more we can do in these areas.  It is all about balancing the issues.  I mentioned earlier the greater need to recognise public goods.  We have started to be much more proactive about valuing public goods, including biodiversity, landscape protection and cultural heritage.  Our intention is to gain more recognition for those values, and we have done some studies with the Heritage Council in that regard.

Traditionally, forestry would have been a matter of the latter.  The availability of land is driven by economic factors in agriculture but also by competing land schemes.  There are also socioeconomic factors to consider in respect of persuading farmers to lock into forestry for a long period.

It might be the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which is the larger owner, in collaboration with Coillte, that ended up adding forests, given the competition for land.

The point about 200 million tonnes of carbon sequestration really struck me.  The recent agreement on the review of the Common Agricultural Policy was based on green principles.

Mr. O&rsquo;Brien will address this issue is his opening statement.<\/p><p>  As the committee is aware, I launched the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance yesterday.  The White Paper underpins the Government&rsquo;s resolve to deliver on the programme for Government's commitment to end the current unaffordable and unfair two-tier system and establish a single-tier health service under which access to services is based on medical need and not on ability to pay.<\/p><p>  The Government is keen to engage with the public and stakeholders on this major policy reform of the health service.  This gets to the heart of what we want from a reformed health service - accountability and transparency.<\/p><p>  Yesterday&rsquo;s launch of the White Paper is the beginning of a national conversation about UHI and the future of our health services.  The Government is keen that this committee will be instrumental in enabling that national conversation to take place.  I noted certain concerns in this regard in the Chairman's opening remarks.  I want to make it quite clear that the Government would like to invite the committee to partake in this debate.  The Government is equally clear, however, that this committee makes its own decisions and if it chooses not to partake in that conversation, that is entirely a matter for the committee.  Personally, I think that would be a sad outcome because, under the Chairman's stewardship, this committee has proven to be extremely helpful and informative.  The committee has also been calming in its tone previously concerning sensitive national issues, particularly with regard to the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill.<\/p><p>  At the launch yesterday, we started a formal public consultation process.  I would encourage everyone to engage in that consultation, and the easiest way to do so is through our website.  The process is open for the next eight weeks to the end of May.<\/p><p>  We will also be consulting separately on the future health basket, including the services to be covered under UHI.  As important as it is to decide what will be in the basket, it is the value framework that underpins those decisions.  Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of services, based on need and not on ability to pay.  If that goal is to be achieved, we need to involve the people in the process.  This committee will be invited to conduct hearings on the values which should underpin decisions on the future health basket.  I must re-emphasise, however, that it is a matter for the committee itself as to how, or whether, it will be involved in this.<\/p><p>  In relation to the basket of services, I will be establishing an expert commission in the coming weeks. The expert commission will advise on the basket of services and will take account of the values framework.  This committee may consider those costed options and the Government will then make a decision on what goes into the basket.  It is important to note that the commission will be consulting with the public; it will not work in isolation.  This deals with the values of transparency and accountability.<\/p><p>  The core value of UHI is equity: no preferential access based on ability to pay, and a system of financial support to pay for or subsidise the cost of standard UHI policy premiums for those who cannot afford them.  People will still be able to pay privately for services not included in the standard UHI package, or purchase supplemental health insurance cover for these.  However, insurers will not be allowed to sell insurance that provides faster access to services covered in the UHI standard package of care. <\/p><p>  I will not go into all the details of the White Paper but I do want to talk about costs.  Obviously, costs are a concern for this Government, stakeholders, families and communities.  As Minister for Health, I want a health service that meets people&rsquo;s needs but does so efficiently.  Over the last few years, we have delivered significant savings to the Exchequer in our health services and we have managed to maintain - and, indeed, improve - services.  For that I wish to thank the people who work in our health service, particularly those working on the front line.<\/p><p>  UHI is part of the overall plan to ensure we can continue to deliver efficiencies over the medium to long-term.  We have generational challenges to face, such as chronic diseases, obesity, tobacco and alcohol misuse &ndash; as well as continuing to provide acute and primary care today and tomorrow for our citizens.  That is why UHI is so important, not just as an end in itself but as part of a series of interlinked reforms that will deliver a health service fit for the 21st century.<\/p><p>  That is why, along with delivering on UHI, we are delivering on the money-follows-the-patient model, which is a more cost-effective way of paying for vital health services.  It is why we launched Healthy Ireland, our strategy for improving the health and well-being of people in Ireland.  It is why I am so deeply committed to making Ireland tobacco-free by 2025, as set out in Tobacco Free Ireland.  I want to thank the committee for its great support in this regard.<\/p><p>  At a practical level, along with these strategic plans, the White Paper sets out a cost control framework that will ensure affordability and keep costs to a minimum.  The cost control measures included range from price-monitoring of insurers and setting maximum prices for health care providers to more aggressive measures such as capping insurer overheads and profit margins.<\/p> <p>We have a job of work to do in estimating the costs before we implement the reforms inherent in UHI.  This is only right and sensible.  We must take into account not just the basket of services but the demand for and utilisation of health care, service delivery models, payment systems and regulatory and administrative costs.  My Department will progress work in this area during 2014 for completion in January 2015.  Only then will we proceed on foot of the approval of Government to draft legislation to give effect to the reforms set out in the White Paper.  The goal is to introduce UHI by 2019.<\/p><p> If UHI is our final destination, the term \"structural reform\" describes the road we must follow to that destination.  We have already made good progress with new HSE governance and management structures, establishing hospital groups on an administrative basis and establishing the Child and Family Agency.  The Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Bill, which I published in December 2013, provides for the HSE to be funded through the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Health and Children from January 2015.  The Bill is on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and I expect enactment to take place before the summer recess.  We will also be establishing new and revised structures for primary, social and mental health care.  This will follow on from the recent integrated service area review carried out by the HSE.  The next stage is the establishment on an administrative basis of the entities that will bring in the purchaser-provider split.  We already have the Healthcare Pricing Office, which is attached to the HSE, while a new shared services division is up and running also.  We will be working further on the health care commissioning agency, a patient safety agency and a national entity to promote health and well-being as well as the evolution of hospital groups into trusts.  We will also be putting the revised primary and social care delivery system on a statutory footing.<\/p><p> To reassure the committee, I note that the Healthcare Pricing Office will be independent.  While it is currently operating on an administrative basis, legislation will be brought forward to underpin its absolute independence.  It must be seen as independent if it is to be able to do its work.  My Department is preparing legislation to set up the new structures on a statutory basis and I have put in place a high-level steering group led by the Secretary General to oversee the process.  The third and final phase of structural reform will see a move to a combination of universal health insurance funding for acute hospital and certain primary care services, with general taxation funding for other services including social care services such as disability and long-term care.  At that point, the Healthcare Commissioning Agency will divest some of its purchasing functions to health insurers under UHI.<\/p><p> I have mentioned the importance of health and well-being and, in particular, tobacco control.  We are ten years on from the implementation of the workplace smoking ban, which research has found has resulted in over 3,700 fewer smoking-related deaths.  This is indisputable evidence that tobacco control measures are saving lives and improving our overall health as a nation.  The measures which have been put in place have worked.  There has been a decline of 7.5% in the number of Irish adults smoking since the last large-scale study in 2007.  Our work will continue.  We are aiming for a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5% by 2025.  We propose to introduce a tobacco licensing Bill to provide for a licensing system and other measures in relation to the sale of tobacco products.  I was very pleased that we received approval from Government last November to proceed with a public health (standardised packaging of tobacco) Bill.  I thank the committee again for its valuable contribution in that area and in advance for the assistance it will provide to me and my officials in introducing the legislation.  We will not be complacent, however.  We cannot afford to be in any sense.  We are saving money but, more importantly, we are saving lives.  We know we face the mother of all battles with the tobacco industry, which has enormous resources at its disposal.  We will not be intimidated by any external entity when it comes to public health issues and, in particular, the well-being of our children.<\/p><p> The committee has asked that I address the issue of a national office for rare diseases.  Rare diseases place a significant burden on patients and their families.  The important work of developing the national plan for rare diseases continues, and the plan is close to being finalised.  The policy framework relates to the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high-quality care and equity.  It will be patient-centred.  The plan we implement will deal with the prevention, diagnosis and care of people with rare diseases, enhancing access to orphan drugs and technologies, responding to the needs of patients with rare diseases and their carers and research into the area of rare diseases.  My Department's steering group is also considering for its report the development of a national office for rare diseases, the purpose of which would be to facilitate and support the HSE in the coordination of centres of expertise for rare diseases nationally and internationally.  Such an office could act as a national point of reference on services, diagnostics, care pathways and information relating to rare diseases.<\/p><p> The report by my Department on recommendations for dealing with rare diseases, including the establishment of a national office, is being finalised.  Departmental officials have met with the Health Service Executive to discuss the implementation of the report.  In the meantime, the HSE is developing a business case on the establishment of such an office.  The HSE has established a national clinical programme for rare diseases.  A national clinical lead has been appointed and a programme manager is in place.  The programme aims to improve and standardise patient care for individuals affected by rare diseases in Ireland by increasing detection and prevention, facilitating early and timely diagnosis, intervention and coordination of care and increasing awareness, information and support.  The programme has already started to map out current services and develop care pathways for patients with rare diseases.<\/p><p> Many of the reforms we have introduced to date represent the building blocks for universal health insurance, which is our ultimate goal.  The underlying principle will always remain that of better outcomes for patients.  That is our business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300003#D00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396514400,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The other members of my team have already been introduced by the Chairman.  I note that the committee requested information and will have received a written response from the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  I will therefore confine my opening statement to updates for the committee.<\/p><p>  Members will be aware of last week's television programme on the National Ambulance Service, or NAS, and I would like to clarify a number of points in that regard.  The programme placed considerable focus on officer response vehicles, or ORVs.  These vehicles and the officers who operate them - all of whom are paramedics or advanced paramedics - are available to respond to emergency calls as and when required.  During the period January to March 2014, ORVs carried out 629 emergency call-outs, of which 252 occurred outside the normal working hours of the relevant officers.  The NAS has recently commissioned a national capacity review which will utilise a modelling provider with extensive international experience of modelling ambulance operations.  The review will analyse current ambulance vehicle numbers, call cycles and response time performances.  Additionally, the review will examine current and projected resourcing levels for emergency ambulance cover, intermediate care and ORVs.  Overall, the review will determine the level of resource required across the country.<\/p><p>  Despite statements in the programme referring to cutbacks in the NAS, it is important to understand that despite cutbacks in other areas of the health services, the budget available for the National Ambulance Service increased by 4.3% between 2012 and 2013.  There is a further increase of 2.6% in the 2014 allocation to the service.  I note that &euro;9.3 million was spent on NAS vehicle equipment and vehicle replacement in 2013, while a further &euro;7.5 million is set aside for 2014.  This has resulted in the purchase of replacement vehicles as part of the fleet modernisation programme, including 27 emergency ambulances, 25 intermediate care ambulances and 27 rapid response vehicles.  It is planned to purchase a further 35 emergency ambulances this year.  A total of &euro;26.2 million is being invested in the development of a single national control centre which will operate at two sites, one in Tallaght and the other in Ballyshannon.  It is also planned to spend &euro;4.6 million on a national defibrillator and mechanical CPR purchase programme in 2014.  Since 2008, the number of staff in the NAS has increased by 16%.<\/p> <p>This is despite a significant reduction in staff in the wider health services.<\/p><p> At the end of 2014, it is anticipated that the complement of advanced paramedics will be 300, an increase of 400% since 2008.  The NAS has also trained approximately 300 paramedics since 2008, as well as recruiting and training approximately 70 emergency medical technicians, EMTs, during 2013 and proceeding to recruit a further 20 paramedics during 2014.  In addition, the Emergency Aeromedical Service has completed 556 missions since its inception in June 2012 to February 2014.  In 2013, the Irish Coast Guard also performed over 300 helicopter missions in support of the NAS and will continue to do so in 2014.  The HSE and the NAS are fully committed to and will continue to invest in services to ensure the best outcome for their patients in addition to the investments towards improvement which are already under way across the service.<\/p><p> On the eight overall recommendations specific to the HSE in the recent report on maternity services at Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise, I will update the committee on the following key actions that have been undertaken to date.  The staff at the hospital have apologised unreservedly to any families who experienced care below the expected standard.  On behalf of the HSE, I reiterate that apology.  A new management team was appointed on 28 February on an interim basis to run the hospital&rsquo;s maternity service.  Dialogue has already commenced with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to provide support to the Portlaoise maternity unit in a collaborative working arrangement.  The HSE is implementing its policy on open disclosure, while a full diagnostics review is under way at the hospital.  The HSE has issued a directive to all health care providers requiring them to notify the director of quality and patient safety and HIQA, the Health Information and Quality Authority, of all key risk events.<\/p><p> Other cases that have become known to the HSE since the airing of the television programme where families were not treated in a sufficiently compassionate manner by the hospital&rsquo;s maternity service are being dealt with by the new management team and the regional director for performance and integration.<\/p><p> The 2014 service plan highlighted that the health service faced a severe financial challenge in 2014.  As of the end of January, the HSE is not flagging any new concerns or risks beyond those which were clearly set out in the national service plan.  On 31 January, the HSE showed expenditure of &euro;999.5 million against a budget of &euro;975 million, representing a variance of &euro;24.5 million.  A material proportion of this variance, &euro;20.2 million, is in the acute hospital sector, with &euro;5.9 million, or 29%, of the acute deficit relating to hospital income generation and &euro;10.1 million, or 50%, relating to agency staffing levels.  Up to &euro;4.2 million, or 41%, of the acute variance relating to agency staffing is in the medical category, which relates to the growth in NCHD agency costs.  However, it should be noted that there remains a significant issue nationally relating to the recruitment of NCHDs, which is driving agency expenditure in certain hospitals.<\/p><p> As well as the wider performance management of the acute system in 2014, a more targeted approach with individual poorer performing hospitals is now being undertaken.  The acute system is facing a challenging year, with legacy deficit issues to be addressed and with hospitals expected to meet the full value of cost containment plans unachieved in 2013 of &euro;56.5 million.  This is in addition to the full value of savings measures that are to be delivered in 2014.<\/p><p> There is an emerging issue with private health insurance income, and the HSE has identified an increase in claims being pended for payment by insurers.  This issue has been highlighted to insurers and the HSE is actively engaging with them to reduce the lead time from submission to payment of claims.  This will improve the overall cash position.<\/p><p> Overall in January, the data with regard to activity against the service plan shows that the health service has seen an increase in new emergency department attendances of 3%, or 2,261 people, and a 3% increase in emergency admissions in January of 2014; a 34% reduction was achieved in the number of emergency department patients waiting on trolleys for ward-bed accommodation between January 2011 and 2014; and day care attendances were 2% lower, at 1,100, than in January 2013.<\/p><p> The health service saw an overall improvement in adult waiting lists in January 2014.  At the end of the month, 96% of those on waiting lists, or 41,251 adults, were waiting less than eight months for a planned procedure, as compared with 94% in the same period in 2013.  There were 1,764 adults waiting over eight months at the end of the month compared to 3,073 in the same period in 2013.<\/p><p> During the 12 months of 2013, the ambulance service responded to more than 281,000 emergency calls in the AS1 and AS2 categories, a significant increase of 14,000 over 2012.  The number of people covered by medical cards as of January 2014 was 1,840,760, or 40.1% of the population.  Included in these numbers are 50,505 medical cards granted on discretionary grounds.  The total number of general practitioner visit cards as of January 2014 was 125,930, including 27,204 cards granted on discretionary grounds.  There are 46,513 clients in receipt of a home help service and 11,969 clients in receipt of home care packages.  There are 22,959 clients supported by the nursing home support scheme, NHSS, with 4.1% of the population, or 21,880 people aged over 65 years, supported in either NHSS or saver beds.<\/p><p> The process which has been ongoing with the section 38 agencies to reach compliance with the Government&rsquo;s pay policy is nearing completion.  Since the beginning of the year the regional directors for performance and integration, with support from regional human resources, have been working with each agency through a further process of verification and clarification where a deviance from pay policy was previously recorded to ensure full implementation of the provisions of the pay policy and assist the agencies in reaching compliance.  In line with the pay policy, and as part of the ongoing process of reaching compliance, organisations seeking to make a business case for the continuation of an unapproved allowance were invited to submit their business cases for consideration by the HSE.  Business cases were also required for the continued payment of allowances which are not encompassed by or in line with the Department&rsquo;s consolidated salary scales but may have been sanctioned in the past.  A total of 202 business cases have now been received.  An internal review panel, comprising nominated members of the HSE leadership team, has reviewed each business case in detail and is in the process of making a decision on each case.  A report will be published shortly.  Up to 143 business cases were received in respect of senior managers - those at a salary level of grade VIII and above - for consideration by the panel.  In addition, 59 business cases in respect of salary levels below grade VIII have been reviewed at operational level by the regional directors for performance and integration.  The process is nearing completion, following which we will be in a position to provide a full report on the outcome of the compliance process.  It is important to note that as a result of the co-operation received in reaching compliance with the pay policy, no agency received a reduction in cash funding.<\/p><p> Turning to section 39 agencies, since the introduction of the national standard governance framework with the non-statutory sector, the HSE has been continuously reviewing and strengthening these arrangements in accordance with the requirements of sound governance and accountability and to ensure they are aligned with the ever-changing exigencies of our health and personal social services.  One such enhancement was the introduction in 2013 of a requirement for all agencies covered by a service arrangement, under either section 38 or section 39, to complete a template setting out details of the remunerative arrangements for senior managers - grade VIII and above.  The HSE is close to completing a template for verification and validation of service managers&rsquo; remuneration in the larger section 39 agencies - namely, those which receive in excess of &euro;5 million in funding annually from the HSE.  A report will be finalised by week commencing 14 April, which will be available to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396515000,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tony O'Brien for his very comprehensive report, and I thank him and his staff for the work they do in the delivery of health services.<\/p><p>  Without naming specific agencies, will he give the committee a sense of a business case for a section 38 or a section 39 agency?<\/p> <p>What is allowed for in the business case?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300005#F00200","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396515600,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I may have to leave at some stage before the witnesses might get to my questions but I will be observing their responses from my office.  The Minister outlined his pathway to universal health insurance yesterday.  We welcome the publication of the White Paper which will hopefully stimulate some form of discourse and broader debate about how we fund our health services.  The Minister has decided to go down the route of universal health insurance.  This will not necessarily meet with universal support.  However, it will stimulate some form of debate.<br\/>We are all prone to platitudes and self-appreciation from time to time but I do not believe that what was announced yesterday was earth-shattering.  There is nothing very new in it.  It was a case of defining what the Minister already said on previous occasions.  That is not a criticism, rather it is an observation.  The work that must be done on universal health insurance relates to the basket of services and types of cover.  The more cover is included, the more expensive universal health insurance will be.  It should cost the same to the State but cost to individuals is an issue that will be discussed.  The more we include in that basket of services, the more expensive it is going to be for some individuals.  That is a key issue that must be discussed.  <br\/>The Minister said that he is putting building blocks in place.  When putting building blocks in place, any handy builder or project engineer would also have a rough idea as to the actual cost of the various materials going into that project.  Assessing how much a project will cost is basic due diligence.  The difficulty we have is that there seems to be no view as to what it will cost.  It depends on many assumptions.  If we want to have a proper debate, we need to get down to some harsh realities with regard to how much this will cost and we cannot make assumptions about what will happen in 2019.  We must assess what it will cost based on what we have now as opposed to hoping that down the road, taxation-based policy will be friendlier to universal health insurance or that certain events will address it.  If we want to have a genuine up-front debate for everybody, not just politicians in this room, but the public, the least we should do is decide a basic suite of services and what that would cost, which could be done quite quickly.  This does not necessarily mean that this will be the actual suite of services that we decide on but there is a matrix there and the Government can work it out.  The problem is that if it works it out, it will find that it will be a bit more expensive than it thought it would be.  We could try to look at that but it is probably for another day.<br\/>For fear the Minister would take us up wrong - I am not saying he did so intentionally - the committee will play its part.  The fact that members are from different political parties who may have differing views on universal health insurance does not mean we will obstruct the passage of it.  We fundamentally do not agree with the policy.  If legislation flows from that policy we will co-operate as legislators like everybody else.  We are not going to be outside the door with placards opposing it but we will use whatever means we have to explore other avenues regarding how we fund health services in the years ahead.<br\/>In respect of broader issues surrounding medical cards and primary care mention has been made of primary care and free GP care for the those under the age of six and moving to universality over the next number of years.  There is a major problem which I said I would bring to the Minister's attention because he does not seem to accept that there is a problem.  A number of meetings are ongoing around the country.  GPs are attending in large gatherings and highlighting the huge concerns they have.  It is not just in the context of the under-sixes contract, although there is no doubt that this was the catalyst in terms of bringing them together.  Even prior to the publication of the contract for free GP caver for those under six years of age, many people were saying that there is a major crisis with GP services in this country.  There have been recent cases where GPs have passed away, the HSE has advertised and nobody took up that GMS practice.  If this is happening, the Government has a problem.  We are now having difficulties in maintaining GPs in the country, which is a key issue.<br\/>When the Minister refers to the roll-out of primary care as a critical plank in reducing admittance to acute hospital sections, at the very least, there should be some <i>quid pro quo<\/i>increase in budget over the next number of years.  There seems to be no concept of how the Government is going to fund primary care other than it being lauded every day and the strategy since 2001 being rolled out on a continual basis as being a central plank in the delivery of health care in the least complex and least expensive setting.  We all agree on that but there is no commitment to making sure that it is working in a way that is sustainable not only for the individuals providing the service but collectively for customers, patients, clients, GPs and other allied professionals.  <br\/>How much time do I have left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300006#G00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1396515600,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I will give the Deputy between eight and ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300006#G00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1396515600,"counter":654,"content":"<p>There is a reduction in the number of medical cards.  We can assume this is because of two things - a drop in unemployment and a number of people emigrating.  We are not quite sure but we hope that it is primarily due to a take-up in employment figures.  What is disturbing is that we are now down to 50,501 discretionary medical cards.  Over the past number of years, the Minister has consistently said that there has been no real change in policy.  I must beg to differ.  I raised this issue last week in the D&aacute;il and I want to say it again, not only in front of the Minister but in front of the HSE officials who are supplying the Minister with the answers to these parliamentary questions, which are answered up-front by and large.  There has been a change in policy.  The Minister even tried to pretend that the word \"discretion\" had been removed from the lexicon of the HSE in terms of assessing medical cards.  This word had been used for years in accounting in respect of the HSE budget.  It has been used in the service plan for the previous number of years but all of a sudden, there was an effort to remove the word \"discretion\".<\/p><p>  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled, I was told that there was no such thing as a discretionary medical card but that is not the case.  At one stage, there were over 90,000 of them in the country and we are now down to 50,501.  Week in, week out, organisations who consistently represent and advocate for individuals, families and cohorts of people with very profound disabilities and illnesses consistently say that their members are having their discretionary medical cards withdrawn.  Regardless of whether one describes it as an entity or otherwise, it is still a fact that many families are encountering huge difficulties.  Even in recent weeks, organisations representing people with Down's syndrome have said publicly that there has been a blatant attempt to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards issued to their members.  That is something with which we must deal.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Brien referred to the National Ambulance Service, the NAS.  We could talk indefinitely about this issue, which needs to be addressed.  There is now a pretence from the Minister, officialdom and the NAS that no problem exists.  People representing those working in the NAS appeared before us a couple of weeks ago.  There was almost a pretence on the part of union representatives at the top that no problem exists.  The \"Prime Time\" programme has exposed what we all knew was happening.  Week in, week out, we are having major difficulties and are continually hearing about the lack of response times and the fact that we are now pretending we have a NAS that is in some way meeting the guidelines that have been laid down by HIQA.<\/p> <p> We should examine the situation regarding ORVs.  It is amazing that Mr. O'Brien can come in here and say that in the first 90 days they were called out 629 times.  Let us be very clear.  The fact that these very expensive vehicles are driving around the country and are unavailable to deal with emergencies should be examined.  However this is just one item of the malaise at the top echelons of the NAS.  The NAS is under-resourced and to pretend it is not is an insult to the professionals who are trying to provide a good service and, more importantly, the many people who depend on that service, some to their detriment in terms of injury and loss of life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300006#G00400","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396516200,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I welcome, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, Mr.O'Brien, their colleagues and the Minister of State, Deputy White.  The response I received to my first question on the ambulance service, which I heard again in the D&aacute;il this week, does not equate with the reality I know.  The NAS is not safe, responsive or fit for purpose.  Those are the facts and it is a very widespread view and experience.  I do not base my view solely on the recent &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme.  It is underscored by a series of information flows recently.  I refer to the experiences of and representations made to individual Members of the Oireachtas.  I have never referred to it before.  I was angry, to put it mildly, about the Minister's retort to me in the D&aacute;il this week.  Despite the experience of individual Members he resorted to name-calling and rejectionism without facing the facts.<br\/>In January I had a heart attack a quarter of a mile from the local ambulance station, yet the ambulance came from Virginia, County Cavan, more than 40 miles away, to the doctor's surgery where I was waiting to be taken to Cavan General Hospital.  There is another ambulance station 15 miles away.  The GP and nursing staff in the clinic were incredulous at the delay and it was a continued issue of concern to them.  That was not my first such experience.  I have been fortunate twice.  As a consequence I had further stents inserted the following morning.<br\/>I do not question the ambulance personnel, who are the most professional people in carrying out their function.  They also make the points I am making today.  It is not just me reporting this.  They have recently come before this committee and outlined the situation they contend with.  It is a very serious matter.  They have made detailed submissions to us via their union and membership representations.  We have other media investigations and reports, including the series by Kitty Holland in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  All this evidence must be recognised as a serious attempt to bring to light real and significant failings within this service.  The responses in the D&aacute;il this week do not acknowledge the reality and the deep fears of so many people.  I could add further personal experience from my family of a less favourable consequence regarding an ambulance call-out before Christmas, but I will not.<br\/>We are not just discussing statistics.  We are talking about a situation in which lives have been lost.  People believe that had the ambulance arrived within the expected time there would have been a chance that they might have been able to save their loved one.  Nobody is foolish enough to say they would have been saved in every situation, but they might have been saved.  That is a very serious matter for people to live with and contend with for weeks, months, years and perhaps a lifetime afterwards.  I am deeply worried.<br\/>Do the Minister and the HSE agree that a figure of only one in every three people with life-threatening conditions being responded to by the ambulance service within the set target time in 2013 is acceptable?  Surely those figures must prompt emergency action.  Will the Minister undertake a comprehensive capacity review of the ambulance service with a view to enhanced provision across the State?  Will he require the HSE to cease the current process whereby it is trying to take over the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service provision, which operates more effectively and with greatly superior adherence to call-out times than the NAS throughout the rest of this jurisdiction?  Here in the city of Dublin this is a very serious matter.  The people of this city have no faith, only fear, about the prospect of the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance services being subsumed in the HSE and the NAS.  There is no confidence in it and it is not a runner when the NAS provision is clearly failing.  Will the Minister and Mr. O'Brien establish a national ambulance authority?  We need a national ambulance authority outside the remit of the HSE.<br\/>My second question is on the shortage or nurses.  A study by <i>The Lancet<\/i>journal, which included this State, reported that for every patient added to a nurse's workload the chance of dying within a month of surgery increases by a shocking 7%.  While that is incredible, it is not disputed.  The survey included 420,000 patients.  It was not pulled out of the clouds.  In January the Irish Emergency Medicine Trainees Association, IEMTA, stated that overcrowding in our hospital emergency departments was unequivocally dangerous for patients.  Do the Minister and the HSE accept that with a growing and aging population we cannot sustain safe services with over 5,200 fewer nurses within our service since 2010?  Those are the figures.  We have 13.5% fewer nursing staff across the services since 2010.  Do they accept that there must be a significant recruitment drive to ensure safe staffing in our hospitals?  We are training nurses for export.  We need them within our own services to ensure the safest possible provision of care.<br\/>My last question is on the Minister's reply on the national plan for rare diseases.  He stated that his Department's steering group is also considering for its report the development of a national office for rare diseases.<\/p> <p>The committee is certain that the establishment of such an office is essential.  Will he qualify \"also considering\" and give us the certainty regarding that intent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300007#H00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396516800,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I welcome everyone.  With regard to the questions I tabled, I would like to follow up on question No. 9 about the HSE's national oversight group and day service or rehabilitative training places for young adults with a disability.  The reality is every year between 650 and 700 young adults with an intellectual disability or autism leave school.  They are viewed every year as new people in the system as if officials do not know they are coming into it.  There is an annual issue over where the funding comes from to provide places for them.  Similarly, 700 young people leave rehabilitative training every year and where they go and where the funding comes from is also an annual issue.  As budgets have been cut back, the services providers affected have said no additional funding is available for school leavers and, therefore, they are falling into this limbo because they are considered to be new clients.  No funding was made available in 2012 while &euro;4 million was made available in 2013 and I am advised by service providers that this was not nearly enough.<\/p><p>  I was disappointed with the reply I received.  It mentions the membership of the national oversight group.  Will the Minister outline the membership?  Reference is made to a service user representative.  I contacted several disability groups and they did not know that such a representative is on the group.  They do not even know who is on the group.  Will the Minister publish a list of the members of the oversight group?  I am also disappointed that there is no mention of the New Directions policy, which is his policy for the provision of day services and supports to adults with a disability.  This recommends a move away from centre-based segregated day services.  Given post-school supports are day services, it is strange that the New Directions policy is not mentioned.<\/p><p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to question No. 10 about the pre-hospital emergency care council and allowing pronouncement of death by advanced paramedics.  This came up in the committee's end-of-life care hearings.  I welcome that the Minister is examining the issue through the Forum on the End-of-Life in Ireland but I remind him of the urgency of this issue.  During the hearings, Professor Patrick Plunkett, a member of the council from St. James's Hospital, outlined to us that in cases where the patient has suffered a cardiac arrest, there is a natural reluctance on the part of the pre-hospital emergency care providers ambulance personnel to pronounce death in the home, which leads to ongoing resuscitation efforts and pronouncement of death in the accident and emergency department.  This leaves the department's team to deal with the process of informing relatives and their grief, the logistical difficulties of identification and referral to the coroner.  Dr. Geoff King also told the committee about how they cannot pronounce death and they must remain at the scene for ten minutes or an hour or until the next day, which is wasting time.  I wonder if this contributes to our ambulance service issues because staff are waiting for a pronouncement of death at the scene.  We were given vivid descriptions about staff who seemed to be resuscitating somebody they knew was dead.  We need movement on this.  I welcome the steps being taken but this issue was raised by several groups during our hearings.<\/p><p>  The final issue I would like to raise relates to question No. 11 about the Children's Rights Alliance report card which gave the Government a worrying E grade on mental health services.  The response I received states, \"While noting the contents of the recent report card by the Children's Rights Alliance on mental health services, real and significant improvements have taken place\".  The Government went from a D grade to an E grade on mental health services.  There was no urgency in this reply.  I could have received this reply a year or two years ago.  Will the Minster provide an update?  At the previous quarterly meeting, I asked about a protocol between the Child and Family Agency and the child and adolescent mental health service and I was told that would be produced within days.  Is it in operation?  I have not heard any details since.  I am advised by social workers that they are finding it hugely difficult to access child and adolescent mental health services.<\/p><p>  In November 2012, the HSE issued an access protocol for 16 and 17 year olds to mental health services, which stated: \"From 1 January 2013, CAMHS will accept referral of all new cases up to their 17th birthday and from 1 January 2014, where feasible, up to their 18th birthday\".  However, last year there was an increase in cases with 16% of cases involving 16 year olds.  A protocol was put in place but the position is getting worse.  More young people are entering adult services when they should be entering child services.  Five children under the age of 16 were put into adult psychiatric wards between January and September last year when everybody agrees this should not happen.  Service providers say places are available but they are not being accessed.  Does legislation need to be introduced for this to happen?<\/p><p>  We are all supportive of the Minister's initiatives on tobacco.  What is the position on the smoking in cars with children Bill initiated by Senators Crown, Daly and myself?  Will it be taken in the Seanad next week to complete its journey there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300008#J00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1396516800,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their questions.  Deputy Kelleher made a number of comments.  The publication of the White Paper is a key and important step along the road to UHI.  It allows for a public conversation to take place and I hope that everybody will engage in that because it is our health service and we all need to be involved in the shaping of its future and the implementation of what I believe to be a more equitable, fair and affordable system than the one that has evolved over decades in a rather chaotic fashion.  I refer to building blocks, money following the patients, the directorate, the hospital groups, new GP contracts and access to free primary care, which the Minister of State, Deputy White, will address in a more detailed way but I acknowledge that people are focused now on cost.  I reiterate that it is impossible to say what the cost will be in 2019 when we have not even determined what will be in the basket of services.  It is important that we have a public conversation around that because it underscores the very values of our society.  I believe in a republic that all people should be cherished equally and that everybody should have access to medical care based on their medical need, not what they can afford to pay and I believe most right minded people support that.<\/p><p>  People are fixated on the issue of cost.  I cannot predict what will happen in 2019 with certainty but I can say what it would have looked like in 2013.  I refer in particular to a newspaper article today which states families face huge bills for universal health cover.  An individual - he is not here to defend himself and, therefore, I will not mention his name - states that there will be no subsidy for the 40% of people who are currently covered by a medical card - but they will be fully subsidised by the Government - and the top 30%.  Clearly the gentleman did not hear me and some of those who wrote the article and who attended the press conference yesterday did not hear me.  I made it clear there, here and elsewhere that there will be a considerable subsidy for families in that group and they will be the big winners in this because not alone will they have affordable health insurance, they will have access to free GP care at the point of delivery and a range of services that will be developed through our primary care initiatives locally.<\/p> <p>Last year the average premium was &euro;920.  If the proposed UHI efficiencies were in place last year that average premium would have been lower in any event.  However, the State would have paid for all those people on medical cards and it would have subsidised considerably those on lower incomes - the very group this paper suggests will not get any subsidy at all.  So it would be a fraction of &euro;920 and it will not cost families thousands of euro or anything like it.<\/p><p> That debate will continue.  I have clearly said we need to have this conversation.  We need to continue to make the progress we have made.  I again thank the front-line service and all involved for making this progress in the context of a 20% reduction in budget, 10% reduction in staff and 8% growth in population.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made the point that with an ageing population things will just get worse.  He is right that with an ageing population things will just get worse if we leave it as it is, which is why we must change it from a hospital-centred service to a primary care-centred service where 90% to 95% of patients' needs can be met.  The focus must move from episodic illness cover to prevention and secondary prevention - the care of chronic illness such as diabetes, asthma and other conditions.<\/p><p> I look forward to that debate and having a wide discussion.  With the commission having reported hopefully by January of next year we will be in a position to bring it to Government to make a decision on what should be in the basket and at that point in time the average costs will be considerably clearer.  However, we need to continue to drive down costs.  We have done that in the public sector; it has yet to be done at all to my satisfaction in the private health insurance market, but it will be done.  Pat McLoughlin's group is working on that with the insurers.<\/p><p> The VHI, as the biggest payer out for insurance with 80% of the market, is considering how it can address this issue through clinical audit of what we are paying and benchmarking what we are paying for the procedures we pay for.  It is also looking at how many of them are being done that should be done and how many of them are being done that should not be done.  Members have heard me speak previously about an individual who took &euro;1 million from one insurance company here a few years ago.<\/p><p> All those issues need to be addressed.  In addition reform of the Department of Health is taking place.  All these things form part of the roadway to get to universal health insurance and give better outcomes for all our people and all those who need our health service.<\/p><p> Deputies Kelleher and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of the ambulance service.  Yesterday I did not call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in names but did I accuse him or shroud waving, as he has done in the past.  Again today he is talking about only a third of people with very serious illness getting the ambulance on time.  I will let Mr. O'Brien respond to that because it is factually not correct.  I am very sorry to hear that the Deputy was ill earlier this year.  I am glad to see he is in good stead and that he had the medical care available to him in his doctor's surgery.  I want to come to that key point.<\/p><p> There has been too much focus on how quickly the ambulance gets there, although that is important.  I do not deny that nor do I deny that we need to do much more to improve our ambulance service.  That is critical, as everyone here would accept - I certainly accept it.  However, what is really important is that the patient gets the care as quickly as possible, which is why the responders, the first responders, the paramedics, the advance paramedics, the response cars and motorbikes are so important in this respect.<\/p><p> I can accept that Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has had experiences personally and among his in his family which I am very sorry to hear about.  As a Minister, overseeing a service, I must bring that service up to speed - and we are doing that.  Mr. O'Brien has outlined the number of new vehicles on the road and that we now have new vehicles for inter-hospital transfer thus freeing up our emergency ambulances to do the emergency work.  The volume of calls has increased and an amount of money has been invested in recent years and will continue to be invested.<\/p><p> We have targets for response times.  While I do not want to be over-political about it, when Deputy Kelleher raises the issue of response times, I remind him that his party had 14 years in government and did not even have a target.  I do not even know if HIQA had reported at that point of time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300008#J00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I remind the Minister that he has had four years in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300009#K00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":662,"content":"<p>No, it is three years and a couple of weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300009#K00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":663,"content":"<p>However, this is his fourth year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300009#K00400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Members should address their comments through the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300009#K00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":665,"content":"<p>That is classic Fianna F&aacute;il-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300009#K00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":666,"content":"<p>This is a health committee not a history committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300009#K00700","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300009#K00800","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I will chair the meeting, thank you.

We have invested in training, personnel and equipment and we will continue to do that.  Should I go back to President Bill Clinton's comment?  Is Deputy Kelleher's problem that it is taking me so long to clean up the mess his party left?  We are working on this.  The people in the service are working it.  Mr. O'Brien and his staff, including Ms Laverne McGuinness, and Mr. Martin Dunne who is the head of the service are all working on this to improve it.  It is not by any means where we would like it to be but we are making progress.  I will let Mr. O'Brien and Ms McGuinness go into this in greater detail.<\/p><p>  The same is true with our emergency departments.  Of course there is still some overcrowding and I am not happy about it.  However, I have to be realistic in what I ask of the staff who work in our service in terms of making the progress we have made.  We have made huge progress at a time when we have reduced money and reduced staff.  When we had loads of money and quadrupled out spend between 1997 and 2009, we ended up with the greatest mess ever in 2011 before the Government came into power.<\/p><p>  I am asking people to be patient.  I know it is difficult particularly when one's own loved one is sick, unwell or in danger and it can be very hard to have patience with the system.  I think most people will acknowledge that in the main - not always, sadly - patients in our hospitals get excellent treatment, as good as anywhere in the world.  When I was in America around St. Patrick's Day in order to promote the country and tourism and also to explore getting partners for our new hospital groups, I went to some of the top clinics in America and every one of them had Irish doctors and nurses, and they were right at the top.  So we have the best people; we train them to the best standard and they rise to the top of the very best institutions in the world.  I know some people will ask why we cannot keep more of them at home.  That is why we have a review group looking at the workload and career prospects of non-consultant doctors to try to keep them here.  I heard Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comment about our nurses; we want to keep them here also.<\/p><p>  However, all this takes time.  In all these reforms as we peel back the layers we find more and more legacy issues to be dealt with.  We will go through it until we get to the core and fix it.  We will do so, particularly with universal health insurance in mind with the full involvement of the people who will have their say in how we shape our new health service.<\/p><p>  In response to Senator van Turnhout, I will certainly ensure that the names of the oversight committee are made publicly available; that is a no-brainer.  I will ask Mr. Pat Healy to comment on the New Directions policy not being mentioned.  The Senator also spoke about pre-hospital emergency care and paramedics pronouncing death.  It makes sense to me and I will ensure it is looked into.  That is a very stressful time for everybody involved, particularly the families and it is not acceptable to have red-tape delay and may further impact on ambulance service performance.<\/p><p>  I will ask Mr. Mulvany to address the question on the Children's Rights Alliance report card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300009#K01600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1396517400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Deputy Kelleher made some observations and asked some questions about primary care.  I am aware of the issues that have been raised at various meetings organised by general practitioners around the country.  I am fully aware of the concerns people have raised and I am in regular contact with general practitioners as a Deputy as well as a Minister of State.  I have visited general practitioners in their practices and have met them in my office, and am fully aware of the issues they have raised.<\/p> <p> A considerable amount of the concern GPs have is not related to the provision for those under the age of six.  That is perhaps in some ways a proxy or the occasion for these issues being raised rather than the reason they are being raised.  I can see the concerns people have, particularly after the period we have come out of.  There are people in general practice who have made commitments in some cases who are struggling in many situations in common with many other people across society who have come out of a huge economic collapse.  This has also affected GPs who are also citizens and who have seen their material circumstances decline, significantly so in some cases.  That is the case across the board.  It is certainly the case across the public service.  There is no public service worker who has not had their pay reduced.  Similarly, GPs have had to face that as well.  Of course, they are providing an essential public service for citizens.<\/p><p> Despite the concerns raised by GPs, which I take seriously and understand, they are continuing to provide a highly efficient and professional service in general practice in rural and urban areas across the country because I have seen it for myself.  One could not criticise the level of service.  I know colleagues have been contacted by GPs, as have I, but I do not get a sense from the people that they are getting less of a service.  I am not infallible and there may be cases of this but that is not the sense I have.  GPs often say somewhat rhetorically, although I do not disagree with them, that it is the most successful part of the health service.  Perhaps other people in this room might have different views about that but they do make that point.  I think they are right.  It is a very successful and vital service carried out in a professional, efficient and effective manner for which I thank them.  They deserve huge credit from this committee and society for the work they do and the efficiency and professionalism with which they deliver it.    <\/p><p>In response to Deputy Kelleher, I must point out that the number of GPs in the system has increased.  One of the first things this Government did was change the law to liberalise entry into general practice, which has been a success.  There are concerns and issues which are legitimate and must be addressed.  The issue of resourcing must be addressed across the board in terms of public services.  We all understand that we want excellent public services and that they cost money, which brings us to the debate touched upon by the Minister in respect of how we fund our health services in the future, including primary care.  We must all face up to this.<\/p><p> One clear question relates to who will be funding health services in the future.  The answer is the people of Ireland.  It is just a question of how they will be doing it.  Regardless of whether it will be through taxation or an insurance-based system, the people of Ireland will be paying for it.  Is it the case that it is more effective and equitable to do it through an insurance-based system?  It is not just this Government that has said that.  The resource allocation report commissioned by the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney, made the point that insurance-based systems have advantages because there is greater visibility in terms of what people pay and what they get from it.  Other people say taxation is the way to do it.  Can any Government persuade its electorate to pay the level of taxes that would be required to have a fully tax-based health system in the future?  I do not know the answer to that question but I doubt it.  We must have the debate.  At the outset, Deputy Kelleher conceded that at least the universal health insurance white paper helps get this debate properly grounded in terms of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300009#K01700","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396518000,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Just to clarify, that was not a concession.

The Deputy should give it a fair chance.  How else will we address the two-tier system?  If Deputy Kelleher says it should not be through insurance, what is the alternative for addressing the two-tier system we undoubtedly have?  Let us have that debate.<\/p><p>  I mentioned the wider context and the reduction in pay in the public service.  The clear stated position of the Government is that it does not intend to further reduce wages in the public service.  We can have the confidence to say that this applies equally to the FEMPI cuts, which is the issue that has most concerned doctors.  It is my confident belief that the Government will not be going back to that well again and that people can have some level of certainty in terms of where they are going in the future.  That is an issue of Government policy and I am simply reflecting what has been said by others in that regard.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher pulled me up again on the use of the word \"discretion\" in respect of medical cards.  I do not want to get into semantics but the Deputy has drawn me into it.  The Deputy's own question asked the Minister for Health to provide details of the number of medical cards and GP cards and the number of each card issued on a discretionary basis.  The card is the card no matter how the person acquires it.  If citizen A has a medical card granted in the normal way and citizen B has a medical card granted on through the discretionary process, the cards are exactly the same.  That is the point I was trying to make.  I was trying to say that there is no separate entity called a discretionary medical card.  If two people are holding the card, the cards are exactly the same in terms of entitlement.  Deputy Kelleher knows exactly what I meant by that but he persists in coming back and pulling us up on it.  That is the position.  There are two different routes - one is the basic means test and the other is through discretion.  That is what we mean in terms of there being no separate entity.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher said that there was a belief on the part of Down's syndrome advocacy groups that there was a blatant attempt to reduce medical cards issued to their members.  We have previously dealt with this issue, which I know is of concern to people and has been constantly raised in the committee.  I want to state categorically that there is no targeting of people with particular illnesses or conditions.  It would be perverse for the HSE to decide that it will go after this or that patient group and take away their medical cards.  Even if I am wrong on that and there was an extraordinary policy of targeting particular patient groups, it could not be done anyway because the system does not retain information in respect of medical condition or illness.  I want to again state that it would be impossible to do this.  It would be perverse if anybody was to think that one would go after particular groups but the system is simply not geared to do that in any event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300010#L00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1396518000,"counter":680,"content":"<p>Perhaps the system should retain information because many of us in this room have heard from people with serious illnesses, be they transplant patients or people with chronic illness or cancer, and families of children with Down's syndrome who have had medical cards removed or up for review and have been questioned.

To be fair, when one does engage with staff in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, they are very fair-minded and genuine people but perhaps the system should be changed.  I have made the point here and to the Minister and Minister for State that we need to look at the issue of transplant patients or people with Down's syndrome so that they do not have go through the rigmarole all the time.

Where somebody is above the means test limit and there is medical condition or illness that has an effect on their means and financial situation, that can be taken into account in respect of the award of a card on a discretionary basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300010#L00900","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396518600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>If I may, I will ask Mr. Healy to deal with the issue of school leavers that was raised by Senator van Turnhout.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300011#M00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396518600,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Just to reassure members, everything we have done in respect of school leavers and those exiting rehabilitation training, RT, is based on New Directions.

However, we have not been engaged on its scoring mechanism.  According to its papers on what led to a reduction from a D to an E grade, one reason was the fact that the &euro;20 million in additional investment was not &euro;35 million.  We acknowledge that an approximate &euro;45 million extra has been invested in overall mental health services in the 2013-14 period.  This is significant.<\/p><p>  The issue of children being admitted to adult psychiatric units was another key factor in the grade.  That five children under the age of 16 years were admitted to adult units is not acceptable.<\/p><p>  A scoring should consider progress over time.  In 2008, there were 16 appropriate beds for the admission of children, yet there were 247 admissions of children to adult units.  In effect, 75% of all children admitted in 2008 were admitted to adult units.  In 2013, the number of beds had increased to 44 and there were 90 admissions of children to adult units.  That was 90 more than we would have liked, but it was still a reduction to 32% of total admissions.  While this is not just an issue of beds, the number has since increased again.  It was 51 when we wrote our paper, but it is now 56.  By the end of this year, it will be 66.  Next year, it will increase to 74.  The remaining increases to 80 and 104 will occur when the new forensic unit at St. Ita's Hospital, the new Central Mental Hospital, opens and the children's hospital opens.  There will be significant progress in terms of the investment in beds.<\/p><p>  Geography and exceptional cases remain issues.  Sometimes, it can be appropriate for children older than 16 years of age to be admitted to adult units.  However, a significant amount of progress is also being made in this respect.<\/p><p>  As to other indicators, waiting times for CAMHS present an issue.  We hit the target of 70% being seen within three months after referral, but it is a priority-based service.  More than 50% of all referrals to CAMHS are seen within one month or less.  Urgent cases are seen in a matter of days or, if necessary, hours.  We have put more staff into mental health services, but we have also accepted more referrals and seen more people.  In 2013, the waiting list increased by a little under 500 people, but that increase was much less than the amount of extra work that the service has done.  CAMHS is not yet at the stage where it is sufficient to meet an increasing and latent demand, but we have put in place 230 additional posts through the 2012 and 2013 investments-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300011#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1396518600,"counter":690,"content":"<p>If I might interrupt Mr. Mulvany for a second, we have just received a note from the broadcasting unit.

I will also seek to address the concerns raised about the ambulance service.  The degree of passion and concern expressed around health services that we often hear in questions is appropriate.  I recognise that there is nothing more personal or, indeed, political than health care, particularly if something is seen not to be working as effectively as it might.<\/p><p>  Regarding medical cards, the reason we do not hold data relating to a person&rsquo;s medical condition where that condition has been factored into the calculations to determine whether someone would suffer under financial hardship and, therefore, qualify on discretionary grounds is that the medical condition itself is not a relevant decision making criterion.  Under the Data Protection Act, we would not be entitled to hold those data.  Only at such time as the law changes or situations evolve to where a medical condition becomes a qualifying criterion would we be entitled to classify claimants in that regard and hold those data.<\/p><p>  That said, the discretion arises from the 1970 Act.  It is important to stress that we have a mathematical formula for basic entitlement.  In order to exercise discretion in a way that will withstand tests as to sound public administration, it must also be standardised.  This has been done on the basis of a higher financial threshold calculated by reference to particular circumstances in particular cases.  Since the discretion was, in effect, vested in the chief executives of the health boards at the time and, therefore, is now vested in me, I am conscious of the importance of the exercise of that discretion.  We are constantly examining whether that discretion can be exercised in a different or better way.  For now, though, we are using exactly the same approach that has been used for a number of years.  To that extent, I can say definitively that there has been no change in policy or practice.<\/p><p>  However, what appears to be clear is that, previously, there were regional variations.  One of the effects of having a level playing field is that, as regards persons who may previously have been granted medical cards on discretionary grounds when they did not fulfil those narrow criteria, one will find on review that----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300011#M01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1396518600,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but there is a vote in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300011#M02000","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396519200,"counter":706,"content":"<p>Persons whose individual circumstances may not have materially changed may none the less find, when a standardised set of rules are applied, that they no are no longer entitled to a medical card.  I can categorically stated that there is no targeting of any particular group.  Medical cards are reviewed on a batched or random basis, except where on the basis of information which is now available to us through linkages with the Department of Social Protection, there are specific reasons to believe that an individual's circumstances have radically changed.  There is no targeting based on medical condition or otherwise.  As stated by the Minister of State, Deputy White, even if we were bizarre enough to want to do that, we do not have the capacity to do it.  I can categorically assure members of the committee that is not happening.<\/p><p>  In regard to the National Ambulance Service, NAS, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, introduced guidance targets in January 2011.  At that time, the service was not organised in such a way as to be able to meet those targets and since that time continuous investment and reorganisation has been producing a steady improvement of performance against target times.  I resent the suggestion that there is any pretence about the performance of the National Ambulance Service.  This data is published monthly in the HSE's performance reports.  The fact that we are engaged, at a time of extraction of significant investment in health care from almost every other sector, in very substantial increases in investment in the ambulance service, resources, training and personnel, is a signal that we do not believe that without that investment or reorganisation the ambulance service can meet the demands that are placed upon it.  There is no suggestion anywhere, either at this level in the HSE or in the leadership of the NAS, that the service is currently organised to do everything that is required of it.  There is no definitely no sense of pretence.  <\/p><p>  Some of the changes that we have introduced include, the introduction of immediate care vehicles which now carry 74% of those on into hospital transfer.  In the past, emergency ambulances were used for this purpose.  The incremental centralisation of the control system to enable the resources to be used dynamically where ever they may be is important.  The intention is that as this rolls forward the national control centre, which is being developed with input and guidance from then National Association of Chief Officers of Ambulance Services in the UK - we have been done this path before - will bring about a significant improvement in deployment.<\/p><p>  On the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service, with no pun intended, there is an awful lot more heat than there is light in the discussion on this issue thus far.  The Dublin Fire Brigade, which we fund for this purpose, operates 11 emergency ambulances in Dublin.  The NAS operates 28 emergency ambulances in Dublin and, in total, 50 in the former eastern health board area.  The Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance is an important contributor but it is by no means capable of description as Dublin's ambulance service.  The NAS out-classes it in terms of scope and scale in almost every respect.  I wish also to ensure that members are aware that the NAS response time in the most recent monthly data for Clinical Status 1 ECHO calls, for which the target is 70% the response rate was 75.27%.  The Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, supplies the NAS with activity statistics in respect of on-call, volume and response times on a monthly basis, one month in arrears.  The most recent data, in terms of the same standard of Clinical Status 1 ECHO calls, in respect of which the target is also 70%, shows that the response was 58.4%.  There has been much inaccurate information in this regard.  The Dublin Fire Brigade is an important contributor but it is no means the exemplar that some people suggest it is.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned by the notion being put about that there is some kind of agenda for a HSE take-over.  I remind the committee that I was appointed as final head of the HSE.  I am winding up the HSE for the Minister.  There is no land grab going on.  What we want to do is ensure that one of the legacies is an appropriately structured National Ambulance Service.  It will not be a HSE ambulance service but a National Ambulance Service.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on the need for a national ambulance authority.  I am sure that following this exercise we will have a National Ambulance Service appropriately governed as hospital groups and so on.  There is no selfish organisational corporate agenda.  We are happy that the city manager for Dublin City Council has initiated the review.  We are working with him in that regard.  It does not make sense to have a control centre in the centre of Dublin, with the NAS resources being managed by controllers on one side of the room and the Dublin Fire Brigade resources being managed by the controllers on the other side of the room, with little interaction between them.  That is not a good use of resources.  I am sure that if we could find a way through this review to manage those resources in a more co-ordinated manner the people of Dublin would have a combined ambulance service, which would be much better.  Let us retain a sense of proportion.<\/p><p>  That having been said, I in no way diminish the impact of ambulance service delays, such as that outlined earlier or by other citizens.  The purpose of the ambulance reforms under way is to ensure a better service.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300012#N00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396519200,"counter":707,"content":"<p>On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question, I am aware that the Rare Disease Patient Organisations appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago.

There are a number of questions taking in issues from Mr. O'Brien's opening statement to the committee, particularly the events in Portlaoise and what is happening there.  In the opening remarks it was indicated that there is now a policy of open disclosure regarding the sad and tragic events that took place in Portlaoise.  Is it envisaged that this will become a national policy?  I know it was piloted in some hospitals in recent months and years.  What is the vision for such a policy?  The research indicates that in dealing with people in a humane fashion and with issues like litigation, there is a positive impact if a policy of open disclosure is followed when there are unforeseen mishaps.<\/p><p>  The witnesses may be aware that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, recently had a survey on the clinical and midwifery work force, with data taken in February this year across 19 public maternity units.  It has indicated the appropriate and safe level of care for women and expectant mothers is one midwife for every 29.5 women.  I am alarmed to see what the figures have indicated, with Portlaoise the worse case at a ratio of 1:55.  It is followed by Mullingar, the Rotunda and my own local hospital in Waterford, which has a ratio of approximately 1:36.  The national average has one midwife for every 40 patients.  What is happening in this regard?  How are the standards and recommendations of the HIQA report arising from the death in Galway of Ms Savita Halappanavar being implemented across the 19 public maternity wards in the country?  All expectant mothers and their families want reassurance on this and the results of the survey carried out by the INMO are quite stark and frightening for people.  I would like some update in that regard.<\/p><p>  Will the witnesses give an update on how the hospital groupings are proceeding and how service reorganisation is happening?

I will stick to three questions and perhaps I might be able to get some more information.  I was disappointed with the response to Question No. 25 as it did not constitute a reply.  I asked if the Minister had considered the cost for the introduction of a nicotine replacement programme for pregnant women.  The response did not even touch on the cost.  I have raised the matter a number of times and I am fully aware of other measures that seek to prevent people smoking.  There are 21% of pregnant women still smoking and there are no statistics indicating how many of the 10,000 smokers receiving support have succeeded in giving up smoking.<\/p><p>  Professor Luke Clancy appeared before the committee a few weeks ago and I asked him a question about pregnant women who smoke.  I queried if, with his expertise in respiratory illnesses, he believed nicotine patches for pregnant women would be better than a woman continuing to smoke.  He told me they would be 100% better than anybody putting a cigarette in a mouth.  He indicated that women who smoke would be better off using patches.  I acknowledge that the Minister's response indicated that the patches are given free in England through a general medical scheme.  I will submit the question again about the cost of these patches.<\/p><p>  There was another question regarding primary care health centres.  My area takes in Inchicore, Ballyfermot, Drimnagh, Crumlin and the Liberties and there has been a very significant response to the primary care centres.  People are overwhelmed by the condition of the facilities and quality of the service which is provided.  My concern is with the centre on Curlew Road.  A response was sought from the HSE in January regarding the planning application and that is still awaited.  When will the response be received?  The development cannot go ahead unless Dublin City Council gets the required information.  People living in the Crumlin and Drimnagh area welcome this primary care centre but the response from the HSE is required sooner rather than later.  We are now four months in and the issue must be pushed on.<\/p><p>  My final question concerns the proposed new national children's hospital.  Yesterday I read an article in a newspaper indicating the planning application must be pushed to 2015 but is there any truth in that?  There is much local frustration about this as we all thought the planning application would be made in September.  Has there been purchasing of facilities outside the complex to help move along the development?  Will the witnesses confirm if a site on Davitt Road has been purchased by the HSE to facilitate ambulances and the information technology section of St. James's Hospital?  What about the site on Brookfield Hill, as I cannot find anything about it?

The Deputy is 100% correct in that it improves patient safety and reduces the amount of litigation.  The patient safety agency will be formed and the chief executive job is to be advertised shortly.  The agency will play a significant role in helping patients who have complaints, from those which some may see as less important to the most important.  Any complaint from a patient must be pursued to his or her satisfaction, and a patient safety agency will help them do that.  As we have seen with Portlaoise, people have one blockage after another put in their way and end up totally frustrated before going to the law, which creates tremendous expense and stress for families and, ultimately, the taxpayer, as we will have to pay the costs in the end.  I am deeply disturbed that with one recent year, from &euro;60 million paid out in medical legal claims, &euro;20 million went to the legal profession.  I have no fight with the legal profession but I want the people who suffer harm to get the money rather than those in the legal profession.<\/p> <p> Mr. O'Brien can give an update on hospital groups, as well as on Portlaoise and the INMO figures on midwifery.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about a number of issues, some of which I will have to refer to the HSE.  I can comment on the Davitt Road site.  A site was purchased on Davitt Road.  The purpose of purchasing it is to reduce any planning risk on the St. James's site, which is minimal but exists.  I cannot say what precisely is planned to go on it at this juncture; I do not know if that has been decided yet.  The delay in planning is true.  I am told it will be delayed for a couple of months but, due to parallel processes, we will still have the commissioning of this hospital in 2018.  The Deputy also asked about nicotine patches for pregnant women.  I will ask the Department to carry out a costing exercise.  Dr. Devlin is here and while it is not precisely his remit, but it would be loosely in that area.  He will talk to Dr. Fenton Howell, who is head of our tobacco unit.  I agree with the Deputy that it is terribly important to protect the unborn child from the hazards of tobacco.  Mr. John Hennessy will reply to the question about the primary care centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300013#O00500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396520400,"counter":717,"content":"<p>The Dublin South Central area was prioritised in the stimulus package for primary care centres, and the Crumlin site is targeted there.

We mentioned this at the last meeting.  That commences next week.  There are 27 applicants to be considered to add to the current vacancy factor of ten posts in that institution.

Today is the first time that we have seen the real figures but they are only in respect of HSE hospitals and do not deal with the voluntary hospital issue.  We can see that there are 250 wholetime equivalent posts consultant vacancies at present which is 12% of the total consultant workforce.  Let us take the voluntary hospitals which have another 500 consultant posts and apply 12% to them which means there are possibly 300 consultant posts vacant at present.  What strategy will be put in place to deal with the issue?  There has been talk about making sure we have a comprehensive health service but in order to do so we need people to provide the service.  One of the key components to providing the service are consultants.  When one adds the number of posts vacant, including senior house officers and registrars, the total is 462.  Three years ago I highlighted the fact this was going to happen.  Based on the percentage rise per annum that has occurred over the past three years then we may end up with between 15% and 20% of posts not filled.  What strategy is being examined to deal the issue?  When will we see the strategy change implemented?  <\/p><p>  With regard to Question No. 8, I wish to raise the issue of absenteeism.  I understood previously that we were going set a target to reduce absenteeism down to 3%.  The reply that I have received seems to indicate that we must  accept and live with the current level of absenteeism.  Absenteeism rates are not reducing but vary between 1.3% for medical staff, 4.64% for management and administration staff and 5.36% for general support staff.  We compared replies received from other State agencies but we did not compare absenteeism rates with the voluntary hospital sector.  From the figures that I have received from the voluntary hospital sector it is obvious that absenteeism and sick levels are around 3%.  Why has there been no real change in percentages?  Let us look at the graph in the reply that I received to question 8.  It shows a sudden rise in absenteeism and sick leave levels in August, September and October.  Why did the level increase for those three months?  The same applied to the month of January.  Has the issue been examined?  <\/p><p>  The total absenteeism rate for 2013 is 4.73% which means 4,730 people, on average, are absent from work in the HSE every day.  Absenteeism is a major issue but there does not seem to have been any progress made to resolve the matter in the past three years.  Why the variation, particularly in cases where there was 1.3% in one area and 4.64% in another area?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300015#Q02700","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1396521000,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Finally, I call Senator John Crown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300015#Q02800","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1396521000,"counter":755,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  I am speaking slightly out of turn because I misunderstood the procedure for dealing with the questions this morning.  However, I shall make a few very general points.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister's unveiling of the White Paper on universal health insurance.  I look forward to studying it, collaborating with him and working on it in the years to come.  It is something that I have advocated for 20-odd years.  I have spoken about health insurance over the years and I have always editorialised about the three problems with the health service in Ireland and that is being unequal, inefficient and of poor quality.  I have heard a great deal of stress being put on addressing the equality issue which is correct.  However, it is the quality issue, in particular the poor and mediocre quality of the service delivered to public patients over the years, which is the key pathology that must be addressed.  That must be the first priority.<\/p> <p> In addressing this, and perhaps pre-empting some of the criticisms the Minister will encounter, I think it is fair to state that built into this kind of plan, where at present a big chunk of tax money goes into paying for a health system which will now be paid for in a different way, is that the tax take goes down by exactly that amount.  It also means that those within the public service who are making their living out of that part of the tax will seek alternative employment, in many cases, in the new health system or in some other service entirely.  This is because it is in the logic of an insurance-based system, even the kind of social democracy-based insurance system I would espouse, based on a principle of social solidarity.<\/p><p> As a little throw-away remark about the high qualify of our medical graduates internationally, I would say, with great respect to the Minister because this is not his fault, we have high quality medical graduates despite, and not because of, our medical schools where one has six medical schools for 4.5 million people, which is twice the European average, and where one has a total - an aggregate - of I believe 60 consultant level people employed by those medical schools, or ten per school, in contrast to Harvard Medical School which has 1,500.  One has to ask how the schools regularly get recognised by the international authorities with such dismally poor levels of clinical staffing.<\/p><p> I am going to say something, which I am sure will be the provocative thing to state today.  One of the reasons we have such high quality is unfortunately that the shortage of consultant staff means that our junior doctors get to practice on patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300015#Q02900","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396521600,"counter":757,"content":"<p>Representatives of our medical schools are not here to defend themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300016#R00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1396521600,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I am not attacking our medical schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300016#R00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1396521600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I know but I am making that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300016#R00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1396521600,"counter":760,"content":"<p>Am I, as a public representative who was elected by a university group, one of whose constituent colleges I am making an editorial comment about, to be prevented from bringing to the committee any expertise and experience I have over 20 years because of some highly theoretical argument that some legal department or PR department in a medical school some place might have an objection to it?

It was piloted in the north east but, for some reason, that pilot was discontinued.  The company which did it has taken that expertise, developed the software and is now doing it under contract on a routine basis in the United Arab Emirates.  Would it not bring specific advantages to us here?<\/p><p>  On the issue of hospital boards, the reply to my query about the ambiguous nature of our hospital boards is that at present, if I understand it correctly, these are separate independent entities which exist under a separate part of corporate governance with whom the HSE has service contracts.  I would say to the Minister and Mr. O'Brien with respect that I think there is a world of difference between the kind of service contract the HSE may well have with some place like the Beacon Clinic to give a certain specific service, such as dialysis or some other service, or perhaps to contract something under the National Treatment Purchase Fund under service contracts to other private entities, to the situation that applies where a big public hospital, which effectively has monopoly status in the area where it does its business, is entirely funded by the health service.  I do not believe we can basically exculpate them from having any answerability or responsibility to the HSE, the Department of Health and to the health service because they exist under some separate corporate structure with whom we have in theory a cancellable commercial relationship.  We all know that is not the case.  The Minister or Mr. O'Brien can no more tell St. Vincent's hospital or the Mater hospital tomorrow that they will no longer do business with them than it could completely \"undefund\" St. James's Hospital or Blanchardstown hospital.  <\/p><p>  This goes to the core of what happened.  The chairman of the board of St. Vincent's hospital stated that it would consider appointing public interest directors to the board.  In the name of God, if the current board is not acting in the public interest, in whose name is it acting?  I think we all know in whose name it is acting, and it is not in the public good. <\/p><p>  This unbelievable fiasco that is now occurring with the B contracts will be a loss for public patients when private patients are clogging up their waiting lists, a loss for private patients who will have decreased access to private hospitals and a loss for public hospitals which may well find it as an increased burden on them.  It is great for people like me because I am on the old contract and will have fewer people competing with me, so do not think this is self-interesting talking.  The only group which will benefit from this developing fiasco, which was brought down on the heads of the patients and doctors of St. Vincent's hospital by the actions of the board of the hospital, are the insurance companies which will make fewer payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300016#R00700","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1396521600,"counter":763,"content":"<p>Senator Colm Burke raised a number of issues around consultants, NCHDs, training and levels of staffing.

While one likes to have as many staff as possible, it is the same argument in regard to teaching.

I will mention that when I come to the conclusion of my remarks.  In the course of the engagement that we have to have on the draft contract, this particular clause, which has been described as a gagging clause, is one that we will clearly have to address.  I think we may well be persuaded that it should be reworded.  Conceivably, we may well be persuaded that it should be removed.  However, we cannot have a discussion with ourselves on this, and I now come to the Chairman's point.<\/p><p>  We cannot negotiate with ourselves.  We cannot say all of these things are on the table but, as I said yesterday, there is nobody sitting at the table.  On three occasions, I have invited the representative bodies of the general practitioners to meet me in regard to the draft contract.  I did so on 31 January, when I met them in person, by letter on 27 February, if my memory serves me correctly, and again last week on 26 March.  I want to have the real and meaningful engagement the IMO, for example, has said correctly is necessary on this, the so-called gagging clause and a number of other issues it has raised with me.  In fairness to the IMO, it has made a submission in regard to the draft contract which would be the basis for our addressing the issues about which it has concerns.  However, it would be much better if we discussed it across the table.  I again invite the representative bodies to meet me.  <\/p><p>  I repeat that if there is any question in anybody's mind that it is my intention, or that of the HSE, the Minister, or the Government to gag general practitioners or to, in some way, prevent people from advocating, for example, on behalf of their patients or from exercising their independent professional judgment, they are wrong in that impression.  That is not our intention and we can deal with in negotiation when we get to the table and address it as with all the other issues in the draft contract.  I keep describing it as a draft contract.<\/p> <p>I can understand the media to some extent.  The desire for the rhetoric of back and forth is always understandable, and I do not criticise that; we are in the political world and words come and go.  The fact is, however, that when we put out a draft contract in January, that was our proposal in terms of the direction we see the thing travelling.  It was not the last word and was never intended to be the last word.  Sometimes when I meet general practitioners, I have to explain to them that this is our initial offering for debate, discussion, engagement and negotiation.  I repeat that we must resolve this together, in terms of having a contract in place that is in the best interests of patients, citizens, the HSE, the health system and doctors themselves.  <\/p><p> On the bureaucracy question, I understand the point that was made in that respect.  I have been in GP surgeries and people have pointed out to me the amount of paperwork, e-mails and general administrative work that doctors are being asked to address.  Data on population health is a hugely important element of what we need to do in the future in primary care.  We need good data.  The unique patient identifier legislation is going through the Oireachtas at the moment and in order to manage the health of the population in primary care, we need good data.  In that context, we seek the co-operation - and make no apologies for it - of general practitioners and other professionals.  This is also about the configuration of resources in primary care.  The doctor does not have to be the person who does all the administrative work.  Doctors argue that they need resources, and of course there is an issue with resources, but we do not want doctors sitting at a computer all day long.  We want the doctor doing the work that the doctor is trained to do.  It is an issue of how resources are configured within general practice.  I  can see that myself when I visit people and I can understand the issue.  However, there will be an element of administrative return in general practice no matter what model we adopt.  Anyone who looks at international best practice in primary care will see that data collection and return is an enormous part of that.  Once we get the proper IT systems in place, it will get easier as we go along.  The hard part is at the start but once the systems are in place, it will be possible for it to work in a smooth way in the future.  Consultation, engagement and negotiation is what we need to do with regard to the draft contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300016#R01500","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396522200,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Carter to speak on the issues around consultant staffing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300017#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396522200,"counter":773,"content":"<p>If we start with NCHD staffing, there are currently 4,900 NCHDs employed across the 48 hospitals.  The majority - I believe around 80% - are on recognised training schemes.  Generally, there is no recruitment issue or difficulty in that context and, in fact, there is quite a degree of competition to get onto those schemes.  Therefore, the main recruitment issue lies with the hospitals without training recognition which are employing service grades.  In terms of the issues raised by the Senator, a survey of NCHDs identified three main concerns.  The first was working hours, with certain NCHDs working very significant hours.  The second was a perceived lack of training and support, either from the medical school or from the consultants, and the third was a concern about career opportunities.<\/p><p>  In terms of moving forward this year, an accelerated effort was made last year and in the first three months of this year to reduce the number of working hours for NCHDs.  Last year the target was 68 hours and our target by the end of this year is to be compliant with the working time directive, at 48 hours.  The main piece in the last three months was removing the requirement to work shifts of over 24 hours, and that has happened.  The other piece in terms of actions this year is to move away from automatic reliance on NCHD deployment and to start, in certain instances, to replace the NCHD workforce with a direct consultant workforce, particularly in areas such as anaesthesia.  The aim would be to also increase the number of training posts, thereby increasing the attraction.  We are setting a trajectory that our workforce will have some degree of stabilisation by year end, to be achieved by working-hour reductions, consultant replacement and certain tasks being undertaken by the nursing fraternity.  However, it is still an area of tension and difficulty.  There are active international recruitment campaigns going on to try to attract our extremely good medical staff.  This is about us making sure we can retain staff while also recognising that many other Western countries are conducting very vigorous recruitment campaigns.<\/p><p>  On the question of the recruitment of consultants, at hospital group level we have been examining the posts for which we have had difficulties recruiting staff with a view to restructuring them to make them more sensible and attractive.  That is happening in some of the smaller hospitals in particular, where, without a link to one of the national tertiary centres, the post is unattractive.  That is true of at least 25 posts as we speak.  It is felt that this will yield an attractiveness which will enable us to fill those posts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300017#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Carter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396522200,"counter":774,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms McGuinness to deal with the questions on absenteeism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014040300017#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396522200,"counter":775,"content":"<p>In terms of absenteeism, we compared ourselves both nationally and internationally because the health service provides a 24-hour service and we wanted to determine whether a target rate of 3.5% is actually achievable in a 24-hour health-related service.

The contract documentation is very different and the relationship is different.  St. Vincent's University Hospital is regarded as a public sector employer, as per section 38.  In common with other instances that have emerged through the section 38 audit, we have uncovered a number of hornets' nests around the place.  These have been aired here and at another committee.  The current issue with St. Vincent's University Hospital is one of trust and transparency.  At a point in time we were advised in writing that only a handful of public consultants - that is, those without rights to practice off-site - were working in St. Vincent's private facility and that this only occurred in rare and exceptional instances of critical patient care need.  Obviously, one would have to accept that such instances could arise.  However, what has emerged in correspondence within the last month is a very different story, with dozens of consultants routinely practising in the private hospital and a series of legal arguments advanced in support of that.  Our position is very clear.  Whatever pretext or grounds have been developed, consultants have been appointed through an approvals process on the basis that they would be public consultants.  It now appears that the St. Vincent's Group is seeking, effectively, to operate its private hospital substantially on the back of that provision, where the primary employment is a public employment funded by the tax payer.  We will not do anything to jeopardise ongoing patient care, but this does fundamentally impact on our future relationship with that hospital if this situation pertains.  We certainly could not see our way to sanctioning further investments in that hospital.<\/p> <p>As Senator Crown correctly identifies, one cannot just be pulling the plug from hospitals that are contributing very significantly to the totality of our health care environment, but we need to return to a position where we are no longer operating on the basis of trust because trust, once given and not reciprocated, tends to disappear very fast.  We need absolute transparency.  There is a new interim chief executive officer of the public hospital.
