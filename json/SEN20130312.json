The protest was attended by a number of people because there is great concern that the front desk will be closed and transferred to Naas, where all queries regarding TB and other issues that arises in respect of the services will be dealt with.  These services are invaluable to the farmers of County Roscommon and surrounding areas and include, for instance, paperwork for EU payments, animal passports, issues relating to TB testing and so on.  There is no substitute for face-to-face contact in these matters as the help of experienced local staff is invaluable and often can prevent small issues escalating into big problems.<\/p><p>I strongly believe the downgrading of this busy and effective service would have negative consequences for the farming community of County Roscommon and urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to maintain the facility at its current level.  I also appeal to the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, to get involved in this campaign and to use its powers and exert its influence.  The farming community contributes more to the IFA than to the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association and the former should use its clout to prevent a downgrading of services.<\/p><p>If the Minister is not available, the Leader should get the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to come into the House to consider the blow to the people of north County Roscommon on the announcement this morning that the Garda headquarters in Boyle, County Roscommon will be closed between the hours of 6 p.m. and 10 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200003#B01000","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1363098600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Law-abiding people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200003#B01100","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1363098600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>This is a major blow to the people of that area from a security perspective.

I would like very much if we could have a debate at an early opportunity about last week&#8217;s decision in the High Court on the issue of surrogacy.  Others have referred to the matter in this House, including Senator Norris.  It is one of those areas where we should not wait to see what the Government comes forward with but because this is a very sensitive and complex issue we as a Seanad should examine the issue ourselves.<\/p><p>  There are many different issues to be considered.  I am concerned about the emotional minefield that is involved in surrogacy.  I am very concerned about the way the rights of children are treated in this case.  I am also concerned about the commercialisation of women, and particularly the use of power and the relative economic disadvantage between those who &#8220;commission&#8221; children, to use that word, and those who act as surrogates.  Many countries such as France and Austria have banned surrogacy and egg donation outright.  They were right to do so.  It has also been banned in countries such as Italy, Norway and Germany.  The European Court of Human Rights has upheld their right to prohibit surrogacy in their laws.<\/p><p>  The mood music, in so far as there is any from Government, is that it would legislate to permit surrogacy in some way.  We should have a debate on the issue rather than accept Government intentions as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  There are major human issues involved, in particular issues relating to children&#8217;s right to their identity and to know who their parents are, and as far as possible to be brought up by their parents.<\/p> <p>This is a children's rights and human rights issue and we should debate it soon.<\/p><p>I also support the calls made in this House last week by Senator Hayden for a debate on the funding of fee paying schools.  Frankly, I do not understand the begrudgery that exists about the right of parents to subvent the education of their children to a basic minimum level of funding for that education by way of the payment of teachers.  Already it is the case that private fee paying schools have higher pupil-teacher ratios.  The McCarthy report urges that the pupil-teacher ratio be 28:1.  In fact, that is saying that anyone who dares subvent their children's education by the payment of fees must go it alone completely.  That amounts to a form of bullying by the State and it discourages something we should encourage, the desire that some parents have when they have the resources to contribute to their children's education.  I support extra funding for children in disadvantaged schools so we can also enable them in the pursuit of excellence but the one-size-fits-all policy is not to be encouraged.<\/p><p>I regret the fact that Sinn F\u00e9in has activated a petition in the Northern Assembly to block a very sensible amendment that would ensure whatever procedures that are to be permitted would be undertaken on the NHS.  I am talking about abortion.  We have the bizarre situation that this move by Sinn F\u00e9in effectively facilitates an abortion privateer in the form of the Marie Stopes Clinic, which even by the standards of abortion providers, does not have a good reputation.  This is a cynical move by Sinn F\u00e9in and it is time the party stopped speaking out of both sides of its mouth, saying it is anti-abortion while doing everything to facilitate its provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200004#C01200","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363099800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>We have had many debates and discussions on job creation and high unemployment levels.

For those who do not know it, Dursey Island is one of the most remote and isolated parts of the country.  It was the last place the people who sailed from Cobh saw as they left Ireland on the <i>RMS Titanic <\/i>before the ill-fated ship hit the iceberg.<\/p> <p>A small number of people still live on this island, while many other islanders who moved to the mainland continue to have farms or land on the island.

We hear about rights for the diaspora and so forth but we must also look after our own people living in remote areas with the threat of being cut off.

While there is a pier, dangerous currents mean it is not safe to make the crossing, especially with animals, for as many as 200 days of the year.  I do not wish to be parochial but I believe I must make this appeal on behalf of those who have been fighting this battle for the past two years.  Everyone, whether he or she is from Dublin 4, Dursey Island or west Cork, should enjoy the same rights.  The people affected have a cloud of uncertainty hanging over them and are seeking nothing more than fair play.  They are entitled to access the island and use their lands and houses.  The common practice of bringing cattle, sheep and other farm animals back and forth on the cable car is being hindered, which is a form of discrimination against the people of the island.

On a recent stay in a Dublin children's hospital with my son, I was horrified to see the conditions to which parents and children are subjected.  Although the nursing care provided was second to none and the nurses were fantastic, I was alarmed at the cramped conditions in the hospital.  Patients share tiny rooms with two beds which are suitable for only one bed.  Extremely sick children are accommodated in rooms while their parents sleep on floors with less than 12 in. of space available to them.  This is totally unacceptable in 2013.  During my visit, no one had privacy and when a doctor wished to speak to a family, the other family sharing the room had to leave.  I also saw nurses step over parents to check on patients.<\/p><p>With regard to the parental accommodation available at the hospital, which I checked out, while I was grateful the hospital had accommodation available for parents, it was seriously deficient for parents who must stay in it for any length of time or who are unfamiliar with Dublin or have no other contacts in the city.  The facilities for parents to wash and shower were, I regret to say, absolutely appalling.  The ceiling of the shower that I saw was covered in black mould.  I took a photograph to show to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  Notwithstanding the state of the economy, conditions in our children's hospitals should not be allowed to slip while we wait for a new children's hospital.  <\/p><p>Some \u20ac39 million has been spent on planning and designing a new children's hospital on the now defunct Mater Hospital site.

One is entitled &quot;CAO shake-up to take heat out of points race&quot;.  The CAO is simply a device by which a scarce number of university places are allocated among people about to sit the leaving certificate examination, and that is all it is.  The article states, &quot;The initial step will be a dramatic reduction in the number of courses available to [new] CAO applicants&quot;.  As with so much in education these days, this provision comes courtesy of six quangos, a virtual alphabet soup including IUA, IOTI, SEC, HEA and NCCA.  I am sure there are more in the wings.  The bodies are against specialised courses and want to reduce the number of options on the basis that it will reduce stress.  There are so many <i>non sequiturs<\/i> that it is hard to know where to begin.  Points are a good guide to how students perform, and a lack of points is a good guide to suggesting who will not be able to cope with third level.  The CAO is inexpensive and is certainly preferable to interviews, letter writing or representations, as we know in a society that is so wedded to clientelism.  The degrees meet the standards of international external examiners.<\/p><p>  We should not present false dawns to people who are studying hard for their examinations.  We wish them every success.  So much does not hang together in the three pages of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> that one would be worried if any students were taken away from their studies by bothering with it.  A lack of points is an indicator that life will be difficult.  Getting points is, of course, difficult, but the number of places we are trying to allocate at third level is lower than the number of applicants.  The CAO, founded by a former Provost of Trinity College, Mr. Bill Watts, is the equitable way to do that.

Figures published by the Commission for Energy Regulation show the number of houses that are connected to gas and electricity meters.  They also show that 2,479 domestic customers had their gas supply cut off between July and September last year.  In addition, 4,181 households had electricity disconnected in the third quarter of 2012.  Over the past two years, gas and electricity prices have risen by an average of 30%, with further increases likely later this year.  A total of 6,572 homes had their gas supply cut off in the first nine months of 2012, more than the total for the previous year.  Similarly, 12,854 households had their electricity supply cut off in the first three quarters of 2012, in addition to the almost 17,800 customers disconnected during 2011.  The issue about the property tax is not how it should be collected but about the people who do not have the ability to pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200008#G00700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1363101300,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200008#G00800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1363101300,"counter":62,"content":"<p>What about all the households who cannot afford to pay a property tax?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200008#G00900","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1363101300,"counter":63,"content":"<p>That is provided for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200008#G01000","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1363101300,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200008#G01100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1363101300,"counter":65,"content":"<p>To tell this House that there were no options is completely untrue.

The City of Dublin VEC and SUSI must clarify some issues that are cropping up in the offices of many Members.  There is one that arises in Donegal, where many of the people go to college across the Border.  A number of them were told that their fees and maintenance grant were covered, but a week or even three or four months later they were told they were not covered.  In one case I am dealing with, the girl concerned intended to study pharmacy in Belfast.  She was told that her fees would not be covered but that she would get her maintenance grant.  However, a week later she got another letter stating she would not get her maintenance grant.  This is a feature of SUSI and the Minister must address it.  The only explanation I can offer is that the people who are processing the SUSI applications have not been properly briefed on the issue of fees across the Border.  Obviously, 90% to 95% of the applications they deal with relate to colleges in the South.  However, we have documentary evidence that people are being told in a letter received one week that they have a maintenance grant and possibly fees covered, but the following week they receive a letter stating the opposite.

What has characterised the Government in this regard since the general election two years ago has been inaction and indifference.  When we first proposed the Family Home Bill in this House in July 2011, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, proclaimed how the code of conduct on mortgage arrears was working exceptionally well and that there was no need for such legislation, and those were his exact words.  Following that, we produced the Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill in October 2011.  We then produced the Regulation of Debt Management and Advisors Bill in May 2012 but all we have had from the Government is the Personal Insolvency Act which the Minister hopes will be up and running by July.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh highlighted some of the rises in costs for families, including energy costs and so on.  The shambles of the property tax and what is expected of people in terms of valuing their houses is further compounded by the fact that we were able to rush through legislation for a property tax but it has taken us two and a half years to bring in personal insolvency legislation which puts the banks completely in control.  Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach if he trusts the banks to deal in an honest and a fair way with the mortgage crisis, which has been going on for so many years?  Some 182,000 mortgages are in arrears out of a total of 942,000 mortgages.  All we have seen is complete inaction.

The petition is a misuse of a good provision that was included in the agreements.  The petition of concern was included in order that no community could find itself totally out-voted by another.  This is not such an issue because it transcends politics and parties.  I regret that it has happened but accept that it is democracy.  I also accept that the party is entitled to adopt whatever position it wishes.

Some of the people are elderly and live in homes that need repairs which they cannot afford and the same applies to the disabled.

This sends a strong message to students, parents and society at large about the seriousness of some of these issues.<\/p><p>Last week, I delivered a speech to the European economic and social committee in Brussels in which I proposed the idea that empowerment through education is a more effective tool than centralised policing.  In this regard, we can get too carried away and point the finger too much at the various social media networks. <\/p><p>In the story to which I referred, 28 young lives, plus the life of a teacher, were impacted upon and have been needlessly interrupted.  There are two main problems, as I see it.  One is a societal problem of how we will deal with bullying and how we can stand up to bullies - and that is not just on the Internet.  The second is a technological problem of how we can employ methods to tackle online bullies.  As regards both these problems, I believe that empowerment through education could have a beneficial role.  It would empower young people to break from the herd, click the report button and have the content removed, thus ensuring that the juvenile actions of one person do not spoil the lives of many others.  <\/p><p>Unfortunately, bullying has always occurred and cyberbullying is just another form of it.  The issue of eradicating bullying remains as difficult as ever and new technology merely provides another dynamic.  The bully is no longer the obvious boy or girl in the classroom because social networking facilitates any individual in the privacy of his or her own home to partake in bullying that is much more difficult to police.  We need to empower and educate young people to work online without fear of the same negative behaviour that we can all encounter in ordinary life.  <\/p><p>On previous occasions, the Leader has been asked to facilitate a debate on this matter.

Can we take a balance into account when we automatically accept EU directives?  There is a need to do something in this regard.  I met a group of business people here the other day whose businesses are likely to go just because of one decision.  It may well be that the State and taxpayers benefit from having an EU directive on public procurement which says that we must buy the cheapest or best no matter where.

Consequently, the city was unable to enforce it.  That decision may mean that the indoor smoking ban in New York is also illegal.

We are against the reduction in the number of Deputies just for the sake of having a reduction in numbers.  Essentially, this is about saving money.

Understandably, he is busy.  In his absence, I made the point that merely reducing the number of TDs, abolishing the Seanad, merging - as he put it - the local authorities, for example, Waterford, reducing the number of councillors and reducing the number of local authorities is all subtraction.  Cutting the numbers is the broad thrust of what the Minister has given us but he has not really dealt with the reforms, in terms of where the real problems are.<\/p><p>One of the big problems is that the Executive has far too much power.  A small group of people have far too much power.

It makes no sense whatsoever to pull small fragments of counties into different constituencies, for example, parts of east Carlow into Wicklow, part of south Tipperary into west Waterford, part of east Meath into Louth and parts of west Meath into Meath West.  Strange configurations and changes have been made, and then more profound ones of which we know in the Border counties, all because of the terms of reference with which my party does not agree.<\/p><p>My party would have preferred to see a move to have increased seat constituencies, for example, six-seat constituencies.  That would achieve greater proportionality and there was an opportunity to do so in some constituencies.  It is one of the positives at which the Minister has looked in the case of local government reform.  There will be five, six and seven-seat wards, and perhaps even bigger, in local authorities and that will be good for proportionality and ensuring there is diversity in representation.  We need that at national level as well.  My party will support the Fianna F\u00e1il amendment and opposing the section for the reasons I outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200019#S00700","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363106700,"counter":252,"content":"<p>The renaming of constituencies is an ongoing problem.

I was listening to my colleague, Senator Cullinane, who I think has a point.  When a decision is made to put an issue before the people, there is a certain implication that there is a desired outcome.  Whether one has a referendum on an issue, such as gay marriage or the abolition of the Seanad or the reduction of judges pay, the very decision to put an issue before the people involves the identification of it as an issue on which there ought to be a decision.  That in itself implies a value judgment.  My question relates to the decision to allow the people have a say on whether the Seanad will exist into the future, which as we all know can only be taken by a referendum.  Given the initial commitment to reduce the number of Deputies by 20, and not by eight as is proposed in the Bill, what is the reason for that decision?  Senator Cullinane said one can cut salaries and expenses and, in addition, reform the D\u00e1il by cutting the number of Deputies.  It is certainly arguable that compared with other countries of a much larger population we have a higher ratio of Deputies to members of the population.  It has been advanced by Government that the reason the number of Deputies is to be cut by eight and not by 20 is that it would require a constitutional change to cut the number of Deputies by any more than eight because the Constitution provides that there must be a Deputy for every 30,000 and no more than one Deputy for every 20,000 people.  If it is possible to ask the people to determine the future of the Seanad by way of a referendum, why was it not also possible to follow through on the promise to cut the number of Deputies by 20 simply by availing of the referendum means which the Government is already contemplating in the context of election reform?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200023#W00700","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1363108200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>The proposed reduction of the Members of the D\u00e1il by 20 members was not included in the programme for Government, while the proposal to abolish Seanad \u00c9ireann is.

We have gone to the limit of what we are allowed to do constitutionally - that is, to 29,040 per Member of the D\u00e1il on the next occasion.  We might have gone down from 158 Members closer to 153 to allow for that, but some latitude is given to the Electoral Commission to get over some of the difficulties that have been mentioned in the course of this debate.

His own county and County Donegal were badly affected, but there is no easy way of doing it when one is distributing population under that criteria per elected Member, in line with the terms of reference, while remaining within the limits of the constitutional requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200024#X00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1363108500,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I am open to correction by the Minister, but my understanding is that the reason given as to why it was not in the programme for Government was that it would require constitutional change.

Prior to this, the axes 3 and 4 rural development programme, RDP, measures were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU with the remaining 45% coming from national Exchequer sources.  The 2011 agreement reduced the national Exchequer input to 15% on a net basis for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU.  This resulted in a reduction in the overall programme complement from \u20ac427 million to approximately \u20ac314 million on the basis of the programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013.<\/p><p>In this context the original project allocations given to each local development company, LDC, contracted to deliver the Leader elements of the RDP, including the allocation for Gaeltacht areas, required readjustment.  The Department is currently carrying out an exercise to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all RDP measures to complete the rebalancing of the programme in as equitable a way as possible.  In addition, given the levels of spending by the LDCs from 2009 to date, it is highly unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013.  The co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond the end of this year and as a consequence, the overall programme requirement will also change.  Until such time as the rebalancing exercise as outlined has been satisfactorily completed, it is not possible to be definitive regarding amounts of funding available for project commitments under axes 3 and 4 of the RDP.  I do, however, expect this exercise to be completed shortly.<\/p><p>Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, the LDC contracted to deliver Leader funding to Gaeltacht areas in 2009, went into liquidation in September 2011.

While this took some time and is still ongoing, almost all Gaeltacht areas now have access to Leader funding through the LDC in the geographically contiguous area.  My Department is working with these LDCs to determine the fairest and most equitable way to distribute funds to Gaeltacht areas, including the consideration of the provision of a separate allocation for these areas in the future.

In a nutshell, this is a very old school that was built in 1909 and in May 1998, its board of management made an application for a new school building on the advice of a senior official of the Office of Public Works, OPW, because it had outgrown its original purpose.  On 7 December 1999, a report was made by a school inspector to the effect that the school should move to a new site.  Subsequently, the then Minister for Education and Science, who I believe was Deputy Miche\u00e1l Martin, indicated that a new school for Summercove, Kinsale, was a priority.  In September 2004, the OPW placed a notice in the public press seeking a suitable site for a new school for Summercove.  Various proposed sites were submitted and one such site was located directly across the road from the existing school.<\/p> <p>However, the local landowner was not prepared to sell or dispose of that site.  In March 2007, the individual put forward a proposal that he would sell a site at Summercove crossroads for the purpose of a new school.  The site was examined by a senior architect from the Office of Public Works, OPW, who gave a favourable report on this issue.  The then board of management submitted a planning application under planning reference 0711917 to Cork County Council.  Unfortunately, in a decision made in December 2007, the county council refused the aforementioned outline application on the basis that the site at Summercove crossroads, Ardbrack, Kinsale, was not zoned for educational purposes.  This was an absolute cop-out by the county council and a dereliction of its social duties to provide planning.<\/p><p>In April 2009, an Adjournment debate took place in the Seanad in which my former colleague, Deputy McCarthy, and I participated.  I stated the school in question originally was built as a two-teacher school with a small number of pupils.  However, over the past 25 years or more, the population of Summercove has increased and at present, 212 pupils attend the school.  At the time of that debate, one of the school's prefabs was 26 years old and the Minister conceded it was the oldest prefab in Ireland.  A second prefab was 20 years old, while a third was ten years old.  The 26-year old prefab was subsequently replaced by the Department of Education and Skills.  At that time, the Department had been paying rent of \u20ac53,000 per annum for prefabs and while I believe this may have been resolved subsequently, it indicates the ludicrous situation that was allowed to develop.<\/p><p>In 2011, the school's board of management had a meeting with the county manager to ascertain whether the planning process could be advanced and eventually, after two planning applications, the board of management in its frustration found it had come up against a brick wall.  It had considerable difficulty in getting planning and despite numerous efforts by me in the past and by previous Ministers, this planning permission was not granted.  I understand the existing Summercove school building was examined by departmental professionals from its technical section on Friday, 18 January 2013 and as a result, it appears as though the Minister now has decided to remove the construction of a new school for Summercove from the building priority list, while citing the fact that no planning permission exists.<\/p><p>Although I have no axe to grind with the Minister of State, I believe this again is a sort of cop-out because the need is so great.  The Minister and his senior officials, in conjunction with those in the OPW who are trying to acquire the site, as well as officials of Cork County Council, should have worked together to provide or obtain a new site.  I understand the farmer involved had offered two different options.  Some of the grounds on which Cork County Council turned down the site were superfluous and not real or genuine.  I will make this point carefully because I do not wish to point and have never pointed a derogatory finger at any official of Cork County Council, the OPW or the Department of Education and Skills.  However, it appears to me and increasingly to the teachers in the school - who received an awful kick in the backside because of this decision - its management board, which has done tremendous hard work behind the scenes, the parents and more particularly the pupils, as though there has been collusion of sorts between all the various agencies.  This school, which has developed rapidly, is a wonderful school and the Minister of State may not be aware it has the second highest academic record of any school in the whole of Munster, being 10% above the average.  This is the reason that over the past 25 years, it has expanded from being a small school to one which probably now has ten or 12 teachers.<\/p><p>There has been an announcement concerning the possible construction of a new school in the heart of Kinsale, where there are issues with traffic problems.  While I wish that project good luck, it would be wrong to ignore the plight of the pupils and teachers who are living in atrociously difficult conditions.  I hope the Minister of State will have good news for me from the senior Minister in the Department, Deputy Quinn, that he will reverse the decision and instead of removing the project from the building list, he will redouble his efforts to ensure a site is obtained, planning permission is expedited and construction of the new school will be included in the new programme encompassing the period from 2013 to 2018.  I would be highly upset to be obliged to return to my constituents, particularly the parents, children, hard-working teachers and those involved in the board of management, to state the plan, about which they were complaining to me in 2003, is now likely to go beyond 2020 with no hope of a resolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200026#Z00500","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363110300,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position on a proposed new school building for Summercove national school.  The school has applied to the Department for large-scale capital funding for a new school building.  The school is currently located on a half acre site and an alternative greenfield site is required for a new school   In the context of the co-operation by the Department of Education and Skills with local authorities in identifying suitable sites for schools, the Department has worked with both the Office of Public Works and the local authority over a number of years in an effort to identify suitable sites for the construction of permanent accommodation for the school.<\/p><p>The Senator might find it helpful if I set out the context within which decisions relating to meeting the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years are made.  Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 by 2018 - more than 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary level.  To ensure that every child has access to a physical school place, it is vital that there is sufficient school accommodation available to cater for these pupil enrolments.  The delivery of building projects to meet the increasing demographic demands will be the main focus for capital investment over the duration of the five-year plan, particularly in those areas where it has been identified that most demographic growth will be concentrated.  In this regard, Kinsale has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth.  Pupil enrolment projections for Kinsale indicate that enrolments will remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>Officials from the Department's building unit met with Summercove school authorities in January 2013, as Senator O'Donovan explained, to explore the options that might be open to the school to improve its existing accommodation.  Subsequently, a member of the Department's technical staff visited the school to examine the possibility of addressing the school's most urgent needs.  However, the option of providing some permanent accommodation to replace the school's temporary accommodation and to address traffic management on the site does not appear possible due to the restricted nature of the site.  The Department accepts therefore that a new site is required.  However, given the need to meet demographic growth, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.  In this regard, it is not possible to indicate at this point when a building project for the school will be progressed.

I wish to ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation whether plans are in place to provide stronger legislation to prevent multinational retailers inflating their Irish prices in comparison to their UK prices.  It is my belief that the price discrepancies are fundamentally unfair and poor corporate practice.  In both the short and long term, they are damaging to our economy, as each euro that is taken out of circulation in terms of disposable income is, in effect, a euro that will not be spent elsewhere.  That is in addition to the obvious difficulties created for retailers who are losing out on business to the UK in circumstances where the same product can be bought at a much lesser price there even with the cost of transporting it.  There is a knock-on effect for jobs in this country.<\/p><p>  I am in favour of open markets and competition and yet with such consistent price increases across so many retailers in this country relative to the UK, increases which cannot simply be discounted by a disparity in labour costs or freight costs, I cannot help but wonder whether competition is working as fully and effectively as it should.  I have written to the Consumer Association of Ireland and to the various retailers who were originally highlighted by a journalist who did some good work for <i>The Sunday Business Post <\/i>approximately two weeks ago on the issue.  As yet, I have received no reply.  There is no compulsion on them to reply to me.  This is a serious problem which is worthy of the Minister&#8217;s time and attention.  I would be grateful to hear whether there are plans to deal with the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200029#CC00300","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1363110600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  The question posed by her as to whether there are any plans to introduce legislation to tackle higher prices charged by traders in this jurisdiction as compared with prices charged in the neighbouring UK jurisdiction seems to presume that price control measures can protect consumers from what may be perceived as high or unjustified prices.  In so far as the general issue of tackling high prices is concerned, price control measures are not an effective means of reducing prices.  During the 1970s and 1980s price control was used as one of the primary tools for combating increasing consumer prices and inflation.  Various analyses of that period have shown that price control was an ineffective way of tackling high prices, as in many instances maximum prices prescribed for goods very quickly became minimum prices with the result that inflation during that period rose close to 20%.  In addition to failing to tackle high prices, price control also effectively acted as a disincentive to businesses becoming more efficient and further prevented justified price rises arising from legitimate cost increases incurred by business.  It was for that reason that the Consumer Protection Act 2007 essentially repealed the legislation which allowed for price control and there are no plans to revisit the matter.<\/p> <p> As regards differentials in prices for goods in this jurisdiction when compared with prices in the neighbouring UK jurisdiction, there can be legitimate reasons for prices to differ, such as exchange rate movements, different distributional costs, etc.  Notwithstanding this, I do not doubt there may be instances where the level of the differential in prices charged for the same goods in the two jurisdictions cannot be justified by reasons such as exchange rate movements.  In such instances, it is important that consumers use their discretion.  I read the article to which the Senator refers and it is interesting to note a comment made by Mr. Mark Gould of MG Consulting who states: <ul><br>Everyone is on the web, you can see what a retailer is charging in Britain versus the Republic, so why everyone hasn't responded to that transparency I don't really understand.  Retailers that get caught on this only have themselves to blame.  <\/ul>We all have access to the Internet and consumers can exercise their power.  Their price sensitivity can determine purchasing behaviour, particularly as it relates to conspicuous consumption.<\/p><p> In contrast to the price control era of the 1970s and the 1980s, Government policy in the area of prices has been focused on the promotion of competition and consumer awareness, given that freely functioning competitive markets are more effective at setting fair prices.  In so far as promoting greater consumer awareness of prices is concerned, the Consumer Protection Act 2007 specifically mandates the National Consumer Agency to promote public awareness and conduct public information campaigns on issues such as prices.  The agency has been very active in raising awareness of prices in a number of different areas.  Evidence available to it shows that consumers are becoming more price conscious and changing their shopping habits to achieve better value for their money.  It is the case, therefore, that competition and price awareness among consumers are more effective tools to tackle high prices than the price control policies of the past.<\/p><p> As regards general price trends, the consumer price index published by the Central Statistics Office shows that prices in Ireland rose by 1.2% in the 12 months to January 2013, whereas the corresponding index in the UK, the retail prices index, shows that prices there increased by 3.3% in the same period.  At the European level, the harmonised index of consumer prices, which is the accepted measure for comparing price trends across the European Union, shows that prices in Ireland increased by 1.7% in 2012 as compared with an increase of 2.3% across the Union and 2.7% in the United Kingdom in the same period.<\/p><p> I am firmly of the view that consumers, by exercising the power they command, are better placed to ensure they get a fair deal than any legislative intervention that would seek to regulate the prices traders charge for goods and services.  Accordingly, by informing themselves as to the different offerings in the marketplace and being strategic in their shopping decisions, consumers can help to ensure they achieve the best value for their money, which is all the more important in the current economic climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200029#CC00400","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363110900,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

I seek clarification concerning the payment to farmers of grants under the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  When will these payments be made?  A large number of farmers in my local area, for example, in Athenry, Loughrea, Gort, Tuam and Kinvara, have been waiting for an unacceptably long time to have payments furnished to them.  I understand farmers in the Galway East constituency are not alone and that numbers awaiting payment run into the thousands.  Most of those affected are in an uncertain position and it is a source of frustration to them that payments are being held up for reasons that are not clear.  The farmers in question have co-operated fully with the conditions of the scheme and are to be commended on the patience they have shown thus far.  Farmers require certainty, however, regarding when payments will be made, given that in the current times they must manage tight farm budgets.<\/p><p>I am aware that administrative problems arose in the AEOS 2 scheme but the matters were resolved after some time had elapsed.  It is clear that more targeted action must be taken to prevent a repeat of these problems.  It is vital that farmers receive their AEOS 2 payments immediately and that all payments are made without undue delay.  Farm incomes have declined significantly in recent years and in the current times the option of subsidising their income by securing off-farm employment is no longer available.  For this reason, the types of financial supports provided under the agri-environment options scheme are vital for ensuring the continuing success of local community focused farms.  In the circumstances, I ask the Minister of State to confirm when the payments will be made and seek an assurance from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that he will undertake to ensure all payments will be made in a timely manner in future.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200031#EE00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1363111200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins for raising this matter and convey the Minister's regrets that he cannot attend this debate in person.  To set the context, the position is that payments by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the agri-environment options scheme, or AEOS as it is commonly known, are well advanced at this stage.  Before discussing the details, I emphasise the commitment of the Minister and Government to the agri-environment schemes, namely, AEOS and the rural environmental protection scheme, as operated by the Department.  The schemes put environmentally friendly farming to the forefront and recognise the vital role farmers play in delivering public goods in protecting the environment and natural heritage for the benefit of society as a whole.  This commitment is evident in the fact that despite serious budgetary pressures facing his Department, the Minister opened AEOS to new applicants last year.  In this regard, an additional \u20ac20 million was made available annually for five years to fund new applications under the scheme.  This ongoing commitment is also evident in the fact that more than \u20ac750 million was spent by the Department on agri-environment schemes in the past three years alone, with a further \u20ac200 million available in 2013 under both REPS and AEOS.<\/p><p>There are currently almost 30,000 participants in REPS and their contracts will continue until expiry of the five year contract period in each case.  The successor to REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, is a more targeted agri-environment scheme for which funding is provided from modulation funds under the Common Agricultural Policy health check.  As Senators will be aware, AEOS specifically targets three challenges that have been assigned the highest priority at European Union level as needing urgent action.  The format of the scheme is a menu type approach, as distinct from the whole farm approach adopted under REPS.  It consists of actions which can be demonstrably linked to the three important challenges targeted.<\/p><p>There are approximately 15,000 participants in AEOS 1 and 2, which were opened to new participants in 2010 and 2011, respectively.  The EU regulations governing the scheme and other area based schemes require that a full and comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system, is completed before any payment can issue.   Previous EU audits have made it clear that compliance with the regulations must be strictly adhered to and all checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met before payment issues.  This means payment cannot be released until all aspects of a farmer's application are in order, all outstanding documentation provided and all queries resolved.  These requirements are a significant administrative challenge, albeit one that the Department has successfully addressed. <\/p><p>The current position regarding payments under AEOS is that under AEOS 1, all outstanding payments due in respect of both 2010 and 2011 have been finalised.<\/p> <p>Of the 7,500 participants remaining in that scheme, nearly 6,500 have received payment in respect of 2012.  The remaining cases are being cleared on an ongoing basis as queries are resolved.<\/p><p>There are 6,250 approved participants in AEOS 2, 5,300 of whom have received a payment in respect of 2011.  The outstanding cases are being finalised as outstanding queries are received.  Applicants have been informed of these outstanding queries and payments are being made on an ongoing basis as responses are received.<\/p><p>Last year saw the first full-year payment for AEOS 2 applicants.  In order to activate payment where non-productive capital investments were selected, a valid capital investment claim form was required.  The high level of queries and farmer delays in submitting valid claims has resulted in a lower than expected level of 2012 payments under AEOS 2.  In all, 2,500 have received payment at this stage.  There are a large number of queries arising.  To deal with the outstanding queries, additional resources have been directed to this area with the intention of clearing the backlog as soon as possible.  The majority of the outstanding payments relate to applicants who chose a capital investment option, such as the planting of trees or hedgerows, on their AEOS contract.  Under the scheme, payment for these options commences in 2012.  In order to be paid for 2012, farmers must have submitted valid receipts.<\/p><p>Approximately 1,000 farmers have not submitted any claim form to date and of those who did, a very high percentage had queries which require further contact with the farmer.  For these farmers, no part of their 2012 payment can be issued until they submit their receipts and the outstanding issues are resolved with them.  The Department has contacted farmers who have not submitted claim forms at least twice, including where possible by phone, and is now dealing with replies received and outstanding queries.  Where applicants have received correspondence in this regard, they should respond as soon as possible.  On the basis of responses received from letters that have issued and the phone calls made by officials in the Department, the Minister aims to ensure that all outstanding cases are resolved in the shortest time possible.<\/p><p>As I have mentioned, AEOS 3 was opened to applications at the end of 2012.  The funding of \u20ac20 million per annum that the Minister has provided will allow for approximately 4,000 new participants to be approved.  The Department is currently processing the applications with a view to issuing approvals in the next few weeks.  It is expected that payments will commence towards the end of the year.<\/p><p>I reaffirm the Government's commitment to the agri-environment schemes.  The Minister is at all times conscious of the importance of the payments to farmer's incomes.  He asked me to convey that he will ensure that his Department continues to make every effort to expedite all payments under these schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031200031#EE00300","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363111800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

The reality is that quite a number of farmers have completed their application forms properly and would have expected to have been paid out in a timely manner.
