It followed a very useful meeting that we had, and I thank the Minister for acting upon that.  I understand that the housing agency report has been complete since July but it remains unpublished, and I rely on leaked information from <i>The<\/i><i>Irish Times <\/i>article published on 14 September which reported that Traveller accommodation targets have not been fully met at any point since they were made mandatory on local authorities 18 years ago.  The article in <i>The<\/i><i>Irish Times <\/i>goes on to say that the leaked report concludes that anti-Traveller prejudice at local authority level may be hampering progress.  If the intention of Government policy and the current legislation is that targets for Traveller accommodation would be met in full and that things would improve it is clearly failing.  It is failing Traveller women, children and men.  The report commissioned by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government finds that more than &euro;55 million provided for Traveller housing remains unspent since 2000, and just 68% of promised Traveller accommodation units have been provided.  All the while, Travellers continue to live in shocking conditions, which I have seen myself at first hand.  <\/p><p>There is unacceptable overcrowding on halting sites.  Figures from the Department show that the number of Traveller families in need of accommodation since 2000 has more than doubled.  In this new leaked report, local authorities agreed that overcrowding was an issue, leading to health and safety concerns.  All stakeholder groups agreed that the future assessment of the needs for Traveller families was unfit for purpose.  The second anniversary of those who died in the Carrickmines fire is coming up.  More people will die in tragedies if these concerns are not addressed.  People will continue to live shorter lives and suffer from housing related ill-health.  I ask the Minister of State what will be done about all of that.<\/p><p>According to the 2016 census, the Traveller homelessness rate is 11 times higher than the general population.  In the last five years the rate of Traveller homelessness has tripled.<\/p> <p>The leaked report also finds that the private rented accommodation provisions are extremely difficult for Traveller families to access.  Often discrimination and prejudice are getting in the way.  People are rejected based on their names alone.  It is a landlord's market, as the Minister of State knows, yet some local authorities use private rented accommodation as the alternative to staying on waiting list for Travellers seeking access to Traveller-specific accommodation.  Figures show a rise from 162 families in 2002 to 2,222 in 2016.  This has rendered increasing numbers of families homeless, further fuelling the crisis.  Most Traveller-specific housing and social housing in general is provided by local authorities using the Part VIII planning process but the leaked report further found that the most significant obstacle to the delivery of Traveller accommodation is the planning process itself, particularly objections from settled residents and elected representatives, as the Minister of State well knows.<\/p> <p>I note and welcome the Minister's decision to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998.  However, there must also be a review of legislation that affects Travellers in order to alleviate the crisis.  For example, the recent amendment to the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which facilitated developments of more 100 accommodation units being dealt with directly by An Bord Plean&aacute;la without going through local planning processes, could also include Traveller accommodation.  Legislation should be introduced immediately to implement this change and decisions to approve specific proposals for Traveller-specific accommodation should be taken away from the local political system and invested in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>There is, at best, systemic apathy and, at worst, prejudice in terms of meeting the accommodation of Travellers.  An indication of the apathy towards Travellers and their accommodation is reflected in the participation in this leaked review, as the Minister of State knows, where only 26 out of the 31 local authorities responded to the survey and only 22 submitted with sufficient detail across all questions.  Significant gaps were found in local authority reporting and inadequate data-keeping.  In some cases, there were no standardised recording, reporting and monitoring mechanisms.  Indeed the deadline for reporting to the Housing Agency, which the Minister commissioned, was extended twice to facilitate poor responses.  Will the Minister of State tell us when the Housing Agency review will be published and his plans to address the issue raised in the report and the major crisis for Travellers and their housing needs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700002#A00500","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506504600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kelleher for providing me with the opportunity to update the House on the Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, review which was recently completed and provided to the national Traveller accommodation committee, NTACC.  A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to establishing a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities' Traveller accommodation plans and consult stakeholders on key areas of concern.  This commitment was underpinned in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness which provided for the commissioning by the Housing Agency, on behalf of the Department, of an expert, independent review of expenditure on and delivery of Traveller accommodation to underpin the work of the special working group.<\/p>  <p>In 2016, the Housing Agency commissioned the review, which examined capital and current funding for Traveller-specific accommodation for the period 2000 to date, having regard to the targets contained in the local authority TAPs and actual units delivered.  It also examined the current status of the accommodation funded and the funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.  Where targets in the TAPs have not been met, the review included an analysis of the underlying reasons to identify the particular challenges that need to be addressed to underpin future progress.<\/p>  <p>The final report was completed and submitted to the Housing Agency in June and it, in turn, submitted the final report to my Department in July.  It was circulated to the NTACC members, considered by a subgroup of the NTACC and discussed at the most recent meeting of the NTACC on 28 August.  At this meeting, the NTACC agreed to advise me to establish an expert group to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.  This is in keeping with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government, and I have agreed to proceed with the establishment of this expert group.  I have also agreed that a review of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 should be part of the work of the expert group.  The composition and terms of reference and methodology of this expert group are being formulated with a view to it being in place as soon as possible.

I agree with the Senator that if one analyses many of the local authority waiting lists, one sees there is a difficulty for people from Traveller backgrounds, so we need to address that.  Likewise, they have different issues as well.  Some of them want to live in different places, so we need to accommodate that as best we can.  There is no excuse for money not being spent.

The Minister of State is very familiar with this issue.  I know he has visited Donegal a number of times and met affected families.  He knows it very well at this stage.  Even though it had limited terms of reference, the expert panel report, which was published almost four months ago, clearly demonstrated that there was a profound failure in State oversight of the manufacturing of concrete blocks.  There was also a failure in building control regulations.  Looking at the eight recommendations, it can be seen that they clearly point to a failure in State oversight.  What does that mean?  According to this report, and based on my own evidence in Donegal, it means that thousands of families in Donegal were profoundly failed by the State.  The biggest investment a family will make is, of course, the purchase and securing of the family home through a mortgage or loan.  It is a huge investment.  They have been left not just with unsafe homes but also with this financial distress.  It is deeply distressing for the families.  This expert panel report was delayed by one year.  This is another year of distress, worry and not knowing what is going to happen.  We are now a further four months down the line.  All I am asking for is that the families affected in Donegal and Mayo receive the same support from this State as did families in Dublin and north Leinster who were affected by pyrite.  We are just asking for equality of treatment and equality of support from the State.<\/p>  <p>There is no more time for dragging heels.  The Minister of State knows what needs to be done.  We need a redress scheme in order that families can make their homes safe.  I have spoken to families in Donegal who are worried that the bison concrete slabs between their floors could come down on top of them.  They are worried that their gable could collapse.  The Minister has heard these stories as well.  We must do something about this.  There must be financial supports for families who are already paying a mortgage.  They have seen their houses devalued profoundly, so in the vast majority of cases they do not have the financial capacity to do it themselves.<\/p> <p> The State needs to step up here.  It failed in its responsibilities.  The concrete block is the core component of the family home in Ireland.  Not ensuring those blocks were manufactured to a proper safe standard and that building control measures were right and proper was a huge failure.  It is a collective failure of our State and we need see collective responsibility being taken.  Now, four months after the publication of this report, I urge the Minister of State, please, to put in place a redress scheme for the families in Donegal and Mayo who desperately need the Government's help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700003#B01000","speaker":"1400","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506505200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank both Senators for raising this important issue.  It is one that affects many people and one that has been raised weekly by colleagues from all parties.  I reiterate that it is important we all realise it is an issue on which we must all work together to resolve as best we can.<\/p>  <p>I acknowledge the very difficult and distressing situation that certain home owners in Donegal and Mayo face on account of damage to the structural integrity of their homes.  I have seen some of these damaged homes first-hand and have met home owners in both Donegal and Mayo and understand what they are going through.  The will is there to try to help people through this difficult phase.<\/p>  <p>I understand clearly the difficulties they face.  I firmly believe the parties responsible for poor workmanship and the supply of defective materials should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies to affected home owners.  The Senators may reread the report and see what it says exactly because it does refer to defective materials.  That is the root cause of this problem.  The expert panel on concrete blocks was established by my Department in April 2016 to investigate problems that have emerged in the concrete block work of certain dwellings in counties Donegal and Mayo.  I will not go through the panel's terms of reference again but it was about trying to establish the number of houses in question.  We now know roughly the breakdown in Mayo and Donegal.  Much good work has been done in gathering that information by the different action groups and sharing it with the expert panel.  I ask people to continue to do that and to identify themselves if they have properties in which they believe mica or pyrite is present, because that helps us formulate our plans.  A major part of the work of the expert panel and the reason it took time was to work out a process on how best to address these houses and remedy the problems, including the technical solutions involved, which is the key part.  Most of the residents who have engaged with it understand the process.  We are all annoyed that it took longer than we had hoped, but we understand the processes we had to go through. The Senator referred to other schemes, and similarly there were formulas used there.<\/p>  <p>I received the report of the expert panel in June 2017.  It is comprehensive and addresses all areas of the terms of reference.  On 13 June 2017, I published the report.  It has eight recommendations.  My Department has already taken action to implement recommendations 1 and 2 as priorities.  Having spoken to the residents of affected houses, they understand the process and that recommendations 1 and 2 are key to their situation.  The others apply more to the future but are not the main issues for the residents currently affected.  We had to prioritise recommendations 1 and 2, so that is what we are doing.<\/p>  <p>With regard to recommendation 1, the testing and categorisation protocol, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, technical committee, established to scope and fast-track the development of a standardised protocol, held its inaugural meeting on 11 September 2017 and has scheduled several further meetings for the coming weeks.  I am pleased to hear its work is progressing well.<\/p>  <p>With regard to recommendation 2, the competent professional oversight, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland about the establishment of a register of competent engineers for home owners' or affected parties&rsquo; reference.  Engineers Ireland provided assurance that it will collaborate with the Department, the NSAI and others on measures to establish such a register.<\/p>  <p>On 19 July 2017, I visited Donegal and met key stakeholders.  Many public representatives from all parties attended that meeting.  I met affected home owners and members of groups working with them and other interested parties.  We discussed the publication of the report and its recommendations.  I explained the importance for me as a Minister in this area of the priority in implementing recommendations 1 and 2.  Regardless of how these solutions will be funded or who will step up, and I referred from the start to the many stakeholders involved in this, we must establish the protocols to do this properly.  That is the number one issue.  The residents understood that, as did the local councillors.  We are doing this as quickly as possible.  I also visited Mayo some weeks later and had similar discussions with stakeholders there and urged all the various groups to come forward with their plans in order that we can identify the numbers.<\/p>  <p>I fully appreciate and understand the urgency of this matter.  I understand that some people have suffered a lot in recent years and that they want solutions, but I want to be clear that as a Department, we are on this matter.  We are implementing recommendations 1 and 2 and will then consider how best we can drive this on and solve the matter.  The first thing is to identify the technical solutions and the process.  I cannot emphasise this enough.  I will not jeopardise this by making a commitment that they will be finished in a week when it will take a few months but the expert panel is there from the NSAI and there are good people with experience on this matter dealing with it.  I am happy we will move this on quite soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700004#C00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1506505200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Senator Conway-Walsh has one minute in which to ask a brief supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700004#C00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1506505200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to Mayo.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators and councillors, it is with a heavy heart we meet.  There was a time that when Ministers gave a commitment, it meant something.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State now presides over what is now the Department of broken promises.  During the Fine Gael leadership campaign, the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, sat where the Minister of State sits now and promised councillors &euro;5,000 in expenses annually and a pay increase of &euro;1,000 starting on 1 July.  He was adamant about the time.  We were told it was written into legislation.  The Minister of State will be aware this has not happened.<\/p>  <p>I appreciate that the Minister of State has only got his feet under the desk and we wish him the best in his role.  I am aware of his previous work and I know he is a hard worker and comes with that reputation.  I have great hopes.  I implore him to give me a date for when the pay increase will start.  That is the simple question he is here to answer today.  When will the expenses kick in and will there be back pay to the date from which the increases were promised?<\/p>  <p>We are haemorrhaging talent from councils.  In the Minister of State's electoral area, a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor was replaced in recent days.  In my own county of Westmeath, there was a Fianna F&aacute;il co-option in the previous week.<\/p> <p>The week before that there was a Fianna F&aacute;il co-option in Offaly.  Those are only three of which I am aware.  I am sure it has happened in other parties too.  I implore the Minister of State to take a stand on this issue in his new Department.  I ask that he would hold his head high when he leaves office and say he did the right thing by councillors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700004#C01800","speaker":"1411","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506505800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  It is disappointing in many ways that we are back here discussing this same issue despite, as my colleague, Senator Davitt, outlined, the promise that was made about its resolution.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree we are fortunate to have so many hard-working local authority members throughout the country.  The problem is due to changes made by Mr. Phil Hogan when he was a Minister.  The workload of county councillors and the geographic area which they have to cover is now, despite their best efforts, nearly impossible.  In my constituency of Cavan and Monaghan, in the past 18 months to two years we have had a turnover of three or four councillors.  All of them cite the same reason, which is that they simply cannot do the work of a local authority member properly and hold down a job at the same time.  I am sure this does not come as a foreign language to the Minister of State.  I am sure he has the finger on the pulse himself and that he knows what I am saying is correct.<\/p>  <p>We are less than 18 months away from the next local elections.  I believe I speak on behalf of all local authority members and Senators when I plead that the issues alluded to by my colleague, Senator Davitt, should be grappled with once and for all.  Otherwise we will continue to lose good people.  As a former local authority member, I am convinced there is no element of democracy closer to the public than the county councillor.  Unless we do something to address the issue, we will lose more people.  I spoke to many county councillors who are seriously considering their position because they cannot afford to do the work and travel to regional and local meetings while holding down a job at the same time.  I therefore request earnestly that the Minister of State grasp the issue and address it once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700005#D00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1506505800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>This is a good opportunity to outline the current position with regard to councillors' pay and conditions.  I thank Senators Davitt and Gallagher for raising it.  I think Senator Davitt was a little melodramatic in calling the Department the Department of broken promises.  A commitment was given and it is still intended that it would be honoured.  There was a time not that long ago when the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as it is now called, would be able to make the decision itself, but now it requires joint approval with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is where the issue rests at the moment.  In terms of dates and times, it is my intention that it would be finalised before Hallowe'en and that it will be backdated to when it was originally due to be implemented.<\/p>  <p>The Senators are correct in terms of councillors leaving office.  I have come across it myself.  It is occurring much more regularly in recent years.  The major contributor is the workload involved while trying to continue with a full-time job or rearing a family.  These are huge issues.  I recently met Women for Election with a view to looking at some of the examples that were mentioned, and I also met some councillors in my constituency.  Senator Davitt mentioned the retirement of Councillor Anne Ahern in Carlow, who received a significant promotion.  I am not sure she would have been able to continue anyway.  However, I acknowledge her work in Carlow County Council over many years.  She was a very effective councillor.<\/p>  <p>Senator Gallagher raised the anomaly between city councillors and county councillors.  It is proposed that the city councillors will get the same increase as county councillors.<\/p>  <p>Effective local government structures are an essential part of our democracy.  I was a child councillor myself 20 years ago.  In turn, effective local government cannot be achieved without the heard work and commitment of elected members in service of their communities.  A range of financial supports are in place to assist councillors in their work.  These include the representational payment, fixed annual expenses, a travel and subsistence allowance, a mobile phone allowance, a retirement gratuity and conference and training provision.  A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to review the supports provided to councillors in consultation with representative bodies.  The former Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, met representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authority Members Association to discuss the view of their members that positive consideration should be given to improving the range of supports available.<\/p>  <p>In January this year, taking account of the considerable additional workload councillors have experienced since 2014 and the reforms of local government, the former Minister announced two important changes to support councillors in their role as public representatives.  First, a new allowance of &euro;1,000 per annum is to be introduced in recognition of the work councillors undertake in carrying out their reserved functions at municipal district level, and second, a new vouched annual expenses allowance of up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 is to be introduced, which councillors may choose to opt for in place of the existing unvouched rate of approximately &euro;2,500.  It is proposed that the allowable expenditure categories and documentation requirements of this new vouched system would be aligned, as appropriate, with the arrangements in place for Oireachtas Members.  While it was intended that these new measures would be implemented with effect from 1 July, the Association of Irish Local Government requested that further consideration be given to the terms and conditions that would apply.  I subsequently met a delegation from the AILG shortly after I assumed office myself to understand its views on the matter.  A particular concern raised, which I acknowledged, was to ensure appropriate recognition of the workload of all councillors at sub-county level throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>As Senators will appreciate, the introduction of measures of this kind requires the amendment of regulations made under section 142 of the Local Government Act 2001, which requires the consent of the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Draft amending regulations have been prepared and are under consideration between the two Departments.  While the matter is taking longer than intended, it is important that the measures are implemented from the outset in a manner that is fair to all councillors.<\/p>  <p>I thank the Senators for raising this matter and ask for their continued patience while procedural matters associated with the measures outlined are finalised.  I reiterate the intention that this will be resolved before Hallowe'en.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700005#D00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1506505800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I will speak on my own behalf and on behalf of other Senators, including Senator Mark Daly who got tied up on the way to the meeting here.

I have raised this issue with regard to junior doctors consistently over the past four to five years.<\/p> <p>In 2012, I conducted a survey of people doing their final medical examinations in Irish universities.  It indicated that more than 60% of them did not intend to work in Ireland once they had finished their internship.  A survey published in recent days indicates this number may very well have increased to 80%.  While we have had various reports going back to 2003, including the MacCraith report and the second MacCraith report, which dealt with training for junior doctors, we do not seem to be making any progress.<\/p> <p>I had to leave a meeting of the health committee with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to come here.  The committee received a report on training and development in the HSE for the first six months of 2017, which showed we are underspending by approximately 36% on training and development.  This concerns me because we want to retain junior doctors and we do not seem to be proactive in dealing with this.  I made the point at the committee that the HSE has recruited more than 2,000 administrative and managerial staff in two years.  We now have 17,000 managers and administrators in the HSE but, at the same time, we seem to have done nothing for the people working at the coal face, namely, junior doctors.  We have a major problem with smaller hospitals, which are finding it extremely difficult to recruit senior house officers, registrars and senior registrars, particularly in places such as Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar, Clonmel, Waterford, Tralee and even Limerick.  We need to address this issue, and it is for this reason I have tabled this question.  We need major reform in how we provide for this category of personnel in the HSE at front-line level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700005#D01500","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506506400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator who has been very consistent, dedicated and committed to this cause.  I commend this and I thank him for raising this important issue.  As a country, we invest considerable resources in training our non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  As recently as Tuesday this week, a report published by the RCSI highlighted that more than 80% of trainee doctors have said that working conditions, training opportunities, and work-life balance are factors that would influence their decision to leave Ireland.  Last Saturday, the Minister, Deputy Harris, attended for the second time the annual medical careers day, where he was struck by the enthusiasm of the students.  It is vital that we continue to foster a positive attitude and support these medical students during their time in training.<\/p>  <p>National Doctors Training and Planning, NDTP, in the HSE funds postgraduate training for trainees through service level agreements with each individual training body for the various specialties.  It also provides financial supports to NCHDs through two separate funding schemes for the costs involved in undertaking exams and courses.  The first of these is the clinical course and exam refund scheme.  NDTP provides funding of &euro;450 for mandatory courses or exams undertaken in Ireland and &euro;650 towards exams taken outside of Ireland.  It is recognised though that sometimes the costs of courses or exams will exceed this amount.  The second scheme is the higher specialist fund.  This fund is available to higher specialist trainees, including GP registrars.  In total there are approximately 1,500 of these trainees.  Trainees are entitled to &euro;500 per year of higher specialist training.  This equates to &euro;2,500 for those on a five year training programme.  The total number of trainees is now more than 3,700 and this number has grown in recent years.  In addition, the number of NCHDs who do not occupy training posts is growing.  The total number of NCHDs has increased by more than 1,000, to approximately 6,000 in the past three years.  While this increase is welcome, it must be recognised that the budget available to NDTP has to cover more trainees than previously.<\/p>  <p>The strategic review of medical training and career structure working group, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, published three reports in 2013 and 2014, and made 25 recommendations.  The need to support NCHD training was highlighted by the group.  I will mention some particular successes already achieved in implementing the MacCraith group&rsquo;s recommendations, including the appointment of lead NCHDs.  This role involves representing all NCHDs in their dealings with clinical directorates and hospital management.  There is also the improvement of the work-life situation of NCHDs.  The HSE has agreed to double the number of family-friendly training places over a three-year period, and the recruitment of additional NCHDs has meant significant reductions in working hours.  The Department remains committed to the full implementation of the recommendations of the group.  This includes recommendations relating directly to NCHD training needs and assisting in the recruitment and retention of key medical staff.  On this basis, it was agreed earlier this year that management and the Irish Medical Organisation would undertake a review of the continuing education requirements of NCHDs.  This review is due to commence in the near future and will be undertaken under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is important that we continue to improve the working conditions of NCHDs and support their training needs to the maximum extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700006#E00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1506506400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Perhaps we could get answers to this.  I thought the MacCraith report would resolve many of the issues, but we are not resolving them and, in fact, we are going backwards.  I am extremely concerned.<\/p>  <p>Another issue which has arisen to cause further problems is the number of doctors coming from abroad is not as plentiful as what it used to be because Ireland is no longer seen as an attractive training location for junior doctors from abroad.  They have other choices such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand and we are not competing for them.  We have a major challenge.  If we want to reduce hospital waiting lists we need to have enough people at the front line to be able to do so.

Cancer Week 2017 runs from 25 September until 1 October.  Since 1996, when the first cancer strategy was launched, Ireland has prided itself on providing a world-class cancer service which adheres to international guidelines and best practice.  However, we are hearing reports of a deterioration in the service, with delays in the commencement of chemotherapy programmes, at a time when we know that time is of the essence for oncology patients.  I have also learned of shortages of radiographers in St. James's Hospital which are resulting in surveillance scans such as MRI or PET scans to monitor the progression of cancer patients not being performed.  The scans were previously conducted on cancer patients on a quarterly basis to determine whether their treatment was working and whether they should continue with their chemotherapy programmes.  As such programmes are very tough on the body, this situation is both infuriating and stressful for families.  Many of the issues arise from staff shortages in the public sector, a matter I have raised in the House previously.  There are staff shortages in the armed forces, mental health services and so on.  The Public Sector Pay Commission recommended that an expert be appointed to address the shortages, but, to date, no one has been put in place and no solutions have been offered to the problem of staff shortages in the public sector.

The home of one man is not insulated.  He suffers from COPD and can barely breathe during the winter because of the cold.  As he is above the income threshold by &euro;6, he is not entitled to receive the fuel allowance or any of the ancillary benefits that accrue to those in receipt of it, including the opportunity in some areas to have one's home insulated.  The weather is turning and, given increases in the price of fuel and electricity, I ask the Minister for Finance to consider increasing the threshold for receipt of the fuel allowance or inserting into the legislation a special stipulation in order that the Department can exercise discretion in certain circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700007#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1506507000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I do not have a specific request for the Leader, but I wish to refer to a very important news item.  Ireland has been named as the country with the most secure food in the world.  This was announced yesterday at the launch of the sixth annual global food security index and is a remarkable achievement.  The news was published in the newspapers yesterday and again today.  The index measures improvements in food affordability, availability, quality and safety.  Ireland finished with a score of 79 out of 100, just ahead of Austria which had a score of 77.  The United States of America which had previously topped the list finished fourth.  France and Germany came third and fifth, respectively.  This remarkable story must be acknowledged.  The detailed reports contain a very interesting analysis and emphasise that Government support for agricultural research weighed heavily in Ireland's favour.  In that context, I refer to Bord Bia's food strategy, Making a World of Difference.  Bord Bia does great work and its strategy is outlined in a booklet which was published in 2016.  I am delighted to say it is also included in the programme for Government.  A lot of emphasis in placed in Origin Green on food security and organic production in the meat sector, as well as the vegetable and horticulture sectors.  We must acknowledge and celebrate this great achievement, particularly in the context of Brexit, as well as the great opportunities it presents on the island of Ireland, North and South.

The inhumane cuts to the numbers of home help hours and home care packages initiated by Fianna F&aacute;il and continued by Fine Gael have left the service in crisis which is not just manifest in rural Ireland but also in urban Ireland.  The nonsensical Fianna F&aacute;il policy of allocating just 30 or 45 minutes to households and elderly vulnerable persons and the drive towards privatisation mean that there are swathes of rural Ireland without a service.  In some cases, home help packages are being allocated, but the necessary personnel are not available to provide the service because it has been privatised.  This is an essential service, as acknowledged in many Government policy documents.  Home care packages need to be delivered in the home and the community.  In the forthcoming budget Sinn F&eacute;in proposes an increase in the number of home help hours by 20%, which would result in an additional 2.1 million home help hours being made available.  We are keenly aware that families have a variety of needs and that the provision of home care packages is essential.  In that context, we propose an increase in the number of home care packages by 15%, or 2,485.<\/p> <p>These measures would constitute an investment of &euro;72.65 million in older people and would go some way toward delivering for them and their families and ensuring they can live with the dignity and respect they have earned and deserve.  Not only are the measures the fair and decent thing to do, they also make sense financially as well as having the knock-on effect of alleviating pressure on acute hospital services through beds being freed up and thus the reduction of the trolley and waiting list crises.  Older people deserve such measures and Sinn F&eacute;in is on their side and is making it a priority for budget 2018.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to deal with some of the issues in relation to home care, home care packages, these not being a Government priority and there not being the personnel in many parishes in rural Ireland to deliver services to ensure elderly and vulnerable persons have the choice of living in their own homes.

It would guarantee one person, one vote for the election of the majority of Senators and thus end the injustice of some people having as many as seven votes while the majority have none.

Will the Government agree to engage with the committee in the spirit of reform and constructive engagement engendered by the result of the referendum four years ago?  Will the Government specifically focus on the Seanad reform Bill that remains on the Order Paper or a wider remit?

The boy's name was Gavin Coyne and his mother's name is Maria.  Gavin suffered from a condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy.  His mother has concerns about his treatment in Crumlin children's hospital and in the Mater hospital and also the treatment of her family when they relocated to Newcastle for further treatment.  She is not asking for anything for her family now as nothing can be done for Gavin, he having passed away at ten years of age.  He leaves behind a grieving family, classmates and friends.  However, his mother has questions in relation to how the entirety of care for children with such illnesses is handled in Ireland.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate in the House on cardiac care for children.  I ask that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, come to the House to speak not just to this issue and case but the general issue of the service that is available for such children.  I will write to ask the Minister to meet with the family but in the House it is more appropriate to address the general issue.  A young child has died and possibly unnecessarily so.

There have been many columns on the issue in newspapers over the past few months.  It has been very unhelpful to Cork and its development.  The issue needs to be sorted out and a conclusion reached one way or anther because, unfortunately, the continuous debate and commentary on whether there should be one local authority, whether it should be a large city or what is to happen to the region of Cork has taken away from its development.

We need some clarity on this issue.<\/p>  <p>The main thing I want to say is that I echo what Senator Neale Richmond had to say about the need for this House to have a really good debate on Ireland's approach to the future of Europe.  When one looks at Emmanuel Macron and his words yesterday, most of what he is proposing is deeply hostile to Ireland's interests.  It is about time people started saying so in public.  There are such-and-such class battleships and such-and-such class destroyers.  I refer to him and some other Heads of State as Bambi-class politicians.  They are photogenic and seem to be cleaner than clean, but they come from nowhere.  He is an accident of the French political system.  Were it not for the fact that the front runner for the Republicans in France made an absolute mess of his campaign, Emmanuel Macron would never have surfaced.  When push came to shove, his views on Europe were a minority view in France.  Some 80% of the votes cast in the primaries for the French presidential election were cast for people who radically disagreed with his agenda for Europe - the extreme left candidate and the two other candidates, including Marine Le Pen.  <\/p>  <p>It is about time that we stand up to the European federalists who are trying to push Europe down the road to a united states of Europe.  Guy Verhofstadt has written a book which says that we need to create a united states of Europe with a single army and a single this and a single that.  The great majority of Irish people are wholly opposed to these kinds of proposals.  Our Constitution prohibits us from participating, for instance, in European defence.  Let us get real for a change.  Let us have a real debate in this House, not a Punch and Judy show where those who are totally against Europe and those who are totally for a federalist Europe knock holes in each other, but a debate for the great majority of decent, sensible people who realise that Europe should continue as an intergovernmental partnership of nation states and who realise that is the model we want.  Let us have an opportunity for Members on every side of this House to express their views honestly on these issues rather than keeping ourselves, through some process of self-censorship, enthralled to people who have extremist views of a federalist kind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700010#K00800","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1506509400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I have just come from the Youth Work Changes Lives showcase in the Mansion House where the Minister, Deputy Zappone, addressed the crowd.  The Minister concluded her remarks referencing how proud the First D&aacute;il would be of the young people in Ireland today.  The youth population is growing and their needs and aspirations are changing.  They have expectations in areas such as equality, social justice, the rights of women and on the abortion issue.  GCN conducted a poll of 565 young people between the ages of 13 and 24 and 85% of individuals stated they wanted to repeal the eighth amendment, 10% did not know and 5% would vote \"No\".  Some change is inevitable.  I wonder, however, can Ireland move to a place of economic equality that supports our young people to prosper to achieve their full potential.  Employment, education, social protection supports, housing and mental health are all issues raised by organisations under the umbrella of the National Youth Council of Ireland today.  Their message, in the Mansion House this morning, was invest in our youth population and value their place in society.<\/p>  <p>Eleven thousand young people are long-term unemployed.  Mental health waiting lists are up 40% on last summer.  The poverty rate among young people is double the overall rate and 800 of those who are homeless are between the ages of 18 and 24.  We have to move to a place where young people have housing as of right, and have to respond to that right.<\/p>  <p>In the NYCI pre-budget submission, the total investment requested was &euro;153 million, all aimed at enhancing youth work services, halving long-term youth unemployment, equality for young jobseekers, tackling youth homelessness and greater investment in mental health supports.  The youth population will increase by 11.6% by 2025.  Investment in young people would not only make a difference now but would generate a social and economic dividend in the coming decade.  One million young people will live in this State come 2025.<\/p>  <p>I would encourage all Senators to visit the Mansion House.  The atmosphere is electric and young people are there to tell their own stories.

I spoke at length recently about paid parking in towns and villages, out-of-town shopping centres, and giving planning permission for out-of-town shopping centres and filling stations.  As far as I can see, it is unfair competition for those who are trying to run their businesses in the centre of towns and it is to the detriment of the centre of towns.  As I stated previously, they made the same mistake in England 15 or 20 years ago where it ruined the inner cities of Manchester and London.  We are putting shopping centres on the outskirts of big towns and villages and I have no problem with these coming along.  I note Aldi and Lidl are planning extensions.  I have no problem with them, but we have to think of the traders in the middle of these towns and villages who have customers coming to their shops who have to pay anything from &euro;1 to &euro;2 for the privilege.  Then these traders are paying high rates.  I have a simple way of solving this problem.  If the local authority gives planning permission for out-of-town shopping centres or out-of-town filling stations, they should scrap the parking charges - it is unfair competition - and let the multiple that is coming in subsidise the paid parking in the middle of the town.  That is the way they do it in England.

We have before us a number of proposals, including, at Second Stage, those of Senator McDowell and his colleagues.  However, we need to do this in a reasoned manner.  Just to put it on record here, every one of us in this Chamber is democratically elected under the Constitution.

I join with the Senator and all Senators in collectively working to ensure that we reduce the incidence of cancer among citizens, friends and family members.  It is important that we work together in the national strategy.  Whether it is breast cancer, cervical cancer or colorectal cancer, survival rates are improving.  I would ask all Members to look at the national healthcare quality reporting system survey for this year which points to the improvement.  There have been significant improvements in cancer screening and treatment services.  However, I agree with the Senator that we cannot be complacent.  If there are gaps or deficiencies then we must immediately fill those posts.<\/p>  <p>Senator Ardagh makes reference to public service appointments.  As the Senator spoke, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, was announcing permanent recruitment in the Defence Forces.  The previous Government ended the moratorium on employment in the public service.  The Government is employing people.  We have reopened Templemore.  We are hiring more garda&iacute;, doctors, nurses and special assistants.  There is a need to do a lot more, obviously, but it is important that we continue.<\/p>  <p>Regarding the fuel allowance, Senator Ardagh makes a good point.  I would hope that in the budget in a couple of weeks' time we will see an increase in the fuel allowance.  Senator Ardagh is correct that it is a 26-week payment to some of the most vulnerable in society who require to have their houses heated and who want, even in the month of July or August, to have heating on.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has made changes to the fuel allowance where one can have it paid in two lump sums.  There are 410,000 people in receipt of the fuel allowance at a cost of &euro;229 million per year.  It is a matter on which we need to see further changes.  I am sure the Senator will join with me in welcoming the changes made by the Minister in regard to the fuel allowance.<\/p>  <p>Senator Boyhan complimented Bord Bia on its food strategy.  The remarks the Senator made show that the country, when it is focused, determined and committed, can do quite well.  Ireland had a score of 79 out of 100.  Bord Bia deserves to be complimented and praised for its work on global food security.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Creed, come to the House in regard to the matter the Senator raised.<\/p>  <p>Senator Conway-Walsh made reference to the need for more home care packages.  The Senator will find agreement from all sides of the House that there must be investment in home care packages, whether it is home help hours or a combination of what the Senator spoke about.  All of us in politics recognise the importance of keeping people in their homes in their community and being treated at home, and the Senator will find no opposition from this side of the House in that regard.  None of us, certainly on this side of the House, wants to see a privatisation of the service.<\/p> <p>As our spokesperson on social protection, Senator Butler has been very strong in advocating on behalf of us with the Minister.  The point Senator Conway-Walsh makes is a valid one and I would be happy to support her in that regard.  <\/p> <p>Senators Grace O'Sullivan, Michael McDowell, Diarmuid Wilson and P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn referred to Seanad reform.  I discussed it yesterday.  There is no ambiguity regarding the Government position.  The former Taoiseach set up the implementation group.

Nobody wants to see an escalation or continuation of the debate.  What we need now is pragmatic compromise and discussion in a meaningful, polite and respectful manner whereby we can put aside our individual or personal differences and recognise the importance of Cork for its people and as a region of growth, employment, tourism and business.

It is a debate that we should have in the short term.<\/p>  <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of flooding in Donegal.  I again thank the emergency services, the first responders and the local communities in Donegal for their response and their work regarding the desperate plight of many residents in Donegal.  Of course, things can be done better, as the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, said in the D&aacute;il last night but the Government responded and was very proactive regarding the issue of flooding.  I would be very happy to take Senator Mac Lochlainn's comments back but I reiterate that there are schemes available for home owners, community groups and sporting and voluntary organisations.  The closing date for applications for funding is 30 September.  The point made by the Senator is that irrespective of politics, we need to see how we can respond better in all situations to tragedies.<\/p>  <p>Senator Norris referred to the issue of entitlements, expenses, letters and envelopes.  This is an issue for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and the Seanad CPP, so I will leave it at that.  <\/p>  <p>Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the Valentia Island ferry.  He might be best placed to raise it as a Commencement matter but I would be happy to allow for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House.<\/p> <p> Senator Gallagher raised the issue of the report of the review group on industrial relations structures in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was presented to the Government this week.  The Government has considered the report and has approved the drafting of legislation that will, when internal industrial relations mechanisms are in place, give the Garda Association access, by right, to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  It will be a priority for the Government.  The issue of Garda strikes is a contentious and sensitive one.  My personal view is that garda&iacute; should not be allowed to go on strike; they are defenders of the State.  I would, however, be happy to have the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to discuss the legislation when it is ready.  I commend the working group chaired by Mr. John Murphy, which made a number of recommendations on the future of industrial relations for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne congratulated Birdhill on its success in the all-Ireland TidyTowns competition.  We all join her in congratulating Birdhill.  I congratulate Carrigaline and Douglas on their final results in the competition and I commend all who were involved in it.  It is volunteers who go out on many a wet and horrible morning cleaning, planting and tending to local public spaces.  I commend them on that.<\/p> <p>I would be happy to have the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, come to the House regarding University Hospital Limerick, which has grown exponentially.  Senator Maria Byrne has raised this on many occasions here.<\/p> <p>Senator Warfield asked for a debate on youth and their future role in our country.  I would be happy to have that.  I commend all those who work with youth groups.  Unfortunately, we could not get to the Mansion House this morning to the showcase on youth work.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, was in attendance.  I commend all who were involved and thank them for their work.<\/p> <p>Senator Butler raised the very important issue of the growth of shopping centres and white goods stores on the peripheries of towns and urban areas, including Cork city.  The Senator has made a very good point in that we need to incentivise people to come into our large towns and cities, such as Cork city.  Cork City Council has incentivised parking for the period up to Christmas, whereby we will see free car parking in certain cark parks in the morning and also late at night.  There will also be a park-and-ride facility for six weeks.  Senator Butler is correct that there needs to be a progressive campaign to attract people back into our large towns, which were the heartbeat and hub of rural Ireland.  Unfortunately, in some cases, because of planning, we have allowed shopping centres to emerge on the peripheries.  I would be happy to have the debate.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  We have many requests for debates and we will endeavour, in the coming weeks, to have them put on the cl&aacute;r.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700012#M02800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1506510600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1506510600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.35 p.m. and resumed at 2 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mid-Term Review of Capital Plan: Statements","time":1506510900,"counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700014#W00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1506510900,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700014#W00200","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1506510900,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad in its new surroundings.

However long or short it is intended that the Seanad will located be here, I wish Senators the best of luck.<\/p>  <p>Included in A Programme for a Partnership Government is a commitment to increase public capital investment in the remaining period of the capital plan to 2021, to be allocated on the basis of the outcome of a review of the capital plan.  In my contribution I will outline the process that has taken place as part of the mid-term review, the main themes and findings the analysis has produced and the next steps in developing a longer term ten-year national investment plan.  I would also like to discuss the efficiency of capital investment in Ireland and how we can ensure value for money will be achieved from the investments made.  This is an issue that is all too often forgotten but which is of critical importance in delivering the infrastructure our society and economy so badly needs.<\/p>  <p>The mid-term review of the capital plan was launched in January and conducted over the course of the year.  Its objective was to provide a robust evidence base that would guide and inform the decisions made on capital allocations at budget time in October.  It will also be an important input to the long-term ten-year national investment plan which will be finalised before the end of the year.  It has now been published and provides a detailed evidence base for the allocation of the &euro;4.1 billion of additional funding available in the period to 2021 and subsequently the new ten-year national investment plan in the light of the infrastructural deficits identified through the analysis undertaken in the review.<\/p>  <p>The evidence base for the review includes detailed submissions by Departments and offices, an extensive public consultation process and an infrastructure capacity and demand analysis completed by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is important to note that in terms of the conduct of the review, it was a matter, in the first instance, for each Department to identify its sectoral priorities and specific projects.  Departmental submissions were received by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform earlier this year and these recommendations will play an important role in ensuring the additional funding will be aligned with the relevant sectoral priorities.  The review examines a number of key issues relating to public capital investment in Ireland such as the rationale and objectives of public capital investment, the efficiency of public capital investment and steady State funding and the sustainability of increased public capital investment.<\/p>  <p>Based on all of the evidence and analysis, the review of the capital plan identified a number of key sectoral infrastructural priorities, including, in transport, the maintenance and upgrading of the road network, as well as public transport; in education, higher education and the schools building programme; in health, subject to further analysis, the totality of health capacity and infrastructure; and, in housing, on the basis of the review of the action plan for housing and homelessness.  The Government will make final decisions on the allocation of the additional capital resources in advance of publication of the Estimates for 2018.<\/p>  <p>Following the allocation of funding for increased capital investment in the 2018 Estimates, a new ten-year national investment plan will be published before the end of the year for the period 2018 to 2027.  The key priority for the ten-year plan will be to secure the coherence of long-term and strategic sectoral objectives with the planned new spatial configuration in the national planning framework.  Drawing on key strategic sectoral objectives outlined by Departments and in line with international precedents, the longer term focus of over five years will be largely thematic.  The ten-year national investment plan will also include proposals for structural reform of public investment in the planning, selection and delivery of capital projects.  It will be informed by the public investment management assessment, PIMA, undertaken by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, in July 2017.  An IMF PIMA evaluates the design and effectiveness of the institutions that shape decision-making at the three key stages of the public investment cycle - planning investment, allocating investment to the right sectors and implementing investment.  All of this work being carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will ensure the additional capital resources available will be targeted at the priority public capital infrastructure required to support Ireland&rsquo;s medium-term growth potential and underpin social cohesion.<\/p>  <p>Based on previous discussions, I expect all those present to agree that increasing capital investment in public infrastructure in the coming years is crucial for Ireland&rsquo;s future development.  It is, therefore, a moot point to a certain extent.  However, simply increasing capital expenditure will not, in and of itself, result in all of the infrastructure deficits being addressed in the short term.  Clearly, there are constraints on the economy&rsquo;s capacity to deliver capital  infrastructure in a given year.  Increasing the efficiency of public investment will allow us to deliver greater levels of infrastructure.  It is critical that we plan and prioritise our investment in a sustainable manner based on robust research and evidence, something that has not always happened in the past.  In the period to 2008, capital investment was ramped up to unprecedented levels.  Research from the ESRI has called into question the efficiency of the investment in that period and whether value for money was achieved, given the overheating and price inflation in the construction sector.  Since that time the Office for Government Procurement has been established, the Government&rsquo;s economic and evaluation service has been established and the public spending code has been developed.  The recent publication of a capital projects tracker on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, alongside the capital review, will also help to bring to the public greater transparency and certainty on the major projects planned for delivery.  Furthermore, the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop a long-term approach to capital investment will provide clarity, confidence and certainty for the construction sector to plan for providing the capacity and capability required to deliver the infrastructure on a value for money basis in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>It is very important in examining capital investment that we shift the debate away from an exclusive focus on individual projects.  To make better use of the resources available for public capital investment we must support the continued development of a culture of evaluation in which projects will be subject to a full  project appraisal consistent with the requirements outlined in the public spending code.  This was a key theme in the submission made by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight on the capital review.  The mid-term review of the capital plan was a detailed and comprehensive process.  It provides us with an evidence base to debate and, I hope, come to some conclusions on what sectors of investment merit prioritisation in allocating the additional funding available.<\/p>  <p>The review of the capital plan also highlights some key themes that will closely inform and be incorporated into the analysis leading to the finalisation of the new ten-year national investment plan.  A discussion of these themes may also be beneficial.  They include confirmation of the central role of public capital investment in underpinning the economy&rsquo;s long-term growth potential and addressing overheating risks, as well as supporting social progress; the need to align public capital investment priorities with the changing demographic profile; the critical importance of public capital infrastructure in meeting the essential  requirement for balanced regional growth and promoting the societal transformation required to achieve climate action objectives; the mechanisms through which public investment can strengthen the economy&rsquo;s resilience to major risks such as Brexit; the central importance of robust mechanisms to support the efficiency public capital investment to ensure the public infrastructure and services delivered through capital expenditure will be secured on a value for money basis; and the strong business case for ensuring public capital spending will be balanced between new projects and maintaining the quality and capacity of existing public capital infrastructure.<\/p> <p>As a Government, we are very interested in listening to the perspective of all Senators here today about these critically important issues.  I look forward to a constructive session ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700014#W00300","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506511500,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on the mid-term review of the plan.  It was announced with much fanfare in 2015 about the period from 2016 to 2021.  We are only one year into it.  It is probably not really a mid-term review, but a review of the early part of the term.  Unfortunately, the announcement in 2015 did not say much.  There was much fanfare but unfortunately the substance has not yet been delivered.  The Government would like us to believe that it is the saviour of capital investment but, unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.  The Government has much spin and so on involved, but we need to look at what is happening on the ground.<\/p>  <p>Capital expenditure has suffered extensively from austerity, as we know.  It was only last year that capital expenditure exceeded the level of 2000 and 2001.  Meanwhile, our secondary and minor road network are at breaking point, our national broadband roll-out is faltering and we have a crippling housing crisis.  A whooping &euro;4.5 billion in capital, to be fair, has been allocated to housing, yet very little has happened and very little has been delivered.  It is true to say that units do not appear overnight and we all understand that, but we need to address it in a speedier fashion.  The Government needs to return to building social and affordable housing as it has over many generations, including in many times in the past when we did not have many resources.<\/p>  <p>There is hardly a debate in this Chamber that does not involve the mention of Brexit.  Brexit is certainly very important to be considered in the context of the mid-term capital review.  It is one of the most significant geopolitical challenges that we have ever faced.  Rural areas, particularly in the Border and midland regions, face very real threats as a result of a potential hard Brexit.  While we all wish for there to not be a hard Brexit, it is very hard to reconcile the idea of not being in the customs union and yet wanting to have no border.  Everybody says that they want no border, but I think it would be very difficult for us to have no hard border while simultaneously having the UK leave the customs union.<\/p>  <p>It is fair to say that we have had a two-tier recovery in Ireland and that parts of the country have done better in the last number of years than others.  It is vital that both the national planning framework and the capital plan reflect this and help to drive development in the regions.  As somebody based in Dublin who was a councillor for many years in Dublin but who has four country grandparents, it is not in Dublin's interests for everything to happen in Dublin.  It adds to further congestion and pressure on prices of housing and services generally, including schools, green areas, sports clubs and so on.  As many other speakers will allude to better than me, rural areas simultaneously face population decline and it is difficult to maintain services, schools and roads with a falling population.<\/p>  <p>Capital investment since 2008 has been abysmal and it has not met demographic needs or demands.  Over the next decades, Ireland&rsquo;s population is expected to reach unprecedented levels with some predicting a population of over 8 million by 2040.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that the national planning framework and the capital plan should be integrated better to meet the needs of the country.  The Government plans to release the national planning framework and the capital review at the same time.  We believe that the national planning framework should provide the overarching objectives for the country and the capital plan should feed into those objectives.  Further, we believe there should be a national infrastructure commission that would prioritise major capital investment in the context of the objectives outlined in the national planning framework.  This would ensure that all aspects of Government policy go in the same direction.  Both the national planning framework and the capital plan must have a balanced regional perspective.  This means spreading economic development throughout the country.  It is fair to give credit today when the M18 is opening and acknowledge that work is being done.  We are more than willing to acknowledge the work that is being done when it is being done but we also point out that we need more.<\/p>  <p>In Ireland, we have had a two-tier recovery.  It is not good for urban areas and it is very poor for rural areas.  Rural areas are crying out for fear of their population and it is important that we try to give those areas a lift and to give them the advantages that they need to compete for investment.  Of course, one is not necessarily going to get Google, Facebook or eBay in a small rural town, but we need to try to get more employment opportunities outside the greater Dublin area, as well as ensuring that we strengthen Dublin, which I will address in a moment.  Commuting and travel times represent one of the most practical and quantifiable measures under which the greater Dublin area can improve its international offering.  To reduce congestion in Dublin, metro north and DART underground need to be advanced and prioritised.  A brand new town in Clonburris is proposed.  It is going through planning at the moment.  It is near Clondalkin.  Equally, Cherrywood strategic development zone, SDZ, in my former county council area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is progressing but major infrastructure is needed to accommodate 8,000 homes, with almost 20,000 people living in both areas.  They need to be given the quality of life that they deserve for the 21st century town that we are building.  It is a great opportunity but we need to ensure that the required capital investment is there.  I mentioned before to the Minister that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, formerly worked with, Deputy Shane Ross, that the Luas green line is fairly full most of the time at Cherrywood already, and that we are going to put 20,000 people at the end of it.  When he was last in here, the Minister said that it could be addressed, but there is nothing concrete.<\/p>  <p>Page 63 of the capital plan review addresses the Minister of State's former Department.  I am not saying this because of Deputy O'Donovan; it is really in reference to the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross.  The part on transport, tourism and sport is full of vague aspirations.  There is nothing concrete or solid in it.  There is about half a page on page 63 about an overall package of measures, \"which focuses on areas that are supported by direct Exchequer investment\", but nothing concrete about what we are doing or how.  We need to face up to the challenges of congestion, not just with regard to quality of life, but the fact that we need to be able to get people to move around efficiently.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce made a very detailed and comprehensive submission to the mid-term review of the capital investment plan.  It is over 18 pages.  I am sure the Minister of State has had a chance to study it.  It talks about a new approach to capital expenditure and Ireland's long-term needs, both for urban and rural Ireland, the short-term investment priorities and so on.  I am sure it will be taken into account in the overall production of the mid-term review, but there is a lot of very good stuff in it and I think we need to make sure that we include many of its points because they are very well made.<\/p>  <p>I saw that Senator O'Donnell was here earlier and he never misses a change to mention the M20 and the proposal for it.  I am sure he will mention it if he is back later.  It is very important that we connect our second and third largest cities with a quality road network.  Broadband is also a huge issue.  It is a much bigger issue for areas outside of Dublin than it is in Dublin.  The recent withdrawal of SIRO from the tender process further undermines whatever planning we had for the roll-out of broadband.<\/p>  <p>We should also mention public private partnerships, PPPs.  We had Andrew McDowell at the finance committee.  He is somebody the Minister of State would be very familiar with.  He is the vice-president of the European Investment Bank.  He talked about how it had money there, ready to go, but that we had limits on how many PPPs we could have.  That is restricting the amount of money available for investment.  We need to have more projects.  We can look at whether PPPs work.  Some work and some did not work so well but the concept should not be thrown out entirely.  We must make sure that we have more growth and more ambition.  The 10% rule makes it very difficult.  Conor O&rsquo;KeIly of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, indicated that the use of public private partnerships can lock in exceptionally low interest rates for a long period of time.  We also need to look at the Juncker plan and the European Investment Bank, as I mentioned.  It is available and willing.  Its representatives came into our Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and said that the funds are there and that we just need to harness them at relatively modest interest rates.<\/p>  <p>We also have Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, with over &euro;6 billion in foreign investments.  Perhaps we could divest ourselves of some of those foreign investments and redirect that money into our own economy.  We could then have further improvements in our infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>There are other issues that we could cover and I am conscious of the time.  We need to make sure that the European fiscal rules are adjusted.  We should say that productive capital investment is not the same as giving everyone revenue bonuses and so on with regard to current spending.  We need to tackle the infrastructure crisis.  We need to make sure that we deliver on behalf of all of our citizens and that our country is ready for the population growth we have, for the fact that people are living longer and that our population is growing very significantly.  There are difficulties in schools, roads and so on.  I welcome the review today.  It is timely that we are here.  Some progress has been made but we have a lot more to do.  We wish the Minister of State the best with it.<\/p> <p>The regions and Dublin need very significant investment in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700015#X00400","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506512100,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Mulherin, I welcome to the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery our former colleague, Senator Michael Mullins, from County Galway.

I also recognise Senator Michael Mullins in the Chamber.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has outlined the capital review and the next steps.  We are down to kernel of the matter, namely, what our priorities will be for the &euro;4.1 billion additional investment in capital spending which will be available between 2018 and 2021 and what the focus will be for the next ten years under the capital investment plan.  It is about priorities.  It exists in tandem with the new national planning framework which is still in draft form but we expect will come into existence by the end of the year.<\/p><p>I will outline an approach I believe would be helpful to simplify and achieve the Government's objectives outlined by the Minister for Finance in his introductory statement to the mid-term capital review.  In his address he referred to balanced regional development and said this mid-term capital review was essential.  Thanks to policies pursued by the Government, we are in a totally different economic space.  There is the issue of responding to demographic change and why the population is declining in certain areas.  Much of the elbow power which the Government has is in its capital expenditure along with other policies such as the Action Plan for Jobs, agencies and so on.  The most significant way of shaping the country comes from the capital investment programme.<\/p><p>All things are not equal in the country.  I agree there has been a two-tier recovery.  Looking back to the last national spatial strategy, it had some good objectives and it identified some good things.  Among many areas which are quite far behind, it is not the case that they have been left behind or have not experienced the recovery.  We have seen a significant drop in unemployment, but these groups did not experience any investment under the national spatial strategy which was at least 15 years ago.  They have been coming from behind and this is compounded because some areas which had capital investment in roads, broadband and so on, can now rise more easily and are more able to attract private and public investment.  <\/p><p>As priorities are being considered for 2021, and in ten years' time, these areas which did not experience delivery should be on the top of that list.  These are predominantly rural areas.  The west and north west is a unique region - I understand there may be areas of Kerry and west Cork whose experience may be similar - where there is no major interurban routes, no high-speed trains and no major ports in the north-north west.  It has not had the delivery.  <\/p><p>The report highlights historic investment.  Can we have figures for historic capital investment in the regions, not only under the current and previous Governments but the one before?  Based on looking at things on the ground, I am sure there is an anomaly and there has not been balanced regional development.  We will not achieve our objectives for rural Ireland, with all the fine plans, such as the action plan for rural Ireland, the regional action plan for jobs, unless at a strategic level we invest in this infrastructure.  It is not all equal on the table.  There are figures, and I am asking the Minister of State for them.  It cannot be like before when one project is cherry-picked and another is not.  There is a case to be made and I am asking for the data for previous levels of capital investment.  The national primary roads into these areas should be invested in.<\/p><p>On the objective of renewing rural Ireland, the current economic model from which we work will continue to work against rural Ireland unless we change it.  That is reflected in the national planning framework which has been published.  It clearly envisages growth in cities.  We recognise that but that is happening everywhere, it is in Ireland, the UK, Europe and around the world.  People are drawn to the cities for work.  Let us say there are two reasons someone would choose to work in an area, because it is an attractive area and there is work available.  Rural Ireland is a fantastic place to live, I live there.  There has been massive investment by the Government, including the sports capital grant administered by the Minister of State in his previous role from which we see the finest sports facilities around.  We see great community effort and great clean places to live which are aesthetically pleasing.  We have schools and empty houses.  We have schools that need more pupils or will lose a teacher, yet there is the opposite problem in the cities where they are seriously congested.  We must take a holistic look at the problem.  The economic model we have where we identify something that is needed in an area is just a short-term response.  There is rural decline.  Populations have declined in Donegal and Mayo in the last census.  It is the young people who have gone to the cities.  These people are looking for housing in the cities.  They want their children to go to school and cannot get places for them and the list of problems goes on.  The challenge is for us to encourage the idea that rural areas are areas to invest in and then there will be more work.  <\/p><p>The report refers to rates of return economically and socially.  This argument that there will not be critical mass is one I often here from Dublin economists, but there will not be critical mass in rural Ireland because people cannot live on fresh air.  It is beautiful but one cannot live on that, especially when one is a young person.  We all know about the problems of young people being unemployed and it is the same where the Leas-Chathaoirleach is from.  The north-north west is in a difficult situation unless something radical is done.  I am glad that my fellow county man, Deputy Michael Ring, has been appointed the new Minister for Rural and Community Development and I do not doubt his intention to get something done, but he cannot do it by himself.  There has to be fresh thinking.  I agree that we need to see research and evidence but I ask the Minister of State to tell us the historic investment in the region.  What is the <i>per capita<\/i>investment compared with that of the tax take of the region.  I believe there is proportionately less investment compared with the taxes paid in the north-north west.  We need data on this.  I have not been able to get data.<\/p><p>An organisation that has been identified as being in a position to advise the Government on policy is the Western Development Commission.  It is on the ground supporting businesses and doing great work but it does not have the wherewithal to come up with its own data, do economic analysis and give a perspective on economics that is not Dublin-centric.  That is what is going on.  I ask that it be charged with doing this and feeding in information and data such as how much investment the region is getting compared with tax paid, how much capital investment it has enjoyed, and then we can put all this information into the mix.<\/p> <p>At the moment, we need this sort of arm.  As well as having the Minister and our action plan for rural Ireland, we need an overarching input and a change from the mindset which is prevalent and which I have encountered on panel discussions.  It is a mindset that says \"sure, we haven't got the population in rural Ireland.  What are you doing that for?\" and then they all come to the cities.  Are we really going to change it or is just tourism?  I believe there is great potential, including on the IT and life sciences side.  I know the Minister will be familiar with them but there needs to be some further measure or what is happening at the moment will continue, which is migration to the cities and an undermining of rural Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700016#Y00300","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506512700,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here.

It is very interesting when a Government colleague stands up and tells the Minister of State straight that what the Government is doing is not working, that what it has done previously has not worked, that rural Ireland is left behind and that this capital review needs to do something drastic and needs a new approach.  I certainly agree with that.  In fact, I think it needs a new Government to deliver it but that is for another day, hopefully, not before too long.<\/p><p>Every single expert who has expressed a view has said that the State is in need of a massive capital investment programme.  We are coming from a very low base so the Government should ensure that whatever fiscal space that might exist is not frittered away on tax cuts but put to good long-term use in extra capital spend.  Unfortunately, the stated position of those in power is that rather than invest, they think we can spare a good chunk of the fiscal space towards tax cuts.<\/p><p>When the Minister was appointed, he received a brief from Department officials which stated clearly with regard to the capital plan:<\/p><blockquote>Many commentators criticised what they saw as an insufficiently ambitious programme.  If the economy grows continuously over the next several years, pressure on economic infrastructure will increase and there may be merit in reviewing these plans.  The overall housing supply challenge is certain to lead to demands for increased levels of capital and current expenditure investment in social housing.  We would support additional resources for housing and housing related infrastructure.  <\/blockquote><p>The same year, the global competitiveness report ranked inadequate supply of infrastructure as the most problematic factor for doing business in Ireland.  That was the challenge put before the Minister and the Government but they have not risen to it.  The Minister can spin figures all he likes but the fact remains that this Government is putting tax cuts above the long-term investment the country requires.  Its policies are precisely the type of short-term thinking that will lead to another mess.  Both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il debate Brexit a lot.  The one thing that is completely within our control in order to fend off the challenge of Brexit is to invest - that is the one tool we have - yet it is bottom of the list.  Long-term economic visions do not win votes.  This is the blunt and short-sighted calculation being made by this Government.  <\/p><p>The Government's capital investment plan puts capital investment at just 2.16% of GNP for 2018, which is a shockingly low level of capital investment and both reckless and unsustainable.  It will also ensure that our capital investment remains one of the lowest in the EU.  The Government will spin that this new programme will move us up that list.  Well, this is exactly where we need to be anyway; we have a younger demographic profile than many other countries.  The lack of ambition in the capital plan programme is a lack of ambition for the country.  It is literally putting a cap on how much growth we can achieve.<\/p><p>I welcome the review of the capital programme.  Sinn F&eacute;in's manifesto represented a substantial plan for the coming years.  I accept some more money is going to go into capital but we must remember that the interpretation of the fiscal rules allows for smoothing of some capital spend over four years.  That is all the more important in a tight year for fiscal space like this one.  When the Minister stands before us in October and announces tax cuts, we must recall that every euro in tax cuts he announces amounts to &euro;4 that could be spent next year on our schools, hospitals or roads.  That is the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il choice and it is the wrong one.  The fiscal rules are a bad idea and are now, as Sinn F&eacute;in said they would, preventing necessary investment in our country.  Has the Minister even raised the need for an exemption for Ireland for at least capital spending over the coming years, including the repayment of the &euro;64 billion that was taken to fund the banks?  This should be argued for anyway but especially so in light of Brexit.  However, how we argue for that in Brussels when it sees the Government giving out tax cuts when it could be spending four times that amount on investment?<\/p><p>The Government plans to spend &euro;70 million on flood defences next year increasing to &euro;100 million by 2021.  Is this the type of thing that can wait?  The pre-fab replacement scheme could be accelerated so that our children are not taught in rundown schools.  I could go on.  Regional imbalance must be addressed.  In the past number of weeks, we saw the example of the regional hospital in Galway and the department where all procedures had to be cancelled because a roof fell in.  Anyone who has visited the regional hospital in Galway knows that staff are doing Trojan work but the infrastructure is falling around them and is not fit for purpose.  Again, we see the opportunities relating to Ireland West Airport Knock that are lost without proper investment in the airport.  Broadband is another example.  We can see the jobs and opportunities for the west of Ireland that are lost.  Roads are a further example.  I know there was an announcement of more LIS funding for roads at the National Ploughing Championships but when one breaks that down, it breaks down to about two roads for every councillor in a 100-mile radius.  The extension of the greenways is another example.  Capital investment is needed in all these areas to generate jobs and regenerate our rural economy.  The negative consequences of the &quot;start-stop&quot; approach to many infrastructure projects are not the way forward - things being announced, re-announced and re-announced.  The people in rural Ireland and Ireland as a whole are fed up waiting for vital infrastructure.  It should be provided for under this plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700017#Z00800","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1506512700,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

Coming from Limerick, the Minister of State will know just how important that road project is in having an Atlantic corridor which links Cork, through Limerick, with Galway as a counterpoint to Dublin.  The new Tuam-Gort bypass is being opened today, which is very welcome.  We see it as another link.  It should be possible to travel from Cork to Limerick in an hour and also from Limerick to Galway in an hour.  Therefore, the journey from Cork to Galway should take no longer than two hours.  A substantial part of the planning process was completed by November 2011 and preliminary work by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is ongoing, which will allow the project to advance.  I hope that in the new plan to be announced following the mid-term capital review the M20 project will be a priority.  The work could be done on a staged basis.  In 2011 the preferred route was via Croom, Charleville, Buttevant and Mallow.  The section from Limerick to Mallow is key and should be stage one.  The M20 project is critical from the point of view of connectivity.  It is also critical from a safety perspective because there are fatalities on the N20 far too regularly.  If we are to speak meaningfully about the need for balanced regional development, we cannot do so without the M20 being in place.  <\/p> <p>While the new emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is very welcome, there is a hospital beds capacity issue.  When the reconfiguration took place, the emergency departments in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals were closed, which meant that 50 beds were taken out of the system.  As part of the reconfiguration, a new 138-bed unit was to be built via a public private partnership on the grounds of University Hospital Limerick, but it never came to pass.  We have secured funding through the HSE to progress the design phase for a 90-bed acute unit alongside the emergency department.  I would like to see that unit progressed under the capital plan.  I would also like to see the maternity hospital moved from the existing site to the grounds of University Hospital Limerick.  <\/p> <p>I would like to see the three projects mentioned - the M20, the 90-bed acute unit in University Hospital Limerick and the relocation of the maternity unit to the site of University Hospital Limerick to improve the cohesiveness of the care provided - included in the new national plan.

Labhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; i mB&eacute;arla c&eacute; go bhfuil m&eacute; n&iacute;os comporda&iacute;, b'fh&eacute;idir, ag labhairt i nGaeilge.  <\/p>  <p>First, we must look at where we have come from, as Senator Kieran O'Donnell said.  We have come from a situation where a few years ago we had a 14.5% unemployment rate.  It now stands at around 6%, which represents a very significant improvement.  We are, therefore, very close to full employment.  It is said an unemployment rate of around 4% or thereabouts represents full employment.  <\/p>  <p>The books are reasonably well balanced again.  Therefore, where do we go from here?  The economic reports I have read and the economists to whom I listen, although sometimes we should not listen to as many as we do, are urging caution.  We, therefore, need to be careful and must be prudent about capital expenditure, to which there are two parts - revenue and capital.  During my time as Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services the big issue was on and off-balance sheet expenditure.  I learned an awful lot about the public finances, although I would have known a little about private investment and business.  Off-balance sheet expenditure is really important and very significant.  If we can create a situation where a lot of our capital expenditure is paid for or supported by off-balance sheet funding, it will support a lot of the capital expenditure about which my colleagues have spoken on hospitals in Galway and the Limerick to Cork and Limerick to Galway roads, projects I strongly support.  As capital expenditure is a long-term investment, I urge prudence in that regard.<\/p>  <p>Another important factor to bear in mind is that EU regulations stipulate the degree of flexibility we have in any budget which is based on income.  It is a multiple of the revenue the Exchequer receives.  I ask the Minister of State to correct me if I am wrong, but I understand the position in 2018 will be pretty tight from a budgetary perspective.  Things will loosen again in 2019 because we will be working with a greater revenue cash flow from the Exchequer's perspective.  Again, I caution the Government not to spend money we do not have and not to spend money that will be on-balance sheet.  We should try to work off-balance sheet to a proper ratio or degree.<\/p>  <p>In the context of the mid-term capital review, I live in Spiddal in Connemara.  It can take me an hour and a half to travel about five miles from Spiddal to Galway racecourse, from where I can get to the M50 in the same amount of time.  The roads in Galway are absolutely killing the people and the local economy.  If we had a good hospital, that would be fine, but we cannot get to it on time.  A very good friend of mine from Oranmore died recently of a heart attack.  If it had happened at 4 p.m. rather than at 4 a.m., it would have taken an hour and a half to get him to the hospital.  Access is absolutely critical.  I, therefore, urge the Minister of State to look at providing an outer bypass in Galway and to do whatever he can to get that project moving.  It would also support Senator Kieran O'Donnell's very well made point about the western corridor to join Cork, Limerick and Galway and, I hope, places further north such as Ballina and Sligo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700018#AA00500","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1506513300,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I welcome this timely debate on the national capital expenditure plan.  We need to debate the issue in the context of where the country is at and from where it has come in recent years.  We must acknowledge that there were serious reductions in capital expenditure and infrastructural investment owing to the state of the economy from 2007 until recently.  However, I must give the last Government credit for continuing to invest in schools, in building new schools, continuing the prefab replacement scheme and building school extensions all over the country.  We have almost eradicated the use of prefabs, although there is still some work to be done in that regard.<\/p>  <p>In 2015 a new capital plan was announced in which housing was prioritised, an in which I had a role.  Over &euro;4 billion was provided for various schemes throughout the country.  That sum has been expanded since, with &euro;5.5 billion being provided for housing.  It is no good, however, just having the money in place.  We need to get building under way.  With the restoration of our economic fortunes, the country can once again provide for capital investment.  However, as the Minister of State outlined, we need to undertake such investment in a coherent, logistical and transparent way.  <\/p>  <p>I was somewhat bemused to hear a Sinn F&eacute;in representative criticise the Government when members of that party speak out of both sides of their mouths.  In Northern Ireland Sinn F&eacute;in will not take responsibility to govern.  In most local authorities the party will not take responsibility for voting on a budget, but its members still look for all services.<\/p> <p>Even recently, in the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services of which I was a member, where investment is critically needed in water infrastructure, they did all in their political power to undermine capital investment by the populist stances that they take.  That is typical of Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p> <p>We in government focus on the positive ways in which the economy can provide for the communities into the future and that is why a new national development plan 2040 is due to be announced shortly.  It is vital that the capital plan is linked intrinsically and strongly to that new national development plan 2040 because that will outline the vision for economic growth in this country and it is critical that investment is made in tandem with that.<\/p> <p>At present, Dublin is a vortex of economic activity.  It is overheating.  However, we have cities around the country that are capable of providing for the economy and driving the regions in which they are.  The national spatial strategy was a good strategy at the time but it failed miserable.  It failed because cities, such as Waterford, the area that I come from, did not have the capital investment infrastructure that it required and that went with the status that it was given.  Now we have a unique opportunity to put that right with the new national development plan and the new capital investment plan.<\/p> <p>Using Waterford and the south east as an example, where it is envisaged that we want to grow that city to almost double in population terms, it is critical that we invest in essential infrastructure.  The north quays in Waterford are similar to a mini-docklands and there is huge potential for the city to grow in that area.  There is interest in investing over &euro;300 million of private investment to provide housing, commercial activity, tourism-related activity and a strong retail offering for a city that should be attracting people from around the entire south-east region.  This development will require substantial Government investment that can return to the Exchequer solid taxes and income.  It will require in the order of &euro;60 million of investment.  I have already spoken to the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, regarding the critical need for this investment and I am certainly hopeful it will be a strong part of the announcements of the capital plan over the coming months.<\/p> <p>Other areas that require investment in the region are regional infrastructure such as University Hospital Waterford, which is a level 4 acute hospital.  It is getting a new palliative care unit with a five-storey building that will certainly help in regards to beds but there is a strong need for a &euro;3 million investment in a regional emergency cardiac care service to bring it up to a 24-7 service.  I will continue to voice that need for my region here in the national Parliament.<\/p> <p>I am not being parochial here.  These are all regional needs I am outlining.  If we are going to have a strong country, we must have strong regions.  We need a technological university for the south east.  I am glad to report that WIT and Carlow IT are now working together.  For that to progress, it will require capital investment.<\/p> <p>Senators spoke about the roads and road safety.  That is an area that fell behind considerably during the dark days of the recession.  The rural and regional roads need investment.  The road between my city and the Minister of State's, the N24 from Limerick to Waterford, is probably the worst national road in the country.  I would urge the National Transport Authority and everybody involved in policy making on roads to look at that road with regard to an upgrade.  If we must have strong regions and inter-connectivity between the cities, that is one road that needs work.<\/p> <p>I could go on forever on areas such as broadband and next generation investments in information technology.  Climate change will be a significant challenge for this country and we will need investments in renewable energies.  All of the regions can contribute positively in that respect and that is why we need a coherent vision for this country with the plans and the infrastructure, and the expenditure, to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700018#AA00600","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506513900,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  It is my first opportunity to congratulate him in public on his appointment as Minister of State.  Knowing Deputy O'Donovan, as I do, over a number of years, he brings great ability and energy, and high principle to the office and I wish him well in it.<\/p>  <p>Through a lot of hard work, great effort and great courage on the part of the previous Government and this one, we have come to the point that we can have this discussion, that we can have a balanced budget, that we are significantly reducing national debt and that we are now in position where we have credibility from a borrowing perspective to get attractive interest rates, and that we are now in a position to engage strategically in capital investment.  I suppose there are a couple of big objectives that we need to achieve through the capital investment.  The Minister of State, as a former teacher like myself, will be familiar with long-term and short-term objectives in teaching plans.  The biggest long-term objective we have is to maintain sustainable populations in rural Ireland and maintain a balance, to deal with what Senator Coffey aptly describes as the \"vortex\" that is Dublin at present and to get a level a decentralisation in terms of population and sustainable communities throughout the country.  With that in mind, the commitment to road infrastructure and transport infrastructure is a vital one, both in terms of achieving inward investment in rural Ireland and in terms of its development and quality of life, and attractiveness to live there.<\/p>  <p>In the county that I and the distinguished Acting Chairman, Senator Wilson, come from, we do not have railways.  We do not have immediate access to local airports, etc., and we depend on the road infrastructure in a big way.  For that reason, the road infrastructure is vital.  In that context, I would commend two projects in County Cavan to the Minister of State that are relevant to both Cavan and Monaghan.  The first is the east-west link, linking Dundalk to Sligo.  That goes through the critical towns of Shercock, Cootehill and Carrickmacross throughout my constituency.  That project is so important because we have the large employer, Carton, in Shercock, employing 600 to 800 local people in a place one would not necessarily have food processing where one would not readily attract alternative employment, and Abbott in Cootehill.  That east-west link is critical.  I commend that project to the Minister of State.  It will stand up to any analysis and any objective scrutiny.  I would also commend the extension of the M3, with the bypassing of Virginia to Cavan town as a critical piece of infrastructure for that region.  I would appeal to the Minister of State to look seriously at those in the context of transport.<\/p>  <p>The Minister of State has a commitment professionally, as I and virtually all of us in the House have, to the regionalisation of education.  Indeed, I note the Acting Chairman is highly involved in that project at home too.  We are committed to getting the new third level campus, the post leaving certificate college, to Cavan.  It is committed to in the capital plan.  In his response, I would like the Minister of State to restate his public commitment to it.  It would mean so much to people.  It is a vital, long awaited project up there.  That is a necessary exercise, if we have any genuine commitment to regionalisation and to maintaining sustainable communities outside of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>I agree with all the points the Minister of State makes in his address around structural reform, planning, procurement and good value for money.  That is prudent and right.  What people want with their hard-earned success is that it would not be squandered.  Of course, I agree with those and I will not labour them, but the Minister of State would be the first to agree that we need inward investment in rural areas.  I cannot go about attracting inward investment to, and we cannot have successful trade mission for, a place such as Cavan until one gets the infrastructure.  Crucial to that infrastructure are the roadways, the college and, as referenced by Senator Coffey, broadband.  Broadband is most crucial.  I accept it is a different debate in the sense it is the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten's, specific responsibility, but it is enormously vital.<\/p>  <p>My colleague, Senator Mulherin, opened with the contention that we have to achieve with this capital plan viable communities around this country, particularly in the disadvantaged areas of the Border region and the mid-west that have suffered hugely.  The Border region, in my area, has suffered enormously down the years.  We have to right that wrong and correct that imbalance.  I appeal to the Minister of State to see that happens.  It is a great and exciting opportunity for the Minister of State and for all of us to put something right here, to make it likely that people will want to live in counties such as Cavan and Monaghan and right through the west of Ireland, and that we will get those in the aptly described \"vortex\" or population centre that is Dublin to choose other centres.<\/p>  <p>Of course, there must be a match between the capital plan and the spatial strategy into the future.<\/p> <p>I contend that the projects that I have mentioned will so do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700019#BB00200","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506514500,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

I shall return to what Senator Coffey said in terms of regional development.  I, too, would like to support the M20 and the connection with Waterford.  I know the Government has a big commitment to the area outside of Dublin and job creation.  A commitment has been given to create over 60% of jobs, etc., outside of Dublin.  I agree that the Government must focus on and develop the regions.  Senator Coffey is right that there is a big connection between the different cities and towns located in the regions.  Limerick is very lucky to have Shannon Airport on its doorstep because many companies have located their businesses in the region thus leading to job creation.  Education has also been included and highlighted in the Minister of State's report.  We must invest in education in the regions in order to assist businesses to grow.  I shall refer to the Minister of State's <i>alma mater<\/i>.  Mary Immaculate College has a library facility for 700 students but in actual fact it has close to 5,000 students attending the college.  Therefore, students lose out in terms of access to the library and research facilities.<\/p><p>Recently I visited the Monaleen national school that is comprised of eight classrooms and 16 prefabs.  The school has been in the building programme for a  long number of years.  There must be investment in local schools and colleges.  Such investment is an investment in our future and that leads to job creation in the regions. <\/p><p>This morning on the Order of Business I mentioned the overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick.  I know that Senator Kieran O'Donnell referred to the matter earlier.  I believe that there must be investment in extra beds at both University Hospital Limerick and St. John's Hospital.  They are not just hospitals for Limerick city; they are hospitals for the region.  University Hospital Limerick has the highest level of overcrowding in the region.  The figures have been consistent for quite a while in terms of the highest level in Ireland.  For an initiative to work and have a positive effect on the region there must be investment in both hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700020#CC00200","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1506514500,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

I can remember well two years ago, as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, when I visited this room.  I can assure Members that it was not in the same state that it is in today.  The room looked as if a reception had taken place a number of nights beforehand and quite a number of wine and champagne glasses were strewn around the room.  In the far corner was the Sam Maguire Cup.  I did not think it would hang around the capital ever since.  I compliment everybody, including the Ceann Comhairle, and everybody involved in the project.<\/p>  <p>I shall make a few points about the mid-term review of the capital plan.  I am delighted that the Minister of State has given us an overview of where things are at the moment and where we can reach.  Every area has a project.  Like everybody else, there are quite a number projects in the west and the north west.  During the Celtic tiger years the region did not get its fair share of capital spending and, thus, fell very much behind other regions.  That fact can be seen quite effectively.  The last census shows that a declining population exists in counties Mayo and Donegal.  I ask that the Minister of State takes a serious look at the population census for 2016.  I ask him to take the data into account when allocating funding to projects throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>I shall name a few projects.  Ireland West Airport Knock is central to the prosperity of the region as it is an international airport.  I ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to take a close look at the airport as it needs capital investment and hangarage.  The airport is a vital piece of infrastructure for the western and north-western region.  People from the region can now commute to London on a weekly basis.  In fact, people who work in London during the week can fly home and arrive in the western area quicker than if they travelled by car from Dublin.  The airport also allows people to travel to the Algarve, Spain and Germany.  The airport is a vital infrastructure that allows people who invest in the region, and to move in and out of the region.  The airport is also very important from a tourism point of view as tourists from Germany and various parts of Europe can travel to the region.<\/p>  <p>The N5 and N26 roads were neglected during the Celtic tiger years.  I ask that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport fast forward capital for the N5.  All of the planning stages have gone through and the fencing has been completed.  The N5 project is ready for completion and ready to go to tender.  I ask that the N5 project is placed high on the agenda when deciding terms and projects for the capital plan 2016-2021.  There are a number of projects in the western region.  In Mayo, in particular, there is the N5, N26 and the Ireland West Airport Knock and I ask that the Minister of State prioritises these projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700020#CC00300","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speech","time":1506514500,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important discussion.  I say so not least because, as he said in his speech and rightly so, that we consider the capital plan in the context of individual projects and how best to grow and develop all regions of this country.  We must also be mindful that we draw a line beyond the M50 and Red Cow roundabout so that we can ensure that priority is given to the regions, that there is investment and that capital infrastructure takes place.<\/p>  <p>We all have a list of individual projects that we want to see prioritised and completed.  As the Minister of State said in his speech, the Government does not have an infinite amount of money to spend on a wish list.  He comes from County Limerick so he will recognise that the Cork-Limerick motorway can act as a catalyst for change and investment in the Cork-Limerick region.  It is important that we learn from the debacle that was the decentralisation policy by a past Government.  We must ensure that we give autonomy to the regions and that we allow for a strategy that will empower the regions to grow.<\/p>  <p>I was very much struck by the joint presentation that we received from Cork County Council and Cork City Council about Cork 2050.  The presentation recognised and emphasised what the region needs to reach its full potential.  Whether one comes from north, south, east or west it is critical, in whatever decision is made by Government, that there is a process that allows for the country as a whole to benefit.  That is why this debate is important.  We can all produce a wish list.  I could talk about Cork-Limerick, the M28 and the need for a second hospital in Cork.  I could list a whole plethora of projects that are important for the Cork area.  What is important is that the allocation of money is done in a way that promotes investment, secure jobs and retains jobs. <\/p> <p>It would ensure that Ireland, which will be the only English-speaking nation left in the European Union, will be open for business, which it is.<\/p> <p>In a recovering economy the key factors, as mentioned by the Minister of State, are transport, education, health and housing.  The kernel of what we must do is recognise the need for investment in capital infrastructure such as the pressing and urgent need for housing and the provision of schools, hospitals and roads and balance that against the services people require in their day-to-day lives such as care for the elderly or disabled and the recruitment of more garda&iacute;, nurses or teachers.  We must try to balance those needs.  Those in Opposition who come out with grandiose plans must recognise that this must be about how the people and the country can benefit.  It is not just about making connections locally and internationally but also ensuring an opportunity for the country.  The Government and Fine Gael have always focussed on the country and the people.  For the five years during which some Members of the Opposition could not decide to cross the road, the Government took decisions to ensure the country recovered and that we are on the cusp of a funding model that will ensure a benefit.  The Government has much interaction with the European Investment Bank in terms of the provision of moneys.  It is important that we invest in infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The situation post-Brexit will be challenging for many parts of the economy.  Senator Paddy Burke referenced the issue of air travel.  The issue of tourism, for which Minister of State had a very strong and supportive role in his previous Ministry, must be addressed to determine how the regions can counteract Brexit.  The southern region has experienced a sharp decline in visitors from the United Kingdom since the Brexit vote although that has been mitigated by direct flights from Cork Airport to Providence which have led to an increase in North American visitors.  The balance has to be gotten right for the way forward.<\/p> <p>The national planning framework, Ireland 2040, is due to be published soon.  It explores how we can plan for the future in the context of expanding cities and counties.  Cork city and county local governance structures were discussed during the Order of Business.  That needs to be gotten right and resolved in order that we ensure that Cork city and county prosper and develop.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance.  It is important that we get this right and have investment but it is also about people and being able to attract investment and retain jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700020#CC00400","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506515100,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators who have attended this important debate.  One would have imagined there would be a bigger interest, in particular from some Opposition groups.  I am very disappointed by the attendance.  I do not know if another event is taking place.  I was looking forward to contributions from both sides of the House.  The Senators who attended made some interesting contributions, much of which I agree with and much of which I do not.  One would imagine there is no more important issue than the preparation and planning for the future development of Ireland, the children yet to be born, the roads yet to be driven and the schools yet to be attended.  We cannot live in the past but must try to plan for the future.  I thank Senators who turned up and showed an interest in such an important issue.<\/p><p>Senator Horkan is correct that a lot of catching up needs to be done.  He identified a number of issues and I will not get into the specifics of all those projects as that would not be appropriate because there is a fairly large shopping list from the Seanad.  The Senator failed to mention that the State was banjaxed in 2011 and was a borrower of last resort, that the economy had no money and was running on empty and the Government did not know if it would be able to keep the doors of the country open.  It needs to be said on the record that the transformation of the Irish economy in a short period of time on the back of the efforts of the Irish people has been enormous.  There are commentators who said a second bailout would be needed, that the State would have to go cap in hand to look for it and that all the policies pursued by the Government were wrong.<\/p><p>One political party opposed everything the Government did during the previous D&aacute;il just for the sake of it.  Its deputy leader said of its leader that anyone could fumble a figure.  It was not the first time that Deputy Adams fumbled a figure in the hundreds of millions.  I take particular issue with Sinn F&eacute;in's record on economic policy and where they were and are <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the economic collapse.  First, it has absented itself from any decision making on the island of Ireland and, secondly, it has decided to oppose for opposition's sake anything done by either the previous Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael-Labour Governments or the current Fine Gael-Independent minority Government supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.  If everything we did was wrong, we would not be in the position four years later of having a balanced budget and being able to talk about fiscal spending space.  If we did as Deputy Adams suggested and told the European Union to take its money and g, and one must remember Sinn F&eacute;in has opposed every EU treaty since 1973 for the sake of it, where would we be?  Where would we now be if we had taken the advice of Sinn F&eacute;in in 2011?  We would be on a one-way ticket to the stone age and would not have to worry about class sizes, roads or the future development of the hospital network.  The country would be akin to a modern-day basket case.  Rather than saying everything the Government did was wrong or coming forward, as it did last year, with proposals that would have meant that every single person who avails of a tax credit they pay into a pension would see a cut of &euro;800 in his or her annual take-home pay, it would be nice to see costed proposals from a party that just opposes everything.<\/p><p>That is the type of make it up as you go along economics of which I am tired.  I admire Opposition politicians such as Senators &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Horkan who make proposals based on circumstances that bear some resemblance to the economic reality of the State.  However, that is not the case for a party that continues to have no regard to either the past or the present in relation to where the economy was, where it went or the policies pursued by successive Governments to do what we believed was right and resulted in us being on a trajectory to virtual full employment from an unemployment rate of 16%.  We are on the way to a balanced economic budget and do not need to worry about a lender of last resort.  We are on the way to being able to look after our citizens as any sovereign government should without going cap in hand to anybody.  Where would we be if we followed the alternative?  All Members know where we would be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700021#DD00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515100,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Parts of Mayo have an unemployment rate of 31%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700021#DD00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515100,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I did not interrupt the Senator.

Many worthy projects were identified by Senators, some of which are in my own region.  The projects include the M29, Limerick Regional Hospital, Ireland West Airport Knock, the Luas cross-city which will soon be opened and the Newlands Cross flyover which was built at a time of economic collapse.  All of those things can only be done if there are the building blocks of a sound economy.  One cannot have such building blocks if one makes it up as one goes along in some sort of <i>Alice in Wonderland<\/i>-type fairy tale.  He might not be great at the figures.  We know he is not great at the figures and he should stay away from them.  It is no wonder that a party that can try and suggest that the country can somehow just decide it is going to run around on empty, tell the EU, IMF and the troika to get out, vote against every EU treaty and pretend it is going to be all right on the night does not want to be in government in Northern Ireland, take its seats in Westminster, be in government in this jurisdiction nor be in power in any local authority in the country because that would involve making a decision.<\/p> <p>The first decision Sinn F&eacute;in had to make in the Northern Ireland Executive was to send the devolved powers with regard to social welfare back to Westminster because it involved making a tough decision that might make it unpopular.  We have done the right thing by this country since 1922 and we will continue to do so.  The main Opposition party has, by and large, always done what it believes is right.  We might disagree with it politically, as we might with the Labour Party, the Green Party and the Independents who come from a variety of backgrounds, but I will not sit here and listen to this type of thing we must also listen to in the other House, where a Senator can stand up and say it is time we rise to the challenge.

I will take Members through the rationale behind the proposal.  Article 4 of the victims' directive, the right to information, provides that all victims of crime have a right to certain information on first contact with the competent authority.  The competent authority is not defined by the directive but the European Commission justice guidelines give an indication as to who should fall within this definition.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 only applies to the investigations conducted by the Garda or Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Such a restriction prevents victims from accessing information in any other form of prosecution or investigation.  Any statutory authority with the potential power to prosecute a criminal offence would fall under the remit of Article 4 of the directive, the right to information.<\/p><p>There is a significant list of bodies falling within the remit, including but not limited to the Health and Safety Authority, HIQA, Tusla, the Health Service Executive and ComReg.  These bodies have the power to investigate and prosecute criminal offences.  Victims who are natural persons should be provided with information from these prosecuting authorities in accordance with Article 4 of the directive.  Similarly, where a competent authority is investigating or prosecuting an offence, it should be obliged to provide all the necessary information, support and protection that would otherwise be provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if it prosecuted.  That is the rationale and I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments.  I hope we can have some support for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700023#FF02300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1506516000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I second the amendment, which has been covered comprehensively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700023#FF02400","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1506516000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to be here to debate on Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill.

It is a matter I raised on Second Stage and I am grateful to the Victims' Rights Alliance and others for raising this issue with me and others.  We were concerned the Bill did not cover other prosecuting authorities or persons with functions related to the investigation or bringing of the prosecution of an offence conferred by enactments.

This Bill is quite unusual in that it focuses squarely on the victims of crime rather than the perpetrators.  For the first time in legislation, it sets out the rights of victims and focuses on the victims as individuals with different needs and vulnerabilities.  The rights provided for in this Bill are valuable and practical rights which would make a real difference to the experience of victims in the criminal justice system.  Keep the victims in mind.<\/p>  <p>We contend that what the Senators proposed in their amendments would significantly expand the scope of the Bill to a range of bodies outside those intended by the EU directive.  The Bill focuses primarily on applying the provisions of the directive to victims of criminal offences that are reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are, of course, other agencies and bodies which have been mentioned that are investigative and also prosecute, such as local authorities, some Government Departments and specialist authorities such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Health and Safety Authority the Consumer Protection Commission and the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  No obligations have been imposed on such bodies in the Bill since the offences they prosecute are mainly of an administrative or regulatory nature.  It is principally on the basis that in the context of the directive, there is generally no direct victim of such offences.  The victimisation for such offences is often indirect and impersonal, for example tax evasion will affect all tax payers. <\/p>  <p>Amendment No. 2 does not seem to have any actual effect.

The definition proposed is overly broad, capturing all statutory bodies with a power to investigate and prosecute any offence including those of a regulatory nature, offences that would clearly follow the scope of criminal offences as intended in the EU directive.  The difficulty lies in the fact that Ireland does not have a legal distinction between criminal offences and administrative or regulatory offences as exist in most EU countries.  The precise scope of the amendment is unclear in that it provides no definitive list of persons or bodies captured.  Consequently a victim will not be able to readily identify whether an authority with which he or she is interacting is covered by the Bill.

He was not critical of the drafting of amendment No. 3 for which I thank him and thank Mr. Finbarr O'Malley who carried out the drafting with me of that amendment.<\/p>  <p>I would say with respect that there are contradictions in the Minister of State's response.  First, he said the other authorised body or person, such as the Health and Safety Authority or the Director of Corporate Enforcement, are effectively only bringing investigating and prosecuting offences that are regulatory in nature while later correctly saying that in Ireland we do not have a formal distinction between criminal offences generally and administrative or regulatory offences.  There is no such formal distinction.  There is a long, if not proud, history in Ireland of bringing prosecutions for so-called regulatory offences, such as breaches of health and safety Acts, for offences which might be prosecuted as corporate manslaughter in other jurisdictions.  I am thinking of cases such as Zoe Developments where we saw a very large fine imposed on a construction company in respect of breaches of health and safety legislation as a result of which it appeared that an employee had been killed.  There is a contradiction there.  If our amendment would bring other bodies charged with prosecuting offences into the ambit of the Bill, that was our intention.  There is no formal distinction between bodies between the kinds of offences they prosecute and those prosecuted by the DPP.  There is no formal categorical distinction of that kind.<\/p>  <p>The Minister of State also made the point that for many of those so-called regulatory or administrative offences, there is no direct victim.  That is true.  I accept there may not be a victim in the way that there is a victim of a burglary or assault but if that is the case there should be no worry or concern about bringing those bodies within the ambit of the legislation.  If there is no identifiable victim in respect of a large group of the offences which are prosecuted by those authorised persons then the Act will not be effective in that way so there should be no concern about that.  <\/p>  <p>Our definition seeks to provide to bring within the ambit of the Act other bodies that may have a statutory function of bringing prosecutions of offences and that where there are offences and where there is a victim identifiable, then whether we call those offences regulatory or criminal those victims should be entitled to the protection of the Act.

Senator Higgins rightly pointed to the fact that there is considerable interest in this and effort being made.  It is disappointing to see debate truncated in this regard given the amount of work we have put into it and the interest there is in it.<\/p><p>The amendments proposed are measures to support in particular, as the Minister of State rightly said, the victims of the crimes of rape, sexual assault and sexual violence, which are crimes particularly but not exclusively experienced by women.  They are horrible life-altering crimes that, as recent media commentary and commentary by Members of these Houses shows, at best are often misunderstood.  At worst, such commentary betrays conscious or unconscious deep-rooted and deep-seated misogyny, and this can rear its head in all parts of our public system, among garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts.  These are crimes in which, uniquely, the victim can be blamed for the awful thing that happened to her.  We rightly do not blame the frail pensioner for being robbed on his or her way home from the post office and we do not blame children for being victims of child abuse.  Why do we still continue to blame victims of the crimes of rape, sexual assault or sexual violence and insinuate or infer that they are somehow to blame for the crimes that have been forced upon them against their will?  The amendments I have put forward are about supporting the victims after they come forward to have a reasonable experience and a fair trial and not to be on trial.<\/p><p>Speaking directly to amendment No. 6, the Director of Public Prosecutions does not prosecute the majority of sexual crimes identified in the Garda files it receives.  At present, victims of sexual crime receive only a very brief and general letter from the Director of Public Prosecutions in response to their request for reasons the decision not to prosecute was made.  There is no reference to the individual circumstances of their case.  This cannot be said to be sufficient information for victims to decide whether to request a review of the decision.  This amendment seeks to ensure victims get sufficient information to enable them to decide whether to request a review of the decision in any case in which such a review is possible.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700026#JJ01500","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I agree with what Senator Kelleher has said.

That cannot be construed as sufficient information for them to decide whether to seek a review.  The practicality of this can be illustrated by the fact it can be done without infringing the right of others such as the accused, and it is already being done, for example, in England and Wales where victims of sexual crime and other victims entitled to enhanced measures can request a face-to-face meeting with the representatives of the Crown Prosecution Service to question the prosecuting authorities as to the reasons for their not proceeding.  They are very often not successful.  Only about 10% lead to a review, but that is an important illustration and example from an adjoining jurisdiction on which we model quite a lot of our legislation.

It is important in terms of people being able to move forward in their lives after such an experience.

The impact or the effect of the amendment would be to require that sufficient information be given to a victim to allow him or her to decide whether to request a review of any decision not to proceed with or to discontinue an investigation, not to prosecute or to discontinue a prosecution or a decision to deal with a person other than by trial.  These are the four areas that are referred to as subparagraphs 2(c), (d), (e) and (f) in the amendment itself.  The challenge with this is that it is very subjective.  It would require An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Ombudsman Commission or the Director of Public Prosecutions to know what information would, in any particular case, be \"sufficient\" for the individual victim to decide whether he or she wishes to request a review of the decision in question.  What would be sufficient for one person might not be sufficient for another.  It is very subjective.  Who decides what is sufficient?<\/p>  <p>Quite apart from the fact the relevant authority may not know what information would be sufficient in any given case, it is only a decision not to prosecute which may be reviewed.  There is no right to a review of other decisions included in the amendment.

One person's sufficient is not another person's sufficient.  Who decides what is sufficient information?  Furthermore, the amendment only pertains to decisions not to prosecute.  For these reasons, we are not in a position to accept the amendment.  If the Senators think about this, they will see that our reasons for not accepting it are valid.  The amendment, if accepted, would cause major difficulties.  <\/p>  <p>The other issue that arises is technical in nature.  The amendment is not inserted in the correct position in the section.  It has been placed within the list of information which a victim may request.  It would need to be a new subsection in the section rather than a new paragraph in the list.  If Senators look at what is actually qualifying the section here, all the subsections are qualified earlier on and it would not make sense to insert the amendment here.  Thus, from a technical perspective it is wrong but more importantly, it is completely unworkable.  Who decides what is sufficient?

It is incorrect to say that there would be a vast amount of information out there that had to be sifted through to determine what is relevant.

That is the issue that victims of these types of crimes are raising with us.  They are not getting sufficient information.  It is subjective from the point of view of the DPP to decide what is sufficient information.  The DPP is making these decisions.  It takes a subjective overview in terms of saying that it cannot prosecute.  There can be a valid basis for that but the decision is made by a person and is, therefore, subjective.

That is what we are talking about here.  It would be impossible for somebody to decide what somebody else might think is sufficient.  What the Senator is now saying is that a person in an office, whether that be in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the DPP, should decide what is sufficient, which makes the amendment irrelevant in many ways, if that is the case, but we are not even saying that.  We are not saying who decides.  We are saying \"sufficient information\" and leaving it hanging there, so who makes the decision?  Is it the victim?  Can the victim say that he or she did not get sufficient information?  One victim might say that the information received is sufficient while another might say that it is not.  We have not defined it and do not know what it is.  The Senator has been suggesting that it is somebody in an office who decides that the information is sufficient.

Having listened to the dialogue, I take the Minister of State's point that there are technical reasons he is against this particular amendment, No. 6.  However, a very important principle has been expressed to him, which is that victims of crime are simply receiving what one might call a generic response currently in terms of decisions not to prosecute.  I know, as does Senator Kelleher, from speaking with victims and survivors of sexual abuse or rape that we have a very high level of attrition between the reporting of the rape or sexual offence and the decision to prosecute it.  In a large number of cases a decision not to prosecute is taken and it is extremely frustrating for victims to receive what they would see as a very generic reason or explanation for that.  That is the spirit behind this amendment.  Perhaps the wording \"sufficient information\" is not, in itself, sufficiently precise but the spirit of this amendment requires greater consideration.  It should be possible to draft an amendment that requires that the victim be provided with information specific to his or her case to facilitate him or her in making a decision to request a review.  It is information that is tailored to the individual case that is sought and not just a generic reason of insufficient evidence to proceed or that the DPP was of the view that a prosecution would not succeed, or something of that nature.<\/p>  <p>The issue here is the spirit of the amendment.

It is not entirely clear what is meant by the outcome of the assessment.  If the outcome of the assessment is understood as the report of the results of an assessment and that report were to be given to the judge, there would also be an obligation to disclose it to the defence.  Assessments will frequently contain sensitive and confidential personal information regarding the victim and his or her personal circumstances, including vulnerabilities to victimisation and intimidation.  I am sure Senators would agree that it would be highly inappropriate for such information to be disclosed to the defence.  The Bill has been drafted very carefully to prevent assessment reports from becoming part of the criminal proceedings to prevent disclosure to the defence and any possible cross examination of the victim regarding its contents.  Assessments may also contain information on previous offences or other previous conduct by the accused which pose a risk to the victim.  If the case were a summary case, it could be prejudicial to the rights of the accused as the judge would have been provided with detailed information on the victim, the offender and the offence from the victim's perspective.<\/p>  <p>If outcomes are intended to be limited to the details of the special measures which have been identified as being of benefit to the victim, this would need to be clearly defined in the amendment.  In any case, it is difficult to see what benefit there is to the victim if the details of the special measures, but not the reasons the victim might needs them, are provided to the court.  It would be impossible for the court to make a determination on whether the measure was required without further details.  In addition, many of the special measures concerned require an application by the prosecution so that the court would not be in a position to act on the assessment in the absence of such an application.<\/p>  <p>This amendment, while well intended, lacks clarity and carries a significant risk of curtailing the assessments themselves and requiring the release of sensitive personal information to the defence which includes potentially prejudicial information to the court.  We have to be very careful and this Bill have been very carefully drafted.  There are huge risks in this amendment even though it is well intended.  I know what the intention is but it contains massive risks.

It is very clear in the amendment that it is a question of the outcome rather than the reasons for the assessment, about which we have just had a debate.  It is simply a matter of whether the person needs protection.  The decision is made by a separate body, separate from the court.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission identify that there are specific protection needs and examine whatever evidence or sensitive information might be relevant, as the Minister of State suggested.  They come with an outcome based on the procedure followed in the case, not evidence.  They are not stating it is evidence in the case.  Nobody is suggesting the assessment would be presented as evidence in the case.  They would simply be saying it was relevant information in how the court was processing the case where there was a need for protection.  That is a very clear and separate process.  Anybody going into something like this may have other needs such as a need for translation services.  It is a matter of the processing of the case and the assessment would not be offered as evidence.  I am not a lawyer - there are esteemed lawyers in the House - but I do not understand why this would require disclosure of the process used in the assessment of the outcome.  It is simply a safety consideration made by a separate body and the information is offered to the court.  It does not involve sensitive information on either an accused or the defence and the information would not be presented as evidence.  Considering that the information is procedural, there may have been confusion on the Minister of State's part about what he believed was actually being suggested.

There would be no choice.  It would have to happen.  Section 18 provides that the prosecution shall have regard to the assessment report in determining what, if any, special measures to apply for.  The prosecution will be in a position to determine, in all the circumstances at the time of the trial, whether the special measures identified in the assessment are in the interests of the victim and, if so, what information the court needs to be aware of to support the application for a particular special measure.  The Bill has been very carefully drafted to maintain a separation between the assessments and the court to ensure the assessments can comprehensibly assess the needs of the victim without any fear of sensitive personal information being released to the defence or potentially prejudicial information being given to the court.  These are serious matters.  The legislation has been drafted in a very careful way to protect the victim.  If the Senators are insisting that the prosecutor \"shall\" inform the court of the outcome of an assessment, it would be giving a lot of information to the defence which it might not be in its bests interest to have.  It could be detrimental to the prosecution and the victim and end up doing the opposite of what the Senators intend.  As this is very serious, I ask the Senators not to press the amendment in order to allow the prosecution to have a free hand in making decisions.  I ask them not to impose what they propose in this legislation because, let us not forget, the prosecution will be acting on behalf of the victim.  The prosecution has to be free to decide what the court needs to be aware of and to support the application for a particular special measure.<\/p>  <p>It is not clear what the words \"outcome of that assessment\" mean.

Senator Norris has already raised the nature of those rulings and the rule itself.<\/p>  <p>The concept of an ombudsman or one-stop-shop to which victims of crime could have recourse is provided for in recital 62 of the directive, which states that member states should consider developing sole points of access or one-stop-shops to address victims' multiple needs.  Over many needs, we have seen a very patchy network of victims' support services across Ireland.  We carried out some research on this in Trinity College some years ago.  There is real inconsistency in terms of the supports available to victims.  This legislation will do a lot to help that but we felt, and were supported by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in this regard, that the idea of an ombudsman for victims would be a worthwhile one to include in a Bill of this kind.<\/p>  <p>In its observations on this Bill, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission recommended a single point of contact for victims to register a complaint about their treatment in the criminal justice system and argued that this would assist in securing great transparency, consistency and foreseeability of treatment.<\/p>  <p>While the ruling has been made and we cannot debate the amendment itself, I again ask the Minister to consider the concept of the establishment of an ombudsman for victims.  It should also be noted that part of our amendment also referred to reporting on general and specialist training, which is an issue dealt with in amendment No. 41 tabled by Senator Boyhan, which has been accepted, so I know we will be dealing with some of the issues that were raised in amendment No. 14 when we get to amendment No. 41.<\/p>  <p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his latitude in allowing me to speak me to an amendment that was ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700030#NN00300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1506520200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Does Senator Norris wish to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700030#NN00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1506520200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>No, thank you.

It certainly did not come from me.  I am happy to accept any amendments that I can accept and if I am persuaded that they will not pose difficulties or that they are necessary.<\/p>  <p>Amendment No. 15 is to be inserted into section 13 of the Criminal Evidence Act.  However, it is not exactly clear where it is supposed to go.  The words \"the relevant offence\" do not appear in the section and if the text is inserted as \"a relevant offence\", it does not make any sense.  It is not, therefore, clear as to what exactly this amendment should apply.<\/p>  <p>It may be that the Senators are seeking to extend the presumptive right to give evidence via live television link, which currently applies to children, to any person who is under 18 at the time of making his or her complaint.  I can see merit in that proposal.  However, there is a risk that it may result in persons of the same age and in the same circumstances being treated differently by the courts merely on the basis of the date on which a formal complaint was made.<\/p>  <p>While there are clear reasons to treat those who are children at the time they are giving evidence differently to adults, which has been upheld by the courts as proportionate, it is not at all certain that the same could be said for treating some adults differently to others depending on how early each person made a complaint.  One has two adults and one is saying that one of them has to have video link because he or she made a complaint ten years ago while the other cannot have video link because he or she made a complaint two months ago.  That is what the Senators are saying.<\/p>  <p>This could result in older adults being given greater protection than younger adults just because it took longer for one victim to come forward than another.  It may also have the effect of putting pressure on a child victims to make a formal complaint at an earlier time than they are ready in order to avail of the enhanced rights.  Senators should think about that for a minute.  That is a serious point as well.<\/p>  <p>Amendment No. 34 seeks to extend provisions allowing video-recorded statements to be admissible in court to persons over the age of 18.  As with amendment No. 15, I see merit in what is being proposed but this is a significant shift away from established practice.  The protections are considered proportionate on the basis of the particular vulnerability of, and the need to safeguard, children.  Extending this particular right to adults bears the risk of an unfair interference in the rights of an accused person to face his or her accuser and would need to be carefully examined from a constitutional perspective.<\/p>  <p>I also point out that the amendment is technically flawed in that it applies to any case in which this part applies.  That language has been removed from the Criminal Evidence Act by this Bill in order to extend certain other provisions of the Act to victims of all offences.  The amendment also fails to make consequential amendments to section 15 of the Criminal Evidence Act which would be required if this amendment was accepted.  They are just technical issues.  <\/p>  <p>As I have said, these amendments have merit and are worthy of consideration.  However, as drafted, they would lead to inconsistent treatment of people in the same circumstances and would require careful consideration to avoid the risk of unintended consequences or unconstitutionality.  There may be a need to re-examine the Criminal Evidence Act in a more comprehensive way to look at many of the points raised in this area during the progress of this Bill and I will certainly give a commitment to look into that.<\/p>  <p>For the reasons outlined and because of the technical flaws in the amendments, I am afraid I cannot accept them.  The issue of video link concerns children and once people go over a certain age, they are no longer a child even though they might have made a complaint earlier on.  There are serious issues around this and I again ask the Senators not to press the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700030#NN01600","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1506520200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>With due respect, these amendments do affect children because if people are children when they go to make a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that is when they are initiating their concern around a potential criminal action against them.  In respect of the experience of children as they seek to navigate our legal system and our courts, we see a huge fall-off where people drop out of the system.  We see this in the case of sexual assaults, certainly for women, and we believe it is true for children.  I do not have the figures to hand but I know they are also high.<\/p> <p>People start a prosecution and drop out because they are frustrated by delays or obstructions in the legal process.  It becomes a weapon that can be used effectively by somebody and it can be a form of revictimisation, as delaying a case can ensure a child will pass the threshold of 18 and have to give evidence in person.  The distress created by the person knowing he or she may pass the threshold of being 18 and be forced to testify is distress that is visited upon a child.  There is concern.  The example the Minister of State gave was one of a case going to court ten years after somebody went to a garda versus someone who went last year.  I hope those who make statements to garda&iacute; in respect of being victims of crimes as children are not, as a standard practice, waiting ten years.  I hope the more normal practice is that the procedures flow from the initial statement to the Garda.  There is a concern about distress, potential disadvantage and perhaps a disincentive to pursue justice being visited upon children by the fact they are perhaps 16 or 17 and they may hit the age of 18 before the case and they could lose the right to video testimony.<\/p> <p>With respect, I suggest that if technical issues about exactly where this is placed have been identified as concerns they are to be fixed on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  They are minor technical matters regarding the exact section.  We see these as procedural changes.  The Government has very often had to make adjustments on Report Stage.  If we had a separate Report Stage debate it would be an opportunity for any such tidying.  We cannot allow ourselves to lose the substantive points because of such technicalities.  It is something for the Department to address as it navigates the next Stage of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700030#NN01700","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506520800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has been very cogent in explaining his reasons for not accepting amendment No. 15 and I accept his argument.

We need to be more radical in our thinking and our approach to criminal evidence.  I speak as somebody who practised as a criminal defence barrister for years.  Aggressive and hostile cross-examination of witnesses, particularly in sexual offence cases, is a real problem, as the Minister of State is well aware, in our criminal justice system.  These amendments are really designed to try to put more protections in place for vulnerable witnesses beyond those who are under 18 at the time of the trial.

As all Members know, the Bill was published in December 2016.  Two months later, in February 2017, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 was enacted.  Among the wide-ranging provisions introduced in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act were changes to the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 which overlapped with changes to that Act that are contained in this Bill.  The purpose of most of the amendments in this group is to update the text of the Bill to reflect the changes introduced in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  The substance of the changes introduced in that Act and the substance of the amendments in this Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are retained.<\/p>  <p>A small number of amendments in this group will make a material change to the provisions concerned.  The language relating to the use of screens to prevent a witness seeing an accused while giving evidence is being changed to refer to a screen being placed in an appropriate location in the courtroom rather than the witness giving evidence from behind the screen.  This will allow the screen to be placed either in front of the witness or the accused person depending on the layout of the courtroom, thus ensuring the provision is operable in different settings.<\/p>  <p>Also to ensure the greatest flexibility in the operation of the provision, the requirement that the accused be able to see the witness is being removed by amendment No. 29.  The provision contains an \"interests of justice\" text to ensure that it may not be used if it would unfairly disadvantage the accused.<\/p>  <p>Amendment No. 31 replaces the new section 14AA which sets out the matters the court has to have regard to in deciding whether a victim should give evidence via a live television link, with the use of a screen or through an intermediary.  The amendment will simplify the provision because concerns were raised that the current wording could require the prosecutor to prove elements of the case prior to the special measures being implemented.  This is not the intention and would undermine the purpose of the special measures.  The wording proposed in the amendment mirrors provisions currently in the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 and will address these concerns.<\/p>  <p>One final change to the substance of section 29 is made by amendment No. 37.  The amendment concerns section 19 of the Criminal Evidence Act which provides that a person with a mental disorder shall be entitled to the same protections as a child under various provisions of the Criminal Evidence Act.  It will limit the sections under which a person with a mental disorder is treated as a child to those sections where no additional protections are available to adults.  If an adult can avail of a protection on the basis of his or her personal needs and characteristics then an adult with a mental disorder will be treated in the same way as any other adult and the protection will be assessed having regard to his or her personal capacity and needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700033#ZZ00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1506521700,"counter":382,"content":"<p>My colleague, Senator Kelleher, had hoped to speak on this area and I will be very brief.

Since 1992 it has been possible to use intermediaries in certain court proceedings to facilitate the questioning of witnesses.  This Bill will extend that possibility, subject to the decision of the court, to all child victims.  However, the use of intermediaries has not become common practice in the years since the statute was enacted.  While there is no established current practice and no community of practitioners with whom to engage in developing best practice, I would be reluctant to expand the use of intermediaries to include not just questions but also the responses of witnesses, particularly as this issue is quite complex, given it seeks to balance the rights of a victim to give evidence and an accused's right to a fair trial.<\/p> <p>It is my hope that an extension of the scope for intermediaries in this Bill will spark renewed interest in this service.  Once some practice develops, I would be willing to revisit the expansion of the functions of intermediaries in the manner proposed here.  I suggest that any such expansion of functions would be best examined in the wider context of the development of best practice guidance for such services.<\/p> <p>On a technical note, the amendment seeks to expand the functions of intermediaries with regard to non-relevant offences but has not made a corresponding amendment with regard to relevant offences.  These offences are more serious under the existing Criminal Evidence Act and include sexual violence or threatening offences and human trafficking offences.  It appears to me to be inappropriate to expand the functions of intermediaries only for those offences where they are least likely to be of value.

An amendment, therefore, should be accepted in this regard, whether it is a Fianna F&aacute;il amendment or that of Senator Boyhan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700035#BBB01200","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1506522900,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Maybe I did not explain things properly and I am sorry if I came across a bit indistinct.  I am informed that training is provided to all State solicitors, the staff of the DPP, the Garda, prosecutors nationwide, the Irish Prison Service and the Courts Service.  That covers most of what is in the amendment.  Training is already happening.  Not only that, but three of the bodies - the Garda, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Courts Service - have published details, I am told, of their training on their websites.  Organisations are already doing this.<\/p>  <p>One of the problems we have is that non-statutory legal professional bodies have been mentioned in the amendment.  I am advised that placing any such requirements on them would not be appropriate without very careful consideration of the issue.  The status of these bodies differs from conventional organisations.  One body has recently been compared with a private members' club in a High Court decision.  For that reason and other stated reasons, I am afraid that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p>  <p>I make the following point again.  The Senators are right to highlight the importance of training.  However, training is already happening, the details have been published and people can see the information.  I am not sure if the Senators are aware of that situation.  Training is happening and we want more of it to happen.  As I said, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Garda, the DPP, the Prison Service, prosecutors and the Court Service have all undergone training in order to provide greater support to victims of crime.  Training already exists and is there to be seen.  As Senator Clifford-Lee said, training can be examined and monitored.  The Senators can look at the information themselves and go through same.  The committees of the Houses can invite some of these agencies in to discuss what is available on their websites.  Training already exists and I expect that it is of a very high standard.  As I said, we want this to move forward.<\/p>  <p>There is an issue with some of the non-statutory agencies mentioned in the amendment.  Do some of them have the structures to provide training?  It has already been advised.  It has been recommended in the directive that other bodies responsible for the training of lawyers would make available general specialist training to increase the awareness of lawyers to the needs of victims.  I agree fully with the Senators but there is no need for the amendment which contains an issue that causes problems.<\/p>  <p>The Government has accepted many Opposition amendments to this legislation in the D&aacute;il.  In fact, so many amendments were accepted in the D&aacute;il that there was nothing left to be changed in a really substantial way.  We listened in the D&aacute;il to what people brought forward.<\/p>  <p>I am anxious, and I know everyone here is as well, to get the legislation on the Statute Book.  As with many of the other discussions we have had here today, it should be possible to amend legislation.  It is early days for the legislation.  It is possible to amend, change and improve the legislation as we go along, under other statutes.  Unfortunately, for the reasons that I have outlined, I am not in a position to accept the amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092700035#BBB01300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1506522900,"counter":463,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has advisers.
