That is worrying because it was the testimony of Bankcheck to an American court.  The Minister for Finance ought to make a statement to reassure people that this is not the case or to investigate the claims made because they are very serious.<\/p><p>Some weeks ago, when deputising for Senator Darragh O'Brien, I raised the issue of discretionary medical cards.  I ask the Leader to raise it with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, who might come to the House to discuss it.  He gave assurances in the other House that a clinical panel would be put in place to ensure those suffering from chronic illnesses would have the benefit of consideration for discretionary medical cards.  We have seen no evidence of such a clinical panel.  It seems the only panel that has been put in place is one that has been told to ruthlessly save money and cut people off from the right to a discretionary medical card.  We are aware that between 20,000 and 30,000 people have been removed from the system in recent years.  This year alone, 1,000 people per month have lost their discretionary medical cards.  That means more than 8,000 sick people have lost their discretionary medical cards.<\/p> <p>All of us have experience of this at our clinics.  All of us know people with chronic diseases who have been ruthlessly cut from the system.  I ask for an update on the clinical panel put in place.  Is it operating?  Who is on it?  What must one do to be considered for a discretionary medical card?<\/p><p>Today we received good news from the ESRI on its predictions for the year ahead, but there are somewhat mixed messages in which it queries the level of adjustment to be made in the budget.  The institute suggests the adjustment should be &euro;3.1 billion, but many of us are pleased that it will just be &euro;2.5 billion.  The Minister for Finance could usefully make an announcement relevant to the ESRI report as there are some concerns in that regard.<\/p><p>One point, in particular, that I have noticed in the report is that the growth the ESRI predicts next year is most likely to occur in the services sector.  This is a reminder to the Government that it should retain the 9% VAT rate for the sector.  It could be crucial to ensuring it is allowed to lead from the front and create the employment the ESRI believes it is capable of creating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900002#A00500","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381311000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Like Senator Marc MacSharry, I welcome the very positive report of the ESRI today on growth predictions and GNP.

It is somewhat surprising to see it suggest we should proceed with the adjustment of &euro;3.1 billion in the budget so as not to have to make cuts in next year's budget.  I greatly favour the reduced budgetary adjustment of &euro;2.5 billion that has been announced.  It is a better way of trying to secure increased consumer confidence.  However, the report is certainly interesting and we might well debate it in this House, with the Leader's permission.<\/p><p>I support colleagues who yesterday asked for a debate on the direct provision system in the light of the reports of the inspectors on the centres in which asylum seekers are being held.  There is genuine concern about the fact that 1,000 children are being held in conditions that are, in some cases, woefully inadequate in respect of food preparation, fire safety, cleanliness, etc.  The reports make for a very distressing reading.<\/p><p>I welcome Senator Martin Conway's motion on Irish Sign Language which is to be taken in the House tonight.

It is a key commitment of the Government.  I attended a conference of the Adelaide Hospital Society last week, run by the medical school in Trinity College Dublin.  At the conference I heard very positive reports from the medical profession on the steps that had already been taken in preparation for the rolling out of universal health insurance.  The general public is not aware of what has been done thus far to further the Government's commitment.

One article indicated that the Minister had tried to get the Bill through the Cabinet without having it sit at all, by way of a ring-around job.  This shows a rather cavalier attitude to the Bill.  There were disquieting reports that the Bill might not be fit for purpose.  Has the Attorney General examined it?  There are people gearing up for elections all over the country next June and it is quite possible that town council elections may go ahead again.<\/p><p>Now that the Seanad is back in business and while I am talking about councillors, the Minister should examine the remuneration of county councillors, especially if the new format is to be put in place.  We face huge county council constituencies that will be much larger than those that have been in place heretofore.  Senator Paul Coghlan will be aware that there is one in our county, Kerry, involving three peninsulas - the Dingle and Iveragh peninsulas and down as far as Kenmare.  There is to be a much larger electorate and a much greater burden of work to be done by our councillors.

Therefore, farmers can expect their payments in the early part of next week.  However, I urge the Minister to fast-track payments to farmers in the light of the difficulties they are experiencing and to ensure adequate provision will be made in the budget.  There is talk of a &euro;54 million cut to the agriculture budget next week as part of the overall budgetary process.  That would be devastating for farmers.  If that cut is to be made, the Minister must consider making it in the area of administration or other elements of the budget.  It should not affect farmers' incomes.

It needs to be addressed urgently.

If the measure was restricted to genuine tradesmen and small builders who comprise the backbone of our communities, it could be great.  However, how can we, in conscience, even think about giving a VAT reduction to developers such as those who developed Priory Hall or those who have been bailed out by NAMA to the tune of tens of billions of euro at the expense of the taxpayer?  There are thousands of half-built monuments around the country that are a testament to the greed of the property developers in question.  There are a number in my county and home town of Athenry.  The Government needs to reflect seriously on giving a VAT reduction to people who have given us half-finished estates, building sites on which the hoarding is falling down and areas that are unsafe for people to enter, let alone live in.<\/p> <p>There are also hundreds, if not thousands, of developers in Ireland who have not paid the development levies owed to our local authorities.  Some estimates put the amount owed at half a billion euro.  That is money that the ordinary householders of Ireland are now being forced to pay over in property taxes.  If the Minister for Finance is considering this measure, I ask him to ensure that the developers who destroyed this country do not benefit from it.  Only tradesmen and small local contractors who are in good standing with the Revenue Commissioners, NAMA and the local authorities should benefit from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900003#B00600","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381311600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am seeking the assistance of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, regarding an adoption crisis affecting five Irish families.  The families are in a unique situation.  Having arranged to adopt a Russian child, they now find that the Russian Government has changed the rules, extending the length of time an adoptive child is to be registered on its database from six months to 12 months.  As a result, the children these families proposed to adopt will only be on the database for 12 months after October 31, 2013, when the declaration for eligibility for prospective Irish adoption expires.

While it is not something of which we are unaware in this House, Mr. Sutherland pointed to the media's portrayal of an overly negative picture, both here and abroad, of the current situation and the measures being taken by the Government.

However, the drop in unemployment is not solely due to emigration and we have the statistics to back up Mr. Sutherland's assertion in that regard.  The negative image of Ireland abroad is being hugely emphasised by our own media.

The Minister&rsquo;s proposals will see the movement of councillor numbers from the west to the east, yet again depriving rural Ireland of the proper representation to which it is entitled.  As Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan alluded to, local government is fast becoming non-local government under the Minister.  County Cavan has an electoral area stretching from Blacklion on the border with County Fermanagh and County Donegal to beyond Cavan town, almost 40 miles of countryside.  Such an area size will not facilitate local government, a fact of which the Leader and other colleagues are aware.  I would welcome clarification from the Minister of what he intends to do to local government.  Does he intend to leave the town councils as they are?  Does he intend to leave councillor numbers as they are and not reduce the number in County Cavan by seven?

I have had quite a number of cases in which I have had to fight tooth and nail for a medical card to be retained.  However, the matter needs to be put in context.  Since we entered government, over 267,000 additional medical cards have been issued.  Over 2 million, 44% of the population or four out of every ten people, now have a medical card or a GP-only card.  Last year alone, an additional 165,000 medical cards were issued.  There have been cases in which people with &euro;300 a week above the qualifying limit without any medical complaint had a medical card for the previous three years.<\/p><p>Senator Lorraine Higgins raised the issue of lowering the VAT rate for the construction industry.  In 2009 at European level, there was a proposal that for small building projects under &euro;25,000 the rate of VAT would be decreased to 5%.  That was to get rid of the black market and people doing work for cash.  It is an issue that needs to be examined.  If we reduce the VAT rate, we must ensure the black market does not continue.  Many would like to undertake renovation work to their houses but have put it off.  The forthcoming budget would be the appropriate time to give an incentive for this type of construction work to restart.  It would bring a large number of people in the building sector back into work.  The country has lost a large number of qualified tradespeople to emigration.  If the building industry was to take off in the morning, we might not have a sufficient number of people with the skills required.  That is another point about which we need to be careful, too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900005#D00800","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I join those who have called for a debate on the latest ESRI economic commentary.  Next week, obviously, we will be concentrating on the budget.  Between then and Christmas, we should have several debates to deal with various reports, starting with the ESRI's.  I note that it is predicting higher growth rates next year.  I do not believe this is correct, but we will find out in due course.  One of our problems is that a coterie of State agencies have been over-optimistic about our growth rates.  I remember telling the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, two years ago in the Chamber that in the Government&rsquo;s tenure growth rates would not average more than 1%.  At the time the Government was predicting a growth rate of 2.5% for 2012 and 2.6% for 2013.  None of these has come to pass.<\/p><p>I recognise that confidence in the economy is starting to come back, which is an essential first step.  However, the most important factor above all others is the unemployment rate.  We had a 14.8% unemployment rate at the peak of the recession.<\/p> <p>Next year it will probably be approximately 13%.  That should caution us all about the extent of the development and growth we need to see in our economy to correct that serious unemployment situation.  We had 4.4% unemployment at the peak of the economic boom and we should start to get back to that.<\/p><p>We should look at competitiveness in the economy.  Our cost of living is exceptionally high and I am disappointed that the Government has not taken steps to try to bring some structural corrections to our economy.  The public service is still way overpaid and our social welfare costs are too high because our cost of living is too high.  Something must be done to inject some momentum into that area so that we can get back to having a sustainable, competitive economy here.  I would like debate on that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900005#D00900","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381312800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I did not speak yesterday.

The Rape Crisis Network published a report this morning about the age of perpetrators abusing children and young teenagers.  We have known for some time that abuse is likely to be within families but the average age of perpetrators is 26, much younger than we thought.  In some cases the abuse is by child perpetrators on younger children in the family.  This should be of concern to everybody in this House because we know a cycle of abuse is repeated if it is not healed and rehabilitated.  I seek a cross-Government response.  Education needs to respond urgently.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, needs to act on the influence of pornography, which has been brought up in this House before, the early sexualisation of girls and poor role models such as Miley Cyrus.  Sinead O'Connor's response to that recent incident was highly influential and much welcomed, but we cannot stand idly by and pretend it does not matter.  The budget is on our minds, as is the recent referendum, but we must consider the health and welfare of our young girls in particular, because 97% of the children being abused are girls.

I presume the Minister for Finance will make a statement on that at the appropriate time.  Senator MacSharry also raised the question of the ESRI report, as did other Senators, and the &euro;2.5 billion adjustment.  The European Commission has given preliminary approval of the Government's proposal to seek a budgetary consolidation of less than &euro;3.1 billion originally sought by the troika.  It said that the &euro;2.5 billion adjustment \"provides a sound basis for taking forward the necessary fiscal consolidation in Ireland\" and paving the way for a successful exit from the bailout programme.<\/p> <p>That is welcome news from the European Commission.  <\/p><p>A number of Senators raised the issue of discretionary medical cards.  I will certainly raise the question of the medical panel, mentioned by Senator Marc MacSharry, and try to get an update on it.

I am sure we can have a debate on the issue when the budget is announced by the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>Senator Mary M. White asked about Russian adoptions, a matter also raised by Senator Feargal Quinn and others.  As Senator Mary White stated, I have been actively involved with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the issue, on which the Minister has been proactive.  This week she will meet a senior member of the Russian Government to try to solve this unfortunate problem which affects families in Ireland.  The Senator also mentioned amending the 2010 Adoption Act.  I hope this will not be necessary and that the discussions with the Minister's Russian counterpart will solve the problem.  The Minister is very concerned about the issue and will do everything possible to solve the problem for the families involved.<\/p><p>Senator Catherine Noone spoke about the importance of projecting a positive image of the country, a point made by Mr. Peter Sutherland this morning.

We will try to get the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to come to the House to discuss the matter.<\/p><p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson spoke about the local government Bill.  I assure him that no legislation will be rushed through the House.

The Senator also welcomed the proposals to resolve the Priory Hall issue.  We all welcome these proposals and hope the matter will reach a speedy conclusion.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke spoke about medical cards, the reduction of the VAT rate and the need for incentives for the building industry.  Senator Jim Walsh spoke about the ESRI report.  The unemployment rate has reduced from 14.8% to 13%.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, as did Senator Michael Mullins, 34,000 additional net jobs have been created in the past 12 months.  It is to be hoped the stimulus proposals and suggestions to be made in the budget will increase this number in the coming years.  <\/p><p>Senator Michael Mullins also called for a debate on the growing levels of addiction.

These small companies might be employing six to ten people.  They are giving employment in their local area.  If they are not eligible for financial support, I sincerely believe they need a mentoring service.  I am dealing with a case in Swords at present on behalf of my colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien.  This lady is doing very well in a hairdressing business but she desperately needs to talk over her business issues.  <\/p><p>  The situation appears to be very unbalanced.  I realise the money must go to companies that have the potential to export, but I believe we should expand the mandate of the enterprise board.  That is not allowed at present, unless on an <i>ad hoc<\/i> basis.  I know there is pressure on resources and on the availability of money for the enterprise boards.  That will be a very serious issue for the new local enterprise offices, LEOs, if they are to have money to run their businesses.  I am speaking on behalf of small employers whose businesses are in the services sector and who could really increase the size of their businesses if they had mentoring.  In the Fianna F&aacute;il policy paper on promoting women entrepreneurs I pushed very ardently for encouraging two or three people to start a business together, rather than one.  It is torturous starting and running a business if one is on one's own.<\/p><p>  My heart went out to the lady I met in Swords last week.  I rang Oisin Geoghegan, the chief executive of the Fingal Enterprise Board, and he very courteously came out and spoke to her.  He said he would do his best personally to help the lady.  It is a lovely salon that employs young people.  The lady wants to set up a hairdressing academy, which would provide more skills and create employment, so he decided that he would give her a mentoring service himself.  I am calling for this to be provided.  I am sure the Minister of State agrees that it makes sense.  There is an issue with the fact that we cannot fund companies unless they are exporting.  People talk about achieving growth in the economy and we all know the only way we can do that is by having more companies that will export.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900008#G01100","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1381314000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>We are on amendment No. 3.

I am told by county enterprise boards that with the transfer of powers there are additional financial responsibilities for local authorities.  The county enterprise board structure is currently 100% funded by the Government but powers will be transferred from the county enterprise boards to the local enterprise offices under Enterprise Ireland and the dual functioning responsibilities of local authorities.<\/p> <p>The authorities will be responsible for part of the financing that will be at the disposal of the LEOs.  Is that correct?  If so, how does the Minister of State see local authorities being in a position to fund such activities given that many of them, including the one in my county, Donegal, are struggling financially to deal even with their current responsibilities under the 2001 Local Government Act?  I refer to planning, housing, environmental issues and so on.  They are strapped for cash.  I do not believe that putting another layer, albeit a new one, of responsibility on local authorities in regard to job-creating responsibilities, an area where local authorities have no defined function under the 2001 legislation, can work.  The answer will determine whether we press this amendment.  Can the Minister of State clarify whether it is stated anywhere in the legislation that this will be cost neutral to local authorities and will not cost them an additional penny?  Will there be a budget of at least &euro;40 million dedicated and available to the LEOs nationally?  That is what the CEOs of the county enterprise boards have sought from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation down the years.  They require that sort of budget to fulfil their role effectively and efficiently.<\/p><p>I do not lay the blame on the Minister of State's desk but down through the years when the budget was available early in the year, very often when it came to October, November or December, additional moneys were made available because of the lack of spending in certain areas and these were given to the county enterprise boards.  They had to approve the grant aid within six weeks and draw down also had to be made in that time.  It was neither workable nor practicable.  Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify this point.  We will reserve judgment on whether to press the amendment.  We cannot have a situation where county councils and councillors are expected to come up with a budget they do not have, for functions they do not have under the local government legislation.  It would be grossly unfair to councillors and councils throughout the country to be expected to find such money. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900008#G01700","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381314600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I will clarify this issue for the Senator.  The new local enterprise offices - in 31 locations around the country - will comprise the existing staff resources of the county enterprise boards and those of the business development units of the local authorities.  These combined resources will deliver an enhanced service via a very effective service level agreement, which I will circulate.  It clearly indicates the new role and is well worth studying.  I refer to Senator White's point which we will discuss later.  It is not in any way excluded and if anything will be enhanced.  The combined resources will deliver an enhanced and integrated support service involving business people through a first-stop shop, under a service level agreement to micro and small businesses.<\/p><p>This is breaking ground in respect of enterprise in every county.  There will be a great level of autonomy in respect of the involvement of local authority and Enterprise Ireland staff, currently under the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

Individual LEO budgets will be allocated by Enterprise Ireland as a separate, ring-fenced subhead.  It is entirely assured, without any dilution.  It is ring-fenced funding that will be benchmarked.  It is anticipated that local authorities will provide funding to LEOs for activities and projects, particularly in regard to enterprise promotion, through their normal budgetary processes.  As I stated, local authorities have already committed staff resources on a county-by-county basis.  To include in legislation the provision mentioned by the Senator would prohibit local authorities from supporting enterprise development in their local areas and, in my view, would directly contravene last year's decision by Government to restructure the existing model, creating an enhanced national enterprise support model to be delivered through the local authorities.<\/p><p>What is contained in the legislation is an enhancement of the service, providing a one-stop shop and enhanced role of services.  I will circulate the service level agreement.  Any questions Senators may have about availability, county by county, and the due diligence to be carried out is clearly set out in that document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900009#H00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1381314600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>An bhfuil an Seanad&oacute;ir s&aacute;sta leis an freagra?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900009#H00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1381314600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it.

We would very much welcome reading the service level agreement ahead of Report Stage of the Bill in order to reflect on it.<\/p><p>I do not question in any way either the sincerity of the Minister of State's standpoint or the view he has expressed as to the benefit of the change.  My worst fears, however, have been confirmed after hearing the Minister of State read that script.  I refer to the statement that while the primary source of funding for LEOs will come from the State, local authorities are also expected to provide funding - funding they do not have.  At present county councils throughout the country are not engaged in job creation.  Through the planning and economic development units of county councils and the county development plan they have certain functions and a statutory obligation to assist in this area where they play a pivotal role.  That applies to county enterprise boards all over but nowhere is it more evident than in County Donegal where the county manager since 1993 has been the chairman of the county enterprise board.  Councillors who have sat on these boards are now being dismissed under the new structures.  <\/p><p>To date, job-creating responsibilities have been performed by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the county enterprise boards but all funding came from central government sources.  It would be grossly unfair now if councils are to be asked to provide even a small amount of the required moneys.  When the Minister of State mentions the primary source of funding is to come from the Exchequer, what does &quot;primary source&quot; mean?  Is it 50%, 80% or 95%?  What is the expectation of matching funding under this proposed legislation for local authorities?  I am told different things, depending on who I speak to and have been given different levels of matching funding but these are only anecdotal.  I can only go on the information provided to me but I understand there will be a matching funding requirement for local councils.  This is funding they do not have and will compete with other commitments they have.<\/p><p>I accept the transfer of functions, as agreed in the legislation, will take care of the staffing complement but it is the hard core money that bothers me.  Ultimately, this is about creating jobs and this costs money.  The role of county enterprise boards, while providing mentoring and assistance, was to provide grant aid and seed capital to new companies starting up.  To do that money is needed.  On a cost per job basis, let us take, for example, a new enterprise that would create five jobs.  Suppose the cost per job is &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 in grants, and the company receives a grant of &euro;50,000 for setting up X number of jobs.  Where is the &euro;50,000 to come from now?  Will it come solely from central government sources?  Will this continue in regard to any form of venture capital, whether seed capital or interest-free loans?  The county enterprise board model of interest-free loans has been exceptionally well received in business circles.  Will it continue and, if not, from where will loans be funded?  That is the crux here.  Where is the money coming from for the funding for business start-ups that used to come from county enterprise boards?  This is a long way of trying to find out the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900009#H00400","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1381314600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Before the Minister of State replies, I call Senator Clune.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900009#H00500","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1381314600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I note the Minister of State's responses.

They will now be able to access all the information and supports they need in a one-stop-shop format from the local authority rather than having to go all around the houses.  As the Minister of State pointed out, the money that was previously allocated to the county enterprise boards is being ring-fenced for the same purpose under the local authorities.

Exchequer funding currently secured by the Minister will continue to be allocated under a separate subheading on a collective basis to Enterprise Ireland, and responsibility for the distribution of these funds to and between the county and city councils will be transferred to Enterprise Ireland in accordance with legislation and appropriate schemes.  Budgets will be allocated on an annual basis but, in the interim, will come under the existing administration of pay and non-pay headings.  It has been agreed that the budget allocation methodology will initially remain unchanged as regards measure one and that local authorities may provide additional funds for activities, projects and supports.  In short, there will be no requirement for local authorities to match the funds coming from Enterprise Ireland.  I have spoken to several local authorities and their main concerns include the stacked-up costs of doing business, vacant units, ailing town centres and so on.  There is already a whole range of expertise in those areas within the local authorities, which the manager might decide to deploy.  None of this will dilute any of the funding.  The moneys allocated by the Department for enterprise through the enterprise boards will remain unchanged and there will be no matching stipulation.  However, if local authorities wish to focus on supporting enterprise, rejuvenating a town centre or giving a derogation, for instance, they will have a huge level of autonomy in regard to their budget.  Such decisions will be at their discretion.  We are putting in place a comprehensive service level agreement which will clearly establish the capabilities and functions of business people, elected members and the fantastic staff who work in local government.  I assure the Senator that when he reads the service level agreement, which I will circulate presently, he will see it all there in black and white.  The funding allocations and how it will all be managed are set out clearly.  The new arrangement with Enterprise Ireland will ensure there is access to expertise.  Where before we had 31 autonomous enterprise boards, this new policy direction will ensure there is a more cohesive provision of support services to high-potential start-up companies and companies seeking to expand.  There is also scope for the institutes of technology to get involved, if they so wish.  It is a positive development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900010#J00500","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1381315200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that we may choose to resubmit it on Report Stage.

It is great to see the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, back among us.  She is heartily welcome.  I agree with the sentiments the Acting Chairman has just expressed.  It is great to welcome members of the Irish deaf community to the Gallery.  It is appropriate that the House has organised sign interpretation for this important debate.  This is an equality issue.  It is about access to information and it is important in terms of how we define ourselves as a nation.  Irish Sign Language is a unique language.  It is the mechanism used by thousands of deaf people in this country to communicate.  It is their language and they are proud of it.<\/p><p>  Commitments have been made on the recognition of Irish Sign Language as far back as the Good Friday Agreement.  Irish Sign Language was seen as the language of a united Ireland and a language of equality where people from different traditions had a common thread and language that broke down barriers.  It was identified by peacemakers in Northern Ireland as a symbol of what could be achieved and the type of country and society to which the people who crafted the Good Friday Agreement aspired.  It was a beacon of hope, light, connectivity, equality and inclusiveness and that was the reason Irish Sign Language was part of the Good Friday Agreement.  In recent years there have been many campaigns for the recognition of Irish Sign Language.  Its promotion and advancement is in the programme for Government.<\/p><p>  We have a unique opportunity in Seanad &Eacute;ireann to unanimously support a motion recognising the importance of Irish Sign Language.  That is a crucial and important step in the right direction towards eventual recognition.  As an individual and politician I am fully committed to the full recognition of Irish Sign Language.<\/p> <p>Other countries have done it successfully and we can learn from their experience.  If it is something that will take time then let us start the process.  I see this evening as the beginning of a process where a House of the Oireachtas unanimously recognises the importance of Irish Sign Language.  Everybody has a right to full access to information.  People need to be able to go about their daily lives and communicate with comfort and ease, and with the knowledge that information is not being suppressed in any way and that they have full access to it.  Many people speak as Gaeilge and their rights are recognised by the Official Languages Act, which is absolutely appropriate and correct.  Irish Sign Language is the method of communication for thousands of deaf people and I firmly believe we need to aspire to its full recognition in Irish legislation.<\/p><p>I commend some of my colleagues who have campaigned on this issue.  Senator Mark Daly has prepared an Irish Sign Language Bill and I sincerely hope we can work together in the interests of Irish Sign Language, because while it is a political issue it is not a party political issue.  I also commend other colleagues, including Senator C&aacute;it Keane, who has done enormous work with the deaf community over the years.  One of her first motions on the Adjournment was on Irish Sign Language.<\/p><p>There is a huge amount of political support for this; we just need to identify the correct mechanism to implement it.  If it needs to be done incrementally then so be it.  Those campaigning for recognition of Irish Sign Language are, like myself, reasonable.  They know the old clich&eacute; that Rome was not built in a day, and what they want to see is a pathway to recognition.  If there are issues or challenges, or the Civil Service - what we like to call the permanent government - has concerns, let us hear them and let us engage so we can smooth them out and alleviate them.<\/p><p>Today I informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality that this motion, which I sincerely hope will be agreed unanimously, was before Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I suggested in the event the motion was agreed that the committee would hold a module on the possibility of introducing legislation to facilitate recognition of Irish Sign Language, and that the committee would seek submissions and hold oral hearings with a view to writing a report of recommendations to the Minister on how best to go about it.  I hope the committee will examine best international practice and examine where sign language is officially recognised and make recommendations to the Government accordingly.<\/p><p>This country has achieved much with regard to disability, access and equality but this is an area in which we have significantly underachieved.  With the capacity legislation which the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is bringing through the Houses, Ireland will ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  In advance of ratification I would like to see the spirit of the UN convention being embraced and Irish Sign Language is a fundamental part of the spirit of the UN convention.  As a country we should not be looking for best practice internationally when it comes to equality of access to information; we should be setting the standard and this is why the motion is important.  With the mandate the Seanad received from the Irish people in the referendum last week, where the people overwhelmingly decided to retain it, it can champion issues such as this, and I certainly intend to do so.  This evening's debate will be important with regard to the future of Irish Sign Language and achieving what many in the Gallery want, namely, official recognition.  It is my pleasure to propose the motion and I look forward to hearing the debate and the contributions from my colleagues on all sides of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900011#K01000","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381316100,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I second the motion and I am delighted to welcome representatives from the Irish Deaf Society to the Chamber.<\/p><p>As Senator Conway stated, my involvement on this issue with Brian Crean, Dr. John Bosco Conama and the Irish Deaf Society goes back a long way.  It was important to me that I used my maiden Adjournment motion in the Seanad two years ago to raise the issue.  I am afraid not much has happened since then, and I am delighted Senator Conway has put it on the agenda as a Fine Gael Private Members' motion.  It is only by keeping it on the agenda at every opportunity we will see advances.  I have a lot of trust in the Minister of State that she will ensure it moves forward.<\/p><p>Senator Conway mentioned the Good Friday Agreement.  I raised the matter at the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly which meant I had to have 15 signatures, including five each from various member Governments.  Some of the Unionists initially confused Irish Sign Language with the Irish language but they were delighted to sign it and we got it through.  I am awaiting a report from the three Governments to which it was sent, and the Welsh Government is preparing a Bill.<\/p><p>Official recognition of the language is important.  It is all right to state that rights exist and that we will take action, and much is written down on paper, but writing into legislation official rights and recognition is what is important.  This is what everybody in society, including the deaf community, deserves.  It is not asking for much.<\/p><p>In 1998, the European Parliament passed a resolution on sign language and in 2010 the Brussels declaration on sign language in the European Union was signed.  We have no legislation on Irish Sign Language.  The Minister of State has provided a good paper on the facilities available, and more is available now than it was before.  Irish Sign Language is part of the culture of deaf people and approximately 40,000 people use it, including 5,000 deaf people.  It is not easy to be deaf in mainstream society.  They are absolutely fantastic people and I congratulate them on the work they have done in reaching the heights they have in society and education.  Services are not always available and they must fight for them.<\/p><p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and its optional protocol, was adopted in 2006 and I ask the Minister of State to speak about this.  Article 9 recognises the right of people with disabilities to live independently.  This aims to eliminate any obstacle or barrier.  The article also obliges the State to take certain measures to ensure deaf people can partake in society, included recognising and promoting the use of sign language.<\/p> <p>Signing up to that would advance the development of Irish Sign Language.  Hungary can do this.  It has given official recognition to its own sign language, which creates a foundation.  There is an attitudinal shift when people get their rights in legislation, which is all people are looking for.<\/p><p>The adoption of the sign language legislation in Hungary was the outcome of a long struggle, like ours.  When I was a councillor, I came to Leinster House to approach then Senator Ann Ormonde, who did what she could, but nothing was really done at the time.  I hope we will end the struggle as we have been fighting for it for a long time.  Hopefully, we will achieve equality in education, in particular early education at the preschool level.  I know Dr. John Bosco Conama and Mr. Brian Crean.  When we set up the Model School for the Deaf, it got funding for a three-year pilot project in regard to early education assistance in the home for Irish Sign Language.  All of this is necessary.  While some assistance is given, they have to fight for it all the way, whereas it should be there as of right, in legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to progress this and I congratulate Senator Martin Conway for putting it on the agenda.  Hopefully, the Minister of State will come back to the House again on this issue.  We will not achieve everything today so we will be keeping it on the agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900012#L00200","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381316700,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

When we were in government I approached our own Ministers on the issues, yet it got bogged down in official Ireland.  The establishment and the Civil Service, not noted for telling us how things can be done, were telling me why it cannot be done.  I fear this will not happen until such time as a member of the deaf community takes the Government to court and forces it to do what it has agreed to do under the Good Friday Agreement.  We are in breach of that agreement.  Despite the fact Irish Sign Language is officially recognised in the North, down here it is not given the same recognition, has not been put on a legislative footing and does not have statutory support.  That is not as it should be, as the Minister of State is aware.<\/p><p>We have to consider the consequences for members of the deaf community of the fact we do not recognise Irish Sign Language.  It means they do not have access to information, whether citizens' information, information on Government services or information about the Department of Social Protection.  It is hard for us to understand how difficult it is to even go about accessing social welfare services when one cannot communicate as other members of the community do, namely, through a glass screen while not having an interpreter available.  In addition, there is the issue of education and trying to access educational services.  Most importantly and life threatening of all, there is the issue of access to health services.  Can one imagine a person trying to communicate with a doctor or a staff member in accident and emergency about their condition and how they are feeling when there is a language barrier between them?  With modern technology, an interpreter can be available on a phone in any doctor's surgery or accident and emergency unit.  However, that will not be made available until such time as there is official recognition because people will not do it unless they have to and Governments will not act unless they must.<\/p><p>While good will is there, no doubt, until such time as Irish Sign Language is put on an official State footing and until legislation is brought in, we will continue to see the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Good Friday Agreement broken and not implemented.

The Irish Sign Language recognition Bill, which I will make available to all Members, will plug the hole and make sure we are no longer in breach of the Good Friday Agreement.  I hope the Minister of State might be available to come back to the House again, and she could give the Bill to the officials to see what we can do in terms of advancing this.  I hope all Members would support it and let it go to Committee Stage, and that we would give time for whatever amendments the Government sees fit to include to be included in that legislation, so it can go to the D&aacute;il and be enacted.  We would then no longer breach the Good Friday Agreement and the deaf community here would be on the same footing as the deaf community in the North in regard to the issue of Irish Sign Language.  We would ensure that all of the people in the Visitors Gallery and the members of the deaf community in Ireland get the recognition for Irish Sign Language that has been promised but has so far not been delivered by this Government or any other Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900013#M00200","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1381316700,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

As has been well established at this point, without legal protection deaf people face uncertain and limited access to society and are exposed to disadvantages in every aspect of their daily lives.  A number of Government initiatives are already in place which seek to promote and enhance Irish Sign Language, and these include special schools for the deaf or hearing impaired, who have been encouraged to use sign language in class; funding for an Irish Sign Language weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf preschool children and deaf school-going children to provide training in Irish Sign Language for the deaf children, their siblings and parents; and funding is also made available through the Special Education Support Service to enable individual teachers and whole-school staff to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language which are available throughout the country.<\/p><p>As everyone will be aware, the NCSE published policy advice on &quot;The Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland&quot; in February 2012.  As with many disabilities and difficulties, early intervention and well-resourced supports is key.  A few of the NCSE recommendations have been implemented to date, including the universal newborn hearing screening programme and information for parents on services available to their children.  As with so many things during these difficult years, we could do with more funding and more attention being paid to this area.<\/p><p>As a spokesperson for disability and equality, promoting inclusion of the various different groups in our society is at the fore of my work in the Seanad.  I believe one of the most important features of this motion is the attention paid to developing ideas for improved access to public services for users of Irish Sign Language between those in the Irish deaf community and Government and Department representatives.  I have insisted on many different issues that the key stakeholders, the people with the most input, should be those who have the most to gain or lose, as the case may be.  In the area of special needs education, I have always advocated that parents of children with special needs should have a seat and a loud voice at the discussion table.  This situation should be no different.  I have never suffered with a hearing impairment so I am not best placed to make decisions, like those in the Gallery.  They are the true experts on this subject and their advice and ideas should be seriously taken into account.<\/p><p>As I understand it, a meeting will be held on 14 November 2013 under the national disability strategy implementation plan and this will focus on Irish Sign Language.  I look forward to the results of this meeting and I would welcome post-meeting feedback from those interested parties here today.<\/p> <p> Every day advocacy groups, organisations and charities are doing more with less to serve their members.  As a Government we need to think flexibly and innovatively on this topic.  The programme for Government commits to \"examine different mechanisms to promote the recognition of Irish Sign Language\".  While doing research for this speech I learned a great deal more than I had previously known about the issues facing the deaf community and the ways in which we can assist them in achieving equality of access to services and in other areas of life.<\/p><p>I look forward to the outcomes and recommendations of the meeting under the national disability strategy next month and I will continue to work with Government colleagues to address the issues raised here today.<\/p><p>I do not have a hearing impairment.  I had not come in contact with those with hearing difficulties until it came to the fore through my involvement with the Special Olympics.  One of our athletes from England was fluent in English Sign Language but when he came to Ireland he had to struggle to pick up Irish Sign Language as people here could not understand English Sign Language and he was caught in the middle.  This brought to the fore the importance of ensuring that Irish Sign Language is recognised as an official language.  One realises the importance of language when one comes in contact with such individual cases.  I would welcome feedback from those who continue to work in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900013#M00300","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381317300,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It is wonderful to see her in this Chamber.<\/p><p>  I am very supportive of the motion tabled by my friend and colleague, Senator Martin Conway, and well supported by Senator Keane.  I am not that familiar with this issue, so in advance I seek forgiveness if I step on toes and say the wrong things.  I have a great many questions because as I research the issue, I find more contradictions as I try to work out the real obstacles. <\/p><p>  As was stated, the European Parliament unanimously approved a resolution about deaf sign languages on 17 June 1988.  The resolution asks all member countries to recognise their national sign languages as official languages of the deaf.  The Irish Government signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007, but has yet to ratify the convention, which contains obligations toward native sign languages.  We need to be mindful of the needs of the deaf and the hard of hearing and develop improved systems in consultation with that community.<\/p><p>  I am cognisant of evolving technologies.  I think we could do more with technology.  The BBC has late night reruns of programmes which have sign language captions.  Given changed viewing habits, I do not know about anybody else but I tend to watch all prerecorded television, but perhaps we could also do more repeat programmes with Irish Sign Language captions.  My colleague, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, informed me the Abbey Theatre, Ireland's national theatre, has been putting on Irish Sign Language interpreted performances of each of its plays for the past 13 years and has<i> de facto <\/i>recognised and supported Irish Sign Language as the third indigenous language in Ireland.  The Abbey Theatre should be applauded for that initiative.  Other bodies should be encouraged to look at similar initiatives.  The State has a responsibility but we all have a responsibility.  I thank Senators Conway and Keane for their input.  I also want to thank Senators Moran and Daly.  Senator Daly has already answered some of my questions.<\/p><p>  Some 850,000 people in Ireland have hearing issues, if we include some of the senior population.  However, only 1,077 put down Irish Sign Language as their method of communication when filling out the census in 2011.  Some members of the deaf community are present and have clearly articulated their needs.  We need to consider ways of using new technologies in public service offices.  We would be able to provide Irish Sign Language services in a cost effective way.  Some 20 years ago, cost would have been a factor but we must question whether it is a factor today.  I accept there may be other options for the younger deaf population.<\/p><p>  I will take the opportunity to mention the parallel issue of the cochlear implant programme.  I am very concerned that out of the 28 cochlear implant centres between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, Ireland is the only one that does not provide a bilateral cochlear implant programme.  I know the Minister of State has met the organisation and is committed to the issue but there are 350 children on the waiting list to receive a sequential cochlear implant.  We know that of that number, only 200 to 240 children will take it up.  The preference is that bilateral cochlear implants are done simultaneously.  I know of one such case.  The first implant failed and the girl had to undergo surgery to have it removed and replaced by a new implant.  The girl was not allowed out of her mother's sight and had to live in silence for five weeks, which the mother said traumatised her daughter.  One can only switch on the implant after four weeks and the person has to relearn all the sounds again, such as the sound of a bouncing ball, a clicking pen and words.  This has a significant impact on the quality of life at a critical time in the learning and development of a young person, as does Irish Sign Language.  It is really important that we do not see these issues as being in competition with each other.  We must consider how we support members of the deaf community to get the supports that will ensure they have the best quality of life possible, as we want for all citizens.<\/p><p>  The debate has opened up more issues.  It is vital that we talk to the deaf community and ensure there is a co-ordinated responsive approach.  The right to use one's own language is an important human right.  Like all linguistic minorities, members of the deaf community have different degrees of access to the majority language of the wider community and for many, English is only a second or a third language.  Consequently, written material and spoken communication are often inaccessible to deaf people.  We need to consider what supports are available.  I welcome the opportunity this debate has provided to learn about his issue.  As I become more involved I hope I will be able to support my colleagues in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900014#N00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1381317300,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and our distinguished visitors in the Gallery.  I compliment my colleagues, Senators Martin Conway and C&aacute;it Keane, for bringing forward this motion.  I hope this will be a very significant step on the road to the eventual official recognition of Irish Sign Language.  This is an issue of equality - equality of opportunity in employment, in education, in being able to access the various services provided by the State, enjoying television and playing a full part in every aspect of life.  It is a matter of principle that the motion is passed.<\/p><p>The Government signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007, which contains commitments and duties towards native sign languages.<\/p> <p> I have an interest in this matter because of something significant that happened over 25 years ago at a major manufacturing plant in Ballinasloe where I worked as personnel officer.  One day a nun from the school for the deaf in Cabra arrived at reception.  She asked me to consider employing a young lady from Lawrencetown outside Ballinasloe.  That was the first time I had been asked to consider hiring a person with a disability and I was extremely apprehensive.  However, the nun was so persuasive that I met the young lady whose name was Ms Joan Kelly.  They both convinced me to take a chance.  Ms Kelly used sign language and written notes and I gave her an employment opportunity on a trial basis.  I assure Members that I have never regretted that decision.  Ms Kelly made a major contribution to the company.  She thrived and prospered in the organisation.  It was an American company which had an employee of the year scheme and Ms Kelly travelled to the United States as a winner of the award.  Not alone did she have a long career with the company, but we hired four others who were deaf or had a disability, with Ms Kelly providing advice and assistance.  She helped to train employees and provided induction training in the company.  My experience has been extremely positive and as I have not forgotten it, I want in any way I can to help to ensure Irish Sign Language is legally recognised in the State.  <\/p><p>I commend my colleagues, Senators Martin Conway and C&aacute;it Keane, for tabling the motion and hope the Minister of State will have something positive to say.  This is an important day for the deaf community as it has brought its case to Parliament.  Having listened to the contributions so far, I know the response has been very positive.  We look forward to working with it in the coming months to ensure there will be legal recognition for Irish Sign Language in order that all members of the community can continue to grow, prosper and avail of all the opportunities available to every citizen, whether it be in education, employment or gaining access to various services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900014#N00300","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381317900,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Before calling the Minister of State, I extend a welcome to Dr. John Bosco Conama from Ballintubber, County Roscommon, chairman of the Irish Sign Language recognition group which is led by the Irish Deaf Society, of which he is a member.

I will commence by replying to something Senator Mark Daly said.  We have signed but not ratified the UN convention because there are certain things we need to do first.  Some countries have signed and ratified it, but they are now being held to account for not putting in place the necessary structures to implement what is included in the convention.  Ireland has adopted a more sensible approach and is putting the necessary structures in place before ratifying the convention.  That is why the capacity legislation is vitally important.  It is the largest piece we need to put in place before ratification, but there are other little bits and pieces that have to be put in place also.<\/p><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House and thank the Senators concerned for proposing the motion.  I ask the person signing for those seated in the Visitors Gallery to let me know if I am speaking too fast.<\/p><p>The programme for Government commits to examining different mechanisms to promote the recognition of Irish Sign Language and that process has commenced.  The commitment was made in recognition of the fact that Irish Sign Language was the preferred sign language of the deaf community in the State and an expression of culture.  As a first language for many in the deaf community, we also recognise that its use is the means through which full and equal opportunities may be achieved by its users.  In addressing the commitment in the programme for Government I requested, as a starting point, that the National Disability Authority facilitate consultations with the deaf community to more fully understand its position.  The consultations took place in May last year and brought together broad representation from the deaf community.  Written submissions from those involved were subsequently received outlining proposals for the promotion and recognition of the language and detailing actions that could be taken to improve access to services.  The contents of the submissions were brought to the senior officials group on disability services and considered for inclusion, where possible and appropriate, in the national disability strategy implementation plan published in July this year.<\/p><p>As part of the national disability strategy implementation plan and to continue to build on the work undertaken to date, I intend to hold themed meetings of the national disability strategy implementation group to deal with specific issues to be advanced on a cross-departmental basis.  The first such meeting will focus on this matter.  I will chair the meeting that will consist of representatives of the relevant Departments, the National Disability Authority, the deaf community and other relevant stakeholders.  They will be in a position to examine the current position across Departments and their agencies on promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language, including in-service provision.  In this way we can address the most pertinent issues regarding service delivery and identify means and supports to assist public bodies in delivering more accessible services.  Actions identified and agreed will be incorporated into the national disability strategy implementation plan, with key performance indicators and timelines and the relevant person being identified for implementing the action.  Progress on the actions to be undertaken will be monitored as part of the implementation plan monitoring process.<\/p><p>It must be made clear that there are no plans to establish Irish Sign Language as Ireland's third official language.  That approach might ultimately result in scarce resources being used to meet legislative requirements that may be of lesser, if any, real benefit to the deaf community than more targeted actions that would significantly improve the situation at the more practical level of service provision and improved communications when conducting business with public bodies.  This is not to say it should not be recognised in terms of its cultural and linguistic identity.<\/p><p>I fully understand Irish Sign Language is an expression of culture and an indigenous language of the deaf community.  It is in this regard that mechanisms for the promotion of the recognition of Irish Sign Language will be examined in order that an agreed platform can be reached regarding the form of recognition that is possible.  I understand other countries have made legislative provision for the recognition of sign language.  However, it must not be overlooked that the existing legislation in Ireland and the provisions made on an administrative basis give a level of recognition and provide practical measures equal to or above those offered by countries which have formally recognised sign language.  In Ireland  legal provisions regarding sign language are set out in the Disability Act, equality legislation, broadcasting legislation and the Education Act 1998.  While some of this legislation does not specifically reference the Irish Sign Language, its intention is to ensure provision is made and support given to prohibit discrimination and enable all citizens to access public services.  The Education Act 1998 makes explicit reference to Irish Sign Language.  I will highlight the extent of the provisions made and their impact.  Specific reference to Irish Sign Language is also made in two pieces of secondary legislation, the code of practice on access to services and information for people with disabilities and the statutory broadcasting access rules.<\/p> <p> Section 26 of the Disability Act obliges public bodies, where practicable and appropriate, to provide assistance, where requested, for people with disabilities to enable them to access the same public service as anyone else.  Section 28 of the Act requires that, where a public body is communicating with a person with a hearing impairment and where requested, the contents of the communication, as far as practicable, be communicated in a form that is accessible to the person concerned.  The statutory code of practice on accessible services and information which provides guidance on these two provisions references the provision of Irish Sign Language interpretation in the case of major public consultations.  It does not specifically refer to it otherwise, but it does stress the need to establish procedures for processing requests and determining the practicability of providing the form of support requested within particular communication contexts and timeframes.  <\/p><p>The Employment Equality Acts require an employer to reasonably accommodate an employee with a disability in areas such as employment and training, while the Equal Status Acts require service providers to reasonably accommodate a person with a disability availing of the service.  The provision of sign language interpretation is something which should be considered in providing these accommodations.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 enables the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to make rules specifying the steps broadcasters have to take to promote understanding and enjoyment of their programming by people who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The access rules in place under these provisions have specific requirements set out for Irish Sign Language.  The Government recognises the importance of the provision of television broadcasting services with Irish Sign Language, as well as captioning and other supplementary communication platforms, in terms of inclusion and the need to support members of the deaf community.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is committed to continuing to pursue with RTE delivery of television programmes with Irish Sign Language in line with this legislation and the commitment given in the national disability strategy implementation plan.  In this regard, mainstream programming with Irish sign language interpretation is due to commence on 16 October covering three hours per week approximately.<\/p><p>Irish Sign Language has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998.  It is a function of the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting his or her needs and abilities.  This includes provision for students learning through Irish Sign Language.  <\/p><p>With regard to education, the Government has passionately defended the provision for children with special educational needs, including children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  Some &euro;1.3 billion will be spent this year in support of children with special educational needs.  This will ensure the majority of pupils with special educational needs can continue to be educated in an inclusive environment in mainstream schools with their peers, while pupils who have additional special educational needs which require intensive interventions in a specialised environment, special class and special school placements can continue to be provided for.  <\/p><p>In line with the policy of the Department of Education and Skills that children with special educational needs access appropriate education interventions in mainstream settings, where possible, many deaf or hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level with the assistance, as necessary, of resource teaching and special needs assistant support.  In addition, there are 16 special classes for pupils with hearing impairment attached to mainstream schools, as well as three special schools for children with hearing impairment.  Enhanced capitation grants are provided for the special schools and special classes for hearing impaired pupils.  Pupils in special classes and special schools for hearing impaired children are supported by an enhanced pupil-teacher ratio of 7:1.  Special needs assistant support is also provided in these schools and classes, as required.  Many of the pupils in special classes or special schools are either taught through Irish Sign Language or use Irish sign language for part of the day and the special schools for the deaf and hearing impaired have been encouraged to use sign language in class.  <\/p><p>Providing deaf and hard of hearing children with opportunities to acquire fluent language skills at an early age is fundamentally important to developing effective communication skills, facilitating greater access to education and ensuring unproved educational outcomes when the child engages in education at a later stage.  The Department of Education and Skills, therefore, funds a number of initiatives which seek to promote and develop Irish Sign Language in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system.  This includes provision for an Irish sign language tuition scheme to assist deaf or hard of hearing children and their families to acquire competency in a language at the earliest possible opportunity.  To ensure the child can communicate with his or her family members and assist him or her to acquire fluent language skills while engaged in meaningful activity with capable users of the language and significant others, the child's family members, parents and siblings may also be included in the Irish sign language tuition under the scheme which is provided in the child's home.  Under the scheme tutors visit the homes of deaf or hard of hearing preschool and schoolgoing pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language for the children, their siblings and parents.  Funding is also made available through the special education support service to enable individual teachers and school staff to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.<\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills, through the Higher Education Authority, has established and funds a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for Irish Sign Language interpreters and tutors in deaf studies.  In addition, the visiting teacher service for children and young people with hearing impairment is provided by the Department from the time of referral through to third level education.  The vservice provides advice and support, including in Irish Sign Language provision, to ensure the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met.  The service is available at preschool, primary and post-primary levels.  Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of preschool children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and-or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.  <\/p><p>Recently the National Council for Special Education published its policy advice on the education of deaf and hard of hearing children which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for deaf and hard of hearing children, including recommendations relating to the provision of Irish Sign Language.  Stakeholders in the deaf community were consulted as part of the preparation of the policy advice.  A number of the recommendations contained in the policy advice have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.  They include recommendations on the rolling out of a universal newborn hearing screening programme, the provision of information for parents on services available to children with hearing impairment and the establishment of new special classes for children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  Work is also under way on the implementation of recommendations to improve the provision of Irish Sign Language services.<\/p><p>Senator Jillian van Turnhout mentioned the cochlear implant centres and the lack of a bilateral implementation programme.  That is a matter to which the Minister for Health has committed.  We all hope the budget will be such that the programme will be delivered on.  It is essential to ensure very young children get the best possible advantage.<\/p><p>In addition to the provisions made through legislation, there are a number of examples of good practice across the public service where there is recognition of the need for Irish Sign Language.  It is examples such as these that we hope to promote further, to create a greater awareness of and learn from in order that they can be used as examples for others and to encourage widespread implementation and increase access to services Government-wide.  <\/p><p>Senator Mark Daly mentioned that people had difficulties in accessing information.<\/p> <p> The Department of Social Protection commenced its pilot remote interpreting service in its Navan Road office on 25 July 2013. The Irish Remote Interpreting Service was officially launched by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, this week at the Deaf Village Ireland, Ratoath Road, Dublin.  The manager of the service demonstrated the remote interpreting service at the launch and a Department of Social Protection staff member interviewed a deaf customer at the Navan Road office while linked to the remote interpreting service at the Deaf Village so that the Minister could observe the operation of the service while in the room with the interpreter in the Deaf Village.  The remote interpreting service is currently being used on a trial basis in the Citizens' Information offices based in Dublin north west, O'Connell Street, Tullamore and Dundalk, and in the Deaf Village in Cabra.  During the pilot phase, it has been provided as a free service to all departmental users.  Service providers such as Departments and their statutory agencies, Citizens' Information offices, employability offices, county councils and schools can avail of the service.  It is a collaborative project between the sign language interpreting service, DeafHear and the Irish Deaf Society.  The sign language interpreting service is funded by the Citizens' Information Board under the auspices of the Department of Social Protection.  Funding of &euro;245,000 has been allocated for 2013.<\/p><p>The sign language interpretation service seeks to ensure that high-quality interpretation services are available to deaf people in Ireland so that they can access public and social services.  The service provides a live link to an Irish Sign Language interpreter using a variety of programmes such as Skype, ooVoo or WebEx.  The sign language interpreter is based in the centre in the Deaf Village and interprets using a computer with Internet access and a webcam.  While it will not replace face-to-face interpreting, this service is particularly suitable for short meetings, phone calls, information inquiries, form filling and interviews.  There are 130 social welfare offices and Intreo centres throughout the country where customers can obtain information and guidance on their entitlements and on the services provided by the Department.  In larger offices, there are staff dedicated to information provision duties who are available to explain all the Department's supports and services and to help and assist people in completing application forms and accessing their entitlements.<\/p><p>In order to facilitate deaf customers in their interactions with the Department, the services of a sign language interpreter are made available when required.  On average, ten requests per year for sign language interpreters have been facilitated by the Department over the past number of years.  These services are provided by the sign language interpreting service and the Centre for Sign Language Studies.  Certain offices provide a loop system for hearing aid users.  Information in alternative formats, such as Braille, audio and larger print, is also available upon request.<\/p><p>In regard to employment supports for people with disabilities, the Department of Social Protection continues to offer the job interview interpreter grant through employment services.  This is used in circumstances in which a jobseeker is deaf, hard of hearing or has a speech impairment and is attending job interviews.  They can apply for funding through Department of Social Protection employment services to have a sign language interpreter attend the interview with them.  Funding is also available to cover the cost of a sign language interpreter during an induction programme when they start work.<\/p><p>The Irish Deaf Society has assisted the Department's staff development unit in raising deaf awareness in the Department over the past few years and providing information to staff in regard to its Irish Sign Language classes.  The HSE recognises the obligations on health and social care providers to ensure that the services provided are accessible and has a specific guidance document for language interpreters, entitled On Speaking Terms.  Patients and service users are entitled to request and be provided with a qualified sign language interpreter.  The cost is borne by the service as it is considered an integral part of the service being provided and it legally protects both the health service provider and the patient or service user.  It is understood that failure to make appropriate provision for communication difficulty may result in avoidable serious risks and errors for both patient and health care provider.  I agree with the point made by Senator Daly in this regard.  It is essential that we are clearly understood when it comes to our health.  Providing a qualified sign language interpreter when delivering care to a patient or service helps avoid a situation in which information may be misinterpreted or misunderstood, which may lead to a potential adverse outcome for the patient or service user.<\/p><p>In regard to practical supports for staff, patients and service users, the HSE, under the auspices of the universal access steering committee, is developing two documents.  The first is national guidelines on accessible health and social care services, and the second, which is more specific, is the HSE policy and guidelines on access to health services for the deaf community and people who are hard of hearing.  Both of these documents are being prepared in consultation with key stakeholders.  The development of these documents is in progress and it is intended that they will provide a valuable resource for staff and be available for staff by the end of 2013.<\/p><p>The National Advocacy Unit is working with the sign language interpreting service to identify areas within the HSE where the Irish remote sign language interpreting service could be used to improve patient and service user experience. The National Advocacy Unit has been working with MEDISIGNS, Interesource Group (Ireland) Limited, to develop a sign language version of the Your Service Your Say leaflet, which will make the feedback process more accessible for service users who use Irish Sign Language as their primary means of communication.  The Revenue Commissioners also recognises the importance of making information available to users of Irish Sign Language and, to coincide with the introduction of local property tax earlier this year, it commissioned a video through the medium of Irish Sign Language, with subtitles.  This video was produced by the Irish Deaf Society and included information on how to complete and submit local property tax returns, details of who is liable, information on exemptions and deferrals and guidance to assist in valuing a property.  The use of similar videos will be considered in the future should the need arise.<\/p><p>On a broader level, ongoing development of the Revenue Commissioners' website and other online services assists persons with hearing difficulties in accessing information and in performing certain transactions online, such as using PAYE Anytime.  We hope to build on and develop awareness of these types of measure and what we learn from them so that we can spread this good practice across all public bodies.  Using the governance mechanisms already in place, such as the senior officials' group on disability, we can share learning and promote good practice.<\/p><p>Once again, I would like to thank the Senators who proposed this motion.  I fully understand the importance of this issue to the deaf community and the need to raise awareness, particularly in the public sector, of the importance of accessible services in providing equal opportunities for all.  I commend the work of the many State and non-governmental organisations to support and promote the use of Irish Sign Language in the State to date and it is the continuation of these efforts that will, hopefully, see greater results for the deaf community.  It is only through this continued support and partnership between the Government and the deaf community that we can achieve our common goals of improved access to services and greater recognition of Irish Sign Language as the first language of many Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900015#O00300","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381319100,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive statement, which took 23 minutes and 59 seconds to deliver.

I welcome the representatives from DeafHear and the Irish Deaf Society to the House this evening.  There is nothing to disagree with in the motion as it is non-contentious.<\/p> <p>It is a little fluffy in the sense that it says we should help people who are hard of hearing and do more for people who are deaf.  We need to do a lot more tangible things.  The Minister of State has outlined much of the stuff that has been done and all of the positive measures.  However, I cannot help thinking that if it was an ethnic group from another country numbering 5,000, the boat would be pushed out further and quicker for those with hearing problems.  Of course, we all support the motion.<\/p><p>Senator Mark Daly has worked hard on the Bill and mentioned some aspects of it.  We could call it a Government Bill or should do whatever is necessary to get it over the line.  While I appreciate there will be a meeting on 4 November that might advance that cause, we should legislate for the full acknowledgment of Irish Sign Language.  The State should not offer any service that does not cater for that option.  As someone whose mother was substantially deaf in the later stages of her life, I have first-hand experience of the level of isolation she felt as a result of her disability.  Even though hearing aids provided for some improvement, it was too late in her life to begin to use Irish Sign Language which she found immensely frustrating.  Most of us who can hear were often oblivious to the exclusion she felt.<\/p><p>Whatever costs need to be met, they need to be pushed further up the priority chain.  The Minister of State has a difficult job to do with the loaves and fishes in trying to cater for various services, including mental health services and so on.  However, we are trying to cater for a very small number of people and ought to be able to do more to ensure the feeling of isolation is kept at bay by providing information in the language through which deaf people choose to communicate.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has made a very comprehensive speech on all that is good.  It is the tendency of Ministers in all Governments to come here and tell us how far we have come.  When the meeting takes place on 4 November, involving Senators Mark Daly, Martin Conway and other Senators, it is vitally important that we listen to the people who know best - those sitting behind.  Rather than telling them how we are doing a good job on their behalf, let them outline for us the specifics in order to provide for them the level of equality to which they are entitled as citizens and for which they naturally yearn.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment to the task at hand on any of these issues and ask her to fight the civil servants on this one.  Unlike the George Orwell version of equality where some re more equal than others, this time we should ask the people sitting behind me to outline for us the list of things that are most important in improving the acceptability of and access to Irish Sign Language across the country.  Let us then get on and do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900017#Q00500","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381319700,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte ar ais ar an Aire St&aacute;it.  It is good to see her back.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the members of the deaf community and their advocates to the Visitors Gallery.  It is great to see them here.  As I normally speak as Gaeilge, I will have to temper my use of language.  I am a native Irish speaker and although I cannot relate to the fact that somebody cannot hear or has a hearing impairment, I can relate to the difficulties of culture and language in trying to express oneself in the language in which one is most comfortable.  Irish is my native tongue and I always feel more comfortable in speaking it; therefore, I can relate to the frustration of our visitors when they are not given the right to lead their lives fully in the language in which they are most comfortable.<\/p><p>  I commend Senators Martin Conway and C&aacute;it Keane for bringing forward this important motion.  We have had much debate in the past few months on the sovereignty of the Constitution, but this debate should go to the heart of the question of the rights of citizens.  I see this as a rights-based issue, whereby all citizens should be treated equally.  Therefore, recognising Irish Sign Language concerns the rights of individual citizens.  That is where Sinn F&eacute;in is coming from on the issue.  It supports and recognises Irish Sign Language as the preferred sign language of the deaf community in the State.  Tthe State has to live up to its obligations in that respect.  We also agree that it is an expression of a unique, rich and valuable culture.  That Irish Sign Language came from the Irish deaf community is unique.<\/p><p>  In a previous existence I was a television producer and in its early days worked in TnaG which later became TG4.  Coincidentally, one of the groups which tuned in regularly to &quot;Ros na R&uacute;n&quot;, the soap for which I was a producer, was the deaf community.  We never expected this and it was a great surprise.  During the years we built up a good following among the deaf community through the use of subtitles.  That was a great help and it brought home to me the importance of recognising a minority group in the State of which I had honestly not taken due cognisance previously.  It is important to recognise that value in our culture.<\/p><p>  Irish Sign Language has an interesting history in that it arose from the deaf community and was developed by deaf people.  It is a language that has struggled against official suppression, with the result that it did not receive State recognition until 1972.  Being an Irish language speaker, recognition as an official language does not necessarily mean the resources required are provided in order that users can practice it on a daily basis.  We have much legislation, policies and strategies for the Irish language, but when it comes to living one's life through the medium of that language, it is very difficult.  I note the positive points mentioned by the Minister of State in a comprehensive contribution, but I hazard a guess that if somebody was deaf, although these things are written on paper, the reality in terms of having them available when needed is different.  It is also a question of resources being made available in order that the members of the deaf community can use Irish Sign Language when they need to do so.<\/p><p>  It is long past time for the State, in conjunction with the deaf community, to develop ideas to improve access to public services for users of Irish Sign Language.  I welcome the movements being made.  The CEO of the IDS, Mr. Peter Regan, stated:<blockquote>It is a matter of principle that this motion is passed.  The Irish Government signed the UN Human Rights Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007, which contains duties towards native sign languages.  In addition, an EU Parliamentary resolution from 1988 presented by Irish MEP Eileen Lemass has since been ignored by consecutive Irish Governments, and the more recent Brussels Declaration on Sign Language in the European Union of 2010 urges member states to actively support the use of sign languages.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>Although we have taken on board the ethos of the convention, the fact that we have not ratified it since 2007 is simply not good enough for the deaf community in Ireland.  I refer not only to this Government, as previous Administrations also did not have it as a high enough priority.<\/p><p>We welcome the Government's targeting of initiatives which would enhance the effective availability of interpreters and interpretation solutions, such as the use of technology for remote access to services.  However, I go back to the primary point, that to recognise the language as an official language infers the right to use that language.  That is crux of the issue here, that the deaf community in Ireland should be given that right.<\/p><p>The deaf community are citizens of the State and as such, they should be treated with equality and respect.  That is what accepting it as an official language would do.  They should not be discriminated against, even unwittingly, by the State.  However, the failure to officially support the deaf community, and their unique and valuable language and way of life, seriously impacts on their ability to participate fully in Irish life.<\/p><p>We should be taking an all-island approach to these issues.  I recognise that strides have been taken in the North to recognise the language and we need to catch up here.  If it can be done there, there is no reason it cannot be done here.<\/p><p>It is not acceptable from the national broadcaster that it is at this late stage offering three hours per week of signed programming.  I note that the BBC has had signing on its programmes, especially for children, for years.  I have often seen it when I am sitting with my children.  Although it is a small step, I would contend that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, needs to push them much harder on these issues.<\/p><p>As the issue of the bilateral cochlear implants has been raised, I hope that the budget next week will make provision for that.  It is something on which we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been campaigning for a long time.  We included it in our pre-budget submission and I hope that the Minister for Finance will do so.<\/p><p>I welcome the initiatives.  I welcome what the Minister of State has said.  However, as the CEO has said, so far the Government has only paid lip-service to the EU and UN.  This is a moment of action and an opportunity for the Government to demonstrate its sincerity on a long-standing issue.  The time for action is now.  Since 2007, the deaf community have been waiting.  It is time to ratify and recognise the language.  I am sure that the motion will get the full support in the Houses.  I thank the deaf community for coming in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900018#R00200","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381320300,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming here this evening and giving a comprehensive statement on this matter.  I thank Senators Conway and Keane for bringing forward this motion.  It is welcome.<\/p><p>Everything that I wanted to say has already been said and I just want to touch on two points.  First, I thank the Minister of State for taking the initiative she is now taking in this matter.  It is not a case of merely sitting around.  I note she is decisive on this issue and that she will be taking action on it, and I welcome that.<\/p><p>My recollection is of a good school in Douglas in Cork which deals with young children who are deaf.  The year I was lord mayor it was interesting to visit that school.  It is one of my fondest memories.  In Cork city, the lord mayor visits 102 schools over a six-week time period.  The amazing aspect about visiting that school, which has a large number of children who are deaf but also has children who are not deaf, was to see the communication going on.  Obviously, they were making comments and these may not have been complimentary of the lord mayor.  They were having their own conversation and it was brilliant to see the interaction between them there that morning.  It is something that always sticks in my mind from that six weeks of school visits.  By the way, my apologies.  I welcome all of the representatives from the deaf community and all of the organisations who are here this evening.<\/p><p>An issue I came across two or three years ago relates to the elderly who are deaf.  I came across 45 such persons in individual nursing homes across the country where there was no communication available to them within the service and there was no co-ordination about having, for example, a number of them living in the same accommodation.  It was not taken into account.  I found it quite sad that there was nothing being offered to them and it was like being put in solitary confinement in their nursing home.  Every one of them was physically and mentally well, but they just had no one available with whom to communicate.  I thought it was sad that we had done very little on that issue.  I would ask that the issue be looked at within each HSE area.  We have broken it up into a number of different areas.  It is something that the HSE should take on board, that where persons who are deaf require nursing home care, we should not automatically put them where they are on their own and we should try to work towards having them together so that they can communicate with one another.  It would be helpful.  It has been ignored for quite a long time but it is something that we should look at.  That is my only point because every other point I wanted to make here has already been made by the previous speakers.  I only ask that that would be looked at.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators for bringing forward this and everyone who has contributed to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900019#S00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1381320300,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister of State.  I am happy to see she is back in full bloom.  Along with my colleagues, I welcome all of the representatives of the deaf community here in Ireland.<\/p><p>I am particularly aware of the disability that deafness brings in one area because I have spent much of my working life as a broadcaster.  I can remember when I started first that I became aware of the blind community, who relied to a considerable extent on radio.  It was following on that awareness that I became more acutely aware of the significant disadvantage that both the hard of hearing and the deaf had in that what we take for granted - the music of all genres that we enjoy when we switch on the radio - is completely denied to all of these people and to their contemporaries.  Of course, one could say that as television developed, those who were blind have suffered from being denied the access whereas those who are deaf have got, as a result of modern technology, at least some access to broadcasting.  In that context, I welcome the Minister of State's reference in her comprehensive presentation, for which I compliment her, as I know she has already been complimented by the Chair and others, that the &quot;Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is committed to continuing to pursue, with RTE, delivery of television programmes with Irish Sign Language in line with this legislation and the commitment given in the national disability strategy implementation plan and in this regard mainstream programming with Irish Sign Language interpretation is due to commence on 16 October covering three hours per week approximately&quot;.  That is a welcome initiative.  It is a small step.  I am aware, from discussions with my colleague, Senator Daly, that while this initiative is to be welcomed, in line with other public institutions, it does not legally oblige RTE to provide this service.  They are doing it because, obviously, the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and her Department have put the pressure on them to do this, if that were necessary.  In fairness, to RTE, I am sure that it acquiesced easily anyway and responded favourably.<\/p> <p>However, it points to the weakness in the argument put forward by the Government.  The lack of legislation does not make it legally obligatory for a public institution to provide the type of service that it might now be providing on a piecemeal basis or, to the best of its ability, on a more comprehensive basis.  That is why I believe the passage of legislation would help the deaf community considerably.  It has been campaigning for that for well over 30 years.<\/p><p>My main reason for standing to speak today was to express solidarity with the deaf community, not to offer some great pearls of wisdom to the debate.  We are with the community in every way possible and we hope the Government will see fit to look favourably on Senator Daly's Bill when he introduces it.  I read it today and it is very comprehensive.  It has almost 30 sections and covers all the aspects of the debate and the argument put forward by the Irish Sign Language recognition group and the deaf community over several decades.  It also takes account of international best practice.<\/p><p>Finally, I compliment the 16 local authorities which have passed motions calling for ISL recognition in the last 12 months and I call on the remaining local authorities to do this.  Perhaps the town councils, as one of their final acts in the months to come, will take up this cause.  As a politician, the Minister knows there is nothing more effective than continuing and persistent lobbying.  If one keeps banging the wall long enough and loud enough, the Government listens.  I wish the community well in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900019#S00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381320900,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of the deaf community and their advocates to the Visitors' Gallery.  I also welcome the Minister of State.  It is good to see her again.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Government is accepting this good and worthy proposal.  I must admit my knowledge of this subject is rather incomplete, but in the course of researching for the debate I was amazed by some of the information I uncovered.  There are 40,000 users of Irish Sign Language.  That is probably equivalent to the population of Dundalk, the home town of my colleague, Senator Moran.  Imagine not recognising Dundalk.  That puts it into context.<\/p><p>I also did not know that Irish Sign Language was unique.  That uniqueness is recognised in the Good Friday Agreement and in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  That is a significant step in moving the argument - slowly, of course - in the right direction.  Apart from the vital aspect of Irish Sign Language being a communication tool, it is important to note its linguistic and cultural value.  Culture and language are the essence of what we are as a people.  That is very important.  We should all strive to ensure that people are allowed and helped in every way possible to express themselves in their own language.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that Senators Conway, Keane, Daly and Moran have brought this motion before the House.  However, not only have the four Senators done that, they have also been very active on this issue in the two and a half years of this Seanad's term.  The Seanad has a role in this regard and there is an obligation on it to do anything it can, both here and outside, to achieve progress in this area.  It is vital that it does so.<\/p><p>Senator Daly outlined some of the difficulties faced by the deaf community without official recognition of Irish Sign Language.  He is right to point out that our legislative and international obligations in this area are not what they should be.  However, the Minister is quite correct.  It has been said that we might be only paying lip service to this but if we were to ratify the convention without having the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill and other structures in place, we could then be legitimately accused of paying lip service to it.  It is not a matter of speedy introduction but, more importantly, proper introduction.  It is a matter of equality, decency and legality.  I assure the deaf community and anybody who cares to listen to the Seanad debate - and sometimes not many do - that I, as Labour Party spokesperson on health, and the Labour Party are fully committed to promoting the full recognition of Irish Sign Language.  It is in the programme for Government, which is also important.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister on her response.  I do not think I have seen such a comprehensive response delivered in this Chamber by anybody.  I welcome the fact that she will take a personal interest in this.  The Minister is my constituency and party colleague and I know that when she says she will take an interest in something she certainly does so.  The technological advances in this area are very exciting and there are exciting possibilities of further advances.  Not surprisingly, the video was produced by the Revenue Commissioners to help people pay their tax.  Perhaps we should ask them not to be so innovative in this area.<\/p><p>Everything I wanted to say has already been said, so it is unhelpful to repeat it.  I reassure everybody that the Labour Party and I, as spokesperson, are fully committed to this.  I commend the proposers of the motion and wish them well in their endeavours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900020#T00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1381320900,"counter":123,"content":"<p>This has been a very interesting debate.  I thank the contributors from all sides of the House.  Each group except one was represented.  I also commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her extremely comprehensive synopsis of what the Government is doing in every area, from the Revenue Commissioners and education to social welfare and the various pilot initiatives.  They are all extremely welcome, but we are still a long way from utopia and from where we need to be in terms of equality of access to information for members of the deaf community.<\/p><p>I agree with the Minister that there is no point in having legislation that creates requirements that are of little, if any, benefit to members of the deaf community.  We must have legislation that is targeted to ensure there is access to information that is used, in the first instance, and that will create and enrich the equality to which we all subscribe.  I believe legislation can be tailored to ensure resources are not wasted, as they have been with some Irish publications.  In the case of a county development plan, for example, the county council is legally required to translate it into Irish even if nobody buys it.  We all believe in the equality of the Irish language, but that type of situation is bizarre.  I believe members of the deaf community would not wish to see that happen but would wish to see resources channelled in the correct way.<\/p><p>The Minister had some positive news with regard to the theme of the meeting that is due to take place on 4 November.  In addition, there will be the discourse surrounding Senator Daly's Bill when it is published.  Furthermore, there is the module of the justice committee that will hopefully hold hearings after Christmas.  It will seek submissions, and that will be followed, we hope, by hearings by the committee at which this issue can be discussed.  Recommendations can then be sent to the Government.<\/p><p>Everybody agrees with the principle of equality in access to information, and I believe everybody agrees with recognition.  However, how to go about securing that recognition is probably where the difficulties lie.  For that reason we need communication and discussions, and we need to examine best practice.<\/p> <p>If necessary, we need to establish best practice.  We can do things better in this country.  We led the way with the smoking ban.  When he was Minister for Health, the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, showed enormous courage by taking on the tobacco industry and introducing a smoking ban.  This is a simple example of how we set best practice which is now replicated almost throughout the world, certainly in the developed world.  We can lead the way with Irish Sign Language, ensuring that resources are properly spent and facilitate the kind of equality all of us, certainly the members of the deaf community, desire.  <\/p><p>The initiatives outlined in detail by the Minister of State are very welcome.  They will enrich people's lives but we need more of them.  I am committed to the recognition of Irish Sign Language and I believe some sort of legislative form must be brought to this.  That is what people in the deaf community expect and I completely understand their viewpoint.  However, it must be done right, in a way that achieves what we want it to achieve.  Like other speakers, I have seen many laws enacted in this country that are ineffective.  There is no point in having a law that is ineffective; we need effective laws that will ensure young people in the deaf community have access to employment and education, culture and all other activities to which people have a legitimate expectation of access.  <\/p><p>There is a job of work to be done.  We have taken an extremely important step forward.  It looks as if this motion will be agreed unanimously which sends a clear message to the Government that this issue, at least from the perspective of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, is taken very seriously.  It also sends the clear message to our colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that Seanad &Eacute;ireann is championing the recognition of Irish Sign Language and puts it up to that House to pass a similar motion.  I encourage people in the Visitors' Gallery to start lobbying their TDs and get one of them to sponsor a motion similar to this in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  If the move comes from both Houses of the Oireachtas it will definitely send the clear message to the Government that we want further action.  <\/p><p>We are lucky that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is the person responsible in the Department because she is someone who gets things done.  During my time in the House she has attended the Chamber probably more than any other Minister of State.  When she speaks she does so honestly and when she acts she gets results.  Members of the deaf community can rest assured they have a very good champion in this Minister of State.<\/p><p>I commend Dr. John Bosco Conoma who approached me about this issue in the first instance.  I have had numerous discussions with him and have learned a lot about Irish Sign Language.  I am glad Members of the House learned a great deal when they researched for tonight's motion and I hope this debate will have informed them further.  We hope there are brighter days ahead in terms of the recognition of Irish Sign Language.  I thank everybody who contributed.

The issue I raise is the ambulance service in County Kerry, in particular in south Kerry where, as of last Tuesday, the service has been changed significantly in a way I believe will have detrimental consequences for patient safety.  The issue is simple.  Killarney town, which services a huge catchment area, has a population of 20,000.  In summer the many visitors swell that population to 40,000 and, at weekends, to 80,000.  One of the town's two emergency ambulances has been withdrawn and Killarney and its surrounding areas have emergency cover that is far from satisfactory.  After a significant campaign in the Kenmare area we managed to retain that town's ambulance.  The ambulance in Caherciveen was also retained.  I refer to emergency ambulances.

It services the entire south Kerry area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900021#U01100","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1381322100,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  A significant reform programme has been under way in pre-hospital emergency services in recent years.  The objective is to ensure that the best clinical care is provided for the people in each region served by the national ambulance service, NAS, through the provision of a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology.<\/p><p>As part of this process, the NAS has implemented a new model of pre-hospital care services for the people of south Kerry.  This new model is for a region-wide service to replace the former local delivery structure, allowing for dynamic deployment and optimal use of emergency resources.  It arose out of an analysis of the needs of the south Kerry area and the best use of emergency resources, including paramedics and advanced paramedics.  The modernisation of service delivery in south Kerry followed a consultation process with interested groups in the region, including GPs, local public representatives and community groups.  The plan was also informed by the modernisation that has already taken place in Cork.<\/p><p>The new structure, agreed between Health Service Executive management, union representatives and staff, provides numerous benefits for patients. The replacement of on-call with on-duty rostering brings service delivery in south Kerry in line with the majority of the region.  On-duty rostering means that, during a shift, paramedic staff are at their bases or in their vehicles, ready to be dispatched immediately to answer 112 and 999 calls rather than waiting at home to be notified, with the delays that involves.  Regional deployment of emergency vehicles and emergency personnel offers a wider availability of ambulance resources, to best serve the people of south Kerry.  An intermediate care service for routine transfers of patients between acute and community hospitals, in line with best clinical practice, will free emergency vehicles in south Kerry for emergency work.  Killarney, Caherciveen and Kenmare ambulance stations will be retained as the locations for deployment in the south Kerry area.<\/p><p>In a modern emergency service, treatment begins when emergency staff arrive at the scene of an incident.  Patients are assessed, treated and stabilised, before being transported to the most appropriate facility.  The NAS has highly trained health professionals in south Kerry, at paramedic and advanced paramedic level, who can perform life-saving interventions and other skilled treatment at the scene, before moving the patient safely to an acute facility for further treatment.  While some concerns have been raised regarding levels of cover at certain ambulance stations, I am assured by the NAS that the plan will greatly improve response times, as emergency ambulances will be available straight away and, where necessary, ambulances from adjacent stations will provide dynamic cover by moving to areas where cover is required.<\/p><p>The new arrangements I have outlined provide an extra 126 resource hours each week between Killarney, Kenmare and Caherciveen stations.  The move to on-duty services means the entire south Kerry area will have a 24 hours a day, seven days a week emergency ambulance service.  This will ensure the people of the region have timely access to highly-skilled paramedic and advanced paramedic staff, day or night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900022#V00100","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1381322100,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

I have had a great deal of correspondence from citizens throughout the eastern region regarding the pyrite remediation scheme that was announced earlier this year.  Like everybody, I welcomed that undertaking by the Government to take action to address this issue.  However, I was somewhat surprised during the summer when I discovered that legislation was required to implement the pyrite levy and the remediation works for home owners.  I am concerned that this legislation has not yet been published.<\/p><p>There were mixed messages from Government yesterday.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, announced that the legislation would be published next week.  However, the Taoiseach, in reply to my party leader in the D&aacute;il, did not give the same commitment and offered little comfort to the many home owners concerned about the issue.  People whose houses are affected by pyrite are at their wits' end and the problem is getting worse on a daily basis.  There is an obligation on the Government to act with urgency.  I acknowledge the progress that has been done to date, including by our late colleague, Shane McEntee, who, as Minister of State, did great work.  However, I am very concerned by the prospect of further delays.<\/p><p>Several housing estates affected by pyrite have been fixed in the recent past, as has been well documented in the media.  That effort has created considerable expertise in this area; we have people in this country who know how to do these jobs very quickly.  I urge the Government to avail of that expertise to ensure the work is completed as speedily as possible.  At the same time, I urge people whose homes are affected by pyrite to contact their local representatives or the Pyrite Resolution Board.  There is an element of heads being buried in the sand, which is understandable.  People are worried sick if there is any hint of pyrite in their home, but they must be encouraged to register with the Pyrite Resolution Board so that the problem can be addressed.  I hope the Minister of State will have some positive developments to report on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900022#V00600","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1381322100,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan.  Following Government decisions of 18 December 2012 and 30 April 2013, work commenced in my Department on developing the legislation required to provide for the funding of a pyrite remediation scheme and the necessary structures to deliver an effective and efficient remediation process.<\/p><p>Developing the structures necessary to deliver a remediation scheme has proved challenging, and several legal difficulties arose over the summer months which required detailed and thorough consideration.  Inevitably, these difficulties have led to a delay in the drafting of the legislation, with a consequent delay in the Pyrite Resolution Board accepting applications from eligible home owners.  While it was the Minister's intention to have the legislation published and enacted by now, this has not been possible.  We are committed to ensuring these issues are resolved as a matter of urgency and, in that context, he will be bringing proposals to Government shortly.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the Pyrite Resolution Board has been getting on with its work, including developing an online application and processing system.  While there has been some slippage in the timeline as originally envisaged, the board is committed to having the system operable as quickly as possible.  However, it would not be appropriate for the board to accept applications in advance of the necessary structures and legislation being in place.<\/p><p>In addition to the work being undertaken on the online application system, the board is also working on developing appropriate structures and systems for the delivery of remediation programmes.<\/p> <p>It is highly important that proper systems, with appropriate checks and balances, are developed and put in place to ensure that effective and efficient programmes of remediation are delivered to affected homeowners.  Cognisant of the need to give affected homeowners as much detail and guidance as possible on the proposed pyrite remediation scheme, the pyrite resolution board, shortly after its establishment, established a website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie<\/i>, to which Senator Byrne referred.  The website provides valuable information for affected homeowners, setting out a summary of the proposed scheme, the qualification criteria and the various steps that will be involved in the remediation process.<\/p><p> The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is acutely aware of the long wait that many affected homeowners have had to endure in waiting for solutions to the pyrite problems in their homes.  The time since the pyrite problem first arose has not been easy for affected homeowners and the Minister understands how stressful such situations can be.  Against this background, the Minister is determined to provide workable solutions and wishes to assure those homeowners that he will continue to attach the utmost priority to providing the structures necessary to deliver a practical resolution to the pyrite problem as early as possible.

I tabled this motion last week and, unfortunately, since then we had bad news in Waterford city of 74 job losses at Honeywell.  I am sure the Minister of State joins me in offering support to the families of the people who lost their jobs.  It is always a difficult time.  A sour taste was left in the mouths of the workers due to the way in which people found out.  Some found out in the media, others by text message.  It is an appalling way to treat workers.  Unfortunately, 74 jobs were lost at the plant, which is a blow for Waterford city and the south east.<\/p><p>It is important to have a regional focus and a clear focus on the south east from enterprise agencies.  A number of weeks ago, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation published an economic development strategy for the south east, setting out more than 100 proposals for the Government and agencies to give the south-east region a lift.  Primarily, it had ten key objectives and proposals, a number of which centred on the enterprise agencies and IDA Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to recognise the high level of unemployment in the south east and the need for a regional plan that joins up the work of all stakeholders, such as the enterprise agencies, education providers and local authorities.<\/p><p>With regard to enterprise agencies and the IDA, it is a problem that we do not have a regional IDA office, director or support staff.  This means we do not have a regional IDA focus.  We have seen that in recent times with regard to site visits.  The number of site visits has improved this year, but previous years saw decreases.  Without a regional focus, we will not be able to deal with the challenges the region has.  The IDA will not be able to meet the challenges without a clear focus.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to these points.<\/p><p>The regional aid guidelines are up for negotiation at European level.  In 2014 there will be a new regional aid map, and the percentage of grant aid that can be made available to foreign direct investment companies will be reviewed.  It is important that the south east is at least on a par with the BMW region.  This is an issue to do with harmonisation.  We must move upwards so that the south east has the same attractive rates as the BMW region rather than a decreased rate.  It is important that the south east operates on a level playing field.  We need a regional focus and a regional plan from the enterprise agencies so that we are on a level playing field in terms of grant aid and infrastructure.<\/p><p>Progress on the technological university for the south east is also important.  It is a priority for the Government, but two and half years into its term of office there is no indication when it will be delivered.  I ask the Minister to outline the Government's initiative for the south east, the IDA's plans and focus and those of Enterprise Ireland.  There is a clear view in the south east that not enough is being done.  Much more needs to be done to give the south east the lift its needs to create jobs for people in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900023#W00700","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1381322700,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Cullinane for raising this important issue.  There has been a long-standing unemployment problem in Waterford and in the region.  The structural challenges that the region faces have built up over many years and could not be reversed with a simple set of actions.  When TalkTalk announced job losses in Waterford in 2011, the Minister decided to take a very focused approach to tackling the causes of unemployment in the region, which appeared to be unique to the south east.  The specific recommendations contained in the South East Employment Action Plan, produced by Forf&aacute;s, are being progressed by a forum representing the agencies and key stakeholders in the region.  There has been good progress since the plan was published, including several significant jobs announcements - notably, several hundred jobs were created at the Eishtec call centre in Waterford city and 65 Enterprise-Ireland-supported jobs and new jobs were created by Dawn Meats.  There has been a tripling of the number of site visits by IDA Ireland.<\/p><p>This welcome trend has continued.  On 28 March, the Minister participated in an announcement by Nypro Healthcare of an additional state-of-the-art medical device manufacturing facility in Waterford.  This newly established facility will result in the creation of over 200 new high-quality jobs in phase 1, which is expected to increase in subsequent years.  In addition, a major investment by Glanbia in Belview on the Kilkenny-Waterford border will provide 1,600 direct and indirect jobs, as well as an additional 450 jobs during the construction phase.  It will contribute an estimated &euro;400 million every year to the economy, with particular benefit to farm families and rural communities.  Last May, the Irish software company FeedHenry announced that it would create up to 100 jobs over the next two years as part of a &euro;7 million investment by the Enterprise-Ireland-supported firm.  The jobs will be located in its Waterford and Dublin offices, bringing the number employed by the company to 140.  To date in 2013 there have been 13 IDA site visits to Waterford, one visit to Wexford, two visits to Kilkenny and one visit to Carlow.  Senator Cullinane will appreciate that while the IDA makes strenuous efforts to attract multinational companies to specific regions, whether companies choose to visit and, if so, whether they subsequently choose to locate in the region concerned, is entirely a matter for the companies themselves.<\/p> <p>While every effort is being made to attract foreign investments to the south east, final decisions are made by the corporate entities.  I regret this week's announcement of 74 job losses in Honeywell in Waterford city, but the company has stated it hopes many of these losses will be voluntary.  It is gratifying that it will still retain a significant workforce.<\/p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of having a stronger IDA Ireland presence in the region.  During 2010, in order to maximise resources, a business transformation process was carried out which examined every position in the organisation.  The outcome provided opportunities to free up staff resources for core business generation activities and to ensure IDA Ireland met its job targets.  It should be appreciated that the Department and its agencies operate under a very stringent regime in regard to staffing levels, with significant cuts imposed in many bodies within the Department's remit.  However, I am pleased to say the agency has been largely protected from cuts under the employment control framework for the past three years.<\/p><p>I also acknowledge the recent report, South East Economic Development Strategy 2013-2023, which the Senator prepared for the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The report represents a comprehensive and detailed assessment of a wide range of factors that can contribute to the overall economic development of the south-east region.  My Department is considering the contents of the report and assessing the merits and practicality of its recommendations.  Many of the suggested actions relate to matters which come within the remit of other Departments or bodies and some of the recommendations could have significant financial implications which would be a challenge in the current financial climate.  The report contains a number of very worthwhile and relevant recommendations for developing the south-east region which would serve to add to the ongoing work of the south-east forum.  I will ask the forum for its considered views on the report.  In due course I will be happy to discuss its findings with the committee in the context of our ongoing constructive dialogue.<\/p><p>I am aware that Waterford city and county councils have recently produced a report on the south east which also contains several positive proposals for enterprise development in the region.  It is heartening that a significant effort is being put into seeking solutions to the economic problems of the south east and I look forward to improvements in the months and years ahead.  <\/p><p>The Minister extends his apologies to the House as he was unavoidably detained at a meeting.  He is dealing comprehensively and in a focused way with the south-east region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900023#W00800","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381323300,"counter":154,"content":"<p>This detailed report was published by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation following a year-long series of consultations with enterprise agencies, education and training providers, local authorities and community and voluntary groups.  Its recommendations are practical, credible, realistic and can be delivered on.  I refer also to the report published by Waterford city and county councils which was cited by the Minister of State.  Many of its recommendations are very similar.  The problem is that these are reports and they need to be implemented.  It is great to have all them, but the people of the south east want to see real action.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to IDA Ireland, the chief executive of which tells us all the time that the agency's job is to bring jobs to Ireland as a whole and that it cannot direct companies to lcoate in any particular region.  There must be a regional plan.  If companies are not coming to the south east, IDA Ireland has a responsibility to look at the reasons they are not coming and to address them.  We cannot just wash our hands of the issue and give the excuse that they will not come because they make the choice as to where they will locate.  That is not the case; very often companies gravitate to where the infrastructure is in place, where a university is located, a region that has strengths in certain areas such as the south east has in the areas of manufacturing, the life sciences and food production.  These strengths can attract foreign direct investment to the south east.  The problem is that there is there is no over-arching plan or strategy for the south east.  In my view, the region is not getting enough from the enterprise agencies.  It can be very frustrating to hear IDA Ireland state it cannot bring jobs directly to the region.  That might be true to an extent, but it needs to look at why the companies are not coming to the south east and then address these reasons in a comprehensive way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900024#X00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1381323300,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I reiterate that implementation of the south-east action plan is proceeding well.  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, also established the south-east forum which comprises all of the State stakeholders in the region.  The Senator cannot say there is no plan.  The aim of the forum is to oversee implementation of the action plan.  It is the first such mechanism for the representatives concerned to formally work together.  The Minister has also met the forum on several occasions.  I, therefore, ask the Senator to agree that there has been good progress since the plan was published in December 2011, including several significant jobs announcements.  Companies supported by IDA Ireland operating in the south-east region now employ over 12,000 people.  IDA Ireland has submitted a planning application to Waterford County Council for the development of new offices totalling 25,000 sq. ft.  This new development will be situated in the IDA Ireland business and technology park in Butlerstown, County Waterford.<\/p><p>There has also been progress on regional infrastructure priorities, including broadband services and the road infrastructure investments under way on the N11 Dublin-Wexford road. Enterprise Ireland has continued its other enterprise support measures, including launching a pilot competitive feasibility fund for new start-ups in the south east.  Over 40 applications were received, with 14 high-quality projects being approved for funding.  <\/p><p>The Government is completely committed to the south east.  Since 2007 Enterprise Ireland has approved a total of 707 innovation vouchers to companies in the south east, with 287 approved to Waterford-based companies as of March this year.

In addition, the Waterford County and Waterford City Enterprise Boards have continued to use the funding available from the European globalisation fund and my Department to provide supports for micro-enterprises within the county.  A range of projects have been supported by them.  I, therefore, ask the Senator to give credit where it is due.

The Minister of State is from the west and will know that County Galway, in particular, has been very badly hit by the recession, through the closure of various businesses and other facilities which were treasured and cherished by the local community.  Loughrea, in particular, has had to contend with job losses as a result of the downturn in the international economy because a multinational company took a hit.  Small businesses, pubs and restaurants have also suffered greatly from the spin-off effects of reduced spending in the town.  <\/p><p>The unemployment register shows that 2,262 people are unemployed in the town and something needs to be done now.  While many Government economic policies are aimed at enterprise and employment creation, they do not have enough of a rural focus.  Employment creation and enterprise in rural areas need to be given a higher place on the policy agenda in the Department.  The key stakeholders in Galway East need to be brought together with a view to creating jobs and promoting economic development in the area.  Any job that can be created in Galway East is to be welcomed in the light of the high levels of unemployment being experienced.  We must manage and address the unemployment crisis in the county.  Currently, the level of unemployment stands at more than 22,000.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this figure is unacceptable.  It is dangerous to have such a high level in small rural towns.  <\/p><p>The east of the county and Loughrea, in particular, need a coherent, long-term strategy which would align all of the relevant stakeholders and agencies in order to address the needs of the area and the region in general.  If the Department is minded to set up a task force, it must take into account the needs of the area, the people of which must take advantage of its key strengths which include tourism, the arts, culture, agribusiness, food production, technology, engineering and the green sector economy.  The crucial components are the enterprise agencies which must play a leading role and have the teeth to address the problem of large-scale unemployment in the county.  <\/p><p>We must join forces with national, local and regional bodies to ensure those with responsibility for delivering on economic development and job creation will deliver for east Galway.<\/p> <p>I will be pressing the Minister to set up a task force for the area and if one is created, targeted assistance should be allocated for small businesses in particular and job activation measures.  My own town of Athenry and Portumna have suffered greatly as a result of the recession.  In Athenry over 35 commercial retail units are vacant in the centre, and Portumna shares a similar story, which is most regrettable.  If a task force is set up in the east of the county, it would go some way towards highlighting the issues affecting the county, and it is only with such action that we can address the problem.<\/p><p>I look forward to any response in this regard and I hope it will be as favourable as that afforded to Senator Cullinane.  There is much focus on Waterford and the south east and I hope County Galway, and east Galway in particular, will not be overlooked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900024#X00800","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381323900,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins for raising this very important issue.  I apologise for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Bruton.<\/p><p>I share the Senator's concern about the loss of up to 30 jobs at ALS Minerals in Loughrea.  In 2011, ALS Limited acquired the Stewart Group, a UK-based mineral testing services company which owned OMAC Laboratories in Loughrea.  Following discussions with IDA Ireland, a grant package was approved in May 2012 to support the designation of OMAC as the hub laboratory for the Europe, Middle East and north Africa region, and for the creation of new jobs in Loughrea.  OMAC has recently moved from its 8,000 sq. ft. facility in the town into the IDA-owned former Cigna building, following extensive updating and modification.<\/p><p>Over the past 12 to 18 months, the global mining exploration industry has experienced a sharp downturn and although this is not unusual given the cyclical nature of the industry, the downturn has resulted in a significant decline in samples available for testing at the recently completed geochemical laboratory in Loughrea.  Against this backdrop, the local management has taken measures to reduce the cost base in an effort to preserve its core employment levels.  As a result, it has entered into a 30-day consultation period with the work force and anticipates that this will result in the lay-off of up to 30 staff in Loughrea.  Local ALS management has stressed to IDA Ireland that the company's strategy has not changed and that the Loughrea facility remains strongly positioned to take advantage of the next upturn in the global exploration industry, and that it remains committed to the region.  IDA Ireland is continuing to engage with the company at local and corporate levels.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the effects on the employees and their families of the job losses at ALS Minerals in Loughrea, I consider that it is neither practicable nor effective to establish jobs task forces or specific jobs plans around the country as a general mechanism to address such job losses, and to embark on such a course would involve diverting the various State agencies from their ongoing efforts to create jobs.  A considerable administrative commitment is involved in servicing any additional committees and groups which may be set up and, given the constrained staff resources facing all public sector bodies at present, I am strongly of the opinion that establishing such additional groups, except in very exceptional circumstances, would not be in the best interests of using the State's resources effectively.<\/p><p>At local level, there is already an employment focus being taken by the enterprise agencies which continue to provide assistance and advice to start-up companies and entrepreneurs with business ideas that have a strong export and job creation potential.  Examples include Galway County Enterprise Board, which to date this year approved funding for 17 new projects in the county to the value of &euro;506,302 that will create 48 full-time jobs and sustain 56 jobs.  Some 97 business people have already attended networking sessions run by Galway County Enterprise Board this year and in addition, the board will run a road show this month promoting local business start-ups in a number of towns, including Loughrea.<\/p><p>There are currently 59 IDA-supported companies in Galway city and county, employing 10,887 in permanent jobs and a further 2,009 in contract employment.  The numbers employed in IDA-supported companies in Galway have increased every year since 2007 and the numbers currently employed are the highest in a decade.  There has been development of IDA property solutions in the county, including business and technology parks in Galway city, Tuam, Ballinasloe and Loughrea.  Galway is designated as a gateway city under the national spatial strategy and Loughrea is included in the Government's regional broadband programme.  There is a clear focus on Galway city and its surrounding towns for investment and development.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland is working with the county development board, which comprises other State agencies in the enterprise sector such as Galway city and county enterprise board, &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission.  There have been presentations to the board on a number of occasions with regard to the activities of Enterprise Ireland in the region.  Enterprise Ireland is available to support anyone in Loughrea or Galway who wishes to establish a new business or, if they have a business idea, help take the idea to the next stage of development.<\/p><p>Employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Galway over the past two years has shown solid growth, and there has been a 16.8% employment growth over the past two years when full and part-time jobs are considered.  Many Enterprise Ireland client companies in Galway are continuing to recruit staff, particularly in the technology sector, and many have been growing their export markets in 2013.  Enterprise Ireland is continuing to strongly support existing client companies in County Galway with &euro;4 million in funding approved for Galway-based companies to date in 2013.  I am confident there will continue to be ongoing co-operation between the enterprise agencies in the city of Galway and surrounding towns, and focusing on synergies between the agencies will lead to targeted growth and investment in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900025#Y00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1381323900,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed response on the efforts being made by the Government and the Department in trying to improve job creation in County Galway, and I welcome the fact that ALS remains committed to the area.

I accept that the macro picture is very important and I fully support what the Government is doing but perhaps more engagement is necessary on the ground.  In particular, a number of good enterprise committees are operating, including the Loughrea enterprise committee, and they are seeking development opportunities around the area that will support further job creation measures.  Perhaps we could see a scenario where Enterprise Ireland and the IDA could liaise with these people and move to the next level by bringing jobs to the people of east Galway and specifically Loughrea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900025#Y00300","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1381323900,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I fully appreciate the Senator's significant commitment to Loughrea and I fully understand her view.  IDA Ireland is actively working with new and existing overseas companies in Galway to encourage them to grow and expand.  The following are some recent significant investments in the area, and it is important to put them on the record.<\/p><p>On 17 May 2012, Merit Medical Systems Inc., a leading manufacturer and marketer of proprietary medical devices used primarily in cardiology, radiology and endoscopy, announced the creation of 200 new jobs over five years at the official opening of its new &euro;20 million facility at the IDA business and technology park, Parkmore East, Galway.  On 3 May 2012, SAP, the leading global software company, announced an investment of &euro;110 million, creating 100 jobs at its Galway facility and 150 jobs at its Dublin facility.  On 30 April 2012, Cisco, the world's largest supplier of networking products, announced an investment of &euro;26 million at its Galway research and development facility over the next two years, with the creation of 115 jobs.  On 18 April 2012, Mylan, a leading pharmaceutical company, announced 500 new positions across Irish operations in Galway and the Gerard Laboratories in Dublin over four years.  On 11 April 2012, Medtronic announced the construction of a new customer innovation centre featuring state-of-the-art facilities, including a virtual lab and innovation suite, with over 70 jobs to be created during construction.  As can be seen from these examples, Galway has an important medical technology cluster of IDA-supported companies.<\/p> <p>There is also an expanding cluster of IDA supported ICT companies and there is a diverse range of FDI companies in international services and engineering.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland is continuing to strongly support the innovation ecosystem in Galway through investment of &euro;2.6 million in 38 development projects at NUI Galway and GMIT this year.  Some 29 small companies in Galway have been approved for &euro;5,000 innovation vouchers each in 2013 to undertake an innovation in partnership with a third level-knowledge partner.  As part of EI's support for early stage entrepreneurs, a series of calls for applications to the competitive start fund were launched in 2012 and two calls were announced to date in 2013.  The purpose of the fund is to accelerate the growth of early stage start-up companies that have the capability to succeed in global markets.  Under the terms of the fund, start-ups receive an equity investment of &euro;50,000 and the services of an experienced business mentor.  A number of west of Ireland early stage companies from Galway have been successful with the fund, including English Bubble Limited, Element Software and MDG Web.  A &euro;200,000 competitive feasibility fund for the west was launched in September 2012 by An Taoiseach and a total of 50 applications were received.  A total of 13 entrepreneurs across the west were awarded funding under this scheme and they are developing business plans for their ideas.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland's national entrepreneur programme - the New Frontiers programme - was launched in 2012.  The programme provides a generous package of supports to help accelerate the development of start-up businesses through GMIT in Galway and Castlebar which are delivering the programme on behalf of the agency.  Some 14 participants were selected to participate on the 2012 programme.  Phase 1 of the programme commenced this month in Castlebar and Galway.  Under the community enterprise centre schemes, which is related to Loughrea, EI has approved support for community owned or led enterprise centres in 19 locations in the west, which is helping to provide workspace and incubate new projects and businesses.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 the following community enterprise centres were approved funding under the community enterprise centre business development funding: IRD Kiltimagh Limited, Action Tuam Limited, IRD North Mayo-West Sligo Limited, Galway Technology Limited and Ballinasloe Area Community Development Limited, to a total of &euro;221,400 in 2012.  A further call for proposals for this scheme closed in April 2013 and applications are being processed.<\/p><p>I am confident that the work of the enterprise agencies, and the combined agency resources represented on the county development board, will continue to meet the growth and development needs of Galway city and county.<\/p><p>With the roll-out of the LEOs and enterprise supports, any time there is a meeting at Galway that all the agencies attend, I will be happy to attend.  If the Senator wants to focus on Loughrea and she wants to facilitate a meeting with representatives of the IDA, EI and the country and city enterprise boards to review the east Galway region, I would be happy to attend, particularly if she feels this will refocus on her concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900025#Y00400","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381324500,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100900026#Z00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1381324500,"counter":166,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 7.35 p.m. until 1 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 October 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
