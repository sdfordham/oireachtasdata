There is a significant level of engagement with companies, quietly and behind the scenes, to address ongoing challenges and help them to develop new strategies, change their business models, where necessary, and further embed their operations in the economy.  This work by the agencies includes pursuing relevant research and development opportunities, promoting training initiatives, the provision of targeted grant aid in specific circumstances, and developing capacity building and transformational management systems.  A good example is a key disruptive reform set out in An Action Plan for Jobs 2014.

I congratulate everybody involved in that process, including the Department, SIPTU and various employers, to try to achieve a resolution.  However, the workers were presented with a choice of either accepting pay cuts or having the entire operation shifted.  That is an unacceptable and very difficult choice to have to make and the workers were placed in a no-win situation.

This was particularly unhelpful and unfair and I do not want to see it happen again.  Workers should not be placed in a difficult position in having to take decisions that will affect their personal lives.

Many of the proposals developed in An Action Plan for Jobs have been designed to assist the start-up, scaling and internationalisation of Irish owned enterprises.  Measures include the roll-out of the local enterprise office, LEO, network, the establishment of the potential exporters divisions, the increase in staff assisting Irish companies to develop in overseas markets, the increase in the number of trade missions, the creation of new instruments to facilitate access to finance and the development of sectoral strategies in areas such as tourism, software and food.<\/p><p>  There is solid progress being made.

They include: a first stop shop through the local enterprise office, LEO, network; more accessible supports for recruitment such as JobsPlus and JobBridge; new instruments for access to finance; enhanced support in developing new markets overseas and through global sourcing; and access to information and support.<\/p><p>  In addition, new legislation has provided for the streamlining of company law to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to form and operate.  We have also reformed the wage setting mechanisms by removing the inflexibilities which prevailed.  Legislation to strengthen competition and consumer law, including, in particular, the introduction of powers to regulate practices in the grocery sector is going through the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  A further major source of jobs growth in the SME sector is start-ups.  The establishment rate of new businesses fell by 30% in the crash.  A key challenge we are addressing is to create an environment in which more start-ups will occur, survive and grow to scale.  The recent forum on entrepreneurship is a major contribution to this objective.  As a follow-on to the forum, the Department shall shortly publish Ireland&rsquo;s first policy statement on entrepreneurship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000005#C00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1404982200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>On the 2011 report, I ask the Minister of State to outline the issues that remain to be addressed.

The new LEOs operating with local authorities are the first-stop shop through which all information on State supports for small and micro-businesses can initially be accessed, and this represents a significant and ambitious transformation of the support structure for enterprises across every county.  The LEO staff cohort is composed of both former county enterprise board staff and local authority staff to ensure a totality in the service provided to LEO clients.<\/p><p>The service level agreement between Enterprise Ireland, whose representatives were in Navan on Monday, and the local authorities provides for Enterprise Ireland to support the developmental needs of LEO staff.

In addition, presenters covered general areas such as the role of Enterprise Ireland and the centre of excellence, LEO brand management and communication protocols, enterprise support services and local authority business development services, as well as partnership with other agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and Microfinance Ireland, where new protocols have recently been developed.

For years, many would have been of the view that some local authorities around the country had a culture of going against enterprise.

The 40 elected members of Meath County Council have a major responsibility in this regard as they now have a mandate to drive business in the county.  The Government cannot create jobs.

One of the high level targets of the strategy was that 50% of all investment would be located outside of Dublin and Cork.  Although IDA Ireland did not achieve this target, there were nevertheless a number of substantial investments in regional locations during the period.  Between 2010 and 2013, some 35% of all foreign direct investment, FDI, announcements related to locations outside of Dublin and Cork, while 40% of all IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors were to locations outside of Dublin and Cork.  Overall, 72,500 people or roughly 44% of the total employment in IDA Ireland's base of companies, including those that were former clients of Shannon Development, are located outside of Dublin and Cork.  <\/p><p>  I am determined to optimise the potential contribution of foreign direct investment to regional economic development as part of a cohesive regional strategy.  To this end, I was pleased to secure agreement on new European Union state aid rules, under which we have secured regional aid status for the south east, County Kerry and the Border, midlands and west region and the capacity to provide aid to large enterprises in these areas.  In addition, Kells, Athy and Arklow have been designated under the new regional aid map. <\/p><p>  Work is now nearing completion on a new foreign direct investment policy statement, as committed to in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.

IDA Ireland does not choose what areas of investment are mobile - certain sectors are clearly more mobile than others - nor does it decide where companies choose to locate.

In particular, huge potential is offered by TTIP to accelerate economic growth, and expand trade and export opportunities.  These give us the potential to create more jobs so that the already falling unemployment rate can be more quickly reduced.<\/p><p>  Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 100,000 people employed in 500 US companies here and with Irish companies exporting over &euro;1 billion in goods and services to the US every year.

This gives a clear indicator of the opportunities we can leverage from fewer barriers to transatlantic trade.<\/p><p>  The Department recently engaged Copenhagen Economics to examine the economic and other impacts of TTIP and related potential opportunities.

The provision of loans that are designed to meet the customised needs of SMEs should incentivise demand and build confidence in the SME sector, thereby encouraging investment in growth and employment.<\/p><p>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the backbone of the economy employing nearly 70% of the total labour force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000010#H02000","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1404985800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>On a point of order, the Minister of State's speech contains a great deal of important detail.

It is accepted that regardless of the economic and financial cycle, there always will be structural problems in the market that constrain SMEs in accessing credit.  This is a feature of SME funding across the OECD.  In particular, innovative firms, small firms and firms early in their life-cycle would appear to be more affected by such market imperfections.  These imperfections or constraints also tend to be exacerbated by financial crises, as was the case with the impact of the international financial crisis which began in 2008.  Furthermore, crisis-enhanced constraints may also persist beyond the return of broader financial stability.  In the years since the outbreak of the international financial crisis, Irish SMEs, like their counterparts across Europe, have been obliged to operate in a more challenging and difficult environment.<\/p><p>  In light of the importance of the SME sector, the Government has responded to this challenge by articulating a clear vision that SMEs should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that enables them to fulfil their growth potential, thereby supporting growth and employment in the economy.  In particular, Government policy has focused on ensuring that micro, small and medium-sized enterprises have access to capital, equity and debt funding from a more diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.<\/p><p>  The Government's medium-term economic strategy, MTES, sets out the ambition of developing a more diversified, competitive and responsive financial infrastructure that can finance growth in the SME sector as we move into a new phase of economic recovery and growth.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 builds on the previous plan and contains an integrated suite of measures and initiatives that are designed to enhance access to finance for micro, small and medium sized enterprises.  The establishment of the SBCI will be a key element in this new and evolving financial architecture and will build on and reinforce the concrete measures that the Government has already put in place to support employment and growth in the SME sector.  This active policy intervention in the credit market for SMEs is justified not only by the importance of the sector but also by the fact research demonstrates that enterprises, including export-orientated firms, which face real or perceived credit constraints are less likely to participate in growth-enhancing activities such as investment, recruitment, exporting, importing and marketing.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the SBCI follows directly from the announcement by the Taoiseach in November 2013, when we successfully exited the EU-IMF programme, that he had held discussions with Chancellor Merkel to specifically find ways to reinforce Ireland's economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms in the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs.  This announcement followed early discussions during the summer of 2013 between officials of the Department of Finance and the German state's promotional bank, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, KfW.  The German Government asked KfW to work with the German and Irish authorities to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.  Officials at the Department of Finance, with the assistance from staff of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA,, have worked quickly to establish the most appropriate way to maximize and sustain the benefits to Irish SMEs of this enhanced co-operation.<\/p><p>  The SBCI will be established as a private company in the first instance.  Shares in the corporation will be owned by the Minister for Finance who will be empowered to change the ownership structure if it is deemed appropriate or necessary to enable the intended expansion of the SBCI.  Although the initial operations of the SBCI will focus on supporting SMEs, other strategic sectors could be also supported in the future.  With this possible expansion in mind, the corporation is being structured so that it is as flexible as possible.  The SBCI will be a for-profit company but will not aim to maximise its profits at the expense of passing benefits to the SME sector.  Rather, it will cover its own costs while ensuring that it maximises its economic impact for SMEs.  The objective of the SBCI will be to increase the availability of loans of greater duration, with enhanced terms and potentially at a lower cost to the SME sector.  To achieve this objective the SBCI will operate as a wholesale lender and will provide funds to on-lending institutions, which will be required to transmit the benefits of the more favourable funding terms to their customers - the SMEs.  On-lenders will include not only the Irish commercial banks but also foreign banks, specialist funds or other qualifying providers of finance.  The tangible benefits to the SMEs will be additional availability of funds, with improved and flexible terms that are more tailored to their ongoing business needs.<\/p><p>  The SBCI will be financed from the outset by a mix of funding from KfW, the European Investment Bank, EIB, and the directed portfolio of the National Pension Reserve Fund, NPRF.  The NPRF will provide &euro;10 million in equity capital and a loan facility of up to &euro;240 million, which can be converted to equity if necessary.  KfW and the EIB combined will more than match that amount and, therefore, the combination of the three initial sources of funding will provide a pool of more than &euro;500 million for the SBCI to use in its start-up phase.  Further details will be released as and when the funding contracts with the EIB and KfW are finalised.  This can only occur once the SBCI has been established as a company.<\/p><p>  Both KfW and the EIB have indicated that they are willing to provide low-cost funding to the SBCI for up to a ten-year term.  The locking in of this lower cost supply of funds for this extended period is a major benefit for Irish SMEs because it can mitigate the disproportionate funding risks that SMEs face.  It will ensure that they will have access to a steady and secure supply of lower cost funding, which is a major competitive advantage.  Another key advantage of the SBCI will be its capacity to extend to SMEs loans of longer duration and with enhanced and more flexible terms and conditions attached than are typically available in the market at present.  Specifically, the SBCI will provide funding to on-lending institutions that will enable them to offer SME loans of a longer tenure, for example, five to ten years, and with more flexible conditions attached, for example, capital repayment breaks or interest holidays.<\/p><p>  This combination of longer tenure and customised conditions and potentially lower cost pricing will provide SMEs with access to patient intelligent capital that will support their long-term development, stimulate increased investment in growth and generate additional employment opportunities.  SMEs will have a greater capacity and incentive to make investments on the basis of improved cash flow that is more tailored and customised to their business needs.  This type of financing is an integral feature of countries with robust and dynamic SME sectors and it is essential, from both a growth and employment perspective, that the development of the Irish SME sector is supported in a similar manner.  Facilitating access to funding with more attractive terms and conditions will also assist in enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs in a context where Irish SMEs have been, since the onset of the financial crisis, disadvantaged by the increased fragmentation within the Single European Market.<\/p><p>  In the initial phase, loans from the SBCI will fund loans to SMEs for investment purposes.  The range of financial products available to the SME sector will grow during the first year of the SBCI's operations and we will be working with the European Commission's Directorate General for Competition on this matter. To date, the directorate has been very supportive of this innovative initiative and we will continue our proactive engagement with it.  Similar to how KfW operates in Germany, the SBCI, acting primarily as a wholesale lender, will lend to on-lenders who will then on-lend to SMEs.  That will enable SMEs to access finance facilitated through regulated providers from the earliest possible date.  This indirect approach will not inhibit the SBCI's ability to enhance the provision of credit in the marketplace and improve the funding environment for SMEs.  The strategic role of on-lending development institutions is a well-established model that is both effective and successful in other markets such as Germany, Spain and France.  It is also the operational model that is traditionally used by Europe's development bank, the EIB.  Experience in other countries indicates that any on-lending facilitated by a state-sponsored financial institution such as the SBCI is generally complementary to the SME lending that is offered directly by private financial institutions.<\/p><p>  The challenges facing SMEs in Ireland accessing credit are the product of a complex interplay of demand and supply side factors.  Significantly, the SBCI has been designed in a manner that will assist in improving both the supply and demand side elements of SME access to finance.  As already outlined, on-lending institutions will include not only the Irish commercial banks but can also include foreign banks, specialist funds or other providers of credit in the market.  The provision of a steady supply of low cost funding from the SBCI should lower the barriers to entry for any new providers of funding and, therefore, has the potential to increase competition in the provision of finance to SMEs and other strategic areas of the economy.<\/p><p>Existing or new entrant market participants will be required to meet prescribed criteria which will be set by the SBCI to ensure the on-lender can lend prudently to the targeted market.  Less concentration and increased competition in the provision of financing clearly will be beneficial to not only SMEs but also to the wider economy, and accords with the overall Government policy objective of creating more diversified and balanced sources of financing for the real economy.<\/p><p> The SBCI also has the potential to incentivise demand for credit from the SME sector.  As the Department of Finance's credit and demand surveys demonstrate, despite tangible improvements in business performance, demand for credit from the SME sector remains somewhat muted.  By ensuring financing of a longer tenure and with more flexible conditions attached and potentially at a lower cost, the SBCI will provide an important signalling effect on releasing any latent or pent-up demand for finance from the SME sector.  The expanded pool of lending products from a potentially broader range of credit providers could also serve the needs of a wider cohort of SME customers than is served at present by lending institutions.<\/p><p> A more stable supply of lower-cost funding from the SBCI will also assist in building confidence within the SME sector as it increases the certainty of financing to that sector, even in adverse financial market conditions.  An institution with a clear SME lending focus will also serve to raise awareness levels regarding the availability of financing, which could also encourage more would-be borrowers to apply for funds.<\/p><p> The SBCI will, at one level, operate in a counter-cyclical manner in seeking to compensate for any constraints in the provision of financing to enterprises and in particular SMEs.  It will also, however, operate with a broader developmental mandate that will enable it to channel investment towards key strategic sectors of the economy.<\/p><p> That many states, for example Germany, France, Spain and Canada, have long-standing national development or promotional banks, highlights the role such state-sponsored financial institutions play in pursuing broader public policy objectives, such as enhancing access to finance for SMEs or for particular strategic sectors.  In the aftermath of the financial crisis, it is evident that a growing number of governments have sought to use national development or promotional banks to support the SME sector in particular.  Countries where such institutions were already in place, such as Germany, France and Spain, have expanded their roles and remits to address cyclical financing constraints, while in other countries, such as Portugal and the UK, new financial institutions have been or are being established.  At the same time, these national development and promotional banks have continued to undertake their broader developmental role of channelling investment towards specific sectors that are considered to be of particular strategic importance to the economy and broader society.  KfW, for example, has implemented promotional programmes to support SMEs in the renewable energy, energy efficiency and wind energy sectors.<\/p><p> The Finance for Growth report of the European Council's Economic and Financial Committee's high level expert group, which was co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, clearly identified that national development or promotional institutions should play an increased role in providing finance for SMEs within their own countries and in other jurisdictions.  The SBCI's support from the EIB also shows that Europe's investment bank has taken a more proactive role than in the recent past.  This approach has been championed by officials from the Department of Finance in its engagement with the EIB.  Given this evolving financial architecture throughout the EU, it is important that SMEs in Ireland have access to financial products similar to those available to comparative enterprises in competitor states.  Otherwise they will operate at a serious competitive disadvantage that will constrain their capacity to take advantage of broader economic recovery.  The SBCI, with its concentrated focus on improving the supply and availability of financing to the SME sector, will ensure that Ireland will have in place a State-sponsored financial institution capable of supporting long-term investment in the SME sector.<\/p><p> The establishment of the SBCI entity will also mean that Ireland will have in place an institution that can serve to facilitate direct EU financing from multilateral bodies, such as the EIB and the European Investment Fund.  The nature and remit of the SBCI will also enable greater co-operation by the Irish State with other European national and multilateral development financial institutions.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the detail of the main provisions of the Bill, which has seven parts.  Part 1 of the Bill, containing sections 1 to 4 sets out the preliminary and general provisions.  Section 1 merely provides for the short title of the Bill and allows the Minister for Finance to commence the Bill or particular parts of the Bill at different dates.  Section 2 sets out the purposes of the Strategic Banking Corporation Bill.  The main purpose of the Bill is to improve the availability of credit to enterprises and other persons in a manner that benefits the economy and the economic well-being of the State.  This will be achieved by the establishment of a new company, the strategic banking corporation of Ireland, SBCI, which will avail of credit and make credit available through on-lending to enterprises, in particular SMEs.  The Bill empowers the Minister to guarantee the borrowings of the SBCI and to provide funding to it, although it is hoped that in time the SBCI will be able to fund itself without the need for either further loans from the Government or the need to guarantee all of its borrowings.<\/p><p> Section 3 is a standard provision providing definitions for certain words and terms used in the Bill.  Section 4 provides that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act will be sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and paid out of the moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Essentially, this covers the expenses of the Department of Finance in working to establish the SBCI rather than the operating costs of the SBCI.  Costs directly attributable to the SBCI will be the liabilities of the SBCI and not the Minister or the Department of Finance.<\/p><p> Part 2 of the Bill, containing sections 5 to 10, provides for the establishment of the strategic banking corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  It provides for the formation of the SBCI and group entities.  It sets out the functions of the SBCI and outlines the composition of the SBCI board and the SBCI's relationship with the NTMA.<\/p><p> Section 5 enables the formation of a private company under the Companies Act, called the strategic banking corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The SBCI will be independent in carrying out its functions under this Act.  This section allows the company to use the word &quot;banking&quot; in its name by disapplying sections 7(1), 8 and 15 of the Central Bank Act 1971 and exempts the SBCI's name from having to end in the suffix &quot;Limited&quot;.<\/p><p> Section 6 provides for the SBCI to be able to form, promote or take shareholding in various types of subsidiaries, such as companies or joint ventures, and sets out the terms on which this can be done.  These will be known collectively as SBCI group entities.  The SBCI is not permitted to guarantee the borrowings or liabilities of any of its subsidiaries without the approval of the Minister.  A definition of the SBCI's group entities is given in section 3.<\/p><p> Section 7 provides that the memorandum and articles of association of the SBCI will be consistent with provisions of the legislation.  It establishes that no alterations to the documents will be valid without the prior approval of the Minister.<\/p><p> Section 8 sets out the functions of the SBCI.  The main functions of the SBCI will be to provide and promote, in a prudent manner, the availability of additional credit in the State suitable to the needs of borrowers, in particular SMEs.  The SBCI will encourage more competition in the provision of credit in the State and greater diversity in the types of finance available.  The functions of the SBCI will also include sourcing international and domestic funding to facilitate lending and providing finance to projects that contribute to national economic development.<\/p><p> Section 9 provides for the SBCI to have a board of not more than nine members including its chairperson.  It sets out that the first directors on incorporation will be appointed by the Minister and that subsequent boards and the position of company secretary will be appointed by the SBCI in accordance with the terms and conditions of appointment set out in the memorandum and articles of association of the SBCI.  The Minister will continue to appoint a chairperson from within the board.<\/p><p> Section 10 provides for the SBCI's relationship with the NTMA.  It sets out that the NTMA will provide the SBCI and any of its subsidiaries with business and support services and systems that are considered necessary for the SBCI to perform its functions.  It will allow these services to be provided either directly or indirectly.  The section also provides for the NTMA to assign staff to the SBCI to enable it perform its functions under the Bill.  Under this section the NTMA may also supply the SBCI with treasury services and advice in connection with debt securities and borrowings of the SBCI.  The NTMA may also enter into transactions of a normal banking nature as an agent of the SBCI.  The NTMA will be reimbursed by the SBCI for the costs incurred under this section.  The NTMA will be also able to perform similar functions for subsidiaries of the SBCI.<\/p><p> Part 3 sets out the funding arrangements of the SBCI.  Section 11 provides for the determination of the authorised share capital of SBCI by the Minister for Finance, and for the initial issue of shares in the new company to the Minister.  It also provides that the SBCI will issue shares to the value of &euro;10 million to the Minister.  This &euro;10 million of equity capital will come from the NPRF.<\/p><p>The authorised share capital will be &euro;250 million or a higher amount as the Minister may decide.  However, the authorised share capital may never go above &euro;1 billion.  If the strategic banking corporation of Ireland, SBCI, determines that further equity is required to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, it may issue further share capital to the Minister in exchange for the conversion of the outstanding loans from the NPRF, the Central Fund or a combination of both.  Any change to the share capital will be laid before the Oireachtas.  It is not intended that all borrowings of the SBCI will need to be guaranteed by the State.<\/p><p>The Bill provides flexibility around the value of the SBCI's share capital and gives the Minister the power to pay in authorised share capital at the request of the SBCI.  This is being done to facilitate a flexible capital structure known as callable capital.  It is used by the European Investment Bank, EIB, among others to facilitate funding of an institution without the need to guarantee all borrowings.  This model will be beneficial in the medium term but will not be used in the initial year of the SBCI.  Callable capital involves an agreement with the lenders to a company that, should a certain balance sheet position be reached, the borrowing company will increase the amount of its issued and paid-in capital to a pre-agreed level.  In the interim, the lender will lend to the borrower on the basis that the authorised share capital has been set to at least that level, and it is usually happy to lend even if the paid-in capital is a fraction of the authorised capital.  This has a potential benefit in that there is no need to issue a guarantee for further borrowings.<\/p><p>Section 12 provides that the Minister can dispose of shares in the SBCI as he sees fit.  Any fund received in respect of the shares will go to the Exchequer - for example, proceeds of sales or redemptions of shares.  If the Minister is disposing of shares in the SBCI, the reasons for the disposal must be given to the Oireachtas.  It is not intended that the Minister for Finance will sell shares, but flexibility to do so has been included.<\/p><p>Section 13 provides that the SBCI may borrow money in any currency through any type of debt it sees as appropriate.  This section limits the amount of borrowings that the SBCI can have outstanding at any particular time to &euro;4 billion.  If the SBCI were to borrow in a foreign currency, those borrowings would be valued using the European Central Bank's published exchange rates.  This section also allows the SBCI to engage in transactions of a normal banking nature for the purposes of carrying out its functions.<\/p><p>Section 14 provides for an amendment to section 54 of the Finance Act 1970.  This amendment allows the Minister to engage in normal banking transactions with the SBCI.  Under this section, he may issue funds from the Exchequer for the purposes of those transactions and any associated cost arising out of same.  Broadly speaking, this is an enabling provision and is common when introducing a State entity that involves borrowing.<\/p><p>Section 15 provides for the Minister to give directions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission with which the commission must comply.  This section provides the Minister with the power to direct the commission to provide credit to the SBCI and to provide funding to same to fund the subscription of the Minister's shares in the company.  The Minister may also exercise any right based on a direction or terminate the terms of a direction.<\/p><p>Section 16 sets out the maximum amount of funding that the SBCI can be given by the State, which is &euro;5 billion.  It explains that the funding of the SBCI includes any loan, investment, exchange of assets, subscription for securities, debt securities, issued share capital and callable capital.<\/p><p>Section 17 allows for the SBCI board to decide what dividends are to be paid to the Minister.  It also provides that any money received by the Minister in respect of his share in the company, including dividends, shall be paid into the Exchequer in such a manner as the Minister directs.<\/p><p>Part 4 provides for the issuance of guarantees by the Minister.  Section 18 gives him the authority to guarantee any money borrowed by the SBCI up to a maximum of &euro;4 billion aggregate of all guarantees outstanding.  Accrued interest does not count towards this maximum amount.  The details of any guarantee provided for by this section shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is given.  Guarantees would only be used when specifically required to enable borrowings from external providers of loans to the SBCI.<\/p><p>Part 5 sets out the procedures for ensuring the public accountability of the SBCI.  Section 19 provides that the SBCI must submit its accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit within two months of the financial year to which they relate.  The audited consolidated accounts will also be presented to the Minister and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Section 20 provides that a senior member of the staff of the SBCI nominated by its chairperson will, whenever required by the Committee of Public Accounts, give evidence to that committee on the accounts and reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General into the SBCI.<\/p><p>Part 6 sets out two miscellaneous provisions.  Section 21 provides that the Minister, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the latter's employees and staff are not to be considered either shadow directors under section 27(1) of the Companies Act 1990 or <i>de facto<\/i>directors of the SBCI.  It is intended that the board of the NTMA be covered in this respect, ensuring that the Minister and the NTMA can carry out their various other functions without their involvement with the SBCI being a block on that work.<\/p><p>Section 22 provides that certain provisions of the Companies Acts will not apply to the SBCI.  These provisions ensure that the Minister's relationship with the SBCI does not prevent him from carrying out any of his other functions and avoids redundant reporting requirements in the administration of the SBCI.<\/p><p>Part 7 contains one section, section 23, which sets out a number of tax exemptions that will apply to the SBCI and any subsidiary wholly owned by same.  This section is a standard provision for all companies and subsidiaries wholly owned by the Minister for Finance.  It is valid as long as the Minister remains the sole shareholder and, therefore, is the sole beneficiary of such tax exemptions.  This section also provides that income and gains arising to the SBCI or a wholly owned subsidiary of same will be exempt from dividend withholding tax, corporation tax, DIRT, interest withholding tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty.<\/p><p>A robust, dynamic and innovative indigenous small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector is key to ensuring sustained economic recovery and employment growth.  Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises need access to a steady and secure supply of credit if they are to fulfil their growth potential, take advantage of business and investment opportunities at home and abroad and create employment for our citizens.  The proposed establishment of the SBCI builds on the measures and initiatives that have already been put in place by the Government to enhance SME access to finance and can be considered to be a major milestone in our continued economic recovery.  By ensuring the provision of improved credit that is tailored to the business needs of enterprises, particularly SMEs, the SBCI will make an important contribution to stimulating economic activity, enhancing competitiveness and generating employment across the State.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000011#J00600","speaker":"1042","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404987000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael McGrath, who I understand is sharing time with Deputy Calleary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000013#L00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1404987000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I will take up to 15 minutes and he will take the balance.<\/p><p>  I welcome the publication of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Bill.  It is long overdue legislation, as a State enterprise bank was promised as far back as February 2011 in the programme for Government.  However, it is somewhat ironic that, having waited three years for the Bill, we are being given little more than three hours to debate All Stages.  I can only conclude that the announcement of the SBCI in May was dictated by the political calendar and not the economic needs of the country.  At the time, we were being hit by a veritable barrage of announcements about grants and all sorts of goodies.  Curiously, the flow of press releases seems to have dried up since polling day.<\/p><p>  We know from the history of the local property legislation that, when a Bill is rushed through the House with limited time for scrutiny, there is a considerably heightened risk of error.  It is regrettable that the much-vaunted pre-legislative scrutiny at committee is not taking place this time.  It would have given us the opportunity to invite the various industry groups and representative bodies that will be the customers of the SBCI to test whether the legislation was fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  While I welcome any initiative that may be of assistance to the credit-starved SME sector, the SBCI as planned is an inadequate response to the sector's crisis with regard to access to credit.  In simple terms, this initiative can be described as all sizzle and no steak.  Even though it is called the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Bill, it will not actually have a banking licence.  In fact, the legislation must contain a special provision to allow it to use the word &quot;Banking&quot; in its name - the Minister has confirmed this - when it is not actually a bank at all.<\/p><p>  When the Government sat down to design a mechanism to increase the flow of credit, it had three options.  It could have set up a full-service, State-backed bank along the lines of the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC, which operated successfully in the economy for many years.  Alternatively, the Government could have opted for a mechanism in which the existing banks referred customers to the SBCI, which then made the lending decision.  The new entity could also have gone down the route of simply providing a line of credit to the banks, which would then make decisions on SME lending.<\/p><p>This is undoubtedly the weakest version and while I can understand some reluctance on the Government's part to set up a brand new bank given the range of banking assets the State already owns it is difficult to understand why it is leaving the credit decisions about SMEs entirely in the hands of those who have over the last five years starved the economy of the essential new lending that it requires.<\/p><p>We know from the manner in which banks have hoarded capital that it is likely that they will continue to take a very risk-averse approach to lending.  This means that many firms with viable business propositions will continue to be denied the capital they need to invest and grow their business.  Cheap funding from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland may help the banks' profitability without improving credit flow in the economy.<\/p><p>I note the comments of Mark Fielding of ISME, someone who very much has his finger on the pulse on these matters, who said: <blockquote>... the fear among credit squeezed SMEs is that the bailed-out banks will revert to form and divert these loan funds to &quot;safer&quot; large businesses.  Our banks have 'form' in this area and previous European low-interest loans found their way to less risky larger businesses, making a killing for the banks, while starving SMEs of much needed finance.<\/blockquote>We also know from the manner in which banks have reacted to ECB rate reductions that they will act in their own short-term interests.  Rate cuts which were designed to stimulate the eurozone economy have not been passed to either personal or business customers.  The banks have stated that their primary focus is on rebuilding their net interest margin.  While some would say that is what banks are meant to do, given the enormous investment of capital that was put in to the banks and the chronic shortage of credit, their actions most certainly do not concur with the needs of the economy at this time.<\/p><p>The Governor of the Central Bank has acknowledged that, compared with virtually all other eurozone countries, SMEs in Ireland face even more acute difficulties in terms of access to, and pricing of, credit.  In that context, I believe the key failure in this Bill is that it will not result in any change in the lending standards that are applied by banks.  We are likely to continue to see the same very high rate of refusal that comes up regularly in ISME and Central Bank surveys.<\/p><p>I am not asking for a loosening of credit standards to start some form of new credit boom but merely to correct the problem that all of us as practising TDs encounter regularly in our constituency offices, namely, good businesses with the potential to expand and grow not being able to get a loan that they need.  In fact, in many instances it is not even investment capital to expand that firms are looking for, it is short-term working capital to survive.  A simple overdraft can be a life saver for many businesses.  We are all well aware of the problems that firms face in getting paid, sometimes even the State is a slow payer.  It is a crushing blow for a company to go out of business when short-term credit could have allowed it the breathing space to trade its way out of difficulties.  As it stands, the banks are often only interested in lending to the most gilt-edged of customers.  A new source of credit for the banks which reduces their costs of funds but does nothing to change the ultra risk-averse lending culture, which pertains at the pillar banks at present and beyond, will be good news only for the banks' shareholders.  It will be nothing more than a drop in the ocean in terms of the real world economic impact.<\/p><p>What I am calling for is for the Government to go back to the drawing board and give consideration to one of the two options to which I alluded, namely, a full service State enterprise bank or some form of hybrid model whereby the bank does not seek to compete directly with the existing banks but potential clients are referred to it and it makes the ultimate credit decision.  A properly constituted enterprise bank could be a permanent solution to the lending gap which clearly exists in Irish banking and would ensure lending was available to any business that can demonstrate its creditworthiness.<\/p><p>It is somewhat of a well worn clich&eacute; at this stage to state that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy, representing 70% of all employment in the private sector. Their well-being is vital to economic recovery.  The domestic SME sector is diverse in nature and employs workers with a much wider range of skills than the multinational sector.  SMEs can range from a small welding business to a local supermarket employing 100 people.  The jobs crisis cannot be solved by focusing on foreign direct investment alone and by supporting the SME sector we are ensuring job opportunities for those with traditional skills as well as people with technical qualifications.  It is in all our interests that the sector is supported.  The number one issues cited in every survey of small business owners is access to credit.  This was a golden opportunity to put in place a mechanism which would support SMEs not just during the current economic crisis but one that would stand the test of time.  Unfortunately, at this point I do not believe we have got the formula right.<\/p><p>As well as problems with access to credit, SMEs report bank fees and charges are rising and that trend is likely to continue.  To the best of my knowledge, no institution has applied for a banking licence to the Central Bank since 2012.  The existing banks are fixated with the upcoming stress tests and are unlikely to change course and begin lending to SMEs in the manner required at least in the short term.  The arrival of a number of international lenders in the early 2000s brought greater competition between banks.  While some product innovation, including 100% mortgages in the personal banking sector, could rightly be criticised, competition ensured customers were offered a wider range of banking services at a lower cost.  As the banking market has contracted, the dominance of two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, is returning to levels last seen in the 1980s.  Lack of competition leads to higher fees and charges, lower interest rates on deposit, high borrowing costs and a lack of product choice.  The SBCI is its current format is unlikely to change that stark reality for bank customers.<\/p><p>Efforts to encourage non-bank funding have been completely inadequate to date.  High profile announcements around seed capital, loan guarantees and microfinance have not been matched by delivery of funding.  It is imperative that the SBCI does not go the way of Microfinance Ireland and the credit guarantee scheme which have, after less than two years in existence, required major examination and overhaul.  It would be far better to get the SBCI right from day one.<\/p><p>I have suggested in the past that the Government bring forward a White Paper on the banking sector.  Five years since the onset of the crisis the Irish banking sector is still not fit for purpose.  It is imperative that the Government has a strategy for competition and regulation and that it does not simply react to each development.  What we are seeing is a piecemeal approach to the many problems in the banking sector, including dealing with legacy debt, ensuring competition in the sector and preventing a recurrence of the mistakes of the past.<\/p><p>I have no doubt that the SBCI will be staffed by very able and diligent people who will work tirelessly to fulfil the mandate given to them.  However, my contention is that the architecture in which they will operate is not fit for purpose and needs to be looked at in a comprehensive overall manner.  We believe that this is better than nothing, but it could be a far more productive and efficient use of resources if the Minister adopted the model we have advocated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000013#L00300","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404987600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for sharing his time with me.  I take the opportunity of the debate on this finance issue to wish Derek Moran every success and congratulate him on his selection as Secretary General of the Department of Finance, although it is a position though that should have been advertised.  When we consider the level of coverage being given to the so-called - on-off or whenever it will be - reshuffle this week and that Mr. Moran will be far more powerful than most of those even in Cabinet who will get positions this week, the level of scrutiny around the appointment needs to be improved.  If we are serious about public service reform, every position at that level should be advertised publicly and expressions of interest sought from all over.<\/p><p>  This Bill, I regret, represents another false dawn for Irish business and for Irish SME in particular.  The kind of bumf that has come with it, is reminicent of some of the worst marketing skills of banks in the so-called boom times.  Letting out and giving this kind of information, that this Bill and this organisation could make a substantial business difference to small business, is false and wrong.  This is the kind of thing that would have been exposed if there was a proper scrutiny of this legislation, rather than rushing it through in the last week of this D&aacute;il session.  This is the kind of thing that would have been exposed and teased out in a pre-legislative stage where groups and organisations, on whom this is supposed to impact, could have come into the committee and given their views on it, but we will be deprived of that.<\/p><p>  The model we are being asked to support here is the model that underpins the credit guarantee scheme, where the State acts as an overarching guide, as it were, for the pillar banks and they are then left to operate the scheme on the ground.  The credit guarantee scheme has not worked.  It has been an absolute disaster so much so that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is due to come back into the House with legislation to change it, yet we are doing the same thing here with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  We are taking extra money into the market, investing it through the existing banks and expressing a hope that other banks might come and break up the cosy monopoly that exists and make a real difference to Irish business.<\/p><p>That  probably will not happen.  Deputy Michael McGrath has outlined the way in which the banks are operating and how they will use this cash to balance their books and the additional lending power to save steady businesses.  This legislation will result in no changes in the practices that are frustrating businesses and their ability to grow and, more importantly, create employment.  It will also not do anything for businesses in substantial arrears.  According to the Central Bank, 41% of SME loans are in arrears.  This debt is choking the ability of businesses to grow and create employment.  It is not possible for them to do so while there is overhanging debt.  There is a need to put in place a solution that will allow them to rest some of this debt until such time as they are in a position to start repaying it again.  We are not asking for massive debt write-offs.  Many viable businesses are being constrained by the debt overhang which is choking their ability to grow and actually pulling some of them down.  There are so many examples of businesses affected in this way and this legislation will do nothing for them.  It will do nothing to change or improve the lending practices in banks.  We all know about the current turnaround time in dealing with bank applications for restructuring and so on.  I am dealing with the case of a person whose application for a &euro;500,000 loan has been in the system for 16 months.  That is typical of what is happening.  However, because of the informality of the system this will not be included in data for bank lending.  The banks know that the status of an application is not recorded until such time as it has been refused.  The applicant then has the option of appealing the decision to the Credit Review Office or seeking finance under the credit guarantee scheme or from the microfinance fund.  However, the Bill will not change the position on banks continuing to stretch out this process.<\/p><p> Another critical issue is that of new products and new ways of lending which facilitate business needs.  There is an over-reliance on old traditional banking products such as overdraft facilities.  Some 60% of Irish SMEs have access to and use an overdraft facility as their primary source of financing.  The European average in this regard is 30%.  On the personal guarantee, Mr. Sean O'Sullivan was scathing in his remarks about it in the entrepreneurship report.  The Bill will not change that practice.  It will not force the banks to recognise that we are living in the 21st century and that they need to offer banking products that are of the 21st century, flexible and respect businesses as customers as opposed to profit-centres for the rebuilding of their profits.  Banks have increased fees for business by up to 60% and are being paid ridiculous fees in dealing with loan applications.  Presumably, when a particular SME wants to purchase new machinery, it will be faced with huge fees in this regard and a process that may take up to 15 months to complete.  There is nothing in the legislation that will stop any of this from happening.<\/p><p> The difficulty is that this has to go through the existing bank structure, in which there is no confidence among Irish SMEs.  What is needed is a State enterprise bank in the form of the former ICC or ACC - that is the space we are in - a bank with ambition to assist and grow businesses and go on a journey and walk the walk with Irish business owners in growing their businesses.  What is proposed falls short of that requirement.  I am at a loss to understand why the legislation is being rushed through when even this model could be improved with a pre-legislative input and an input from business people whom it is supposed to benefit.  Those operating SMEs are the ones who need to be involved in this process.<\/p><p> The credit guarantee scheme was launched in October 2012.  We were told &euro;400 million in guaranteed lending would arise from the scheme, but nowhere near that amount has been provided.  We were also guaranteed funding of approximately &euro;25 million per annum from the microfinance fund, but thus far only approximately &euro;8.5 million has been provided.  The decline in lending in the Irish market continues.  While businesses are deleveraging less and paying down loans, if, as the Government states, we are in a business development stage, they should be in a position to start growing again, but they are not because the perception among Irish businesses is that Irish banks are not lending.  That is the perception of every business organisation and the legislation will not change it.  What we need is something that will shake up the cosy consensus in this regard.  We need a new type of operation to shake up the banking sector, its product offering, business practices and fee charging structures.  That would make a difference and force the existing banks to cop-on and move into the 21st century, thus ensuring the investment in the SBCI might make a difference on the street and to those who want to create additional employment.  It will also provide SMEs with the capital they need to grow their businesses.  As I stated at the beginning, this is another false dawn, which is regrettable.  For the many SME owners looking in who had hoped the legislation would assist them, it will not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000014#M00200","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404988200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Pearse Doherty is sharing time with Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000015#N00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1404988200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh don cheapach&aacute;n sa Roinn Airgeadais a luaigh an cainteoir a chuaigh romhaim.

It is important that I again stress our dissatisfaction with the manner in which the legislation is being dealt with by the Government.  It shows contempt for democracy and debate.  It is clear that no amendments will be accepted on Committee Stage and that there will not be an opportunity to table amendments on Report Stage, as Members who wished to table amendments were required to do so within hours of publication of the Bill and prior to hearing the Minister's contribution on Second Stage.   <\/p><p>  Nobody in the House has been arguing for a stimulus more than Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p><p>It has been a central part of our policy for many years to contend there are other ways of reducing the deficit and getting people back to work.  That part of the jigsaw was the need to stimulate the economy and ensure the banks were lending to SMEs and also in other areas.  We highlighted the need to use resources we had at our disposal to ensure that would happen.  Three years on, we finally see some movement on the part of the Government.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance spoke about the agreement secured last year between KfW and the State to inject money into an entity such as that being established.  I do not understand why the Government waited until the end of this parliamentary session to introduce this legislation.  Our views mean nothing because the Bill will go through.  The Government has made it very clear that it will be passed tonight; the use of the guillotine is to be imposed.  The Taoiseach tells us it is the first time the guillotine has been used this year.  One could argue that a Bill such as this does not have major significance, but we should delve into it and ask whether this is true.  When I read the legislation, I note that it stipulates the State can fund the new company to the tune of &euro;5 billion and that the Minister can guarantee loans issued by it to the tune of &euro;4 billion.  Perhaps it is regarded as a Bill that does not require proper parliamentary scrutiny and proper consideration, with sufficient time allowed between Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage to ensure we get it right.<\/p><p>When considering amending the Companies Act such as section 60, phrases such as &quot;the normal course of lending&quot; might mean nothing to us, but if we had paid attention to the courts and the protracted Anglo Irish Bank trial in recent weeks, we would know that that term was at the very core of the trial and prosecution of those found guilty of breaches of the Companies Act.  Let us not debate the sections of the Bill in a proper, meaningful way: that is what the Government has suggested to us.  This is not a Bill about investing a couple of hundred million euro of taxpayers' money in an area of the economy; rather it is a Bill that contains potential liabilities in the order of billions of euro.  I refer to the figure of &euro;4 billion for loans and a maximum of &euro;5 billion that can be injected into the company.  Therefore, it goes without saying this is the wrong way to deal with the matter.  The debate on the Bill should not be guillotined today and proper respect should be accorded to the people and the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The programme for Government made a clear commitment to establish a strategic investment bank.  Where stands that commitment?  What we have is a very poor substitute for a State bank investing in the economy.  It is very clear that the body is not a bank because banks have licences.  If one wants to set up a bank, one must have a banking licence.  The Government went to extreme lengths to try to appease the Labour Party, in particular, which argued that a strategic investment bank would be central to its platform.  It went to extreme lengths to change the law, not once but twice.  On one occasion, it changed the law to use the word &quot;bank&quot; in the name of the company.  That would probably not fool people sufficiently to have them believe the body is a bank; therefore, it also had to change the law to remove the word &quot;limited&quot;.  If we were to use the word &quot;limited&quot;, people would understand it was not a bank but a company.  The Government made two changes to the law to try to dress up the company as a bank.  There is a saying in Irish, &ldquo;Cuir s&iacute;oda ar ghabhar agus is gabhar i cg&oacute;na&iacute; &eacute;.&rdquo;  The Americans refer to putting lipstick on a pig.  No matter how one dresses up the entity, it is not a bank.  That is a major problem I envisage with the legislation.  The entity should be set up as a strategic investment bank that would lends to the real economy.  The lending brief should be broader than SME lending.<\/p><p>The company on which the entity is very much styled, KfW, provides in a very meaningful way loans for SMEs.  That is but one part of its structure.  The other parts involve investing in housing, the environment and other areas with an economic benefit.  The Germans used the bank to create the stimulus package the German economy needed at the time in question, while keeping the arrangement off the balance sheet.  It seems clear that the Government intends to have the entity focus solely on SMEs which are very much starved of and require funding.  However, the scope should be wider.  We should be ambitious for a State bank if it is to receive a banking licence.  Then again, we probably will not have time to dip into the real meaning of the legislation.  It refers to lending to enterprises and &quot;other persons in the State&quot;.  What does the phrase &quot;other persons in the State&quot; mean?  It is referred to time and again.  Section 2 refers to the purpose of encouraging &ldquo;the giving of credit in a prudent manner to enterprises and other persons in the State, in particular SMEs...&rdquo;.  Since it is not just SMEs, what does the phrase &ldquo;other persons in the State&rdquo; mean?  What limitations are being set for the fund?  Are there limitations?  Can anybody legally avail of it, although the direction of the fund is to provide for SMEs, in particular?  These are the points I would like to tease out in a proper debate on the issue.<\/p><p>The proposed structure of the company represents a half-hearted attempt to do what is required.  The record of the Government in gaining access to European Investment Bank funding is not good.  Unless the commercial agreements of KfW are made public, we will be in the dark on whether it is a good way to fund the new body.  We need to consider in detail the question of whether we are sure the funding mechanism proposed is the best one.  I refer to having one of the top ten German banks provide loans for this company which it will lend on to others.  What guarantee is there that the banks will pass on funding to SMEs to which they would not otherwise make credit available?  The statement from the Government makes it very clear that the banks will have to ensure the money is passed on to SMEs that comply with rigorous state aid rules, but the legislation contains no provision in this regard.  A major problem with it is that it is very bare; it does not have much detail and only creates the skeleton of the company.  Actually, the detail is utterly absent.  There is a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>and we are being asked again to trust the Government regarding what it claims it will do.  We are asked not to worry about the fact that it is asking us to guarantee &euro;4 billion in loans and support its commitment to inject &euro;5 billion into the fund.  We are asked not to worry that there is nothing in the legislation that can actually ensure the banks will pass on the funding to those most in need of credit in the SME sector and that there is no supervisory mechanism or hard and fast rule in the legislation that will force the banks to pass on the money or punish them if they do not do so.<\/p><p>I have made it very clear to the Minister that I do not trust the Government.  The vast majority of the people do not trust it either, which is no revelation.  I did not trust the last Government and the people were rightly shown that this was justified.  The Government came into office with the promise that it would do things differently.  One of its first decisions was to proceed in exactly the same way as its predecessor and invest our money in broken banks.  I have extreme concerns about the Bill.  I do not see enough in the legislation, even if it establishes the bare bones of a new body that will guarantee extra support for SMEs on the ground.  There is nothing in it that will stop the banks that have been bailed out from simply soaking up extra cheaper funds.  They received enough public funds to waste on salaries and in other areas.<\/p><p> Under the mortgage arrears resolution targets, the Central Bank had the stick of being able to inflict capital penalties, and that should be available in respect of banks and other bodies that access funding under the SBCI if they do not pass it on to the real economy.  There should be extra provisions in this Bill that would allow the Central Bank to use its powers to ensure the funding that comes from this company to the banks is not just soaked up in the normal course of the bank's lending, which the bank would lend anyway.  It must be additional.  I also believe we should closely examine allowing the company to directly fund SMEs.  Sinn F&eacute;in strongly believes in a State bank investing in the economy.  That means investing in our physical, social and environmental infrastructure.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, the Bill falls short, and we do not have a sufficient amount of time to scrutinise it.  It is envisaged that the fund will be financed by a German bank, presumably at a profit to that bank, and the European Investment Bank.  It is an example of how broken our system is, six years later, that we are relying on a German bank to fund a company that is not a bank to fund the banks, some of which we own, to fund small and medium enterprises that are starved of funding.  The craziness of the type of structure we are trying to create, six years later, in order that State-owned banks can lend to businesses demonstrates the failure in the past three years of the Government's policies on banks and lending to small and medium enterprises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000015#N00300","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404989400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>One of the most significant outputs of the economic crisis has been the collapse of private and public investment, and that has become one of the major causes of the length of time of the economic crisis.  From the outset, Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for stimulus.  In our response to the Fianna F&aacute;il emergency budget of 2008 we published alternative revenue and expenditure proposals and a jobs plan which set out a range of measures that could be used to ensure the SME sector received the supports it needed.  We have repeatedly stated one cannot cut one's way out of recession and our analysis has been supported by accomplished economists around the globe.<\/p><p>  Our society is firmly ensconced in the latter half of a lost economic decade.  The lost economic decade is the result of the Government's refusal, until now, to deal with the issue of stimulus and its refusal to plug the investment chasm in the economy.  Sinn F&eacute;in's economic stimulus has been proved to be correct and the Government is now finally acknowledging that it is necessary.  I spoke to one of my colleagues about 18 months ago and told them that the Government would simply have no choice but to turn around and start to take on board some of Sinn F&eacute;in's economic policies.  The Bill is a half step towards this.<\/p><p>  The real recovery will be delivered through the SME sector, which employs up to 70% of the Iworkforce.  However, that recovery will not happen until the challenges it faces are addressed.  So far, this Government has put all its eggs in one basket, the foreign direct investment basket.  We have said foreign direct investment is good and necessary and that we must pursue it.  However, there is an imbalance in the Government's economic policy and the domestic sector has been ignored as a result.  The domestic sector is the lifeblood of the economy, but the Government has failed to deliver many of its commitments in the programme for Government to SMEs.  The promised reform of procurement has not happened.  In fact, the opposite has taken place.  The roll-up of procurement contracts has further prevented SMEs from getting involved.  The Government did not listen to us when we put forward legislation to end upward only rent reviews and commitments with regard to co-operatives have been anaemic, at best.  It has also dragged its heels on progressing the potential social enterprise centre.  A social enterprise centre offers a massive alternative economic system, as is seen throughout Europe and in many progressive and successful economies.<\/p><p>  The SME sector is hamstrung by debt.  Two weeks ago we heard about the situation in Morrisseys in Carlow, a firm with &euro;8 million worth of business on its books.  It is a functioning firm but has legacy debt and the State's bank, AIB, is seeking to close down that business with the potential loss of 130 jobs.  In my county, Meath, we have lost Spicers Bakery, which had been in business since the 1830s.  The business was closed due to legacy debt.  There are thousands of businesses throughout the State in that limbo of not being able either to function properly or to take the next step of investing in the economy.  That 41% of SME loans are still in this type of distress is an example of the Government's ineffectiveness.  The Government's policy on SME credit is a dog's dinner, and it is a disgrace that it is continuing.<\/p><p>  Construction remains one of the sectors most exposed to loan defaults.  That the Government is now tackling the housing crisis on the demand side while the construction industry is still hamstrung by debt shows the problems in the Government's thinking.  The Government has also slashed capital expenditure, one of the worst decisions a government can make in a time of recession.  The meagre jobs growth that occurred has ground to a halt in the last quarter.  When consumers face another round of flat stealth taxes they realise that their disposable income will shrink so their expenditure patterns change and they withdraw from spending in the domestic market.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's ambitious stimulus proposals would get people back to work, create competitive advantages, create efficiencies and increase productivity and revenue.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, has stated our party's major objection to the manner in which this legislation is being rammed through the D&aacute;il in the week before the summer recess.  The Deputies elected by the people will be unable to have a proper input into an issue of such importance.  The Government has had more than three years to examine this issue.  It is incredible that it has waited until the last week of this D&aacute;il session to ram it through.  Deputies should be given adequate time to consult on and debate the legislation, particularly in view of the failings of the Government so far in respect of SME credit.  The microfinance system, which was supposed to put &euro;90 million into the hands of SMEs, has had a minuscule drawdown and all of the other ecosystems of credit facilities have had the same experience.<\/p><p>  In the programme for Government, the Government committed to delivering a strategic investment bank, yet neither the SBCI nor the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, is a bank.  Deputy Pearse Doherty spoke about the convoluted system being put in place, rather than simply creating a State investment bank which would be able to inject the necessary funds into the economy and the SME sector.  We know from the Central Bank that gross lending by bailed-out banks to SMEs remains static after three years.  The Minister said the SBCI will seek to address this uneven flow of credit to enterprises.  Obviously, there are concerns regarding the existing banks' buy-in and whether the low cost of the source of the funds will be passed on to SMEs.  The Minister has reassured us that this will be the case, but we have not seen the detail in black and white and what mechanisms will be used to achieve this objective.

Marginally lower lending rates, encouraging increased competition in the SME lending market and repayment holiday periods for businesses are welcome.

However, there also must be publicity, awareness and education for SMEs to ensure they can use these facilities.<\/p><p>We have called on the Government to consider making the Credit Review Office findings binding on banks and that all banks be brought into the scheme.

In the past two days, the Israeli Defence Forces have killed 50 people and wounded more than 500 in the relentless shelling of Gaza.  Their claim that they are attacking Palestinian military targets is a lie.  They are attacking family homes and refugee camps and killing women and children.  As if this brutality is not enough, they are now threatening a full-scale military invasion of Gaza.  We all know that for years the people of Gaza have been subjected to an illegal and brutal blockade.  They are now being subjected to collective punishment by the Israeli Government.  It is targeting women and children, and this is not acceptable.  It is not acceptable either to kidnap and kill Israeli teenagers, it is not acceptable to kidnap and kill Palestinian children, and it is not acceptable for the Israeli Government to pound Gaza, one of the most densely populated places in the world, with hundreds of tonnes of explosives in a matter of days.  The firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel should end immediately, but these actions cannot excuse the brutal and overwhelming military force used by the Israeli Government against what is, I repeat, a civilian population.  Diplomatic pressure must be brought to bear to bring this violence to an end and to open the way for talks.  What has the Irish Government done in recent days to help bring this violence to an end?

The Government is gravely concerned about the escalating violence and the civilian casualties we are now witnessing on the ground in Gaza and Israel following Israel's launch of a major air offensive against Hamas targets in Gaza in response to the continued large-scale firing of rockets by Hamas and other Islamic militants into Israel.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a statement yesterday in which he condemned unreservedly the indiscriminate firing of rockets into Israel, which, as the Deputy said, poses a grave threat to the population.  Equally, his statement condemned the mounting civilian casualties, including reportedly women and children, resulting from Israeli air strikes against Gaza.  The latest estimates are that more than 70 Palestinians have been killed since the launch of the Israeli operation earlier this week.<\/p><p>  Both the people of Gaza and the people of Israel have the right to live in peace and security without the threat of indiscriminate violence being visited upon them.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is closely monitoring the situation and is keeping in contact with our missions in Tel Aviv and Ramallah.  It is recommended that Irish citizens who are currently in the region or travelling there register with the Department on its website.  Those considering travelling should check the travel advice on the website which is updated regularly and Irish citizens in Israel or the occupied territories should exercise extreme caution and closely monitor developments via local media outlets.  <\/p><p>  It is vital that all efforts are now made to de-escalate the current situation and bring the current wave of violence and military action to an end.  On behalf of the Government, I appeal to all sides to exercise the utmost restraint, avoid all civilian casualties and negotiate the earliest possible ceasefire.

Whereas the T&aacute;naiste itemised a statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I put it to her that it is gravely insufficient given the seriousness of the situation and the real possibility that Israeli aggression against the Palestinian population will escalate.

This accusation has been made time and again.  Time and again, we have seen the population of Gaza pummelled and we are literally only given diplomatic rhetoric.  We need more than this.

Initially, I raised the issue of community development projects and programmes and the tendering process that could lead to privatisation, which would mean that many years of experience and insight among people and providers living in the communities and making decisions on their behalf will be undermined.  Last week, I raised issues with regard to drugs.  At the Taoiseach's request, I forwarded to him the details that I brought to the House's attention and hope they have not been lost in the various power struggles this week for positions.<\/p><p>  The common denominator in both issues is the disproportionate cuts that have been suffered in both areas.  Cumulatively, community, youth and drugs projects have been cut by 38%.  The third area affecting vulnerable communities is community education.  Such education services are provided for those who have been most disconnected from the system in their lives, perhaps through leaving school early, being long-term unemployed or being lone parents.  Community education is a powerful informal educational tool which is replicated throughout the country.  For example, in my constituency, between January and June this year, 430 people participated in accredited programmes with a community education provider.  The programmes were child care levels 4 to 6, horticulture level 5, and IT levels 3 and 4.  These areas offer great employment opportunities.  People are also enabled to progress further.<\/p><p>  Community organisations that are FETAC-accredited are legacy providers, and if they want to continue to provide accredited programmes they must engage with the Quality and Qualifications Authority of Ireland which could mean a fee of &euro;5,000 for each participant.  They do not have that money.  Will there be a fee waiver for community education providers that are doing this valuable work, as opposed to private educators that can afford to charge people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000020#S01500","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1404991200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her good wishes.<\/p><p>  With regard to the concerns about ongoing changes in community development, I agree with her that community development, whether in urban or rural areas, is tremendously important to every community in Ireland, and valuable services are provided.  Two years ago, after I became Minister, F&Aacute;S, which dealt with community development, was taken into my Department and there was a great deal of fear, with many people suggesting this could be the end of public funding of community centres, the end of community employment and so on.  I gave an undertaking in the House at the time that not only would it not be under threat but it was my intention, as resources permitted, to expand community development because of the significant role it plays, including in allowing people to return to education and training who may for a variety of reasons have not been employed for a time.  Some time after that, we had a debate during which concern was particularly expressed by the Opposition.  More than &euro;1 billion is spent by the Department of Social Protection on initiatives such as community employment and the roll-out of new community programmes such as T&uacute;s, which have been successful.  I understand there has been a great deal of concern about funding for the past seven years among all the organisations involved since the time of the financial collapse of the country.  During the seven years prior to that, a great deal of additional funding was available because of the boom, but following the review of the various elements, including the educational elements, and the development of SOLAS, I am convinced that what will emerge is a community education personal development pattern which will focus on people getting involved and, as the Deputy, who has great experience in this area, said, attaining serous qualifications such as FETAC levels 4 and 5 which will enable them to approach employers, whether in the pubic, community or private sectors.  Rather than simply saying they have been on a course, they can show they have acquired a qualification that will assist them in securing well-paid employment or progressing further to second or third level education.  I understand the concerns of the Deputy, and the Government is committed to emphasising and prioritising community investment, which is so important to communities right around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000020#S01600","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1404991200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I hope the Government will take it further and provide the &euro;5,000 waiver I mentioned, because, as the Minister said, community education is working.  I refer to two providers in Dublin Central, HACE on Henrietta Street and the Larkin Centre for the Unemployed on the North Strand.  There were 20 participants on a community employment scheme, five of whom had to drop out for various reasons.  Twelve of the participants achieved distinctions, of whom eight are going on to further education.  This is working.  Community education providers are being monitored and are engaging with everything that is required of them.  However, they feel threatened, and when I questioned the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government about this, he was unable to reassure them that they would not have to pay a &euro;5,000 fee.  They do not have that money and that is the bottom line.  If such a fee is imposed, they will have to opt out of community education.  Because the providers know their communities, they know what is working and the methodologies to use.  That is what they have used to ensure people return to full-time employment instead of having to take on part-time manual work.<\/p><p>  The providers are engaging but they are asking whether there is a cull in community education.  I take it from what the T&aacute;naiste said that she will look into this.  The providers cannot afford the &euro;5,000 fee.  Many participants do not even have the money to travel to their training.  Significant opportunities exist in child care because those who have completed FETAC level 6 are moving on.  There is nobody coming in to take those places because there is no incentive and, therefore, the child care facilities are also under threat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000020#S01700","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1404991800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Deputy's commitment to community development, which is very important.

I have discussed these issues with people from the Larkin Unemployed Centre and other community groups and organisations.  The Department of Social Protection has developed a model of talking to stakeholders and groups and we meet them regularly, for example we had a five-hour session in Dublin Castle last Friday.

This Bill is not an effort by me or my party to meddle in the planning process.  The Bill recognises that the Act of 2000, in respect of the issuance of licences for large-scale entertainment events, does not have an appeals mechanism.  Unlike other provisions of the planning Acts concerning development generally, with which we may be more familiar, in which there is the opportunity to appeal a decision of a local authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, there is, unfortunately, no such provision in the existing legislation.  The Bill provides an interim measure to allow the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to review a decision taken by a local authority and to take into consideration the facts taken into account by the licensing authority but also the economic impact of such an event not taking place and the reputational damage to the country from a tourism perspective.  The Bill provides a short-term measure to deal with the current impasse and we are prepared to accept amendments from the Government in respect of a long-term, sustainable methodology to allow for an appeals mechanism for licensing decisions.  If accepted, the legislation provides a short-term opportunity to deal with the current impasse, and I hope the Government will accept this in good faith and use it as a means to overcome the impasse in respect of this event.

All Members of the House agree that the Committee of Public Accounts has worked in the national interest very effectively in recent months, but it is hitting a roadblock.  The Bill is born out of frustration that certain areas of investigation have been stopped or delayed interminably as a result of the apparently limited powers of the Committee of Public Accounts.  A less benign scenario is that the work of the committee is being deliberately nobbled and frustrated by other committees in the House and other Members because they do not wish certain activities to be properly investigated.  I refer specifically to the investigation into Rehab and the Central Remedial Clinic.  There has been an unjustifiable delay, which continues, at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges..  Under the camouflage of legal opinion, it is not allowing us to continue to do work.  The Bill is supported by at least three members of the committee, Deputies John McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and Sean Fleming.  When it is accepted for introduction, I intend to circulate it to Government Members and to seek their support.<\/p><p>It is imperative that what we have been doing is not stopped in its tracks by legal niceties or deliberate political obstruction.  The Bill removes the Committee for Procedure and Privileges from the equation.  It allows the Committee of Public Accounts to appoint a parliamentary inspector who can examine areas about which we have concern, report to the committee in the same way as the Comptroller and Auditor General and tell us the findings in a short time.  Then, the Committee of Public Accounts can compel witnesses to appear and compel documents to be brought to us.  This is the only way around a logjam that has been put in our way, either deliberately or by accident, which is very convenient for those who do not want to see the committee do its work.  That is why the Bill is being introduced. <\/p><p>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges operates behind closed doors, issues no record of its activities, does not allow other Members to attend its meetings and does not make its minutes publicly available.  If that body is to control what happens in the House and, more particularly, within other committees, it is only right that it does not act like a politburo but in an open and transparent way so that the public, the press and other Members can react to its activities.  The Bill is compelled to address the subject by bypassing the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because of the deeply secretive nature of its activities.  I ask the House to allow us, as a committee, to appoint a parliamentary inspector to fill the gaps that may be left in legislation by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Any guidelines should be set by a body that is not the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which is totally and rigidly politically controlled, but by the Working Group of Committee Chairmen.  This means less interference in the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I ask the House to recognise the serious difficulties in which we find ourselves and the frustration and the obstacles put in our way by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and lawyers, and give us the powers to compel witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000023#V01500","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1404993000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Before I put the question, I take serious objections to the serious allegations the Deputy has made about the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which is an all-party committee and includes representatives from the Independent Members.

This will require a major cultural shift.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, mentioned that the dependance on overdrafts in this State is far higher than in other EU countries.  In order to make a cultural shift in this regard, we need to train and educate people.  The local enterprise offices now opening up around the country provide a mechanism for this.  I encourage the Government to ensure this is done.  SMEs need new, innovative, competitive and flexible credit products to grow their businesses.  We have yet to see if the SBCI will deliver on this. <\/p><p>  Since the Government introduced new lines of credit, the experience has been that these new lines have not been used enough.  Microfinance Ireland was supposed to put &euro;90 million up for small businesses to draw down, but it has yet to achieve even 25% of that objective.  As I said earlier, there is a major problem in regard to small businesses which are tied down with legacy debt.  I mentioned Morrisey's quarry in Carlow, which has &euro;8 million worth of business on its books.  It is an efficient, well organised company, but it is under threat of closure from a bank because of its legacy debts.  Also, Spicer's bakery in Meath, which had been on the go since the 1830s, was closed because of its legacy debts.<\/p><p>  Firms that are not in danger of closing because of legacy debts remain paralysed in regard to further investment, because they must service their legacy debts rather than innovate, invest, create and build.  The pillar banks and farm banks have not been up to scratch in regard to delivering credit.  Instead, at a time when we should have seen increasing credit granted, credit into the system has been static.  If private and State investment collapse, we will be caught in this lost decade for many more years.<\/p><p>  SMEs need the Government to grasp the thorny nettle of SME debt, with one out of every four loans in default and limited lending going into working capital and restructuring.  The sector needs a structural solution if the potential is to be realised.  Stimulus is necessary.  I believe the proposal in this Bill is a stimulus, but stimulus in a straitjacket.  The Government needs far more ambition in its objectives with regard to ensuring that funds get to certain sectors in a researched and balanced manner which improves efficiencies, productivity and competitive advantage for businesses in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000024#W02100","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1404993600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>We move on to the Technical Group.

What guarantee is there that those banks will play ball on this occasion?  We know from research carried out by the Central Bank that the loan rejection rate relating to SMEs in Ireland is one of the highest in the eurozone.  In 2012 - the year in which this research was carried out - the rejection rate for SME loans and overdraft applications in Ireland was second only to that which obtained in Greece.  I know many people involved in the SME sector.  The general experience of those individuals in the past five years has been that when they rang the pillar banks to discuss asset financing, on many occasions their calls were not even returned.  This is because the banks in question lack the appetite for what is required.<\/p><p>  The difficulty is that the pillar banks are interested only in maximising their profits, where possible.  They are not about providing a service.  A State investment bank would provide such a service.  It is crucial, therefore, that we should have a serious State investment bank which will be independent of the pillar banks and which will have a genuine appetite for assisting SMEs that are really struggling.  It is bad enough that it is extremely difficult for SMEs to borrow money, it is also the case that the fees charged by the main banks are actually rising.  In the past year alone, cash-handling fees have tripled from 17 cent to 45 cent per &euro;100.  That is crazy because it is giving rise to major problems.  The fees in question are a huge drag on small businesses.  The fees relating to debit cards have been increased, with 28 cent being charged irrespective of whether the transaction involves &euro;1 or &euro;1,000.  That is draconian.  A State-led bank could deal with these issues in a fair way in respect of people who are trying to keep their small businesses in operation.<\/p><p>  Most of the discussion about jobs in recent years has focused on foreign direct investment and multinationals.  We have not afforded the same priority to SMEs, which comprise 99.8% of all businesses in the country and which employ seven out of every ten people.  It is imperative that the Government should afford a much greater priority to taking care of SMEs and ensuring they remain in existence.<\/p><p>  It was good to hear the Minister of State say that in addition to SMEs, other strategic sectors could be also supported in the future.  However, it is disappointing that no detail has been provided with regard to the other areas in which the strategic banking corporation might operate.  How long will it be before it will be in a position to operate in other areas?  The lack of information does not inspire confidence in the context of the Government being really serious about establishing a proper State investment bank.  As the Nevin Economic Research Institute points out, &quot;Consideration of the role of a new state development bank takes place within a much wider debate not only about what type of banking system is needed for the future but what sort of society we seek to create from the recent economic conflagration.&quot;  Has consideration been given to allowing the new corporation to lend to not-for-profit organisations such as those which operate in the housing sector?  In the light of the State's failure thus far to roll out a comprehensive social housing construction programme, surely it would make sense to allow a strategic bank to lend to housing associations that are ready and willing to deliver affordable homes to the many who need them.  Only 283 local authority houses were built last year and this did not even put a dent in the waiting list.  It is extremely important that the State should commence a real social housing programme but it should also try to facilitate access to funding for the organisations that want to assist in filling the gap.<\/p><p>  What is the position with regard to the State's responsibility for child care?  Is there not a role for a proper State development bank to play in supporting the development of a high-quality system of child care?  Last night I reminded the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection of her promise not to cut the one-parent family payment until she obtained a credible, bankable commitment to a Scandinavian-style system of child care.  For young parents, this is both a serious issue and a key factor in deciding whether they can take up work.  Dr. Mich&eacute;al Collins of the Nevin Economic Research Institute is on record as stating, &quot;For all households with children, the additional costs associated with childcare represent the largest additional household cost associated with taking up either part-time or full-time employment.&quot;  The lack of State-supported child care is preventing some people from  participating in the labour market.<\/p><p>  If the State had direct control in respect of giving small businesses access to credit, it would lead to a massive improvement in the way we operate in this country.  I fear, however, that this new venture will not go far enough in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000025#X00500","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1404994200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>The move to establish a strategic bank is a very long overdue recognition of the failure of the banking and wider economic strategy employed by this Government and that which preceded it in the aftermath of the economic crash.  We bailed out the so-called pillar banks to the tune of &euro;64 billion, privatised some of them and beggared the country in the process.  The rationale behind doing so was that we needed these banks.  The attitude was, \"We do not like it but we need to do it because the main commercial banks are critical to economic recovery\".  Three or four years have passed and we now realise that this just did not work.  We gave the banks all the money they required and they continued to act as a law unto themselves.  They do not give a hoot about the State's rationale.  They only have one rationale, namely, to make money.  Their balance sheets constitute the bottom line.  The strategic priorities relating to our economy and the needs of citizens are irrelevant to the banks.  As a result of the realisation that has been reached, we are now obliged to set up a strategic bank.<\/p><p>  One could say it is better late than never and that at least we are doing this now.  However, having made the decision to introduce legislation to facilitate the establishment of the new corporation, the Government has imposed a guillotine.  We are whacking through this Bill in one day.  In the context of anything discussed in the D&aacute;il, this legislation is extremely important by any standards, particularly as it  will have far-reaching implications for our economy's capacity to recover.  The Bill contains provisions which will give the Minister for Finance power to guarantee up to &euro;4 billion in investments by foreign entities without having to have recourse to the D&aacute;il.  That is extraordinary.  Despite the damage done by the blanket bank guarantee, the Minister will have the power to issue a guarantee without being obliged to discuss the matter in the House.<\/p><p>  The art of political distraction currently being practised with mastery by the Government is amazing.  What are we discussing while this Bill which involves bank guarantees and strategic investments and is the result of the failure of the Government's banking strategy is being whacked through the D&aacute;il by means of the use of the guillotine?  The answer is Garth Brooks and the drama of the Cabinet reshuffle.  People have been speculating as to whether the latter would take place on Tuesday, yesterday or today and whether Phil or Eamon will be appointed as Ireland's next European Commissioner.  They are also anticipating the press conference to be given later today by Garth Brooks.  That is just extraordinary.  What the Government is doing is on a par with the distraction tactics employed by the Roman emperors, namely, give them bread and circuses while the real business is taking place.  The media, of course, go along for the ride, which is absolutely pathetic.<\/p><p>The headlines on RTE and in the media are all about Garth Brooks while something substantial like this Bill, which is about the economic future of the country and a belated recognition of a failed economic and banking strategy, is going through.  At least we are beginning to address it but there are major problems or gaps in this legislation because it is being whacked through, or, perhaps, the Minister is whacking it through with the these gaps and problems because he hopes everyone will be looking at Garth Brooks and the summer holidays and, therefore, we will not be looking at the deficiencies of the Bill and the issue of the guarantee.<\/p><p> It is good that there is a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises.  I welcome this although it is a pity the Minister will not do all the other things that the SMEs have been asking for.  It is a pity the Government is not doing something about the rates system or public contracts, which are going to multinationals all over the place instead of small and medium-sized enterprises and benefiting local economies.  It is pity the Minister does not do something about the disaster of parking charges and so on.  Unbelievably, the Comptroller and Auditor General wants to spread the disease of parking charges, which has blighted D&uacute;n Laoghaire's small and medium-sized enterprise sector, over to Howth and other such madness.<\/p><p> At least we are talking about prioritising SMEs.  The banks have singularly failed to help them, although that was supposed to be the purpose of the billions of euro we poured into those banks.  Why is this strategic bank not dealing with other areas?  KfW, the German strategic bank that will be investing in this bank has a far wider mandate than the mandate proposed for this bank and, crucially, it includes housing finance.  This week the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and all the organisations dealing with the mortgage distress have all said the insolvency legislation is failing abysmally.  They indicated that the banks have refused to engage properly with the mortgage arrears process.  There are 136,000 households that are financially crippled and, consequently, unable to participate fully in the economy or help it recover because they are in mortgage distress.  The banks are not interested in them or in the impact that their situation has on the wider economy.  Why is this bank not going to deal with that area?  Distressed loans should be transferred.  The loans of people who cannot get a decent deal from the banks should be transferred to this State strategic bank and it should give them a decent a sustainable mortgage arrears resolution for their situation.  I have tabled amendments to the effect that the mandate should be widened at least as far as that of KfW, which the Minister is proposing as a co-investor in this bank.<\/p><p> The problem is similar with the issue of housing, which, we know, is an absolute disaster.  We have seen hand-wringing from the Government on the issue of housing but no concrete action.  The key issue is that the banks are not interested in financing the type of social and affordable housing that we need, yet here is an ideal opportunity for that to be done.  This bank should have addressed housing as part of its mandate, just like the American Federal Reserve.  The issue of housing is critical.  Financing social and affordable housing is in the interests of citizens and vital in terms of the macroeconomic stability of the economy and the wider housing market.  This should be one of the key priorities and imperatives in any strategic bank but it is not included.<\/p><p> I will be dealing with the guarantee in the amendments later.  It is absolute madness.  At the very least the Minister should accept an amendment that will require any bank guarantees given to KfW or the European Investment Bank to be examined.  It seems we have to bribe these banks with guarantees although this country has been bled dry by Europe with the debt interest repayments.  We must bribe these banks with bank guarantees for them to invest into our economy.  It is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000025#X00600","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404994800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I offer a cautious welcome to the Bill before the House.  We all accept that SMEs are the bedrock of the economy.  While I welcome the foreign direct investment that continues to come to Ireland, I am concerned at a macro level at Ireland's over-reliance on foreign direct investment.  Anything that can be done to create a more robust long-term domestic sector, especially in the SME sector, is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  It is clear to anyone who has been talking to people who work in or run small and medium-sized enterprises in Ireland that they have struggled, in many cases, to get money at reasonable interest rates and on reasonable terms.  This Bill includes a mechanism for a significant amount of money, up to &euro;5 billion, to be provided at reasonable terms to SMEs and that is welcome.  I am cautious for two reasons.  First, neither this Bill nor any accompanying legislation addresses the demand for credit.  It is a supply-side Bill.  The overindebtedness of individuals and the SMEs is not addressed in this Bill - I would not expect it to be - but there is no accompanying policy to address indebtedness, an important point.  Second, we do not have enough time to get into it, unfortunately, but the Bill appears to give significant sweeping powers to any Minister for Finance.  The current powers introduced by the last Government give the Minister licence to put any amount of public money into the banking system.  This is a dangerous power that should be repealed.  While I do not have an issue with the Minister for Finance doing what is in this Bill, I believe there should be far stronger parliamentary and D&aacute;il oversight of it.  It makes me nervous.<\/p><p>  I echo some of the comments made before about the process.

It is serious stuff and there is a good deal of technicality to it.  I believe the D&aacute;il and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform could have added considerable value.  I simply cannot understand why such important legislation, which is relevant to so many sectors of society represented by Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, is getting only three hours in Parliament.  I cannot get my head around it and I do not understand it.  I believe that more scrutiny would have helped.<\/p><p>  This is not the first time the Government has tried to introduce credit.  We have seen the micro-enterprise loan fund scheme, the seed and venture capital scheme, the development capital scheme and innovation fund Ireland.  It is fair to say none of these schemes is working.  Let us consider the micro-enterprise loan scheme.  As of late last year only 224 start-up companies had applied and only 79 grants or loans had been approved.  The micro-enterprise loan fund is applicable to businesses which have already been turned down by the banks.  It is a dubious situation for a company because the bank has already decided the company is not worth investing in and then Government money may be put up to invest in it.  That money is not really being lent.  The credit guarantee scheme had a budget of &euro;450 million.  It is a sizeable policy instrument.  It has been up-and-running since October 2012.  It underwrote 75% of the risk of private banks investing in SMEs using public money.  It was expected at the time that it would distribute or facilitate approximately &euro;150 million per year.  However, in the first ten months we know it lent less than &euro;10 million.  A certain amount of money is being lent but it is fair to say that the figure is far less than it should have been.  What if this Bill, which has major potential, had been brought before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform for several days?  The finance committee is working well at the moment.  Had the committee been given the opportunity to bring in people from the SME and banking sectors to ask whether it would solve the problem, would it have helped?  The Government has tried to solve the problem in numerous ways with numerous funds and various mechanisms but none of them appears to have worked.  It is a shame not to have had proper constructive parliamentary input to the process to ensure that whatever was not working in all those other funds is address such that this time it does work.<\/p><p>  One of the reasons the previous schemes have not worked is the lack of demand-side legislation or policy being introduced.  There are ambitious supply side policies being introduced and this is one such element.  We know that many SMEs are overindebted.  Professor Morgan Kelly recently carried out some analysis and spoke to the matter.  He indicated that the upcoming European Central Bank tests will probably uncover it.  There are two areas at issue.  The first is SME debt.  For example, the classic case would involve an SME in a given town which invested in an apartment in 2005 when it should not have and, as a result, it is overindebted.  No matter how much money is offered to that company, it will not invest any more.  Then, there is the personal indebtedness issue.<\/p><p>According to a great factoid, the average age of a founder of a successful high-tech company in Silicon Valley is 39 years.  That is my age, not 22 or 25 years.  In Ireland, many of the people in or around that age are in the negative equity generation.  They do not have money.  I know many people who, in a normal economy, would be setting up the fantastic, high-tech and innovative enterprises that we want and need, but all they are doing now is trying to pay down negative equity.<\/p><p> Not enough has been done, but the good news is we know how to fix this.  I hope the Minister has read the finance committee's report on the mortgage crisis.  In fairness to the committee and its Chairman, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, that good, cross-party report goes quite far.  If its recommendations were implemented, personal indebtedness could be tackled.  Many of the people whom this Bill aims to facilitate to borrow and invest would be free from personal indebtedness or, rather, their personal indebtedness would be more sustainable.  They would be financially and psychological more likely to invest the kind of money that the Bill has in mind.<\/p><p> Although it does not relate to Deputy Michael Noonan's Ministry, I introduced an examinership Bill that was voted down.  Since its introduction, PricewaterhouseCoopers has stated that we need a non-judicial examinership process.  Such a process would be useful and, with a new Cabinet in place, it might be encouraged.  Between the examinership Bill and the finance committee's report on the mortgage crisis and, therefore, personal indebtedness, much of the demand-side challenges to this supply-side solution would be addressed.<\/p><p> I will support this Bill.  We should have had more time to debate it, as much more could have been done with it.  Please, Minister, consider the demand-side challenges.  There are solutions.  Between this supply side solution and tackling the demand side solutions, we could achieve something interesting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000026#Y00500","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404995400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I agree with my colleagues who stated that this corporation's necessity reflects the precarious nature of the Irish banks, not the great confidence that we are used to hearing from official sources.  The Minister is well aware that the formerly largest shareholder in Bank of Ireland, once a welcome shareholder but now no friend of Ireland's, recently dumped his shares on the market.  He dumped a portion of them in March declaring that he had no intention of selling any more, was locked into 90 days and, on the 90th day, sold the rest.  The lesson is that not only are those shares prey for vultures, but people who are objectively watching what is happening in the Irish banks, even people with profit motives, are doubtful about the banks' future.  The share price has dropped from approximately 39 cent to 24 cent, a reflection of the level of market confidence in Bank of Ireland, of which I hasten to add I am a small, but destitute, shareholder.  AIB has fallen proportionately to approximately 9.5 cent.  The confidence in the Irish banks that is regularly blared by propagandists on the airwaves is not shared by the international holders who found the banks a convenient vehicle for coming in, ripping off money and leaving with several hundred million euro in their pockets at the expense of the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000027#Z00200","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1404995400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>A sum of &euro;500 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000027#Z00300","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1404995400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Correct.

The fact of the matter is that I never applied for it, but the &euro;25 charge was to go straight onto my account.  When I rang the bank about it, the person who had signed the letter did not have a clue what it was about and stated that he had signed hundreds of thousands of letters.  All of those people were each charged &euro;25 for something they had not requested.<\/p><p>  Accompanying the letter was another one asking me to sign a customer consent form, although I cannot remember its exact name.  By signing it, I would have consented to AIB coming to my place of work to address my loan at any stage.  In other words, AIB could send the heavies around to Leinster House or Agriculture House at any time to embarrass me, presumably if I was running against the rules of the overdraft.  This would not have embarrassed me particularly, but that AIB would call to the doors of more vulnerable people because they gave consent in the belief that it was the right and probably mandatory thing to do is unacceptable.  This is the sort of bullying tactic that is going on and is the Government's responsibility because it owns AIB.  The previous T&aacute;naiste told me that the Government could not micromanage, but it can and it should to inject a new culture into the arrogance in AIB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000027#Z00400","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1404995400,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Especially if the Government can micromanage Garth Brooks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000027#Z00500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1404995400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Yes.

I encountered an instance of someone with a dollar account.  That is perfectly legal, but the currency it was most difficult and expensive to get from AIB, despite holding that dollar account was dollars.  If one holds a dollar account in AIB, one does not have a hope of getting dollars.  One must go to the bank, change one's dollars into euros and then change them back into dollars because that is &quot;the system&quot;.  &quot;The system&quot; is also how this House operates.  If &quot;the system&quot; says one must do something, that is it.  If one wants to change dollars into Swiss francs, Australian dollars or sterling, one is not even charged once.  If one wants to withdraw dollars, one gets charged twice.  There is still this sort of rip-off culture in the banks.<\/p><p>  I have very little time to discuss SMEs, but I welcome this attempt to address them.

In this context, the SBCI will be supportive of both domestically-focused and export-orientated SMEs.  It is being established as a private company, but it will operate with a strong public policy mandate in providing additional finance for the SME sector, stimulating economic activity and contributing to the economic well-being of the State.  As a wholesale lender, providing funds for on-lending institutions, it will enhance the supply of funding both by using existing channels and encouraging new entrants into the market.  The provision of loans designed to meet the customised needs of SMEs should also incentivise demand and build confidence in the SME sector, thereby encouraging investment in growth and employment.<\/p><p>  The strategic role of on-lending development institutions is a well established model that is both effective and successful in other markets such as Germany, Spain and France.  The SBCI does not require a bank licence to carry out the activities which have been assigned to it and there is no need to spend time or resources on a process of applying for a banking licence.  Its relationship with on-lenders will be vital to its effective operation.  As part of this process, it will design products that on-lenders will provide for SMEs.  Furthermore, it will also impose a number of requirements on on-lenders to ensure they use SBCI funding for SME financing to fulfil the purposes of the Bill.  These will ensure the actual benefits of the funding arrangements provided by the SBCI are clearly passed on to the ultimate end user, SMEs.<\/p><p>  The reporting requirements set by funders of the SBCI, in conjunction with the nature of the lending agreements with on-lenders, will also provide the SBCI and the Department of Finance with sufficient data and information to enable them to analyse and explore the effectiveness of the SBCI in financing SMEs.  Moreover, this information will be utilised to inform and shape ongoing product development to ensure the customised financing needs of SMEs continue to be met by the SBCI.  A key function of the SBCI is to finance projects which promote economic development.  It is also possible for it to provide, via on-lending institutions, financing for social and environmental projects that enhance economic development, provided they present the on-lender with reasonable repayment prospects.<\/p><p>  The SBCI is an important intervention in the SME credit market that will contribute to economic development; however, it cannot be expected to be the vehicle for addressing all policy issues, especially where such issues are already being tackled by other bodies and policy initiatives.  At the same time it is important to recognise that the SBCI, in conjunction with NewERA and the soon to be established ISIF, will collectively provide a more robust infrastructure for financing productive investment in the real economy, thereby contributing to more sustainable long-term economic and employment growth.  Achieving this type of economic and employment growth will provide not only economic but also social and environmental benefits for the country and its citizens.  The SBCI Bill is being expedited to ensure the benefits that can be achieved through the formation of a State-sponsored financial institution can be brought to bear on the Irish market without delay.  Negotiations commenced with KfW and the German authorities within days of the Taoiseach's announcement in November 2013.  In addition to trying to ensure the formation of the SBCI was arranged so as to maximise and sustain the benefits for Irish SMEs of this enhanced co-operation, the project team also opened up discussions with the European Investment Bank.  Adding another funder has meant that the SBCI can offer more liquidity to the SME market, but it also has meant more work on the establishment of the SBCI.  Arriving at an optimal solution for the start of operations which does not preclude further evolution of the SBCI has taken some time and brought us to the point where legislation has been prepared but Oireachtas time before the recess has been limited.<\/p><p>  In order to establish a company which can enter into agreements with both the international providers of finance and the on-lenders in the Irish SME market, we first need enabling legislation.  Waiting until the autumn semester to commence or complete the legislation would effectively mean that the work that needs to be done in establishing the company could not proceed until September at the earliest and the sequential actions which follow such as the establishment of a board, the hiring of staff, the signing of agreements with the international lenders, establishing internal operations, signing agreements with the on-lenders and awareness raising initiatives could not commence until October or thereabouts.  It was decided, therefore, to expedite the enabling legislation in order that additional and enhanced lending to SMEs would be facilitated this year and without delay.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that officials from my Department provided a number of briefing sessions for the relevant spokespersons of the Opposition parties.  Furthermore, the said officials also worked with the Bills Office to extend the time available for submitting amendments.  I am sure Deputies are appreciative of this effort to accommodate their input into the legislative process.<\/p><p>  On the matter of issuing guarantees, the potential exposure of the State has been capped at &euro;4 billion in the legislation and the Minister is obliged to inform the D&aacute;il of the use of the guarantee each and every time it is extended to the SBCI.  The SBCI is also to be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the effectiveness of its operations.  I expect that the SBCI will be covered under the amendments to freedom of information rules which are the subject of a separate Bill, but this is subject to agreement with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I consider, therefore, that the provisions in the Bill are sufficiently broad to ensure effective public oversight of the ongoing operations.<\/p><p>  Under the legislation, the Minister of Finance is to be the sole shareholder in the SBCI.  It is not our intention that the shares will be sold or disposed of at any time.  The SBCI will be a key element in the future financing of the real economy and contributes to our stated ambition of creating a more diversified, competitive and responsive financial infrastructure that can finance growth in the SME sector as we move to a new phase of economic recovery and growth.  State-sponsored development or promotional institutions are an integral part of the financial architecture in other countries such as Germany, Canada, France and Spain and it is recognised that they will continue to play a key role in the financing of the economy in years to come.  It is important that SMEs in Ireland have access to similar financial products available to comparative enterprises in competitor states, otherwise they will be operating at a serious competitive disadvantage.  The SBCI, with its concentrated focus on improving the supply and quality of financing to the SME sector, ensures Ireland will have in place an institution capable of supporting long-term investment in the sector.<\/p><p>  A robust, dynamic and innovative indigenous SME sector is key to ensuring sustained economic recovery and employment growth.  The establishment of the SBCI builds on the measures and initiatives already put in place by the Government to enhance SME access to finance and can be considered to be a major milestone in our continued economic recovery.<\/p><p>The SBCI is mandated to provide additional credit that is tailored to the business needs of SMEs.  In carrying out its core functions the SBCI will make an important contribution to stimulating economic activity, enhancing competitiveness and thereby generating employment opportunities for people across the State.<\/p><p> Negotiations commenced with KfW and the German authorities within days of the Taoiseach's announcement in November 2013.  The project team has moved quickly to establish the structures now being debated.  While the assistance provided by the European Investment Bank has resulted in the SBCI being able to offer more liquidity to the SME market, it has resulted in more work on the establishment of the SBCI.  Now that this work is complete, we have this opportunity to debate the Bill.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath spoke about the Bill as initiated.  The Bill enables the formation of the SBCI in a flexible manner that will allow it to develop to cover any strategic area of investment.  SMEs are singled out as indigenous growth will be necessary.  SMEs always face a structural disadvantage in funding.  <\/p><p> On Deputy Dara Calleary's point, the SBCI will demand from existing lenders and other entrants that all funding drawn down by it is used or returned to the SBCI.  The Directorate General for Competition and SBCI will require proof that the benefits have been passed on to SMEs.  Additionally, the SBCI will supply credit products that are innovative, are in no way designed with the lender in mind and in every case are tailored to the needs of the SMEs.  For example, working capital is now available but this may only be available for a 12 month period.  Term loans are also available to SMEs, typically over three years but up to five years in certain circumstances.  What we are talking about here is low interest loans that would be available for development of a company, perhaps of a ten year duration.  This fills a gap in the product market for SMEs wishing to expand and currently finding it very difficult to get the finance to do so.<\/p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty in a thoughtful speech also made a number of points.  Under the Bill &quot;other persons&quot; means that the SBCI can lend to any legal person and not only to SMEs.  Flexibility to grow and adapt is key to the architecture of this legislation.  We see it as organic.  As experience is taken on board it will grow organically to serve wider needs in the economy but the particular focus will be on SMEs.  The legislation has not only an economic mandate but a social and environmental mandate.  I will be pleased to work with Deputies on all sides of the House to extend its mandate as we see fit to grow the economy and to create additional jobs.  <\/p><p> Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n echoed a number of the points made by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  I thank Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Shane Ross and others who contributed to this debate for their support for the principle of the Bill, even though they had some limited criticisms of it.  On Committee Stage, we can deal in greater detail with some of the points made.  I take the point that the Government has been in office now for three years and that Deputies have been calling for the establishment of a strategic investment bank for a number of years.  While we committed in the programme for Government to the establishment of a strategic bank, it is only now that we have the investment capital available to put it in place.  This capital was raised in the first instance through the initiative of KfW in terms of the talks between the Taoiseach and the Chancellor and then the decision of the European Investment Bank to not only equal the funding provided by KfW but to put more in.  We also have our own strategic investment fund.  In simple terms, approximately &euro;800 million will be available in the first year and, as the company is renewed, the balance sheet should be approximately &euro;4 billion.  This money will be available to the SME sector.  In comparative terms with other strategic investment institutions across the OECD countries this is a balance sheet which is proportionate to our economy and fits the need of the economy.<\/p><p> I thank Deputies for their support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000028#AA00100","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1404996600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1404996600,"counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000029#BB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1404996600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case:(1) Deputies Se&aacute;n Crowe, Dara Calleary, Finian McGrath, Thomas Pringle and Brendan Smith - the need to ensure the full disclosure by the British Government of documentation regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings;  (2) Deputy Michael McNamara - the need for Irish Water to develop a communications strategy;  (3) Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy - the need to ensure sexual and reproductive health and rights are included as a central goal of the post 2015 sustainable development goals;  (4) Deputy Sean Fleming - the need for funding for the school meals local projects scheme for Scoil Bhride, Portlaoise, County Laois;  (5) Deputy Robert Dowds - the relationship between the National Roads Authority, eFlow and the public;  (6) Deputy Ciara Conway - the need to ensure sexual and reproductive health and rights are included as a central goal of the post 2015 sustainable development goals;  (7) Deputy Patrick O'Donovan - the need to have the current valuation process leading to the calculation of commercial rates in Limerick City and County addressed;  (8) Deputy Willie Penrose - the need to amend the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Acts 1984 to 2006;  (9) Deputy Brendan Griffin - recent attacks on staff at Kerry General Hospital psychiatric unit;  (10) Deputy Olivia Mitchell - the need to ensure sexual and reproductive health and rights are included as a central goal of the post 2015 sustainable development goals;  (11) Deputy Simon Harris - the need to give consideration for new treatments for children with Spina Bifida;  (12) Deputy Terence Flanagan - the need for Irish Water to ensure that water meters are fully accessible to those with disabilities;  (13) Deputy David Stanton - the need to begin construction on a premises for the amalgamation of two primary schools in Carrigtwohill, County Cork;  (14) Deputy Michael Conaghan - the introduction of a capital gains tax break for inactive farmers; (15) Deputy Paul J.

That is positive.<\/p><p>The focus on SMEs which is the declared priority of the Bill and is explicitly set out therein is right and proper for the reasons, as mentioned by the Minister and other speakers, that the SME sector is the lifeblood of the economy; 70% of people working are employed in the SME sector and if there is going to be meaningful economic recovery we need to help SMEs, which the banks have failed to do.  To my mind, there is an unwillingness on the part of Government to tell the banks what to do despite that we own some of them and have bailed out all of them.  Given they are clearly not doing what they need to it is right this bank should fill that gap.<\/p><p>There are other priorities, which I believe should be explicitly set out in the Bill.  The amendments in my name seek the inclusion of two other absolute strategic priorities, including address of the issue of mortgage distress.  The committee of finance, of which I am a member, was informed this week of the multiple failings of the pillar banks and mainstream banking system to properly engage with distressed mortgage holders and the MARPs process.  At a briefing yesterday with Grant Thornton and the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation we were told of the pathetic number of cases dealt with under the insolvency legislation.<\/p><p>When it was first put through, the then Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, stated that 18,000 cases would be dealt with in the first year.  In fact, only a few hundred cases have been dealt with.  The Irish Mortgage Holders' Organisation told me yesterday that 10% of those on AIB's mortgage book had to engage with it because the bank would not engage with them.  It is not capable of doing so.  The banks, therefore, are not doing what we need them to do, nor are they doing what we hoped the insolvency legislation would force them to do.  We have got to do something about this, not just because we care and should care about the 136,000 householders and families in arrears but also because it has to be a strategic priority.  The Government stated it was a strategic priority to get the people concerned participating in the economy again, but they cannot do so if lumbered with mortgage debts.  We will paralyse a very significant portion of the economy's capacity to recover unless we deal with this problem with much more urgency and speed than the banks have proved willing or able to demonstrate.  That is why the series of amendments is proposing that a priority should be to offer a way forward for those in mortgage distress where they have been unable to get a decent, proper deal, or any deal, from the banks.  It is proposed that their mortgages be transferred to the proposed bank.<\/p><p> I talked to Mr. David Hall and representatives of Grant Thornton yesterday after they had given a briefing in the audiovisual room on the whole matter.  I asked them what they thought of my amendment and Mr. Hall was certainly very positive about it.  He stated it represented a very good idea that could really work.  We obviously need to tease out the details, but there are many that need to be teased out in respect of what the Minister put in front of us.  Will it really deliver for SMEs?  We need to think about how the measure would work.  What I believe should be a strategic priority for the new bank is a no-brainer.  It is in line with the consensus on the need to make progress a hell of a lot faster and more decisively for those in mortgage distress than has been the case heretofore.<\/p><p> I hope the Minister will consider the amendments seriously.  There is a clause that refers to providing finance for those seeking to provide social and affordable housing on a not-for-profit basis.  The Government has stated it wants to see this happen, but we have not seen much in the way of concrete moves to make it happen.  When in the light of the housing crisis we on this side of the House talk about the need for a significant social and affordable housing building programme and the Government states there is a big problem of supply in the market which is creating a property bubble or the threat thereof, it seems obvious that we need a vehicle to provide the necessary finance for bodies that are willing to address this issue, be they voluntary housing associations or otherwise.<\/p><p> We should seriously encourage co-operatives.  I am always being asked by people in my area about housing co-operatives because they were a feature in the past.  Building workers and people on the housing waiting list could band together, obtain some finance and use land not being used by the local authorities to provide social and affordable housing.  The proposed bank should have as a priority the financing of such projects.  Owing to all the bloody EU rules on financing local authorities, there may be difficulties, but we must find a way, perhaps through trusts set up by or sponsored by the local authorities, to direct money towards the building of social and affordable housing.<\/p><p> These are very reasonable suggestions which I hope will receive the support of other Deputies.  Others have mentioned in their Second Stage contributions that the mandate needs to be wider.  The wider mandate has been talked about a lot in terms of the international banking system.  Reference was made to the contrast between the focus of banks in Europe and that of banks in the United States, where the banking system, starting with the Fed, has a mandate that is much wider than just dealing with issues such as inflation and the bottom line.  A key part of the mandate concerns employment and housing.  These are imperatives for the American banking system as dictated by the Fed.  We should follow suit, not that I am saying everything about the American banking system is wonderful.  We need a wider mandate, particularly for the strategic State-sponsored bank.  I hope the Minister will consider these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000029#BB00900","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404997200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.

Wilbur Ross made &euro;500 million within two years and nine months and Archie Kane, chairman of the bank, thanked him for his support of it.  He did not do anything for the bank; he wrote a cheque for his investment, which was a one-way bet.  He could never lose on his &euro;290 million investment on which he made &euro;500 million.

That was until Bank of Scotland (Ireland) under its Highland Bank of Scotland, HBOS, ownership trashed it by ballooning its funding and distributing that funding in mad lending.  It was one of about ten banks that did it.<\/p><p> This is where the appraisal should start, because it is a practical situation.  The Minister mentioned the insolvency legislation, but legislation solves nothing.  It does not solve a physical problem, a medical problem or a financial problem.  A financial problem is solved financially, by understanding the implications of the physics converted into finances.  When the physics of an enterprise make sense, whether it is to manufacture shoes, import machinery, distribute it or whatever, the financials follow.  Thirty years of working in financing physical production, marketing, distribution, importing, exporting and performance bond underwriting has taught me this.  It is worth listening to the practitioners, but the practitioners' input into this Bill is not apparent.<\/p><p> One such practitioner was here last week to discuss SME lending in Germany through the Sparkhassen banks.  Sparkhassen and the co-operative banks, together, provide 67% of all funding and lending to German households and SMEs.  It is not done by Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and other such banks; they have operations and assets created outside of Germany.  The Sparkhassen banks are local banks which take local deposits and lend locally.  They are staffed by people who are professionally trained to understand business.  At present, our two pillar banks are bereft of people who know how to assess businesses.  There are very few left and their heads have been done in.  They are depressed and demoralised by the experience of the past six years, because they have been told to repair their balance sheets.  We must get real.<\/p><p> As I have said, the aspirations are good.  I am not being negative, just realistic.  There was an unrealistic approach to assessing the provisions needed in the banks.  One had to shout to be heard, and then be ignored.  They are still short of capital.  If they were not and if they had the right management and executives to do the job, they would get on with writing down the old loans from a bloated credit pyramid that was nothing other than a Ponzi scheme.  The banking inquiry is going off in all sorts of peculiar directions and does not know where to start, but the banks' balance sheets will explain the story and provide the lessons, if they are properly explained.  It is not rocket science.  That will show where the accountability and responsibility lie, which is clearly on the desks of all the directors of all the banks between 2001 and 2008.  The balance sheets show it.  Furthermore, the culpability of the banks' boards for the creation of the asset price bubble is measurable from the balance sheets.  On average, the banking sector was 92% culpable for creating the asset price bubble.  Why is that?  The weighted average of their loan-to-deposit ratios was 173%.  That is 83% above the maximum 90% prudential level, and 83% as a proportion of 90% is 92%.<\/p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the mortgages that might be included under this new arrangement.  One could argue that a whopping proportion of the loan balances the banks say are owed by those customers are not owed by them, because the banks created the asset bubble that disappeared and left the customers with the loans.  The same applies to the SMEs.  That is really the starting point.<\/p><p> That cascades forward to the question of from where the funds came to bloat the Irish banking sector's balance sheets by such a huge amount.  They came from people who invested in the bond offers by those banks, which was a crazy decision by boards that did not understand or if they did were just greedy, stupid and malfeasant in the years between 2001 and 2008.  The funds were secured from issues and the subscriptions of the original investors, who might have been the pension funds.  Members will recall when we were told we should be careful because we might damage our pension funds if the banks have to take losses.  However, all of those original investors had sold into the secondary market, to the guys who take risks.  That is why it was wrong that the losses were imposed on our people.  It is not the vicious cycle of bank debt and national debt, but the vicious imposition of losses and its conversion into national debt.<\/p><p> Well done to Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, MEP, who, according to today's newspaper, told the new Commission President, Mr. Juncker, that we want our money back.  Brian Hayes, MEP, was also credited for his participation in those remarks, but it was Luke 'Ming' Flanagan who made it easily understood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000030#CC00800","speaker":"1183","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404997800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Please speak to the amendments, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000031#DD00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1404997800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>We should consult Mr. Niclaus Bergmann, chief executive officer of the Sparkhassen, which has 250,000 employees and 29,000 trainee managers across Germany in local and regional areas of banking.  The banks are not allowed to trespass on each other, so they understand the businesses to which they are lending.  They are lending the deposits of the communities, which give them those deposits from their savings.  It is all very sound and is probably the type of thing we should do.<\/p><p>  The SBCI is more similar to a venture capital investment bank.  It does not even have a licence to take deposits and the word &quot;deposit&quot; is not mentioned anywhere in the Bill.  It is always a good test of a bank if its sources of funding and destinations for lending have some type of correlation.  That is usually a good foundation.  The analogy is a well balanced cardiovascular system in the human body.  That is what we should have in mind.  However, that means one must do site clearance of the canvas, relieve SMEs of the legacy debt that is an impossible burden and make the banks wake up, shape up and do the work they must do, with properly trained management and executives.  Those people are available but they must be harnessed and motivated.<\/p><p>  That is the task at hand.  If one rushes off to do something that is a little too hasty, but has the appearance of being solid because it is in the presentation format of what we are familiar with, such as this Bill, one gets a false sense of security.  Experienced pragmatism should underlie whatever we do to provide finance for SMEs and households.  The households must be relieved too.  We might as well put it out there to the creditors, which is the euro system, and tell Mr. Draghi that we got it all wrong but have woken up, that the promissory bonds are all wrong and we are tearing them up and that it will be something for him to organise in his housekeeping of the euro system across Europe.

This is a convoluted way of sorting that out but I accept it was brought forward with the right intention.<\/p><p>  The housing aspect is crucial.  An issue I raised on Second Stage is the definition of &quot;other persons in the State&quot;, which the Minister said is anybody who is a legal entity.  Therefore, can there be lending to housing associations such as Cl&uacute;id and the different types of not-for-profit social housing providers through this vehicle?  The commentary the Minister made earlier suggests it can.  However, it is very clear in the legislation that this is directed particularly at SMEs.  While there is a major problem with credit to SMEs, we know there is a social housing crisis and this is a vehicle that could be made available for cheaper credit to those bodies.<\/p><p>  I would be interested to hear why social housing as a particular area is not identified within this new company structure, given that the Minister is modelling this on KfW.  KfW has been successful and now lends a huge amount of credit into the German economy and economies throughout the world, with more than half going into the Germany economy but much going to companies that have links with German companies in other countries throughout the world as well as to other programmes.  It has different structures, however.  For example, one of the banks under KfW, Mittelstandsbank, is the one which deals with SMEs.  If we examine the other structures within it, they deal with investment in housing, education and the environment.  My fear is that the Government has decided to just look at one part of this and has left out the other parts.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment identifies one of those areas, housing, but we could equally look at the others, such as education.  However, given housing is a major crisis, access to cheap credit is needed and this is a vehicle that could be used.  I believe the Government should consider supporting the housing aspect of this amendment.  I would welcome it if Deputy Boyd Barrett would explain exactly how lending to those who cannot pay back their mortgages would work in regard to solving this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000032#EE00400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1404998400,"counter":395,"content":"<p>On a point of order, what is format on Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000032#EE00500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1404998400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>The Minister responds and you will then have an opportunity to come back in again after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000032#EE00600","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1404998400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>There is a lot of food for thought in all of the contributions that have been made.  I want to say, first, that I am not in a position to accept the proposed amendments because they are beyond the scope of the Long Title of the Bill and, as a consequence, I cannot incorporate them in the Bill.<\/p><p>  Many of the contributions that have been made are very interesting but, effectively, they are a further analysis of the crisis that started six years ago, in particular the crisis brought about by personal debt and the indebtedness of the SME sector.  This Bill is not intended as a vehicle for getting people out of debt.  It is intended as an initiative for the future to ensure there is sufficient credit available to small and medium size enterprises to grow the economy, grow their own businesses and create additional jobs.  It is in a different space to the space where many of the speeches were made.<\/p><p>  I take the point made by Deputy Donnelly that it is possible to make the two ends meet.  If there are supply-side initiatives such as this, we have to ensure there is sufficient demand, and if people are totally indebted, they do not provide the demand.  However, we have the Central Bank's responsibility for running the programme on restructuring mortgages and getting people out of debt, and regular reports are brought before the House and before the finance committee in that respect.  The Department responsible for planning and housing is responsible for social housing, under the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the Housing Finance Agency is responsible for the financing of houses.  While I agree with the Deputies' assertions that more could be done in those areas, there are organisations, agencies, institutions and personnel dealing with these problems already and we have had innumerable debates about them.  Some people are critical and some are supportive, but I believe there would be a general view that progress has been made and will continue to be made.<\/p><p>   This initiative is in a different space.  This is to provide lending at lower interest rates and with different lending products to existing SMEs so they can expand, grow their businesses more rapidly, make a contribution to the general growth of the Irish economy and provide additional jobs.  Some of what they will be doing is traditional and some will be innovative in the new economy.  Any analysis of the availability to SMEs at present would indicate there are flaws in the type of products being provided, some of them to do with the interest rate charged, others to do with the length of the payback period and others to do with the fact it is very difficult  for an SME to borrow in Ireland and have a payback holiday for, say, 20 or 24 months before the repayments pick up.  As one moves from cash flow to profitability, it should be possible to design products, in the same way as KfW, that would fit the progress of a company from its loss-making early start-up years to years in the middle phase when it becomes profitable.<\/p><p>  I am not challenging any of the views held by Deputies and expressed here today.<\/p><p>I am simply saying that they are not in this space.  What we are doing here is looking to the future and seeing whether we can provide credit in new ways that would better suit the SME sector, which wants and intends to expand and whose expansion is being inhibited in many respects by the lack of credit or the fact that credit is not available in the way that best suits the needs of companies.  <\/p><p> That being said, the first priority of the Bill is to take existing SMEs with a plan to expand that requires the investment of capital and make capital available in a user-friendly way.  People will then set up new companies, many of which will be in the new economy, and credit should be available for them as well.  In respect of housing, the test is whether it is an enterprise that will be run by an SME and has an identifiable commercial return, rather than being based on the particular activity people are engaged in.  The German model is different.  There is not the same level of home ownership in Germany.  Much of the German housing supply is provided on the rental market, so obviously there are many SMEs and large housing companies that effectively provide the housing stock that people rent, and there is an identifiable income stream and commercial return.  Germany has many SMEs and larger companies in the business.  We do not have as many like that in Ireland.  We have a buy-to-let sector which is quite strong but we do not really have a construct-to-let sector, although there are signs it may be starting.  This is an area into which this credit institution could move in due course, but its primary purpose is to do what it says on the tin, namely, provide credit to existing SMEs and move on from there to new SMEs.  To that extent, I think and hope it will be successful.<\/p><p> The other types of response the Deputies are talking about, whether it is through the insolvency legislation, bankruptcy, the work of the Central Bank in restructuring mortgages or the work of the individual banks in restructuring SME debt, all run in parallel.  This is not a vehicle that is intended to support that activity.  There are other agencies and people who have responsibility for that.  Bank of Ireland says it has restructured over 90% of its SME loans that are indebted, and AIB says it is at 65%, so the percentage of SME debt being dealt with is higher than the percentage of domestic debt that is being dealt with, which we get in the quarterly reports from the institutions.<\/p><p> Another thing that is worth saying, but with which many Deputies will not agree, is that many of the problems we have had over the past four or five years are legacy problems that arose from the greatest and most disastrous recession the country has experienced and probably the greatest economic downturn since the Second World War.  There are always problems in politics.  The idea that there will be some kind of problem-free zone in a brave new world where politicians will have nothing to do is fantasy.  It is just that the nature of the problems switches.  We are in that switch year in 2014 where the problems of the future are coming strongly on board.  It is a problem of the future economy.  How do we deal with all the people who are unemployed?  How do we create jobs for them?  How do we provide the credit across the economy that is necessary in all the sectors?  How do we deal with people whose confidence is beginning to build, who feel they are entitled to some reward and whose representatives in the trade union movement will be putting in pay claims?  How do we deal with people have not received a pay increase or tax break for quite a while and who have expectations around budget time that they will receive one?  As one works out the kind of models that might be effective, one can use as a rule of thumb the idea that a share of the legacy problems are going off the agenda and being replaced by the problems of the future.<\/p><p> This is addressing the future.  It is not addressing the past.  It is not addressing legacy debt issues either in the SME space or in the mortgage space.  This is addressing a foreseeable lack of investment capital in the future to grow SMEs and the economy and, as Deputy Donnelly said, to complement what is happening with regard to foreign direct investment.  I am not saying we should replace foreign direct investment with this, but if one looks at the model of economy we have, increasingly, foreign direct investment is going into the main cities and larger towns.  The future of smaller towns is in doing what we were always very good at - agriculture, agrifood, food production and processing and tourism.  One can name the tourist hot spots all around the country.  While Dublin is very strong, there are others such as Dingle, Galway, Westport, Kilkenny and Kinsale.  One can build the industry around them.  We need a new tapestry where we modernise our traditional industry, invest in it, put people back to work and develop the agrifood and tourism industries in particular.  To service that, one needs a strong construction sector and a strong retail sector.  Of course, foreign direct investment runs in parallel but, increasingly, foreign direct investment tends to be in the larger urban areas to which quite a lot of people commute.  Foreign direct investment is not the only game in town.  Foreign direct investment is only part of how we rebuild the economy, and SMEs are absolutely vital.  They have been vital all over Europe in growing successful economies.  The availability of appropriate credit is crucial to the development of the SMEs.  It is in that space that we should be resolving the problems that are quite clearly evident now but which take us into the future, rather than constantly analysing the ashes of the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000032#EE00700","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404999000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett has no time restrictions on his reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000033#FF00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1404999000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Oh God.

I do think we need to look to the future and chart a strategic road ahead.  This is essentially what the Minister outlined with regard to prioritising investment and political energy in key areas that can form the foundations of a balanced and sustainable economic future and development for the country and its citizens.  I agree completely with the Minister on that point.<\/p><p>Karl Marx said: &quot;The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.&quot;  Stephen Dedalus made a similar comment in James Joyce's <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man<\/i>.  It is true and could not be more accurately applied to what is happening in our economy at the moment, where the past does weigh like a nightmare on the brains and lives of the living.  It is preventing us from moving down the road of the future, and this needs to be addressed if we are going to get beyond the current paralysis.<\/p><p>&quot;Paralysis&quot; is a fairly accurate term for where we are.  This is another favourite Joycean term.  <i>Dubliners<\/i>is all about the paralysis of the city and Irish society and culture at the start of the 20th century.  For the past ten years we have witnessed paralysis, more or less.  The Minister might point to the odd incremental improvement and we may agree or disagree sometimes but things are stagnant and, as a result, there is a great deal of despair and demoralisation and many people are struggling.  The reason for that is the Government and the previous Government hoped that if they put the banking system back on the rails and imposed a little more regulation and tried to influence its priorities, it would begin to inject life into the economy, but it has not done so.<\/p><p>It is not just about saying the Government was wrong and all the rest of it.  We can argue that.  I stress that my amendments fall far short of what I would propose.  If I had a choice, we would send people marching into Bank of Ireland and AIB and boot the current boards out, take control of them and tell them what to do because we funded them.  The Minister will not do that.  I can say that but, having said it, we have to move on.  I will campaign for that politically in other ways but in so far as there is a consensus regarding a strategic investment bank, which I welcome - it might be short of what I would like but at least it is pointing in the right direction - the question is what is its mandate.  It is not only a question about the past, although my amendments partly try to address legacy issues, it is also about the future.<\/p><p>I do not know what is the Government's position but the view has been expressed by Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and Independents that the mandate of the banking industry in this country and in Europe is too narrow.  I drew the contrast with the American banking system whose mandate predates the crash.  Housing and employment are key priorities of that system.  If we have rightly recognised the need for a strategic bank, surely the strategic priorities should not be only about SMEs.  That is fine, although one might ask why it is not called the SME corporation bank if that is its only priority.  I am not absolutely clear about the Minister's view on that.  I accept SMEs are a priority but is the Minister saying housing finance should not be a key priority of a strategic bank?  If so, I disagree with him not just because of the particular crisis we are facing but also, fundamentally, regarding what the mandate of such a bank should be.<\/p><p>I ask him to note the fact that KfW, the bank to which he is looking to co-invest in this bank, has housing finance as one of its key mandates and imperatives.  The very bank the Minister has involved in this process, and which presumably at some level he is trying to copy or to take aspects of what it does and import into our strategic bank, has housing finance as part of its mandate, which is correct.  Why would we not do the same?  This should be a priority anyway, regardless of our legacy problems but it should be even more of a priority because of them.  They are a dead weight on the economy and on hundreds of thousands of our citizens who are unable to participate and function in the economy properly and that is acting as a serious drag.<\/p><p>I raise a slight philosophical point.  I do not know whether Minister has ever read the philosopher Jacques Derrida.

As initiated, the Bill expresses the optimal structure for the SPCI, which will be established as a company incorporated under the Companies Acts rather than as a statutory or public company.  A Companies Acts company is more transparent than one set up by statute as it must follow the corporate governance regulations and laws of the State unless exempted under the Acts.  Incorporation also provides the Minister with more flexibility in managing the shares on behalf of the State.  Importantly, it will allow the SPCI to act on an independent basis in the carrying out of its functions.<\/p><p>It is necessary for the SBCI to act in a strategic manager, taking into account its enabling legislation, but its day-to-day operations should be independent of the Minister and the Government.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett.<\/p><p> I refer to section 12, which is relevant in this case.  In circumstances where a Minister holds shares in a company enabled or established by statute, it is usual to specify that the Minister in question may sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholding or part of the shareholding.  It is not anticipated that the Minister's shareholding in the SBCI will be sold or otherwise disposed of at any time.  Section 11(5) specifies that the Minister for Finance is to be the sole shareholder.  However, given that it is usual to include a section on the alienation of shares, it was agreed with the Office of the Attorney General that it was best to provide this section in its current form but also to specify the intention that the Minister is the sole shareholder.  This is to allow the Minister freedom of action where the proposal is appropriate and to account to the Oireachtas afterwards for his or her actions.  This is in accordance with practice whereby the Executive - or the Government - acts and is then accountable to the Oireachtas for such actions.

The funding for the institution will come significantly from KfW and it could happen that, in the course of business and after a few years, as a serious creditor to the institution KfW could exert leverage to take over or convert the funds it has lent to the institution for controlling shares.  An institution that will have a broad spectrum mandate and be predominantly focused on SME financing in the short-term, medium-term or long-term, for fixed assets, working capital or whatever and taking on housing finance, if deemed appropriate, or other objectives and if difficulties arise in the conduct of the business, the creditors may end up having a significant influence to control, to take over, to liquidate or partially own the institution.

Some of us remain sceptical about whether that will be adhered to, partly for the reasons referred to by Deputy Peter Mathews.  There can be a hollowing out of public ownership from the inside when it is financed from elsewhere.  If it is his intention that it stays public and that this is a practical way of organising it, can the Minister include, as suggested by Deputy Stephen Donnelly, something more explicit about it being retained fully in public ownership?

However, the Minister refers to section 11 in the Bill.  Section 11(5) states: \"Subject to section 12, the Minister shall be the sole shareholder.\"  Section 12 states: \"The Minister may, at such time or times as appear to him or her appropriate, sell, transfer, exchange, surrender, redeem or dispose of all or any of the shares in the SBCI on such terms and conditions as appear to the Minister to be appropriate.\"  The next section states that \"Any funds received [...]shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer and the Minister may not dispose of any shares in the SBCI without the general principles of the disposal being laid before each House of the Oireachtas.\"  The legislation seems to allow a future Minister for Finance to sell this into private ownership.  Deputy Peter Matthews made a legitimate point that foreign companies will have equity, loan calls or the various legal calls on the entity and they may be interested in taking it over.  The legislation sets out how it can be sold into private ownership.  There seems to be a contradiction between the stated aim of the Minister, and I take him at his word, and what the Bill lays out as the sales mechanism for a future Minister for Finance.  Is that interpretation of the Bill correct?  Does the Bill preclude it?  If it is his intention that no future Minister is capable of selling this into private ownership can we introduce a subclause that states that?

The Minister mentioned there would be accountability by the Houses after the event and that is the real issue here.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  If that company was to go into private ownership, it would require a resolution in the House.  It would require legislative change.  What we are saying is that if the Minister does not want to change the law, he should at least require a resolution in the House that gives him the democratic mandate to transfer what is a private company, whose shares are solely held by the Minister for Finance, into a variant of that, whether completely private or semi-private.  This is the key issue for me.<\/p><p> I am not as concerned with regard to whether it is public or private.  I am familiar with what the Minister has said in terms of the different rules that would apply under the Companies Act to a private company.  The key concern is that section 12 facilitates - whether that is the Minister's intention or not - the sale of the shares into private hands, and it does this without requiring the approval of the D&aacute;il.  We could have a situation where the Minister wants to sell some shares one day and more on another.  Obviously, he does not want to be required to change legislation all the time to do that.  However, he should at least seek approval of the D&aacute;il.

Anything that can be enacted in law can be changed in law.  It is not like the Constitution.

Amendment No. 3 is a simple amendment.  The purpose of the Bill is to allow for on-lending.  I believe this should be accompanied by the possibility of direct lending.  The Minister mentioned earlier that this will morph and grow into other things.  While on-lending may be the way these companies or banks provide credit to SMEs and other sectors of society, it is not the only way.  Direct lending also takes place and I believe this should be available as an option, if not for immediate purposes at least as it grows.  For example, we should provide that we can lend directly to a certain sector or project, where the loan is not required to be on-lent through another financial institution.<\/p><p>In dealing with the issues of on-lending and direct lending, I am interested to hear the Minister's views in regard to the likes of Microfinance Ireland and where it sits within this Bill.  This Bill is about small and medium enterprises, which includes microenterprises.  We already have a company or agency set up to provide credit for microenterprises, at a lending rate of 9.5%.  Is it envisaged that the SBCI would on-lend to that company, which would then lend it out at a cheaper rate or are the functions of that company going to be subsumed into this new company, which could therefore lend directly to the small and medium enterprises which have been refused credit from banks?  Or, are we just going to get rid of Microfinance Ireland altogether.  How is this going to pan out and is this going to change the structure there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000038#LL00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1405001400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>The legislation and the Minister's speech make clear that the corporation is being established as a wholesale lender.  I agree with Deputy Doherty that it would be preferable if the corporation had the capacity to lend directly to the end consumer, in this case primarily SMEs.  One of the main selling points of the Bill as presented is that the corporation will be able to increase the availability of loans of greater duration with enhanced terms and potentially at a lower cost to the SME sector.  Will the Minister elaborate on how the strategic banking corporation can ensure this happens?  In other words, if the SBCI is providing funding to the financial institutions at a relatively low cost, how can we be sure the banks are not just going to use that as a means of increasing their net interest margin?  How can we be certain an SME will be able to get a loan at a competitive interest rate, because that is the purpose of the Bill.  Will the Minister elaborate on what assurances we have the terms offered to an SME by way of loan offer will be attractive?<\/p><p>  One of the main reasons I would like to see the corporation being in a position to lend directly to SMEs is that under the system we now propose, the banks will still make the final call on any lending decision.  If a bank is risk-averse - as banks are currently - there is no guarantee that even with this funding being available from the SBCI, it will be more willing to lend to the SME sector.<\/p><p>The fact that the corporation will not have the capacity to lend on directly is a key flaw in terms of what is proposed.<\/p><p> Perhaps the Minister might outline the position with regard to the mechanics of how this is going to work in practice.  If a bank wishes to avail of some of the funding available, will a formal contractual agreement have to be entered into with the SBCI?  Will such a bank draw down a tranche of funding from the corporation and then make it available, at its discretion, to SMEs?  If the Minister could elaborate on these matters, that would be very helpful.  The Minister clearly indicated earlier that the funding to be made available to SMEs by the SBCI via on-lenders would be for investment purposes.  The critical issue SMEs face at present in the context of funding revolves around the availability of working capital.  Businesses are trying to keep their doors open and, as we know, many of them are hanging on by their fingertips.  In the short term at least, funding from the SBCI will be of no benefit in terms of the availability of working capital.  Will the Minister outline his vision as to how long the corporation will be restricted to providing funding for investment purposes and on how quickly it might provide funding, particularly in the form of working capital, for the day-to-day needs of businesses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000038#LL00700","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405002000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>From reading the Bill and the one-page diagrammatic aid circulated to Members at the beginning of Second Stage, I am of the view that the intentions here are very clear.  Whether they are adequate in terms of what is needed and answer the question as to where the economy stands in the context of SMEs is another matter entirely.  The strategic banking corporation of Ireland will essentially be a wholesale bank that will lend to existing banking institutions and any new entrants to the market.  The risk relating to the moneys that will be on-lent to SMEs will be carried by the direct-lending entities, namely, those existing institutions and any new entrants.  Deputy Michael McGrath's point to the effect that the security the banks hold at present in respect of existing loans, legacy loans and the banjaxed loans that are weighing down on SMEs is compromised is well made.  The appetite on the part of the banks to lend to SMEs is going to be dulled by that compromised security.  They will not want to ascribe to the new funds better security than that which applies in the context of legacy debt.  This will cause a problem and it brings me back to the point that the blackboard must be cleaned before any new sums are written on it.  In other words, the position with regard to mortgages and SME legacy loans must be addressed expeditiously.<\/p><p>  As I have already stated, my comments are constructive in nature.  I am all in favour of the sort of bank being established under the legislation.  ICC bank, for which I worked, was that kind of institution, but it lent directly.  ICC obtained its funds mostly from its customers but also from the EIB in the case of ten-year funds with fixed interest rates.  That was how it was designed.  The trouble with what is proposed in the Bill is that the Minister is trying to straddle two moving platforms.  On one hand are the banks, which have poor operational experience with their customers and which are trying to deal with the new requirements of those customers, and on the other is the new funding coming from new wholesale funders through those banks.  It is a very wobbly arrangement.  I am only being realistic.  The Minister must be of the view that my comments are very negatively charged.  That is not the case.  They are realistic and they need to be taken on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000039#MM00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1405002000,"counter":449,"content":"<p>As a number of Deputies have pointed out, we are dealing here with a wholesale model.  The SBCI's business model is based primarily on the on-lending model which has been operated successfully by Germany's promotional bank, KfW, and Spain's state investment bank, Instituto de Cr&eacute;dito Oficial, ICO.  The SBCI is being set up initially as a wholesale funder which will work with various on-lenders in order to minimise the overhead expenses of operations.  This is designed to get the SBCI up and running as soon as possible so as to leverage the existing networks and capabilities of on-lenders for the benefit of SMEs.  That will ensure that SMEs obtain the best value possible.  The money will be forwarded to on-lenders in tranches.  Of course, those lenders will be subject to rules and regulations laid down by the wholesale entity.  There will be contractual agreements and these will specify the nature of the product which will be on offer to SMEs and also the terms and margins involved.  As the money involved will be obtained very cheaply, the risk carried by on-lenders will be covered by the margin charged.  The wholesale entity, namely, the SBCI, will put in place a protocol that will cover that margin.  This should work reasonably well in practice.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Pearse Doherty's question about microfinance, the SBCI team will be working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Microfinance Ireland in order to identify how further demand-side solutions can be facilitated as soon as possible after the company has been established.  In other words, we will establish the company and get it working as an on-loan wholesale bank.  Money will then be lent to on-lenders such as the existing banks, which will lend in the normal way but subject to protocols set down by the SBCI.  At that point, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Microfinance Ireland will become involved in order that they can be used to deliver microfinance to small industries.  The model is fairly well worked out and it will be flexible enough to deal with any day-to-day problems which might arise.<\/p><p>  The facility will not be confined to existing lenders; new entrants to the market will also have access to it.  All funding drawn down by the SBCI must be used or returned to it.  The Directorate General for Competition and the SBCI will require proof that the moneys involved have been passed on to SMEs.  As a result, there will be no question of investment funds going anywhere other than to SMEs, which, of course, are the intended target of such funds.  In addition, the SBCI will supply credit products that are innovative, that are in no way designed with the lender in mind and that are tailored to the needs of SMEs.<\/p><p>  I am sure we will discuss this matter on many future occasions.  However, what I have outlined is the general shape and scope of and intention behind what is involved.  We will deal with any practical difficulties that arise as we proceed.  I stress that the SBCI will operate independently of the Minister for Finance and the Government and in accordance with its own mandate.<\/p><p>  The provision of credit directly from the SBCI is not precluded under the legislation.  Section 8(1)(a) will ensure that direct and indirect lending can be made possible.  The intention is, of course, to facilitate indirect lending in the first instance.  Under section 8(1)(a), the corporation will be legally empowered to become involved in direct lending subsequently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000039#MM00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1405002000,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply, which was helpful.  I wish to ask a number of follow-up questions.  Will information relating to the funding to be made available through the SBCI be highlighted, front of house, in bank branches?  Will SME customers be able to inquire about such loans in their local banks and will marketing information be available in the respect of SBCI loans and the terms and conditions attaching to them?<\/p><p> I asked about the purpose for which funding would be made available.  Initially it is for investment purposes for small and medium-sized enterprises.  For how long does the Minister envisage this will remain the case?  Is it his intention that the purpose of the funding can be broadened in scope to include meeting the day-to-day cash or working capital requirements of businesses?<\/p><p> Contracts will be entered into between the SBCI and financial institutions.  Will they go into detail about the lending criteria to be applied?  Ultimately, will it still be very much a decision of the bank on whether to lend?

The Minister said there would be engagement, but let us consider Microfinance Ireland.  It is a stop-gap option for companies that have been refused by commercial banks.  They go to this State-funded entity where the rate is 9.5%.  Now we are setting up a vehicle that will provide funding at cheaper credit rates over a longer period and offer different products that it will design over time.  The real question is whether it can fund Microfinance Ireland.  Will we see Microfinance Ireland's interest rate drop substantially from 9.5% to a reasonable rate?  Given the way it is structured as a company, will it be allowed to access the funds available from this corporation through on-lending arrangements?<\/p><p>  Forgive me if I have missed it, but I have not heard an argument against the possibility of direct lending.  The Minister has indicated that this has been modelled on the on-lending concept or practice used by successful operations in Spain and Germany.  He has said KfW will fund the company.  KfW also allows for direct lending and has several associated proposals.  It has been heavily engaged in direct lending to the wind farm industry.  A direct lending option could and should be available.  I am not suggesting it should be for wind farm energy projects but in any given area in which direct lending could be of help.  It would be of benefit to allow this to take place from the start.<\/p><p>  On Second Stage I mentioned that one of the major problems with the Bill was the lack of clarity on how it would work.  We are putting infrastructure in place without real knowledge of how it will work from the consumer's point of view.  Deputy Michael McGrath raised this point also.  If a person from an SME goes to the bank, how does he or she access SBCI loans instead of those of Bank of Ireland, AIB and so on?  What are the sureties required?  The Minister has indicated that the banks will have to assure the SBCI that the money will be lent to small and medium-sized enterprises.  We have been there and done it.  The Minister has laid down targets for lending into the economy from the pillar banks.  We have had representatives from the banks before the committee and they have told us they reached the targets set.  However, they did it by removing overdraft facilities from small and medium-sized enterprises and turning them into loans.  Let us consider the targets laid down by the Minister in mortgage resolutions.  The banks abused the system of allowing legal letters to be issued and then counted them in meeting the targets.<\/p><p>  There is not enough in the Bill to ensure lending into the economy and to SMEs.  Will what is envisaged enhance the credit facilities available to SMEs?  I simply do not understand why the concept of direct lending should be ruled out completely at this point.  How will Microfinance Ireland interact with the organisation?  Will the corporation be able to lend at low rates to Microfinance Ireland, a company owned by the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000040#NN00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1405002600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Like the discussion we had earlier, I simply do not understand why we seem to be taking aspects of the KfW model but not all of it.  I forgot to thank the officials for the briefing which was very illuminating.  If I understand the position of KfW properly, it provides products directly, but these products are also made available through other banks.  It is possible for an SME to obtain a KfW product from other financial institutions.  However, if an SME goes directly to KfW, there will be a different product from what it might obtain from the banks, given their narrower commercial focus or orientation.  KfW has a different mandate and, therefore, different products.  If we are modelling the corporation on KfW, why are we not doing what it is doing also?  Perhaps the Minister might explain why we are doing a little of what KfW does but not all of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000040#NN00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1405002600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>One of the major differences between the on-lending model through a wholesale provider of funds and what we are used to with high street banks is that the network is not in place.  We will move to set it up immediately, but the first set-up will be some type of central office, probably in Dublin.  It will not have a network of offices in every town in the country.  The obvious way to deliver money to SMEs throughout the country is to have an on-lending arrangement with the institutions that already have networks.  We will start with the established banks; then new entrants will come in, to be followed by companies such as Microfinance Ireland.  I am a little vague about the model for Microfinance Ireland because it is in transition.  It has a new chief executive.  There are major changes in the agencies assisting industry - for example, the local enterprise offices are now playing a stronger part.  The intention is that after the discussions between the new institutions and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Microfinance Ireland will be an on-lender and provide credit on much the same terms as on-lenders in the banking sector.  That would imply a reduction in interest rates from their current level.  The details have to be worked out because Microfinance Ireland is under review and the new chief executive has been put in place.<\/p><p>  Why not do it all on the one day?  We are starting something new which, as Deputy Peter Mathews pointed out, is going to be a permanent feature of the Irish financial landscape.  We hope it will be a significant investment lender in the economy for many years to come.  We hope what we are putting in place will be something like what our predecessors did when they established the IDA or one of the institutions which were very successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000040#NN00400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1405002600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>What about ICC bank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000040#NN00500","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1405002600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I hope it will be successful in that way.  In building any organisation from start-up, it is reasonable to phase its development.  While we want to empower it to lend directly, the first phase incorporates an on-lending basis.  A bank without a network must consider the logistics of direct lending.  A bank could lend directly from a head office for big projects.<\/p><p>For smaller projects, the on-lending model works best.  One of the earliest steps will be taken this summer, in that there will be marketing and promotion of the strategic banking corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  SMEs will know from where they can get SBCI loans.  Like everything else in private business, the incentive for the on-lending banks will be their profit margins.  This will largely depend on what margin is negotiated.  Due to the reduced risk for and availability of money to on-lenders, they should not charge much more than a handling charge plus a small risk premium.  We know there is a willingness among the banks to participate and the details will be worked out in the coming months.  I am anxious to get this model up and running this autumn so that actual lending to the SME sector will have taken place in 2014.<\/p><p> Although the previous measures we have tried might not have worked 100% and all of the money earmarked for SMEs in 2011 was not be drawn down, the situation improved in 2012 and 2013.  In co-operation with us, the Central Bank asked RedC, the polling agency, to examine the funding of SMEs.  The latest returns show that more than 80% of applications for investment funds from SMEs are being sanctioned by banks.  A residue is not being sanctioned, but the situation has improved substantially.  We are not claiming 100% success for any of our initiatives.<\/p><p> Regarding the Deputy's original proposition, there is also a demand-side problem with people who are indebted not wanting to borrow further.  For those who were burned badly playing in the property market, the last place they will go is near the fire again.  In general terms, Irish entrepreneurs and SMEs have become risk averse.  Many try to limit their borrowing and are working with cash only.  While this is prudent, we need SMEs to borrow, to invest, to grow their businesses and to provide jobs if the expansion we require is to happen.  This is an objective we all share.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000040#NN00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405003200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and agree it would be good to see the SBCI up and going but, at the risk of being repetitive, I will underscore my comment by asking him to whip into shape the banks' boards and managements.

In particular, some deem a competitive approach to be one that cuts jobs.  I do not agree, but this is often how &quot;competitiveness&quot; is interpreted.  In having a fully rounded set of objectives for this strategic bank, it is important to include as an informing principle an explicit commitment to create employment.  Who knows?

Obviously, it is easier to keep somebody at work than it is to create a new job.  It seems it would be useful for the Government and the strategic investment bank to be able to say to lenders that they think there are a significant number of opportunities which would create or protect employment and even though they may not be a huge boon to GDP or GNP, they would create and protect a bunch of jobs, and they think they should be lending to those as well.

I agree with the Deputy that the creation of employment is a key goal here, but enabling growth through enhanced credit provision in the economy is the more accurate purpose of the Act and the more accurate function of the SBCI, and it is this economic growth which can enable the creation of employment directly.

I do not understand that.  It is quite contradictory.  It raises the question of why we do not call it an enterprise Bill or an enterprise bank Bill, if the Government wants to focus it so narrowly.  That would be a good objective.<\/p><p>  I was chatting to a Fine Gael colleague of the Minister's outside the House who made the point that this legislation is very important in terms of the need to provide finance to the small and medium enterprise sector which is not currently available, and I replied that I totally agreed but that there are other strategic economic and social objectives which are as important for the economy and our society, and I would have thought that was what a strategic bank should be.  If it is simply an enterprise bank, we should call it an enterprise bank or a bank similar to the former ICC, which was mentioned, but I thought this was a strategic bank and that it had a slightly broader remit.  That is what the name implies, yet the Minister is narrowing its focus.  To narrow it down to the extent that the imperative to create jobs cannot be explicitly stated in this section seems odd.  To elaborate on the point I and Deputy Donnelly mentioned, the categories of growth, economic development and competitiveness in the economy are quite general and one could argue they go beyond the priority the Minister is putting on SMEs, because they are quite broad - namely, protecting taxpayers and contributing to economic development.  Therefore, why would the category of employment not be set out explicitly as an imperative, as there are things that would significantly benefit from job creation which might not necessarily be ticked under the other categories or imperatives?<\/p><p>  I am surprised that the Minister will not accept this amendment, particularly when he is saying that it is the intention of the Bill, but we just cannot say so.

He stated that the purpose of the Bill is economic growth and that economic growth and economic development are what he is talking about.  That is not stated in the Long Title of the Bill, which states that the Bill is for the purpose of \"making credit available to enterprises and to other persons\".  Under the section setting out the purposes of the Act, the only other wording is about the \"availability of credit ... to benefit the economy\".  The section goes on, and pretty much out of nowhere it states: \"to contribute to the economic development\" and \"to enhance competitiveness.\"  The Minister's response was that he liked the idea of the proposed amendment but the legal advice he got was that the category of employment should not be included in this section because it does not link back to the purpose of the Bill.  The categories of competitiveness and economic development are included in the section, but neither of these, with which I agree, are included in the Long Title.  Therefore, if the category of competitiveness can be pulled into this section under subsection (h) and is not mentioned anywhere else, surely the category of employment can be pulled in.<\/p><p>  We all talk about economic growth, and it is a good thing, but what is the purpose of it other than to get on top of our debt ratio?  It is about employment and jobs.  It is all well and good having the strategic investment bank thinking that it needs to lend money to SMEs in order to have economic development, but what is economic development?  It may interpret it as GNP or GDP, which basically means that as long as the company is investing, GDP and GNP will go up, because that is one of the five constituent parts, but if the Government is going to bring in competitiveness as an explicit objective, surely the most fundamental economic objective is not GNP growth or competitiveness but employment.  The only reason we want competitiveness is for the sake of employment.  Competitiveness in and of itself is not a thing; it is an enabler of employment.  If the category of competitiveness is included in the section, I respectfully suggest that the legal advice the Minister has is flawed and that including the category of employment would not just be a nice thing to do in terms of the legislation but would actively allow whoever ends up running the investment bank to say to a bank such as Bank of Ireland that it has given the bank a tranche of &euro;500 million and it expects to see some very smart investments which result in the creation of jobs.

We are speaking about a company that is being established to lend money to a bank which is regulated by the Central Bank and will lend vast amounts of money to customers throughout the country and in other jurisdictions.  This money will be sizeable in amount but only a small fraction of the overall lending of the larger institutions.<\/p><p>The problem is that although the banks may be contractually bound to report to the company demonstrating the funds they accessed were lent to X, Y and Z in the SME sector, this arrangement may not work unless there is an institution with an overall picture of what is occurring.  We have seen the unfortunate behaviour of some financial institutions that twist, bend and contort the rules to ensure the arrangement is in their own financial interest.  Therefore, the appropriate agency to ensure oversight and ensure the spirit of this legislation is being adhered to is the Central Bank.  It is only the latter that will have the potential to gain access to all the information.  For example, it could ascertain that a product developed by the SBCI is not just supplementing lending already taking place within a bank.  Perhaps the Minister's intention is that the company will just provide cheaper credit and not more credit to the SMEs such that those availing of credit today might be able to avail of different forms of credit, with different term loans and at cheaper rate.  This would be a failure considering the aims of the legislation.  Not only should different types of credit be available through different products - the Minister mentioned some of them, including holiday payments, longer durations and cheaper credit - but more credit should be available for SMEs.  The company itself will not be able to adjudicate on that.  Only the Central Bank of Ireland will be able to determine whether all of the funds made available by the company to a financial institution have been lent to SMEs.  It would be able to determine, for example, that 50% of the funding replaced existing funds lent to SMEs and thus did not increase the flow of funding.  A broader approach is needed involving the Central Bank in some way.  I am not sure what the phraseology should be in the legislation, but the Central Bank should have a role.  I do not trust the banks and I believe we have enough evidence to show that when rules are applied, it is the job of some of the very senior staff in banks to discover how to comply with them in a way that maximises profit or, at least, minimises the loss of profit to the bank.  Therefore, the banks may comply with the letter of the law but not the spirit.

Nowhere in the legislation does it state that lending must be &quot;additional&quot;; it actually just refers to making credit available.  That is probably a good example of how the Minister's intention in drafting this legislation is not reflected in the text.  If one examines the stated purpose of the legislation, one will note it is to encourage the giving of credit in a prudential manner to enterprises, etc., and that it does not say anything about additional lending.  It refers to &quot;availing of credit and making credit available through on-lending to enterprises&quot;, &quot;the making available of funding for the provision of credit to enterprises, particularly SMEs&quot; and to availing of sources of funding.  It does not state &quot;additional credit&quot;.  It is clearly the intention of the Government and this House to ensure that additional credit will be available, but rules are rules.

Perhaps there is an argument for stating that not all the funding needs to be additional and that some of the credit might simply be credit made available in a more flexible way.  Some SMEs are availing of credit at this point in a way that is making them unsustainable, so access to credit in a new manner envisaged in the legislation might make them sustainable or increase their activity, thus leading to a spillover in terms of economic development and job creation.

Given that we are dealing with on-lending to institutions that may have targets laid down for them by the Central Bank and that may or may not be meeting those targets, it is important that some transparency is brought to this, that the debt restructuring targets are disclosed and published and that performance in meeting those targets is published on a quarterly basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000045#SS00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405005600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of D\u00e1il","time":1405005600,"counter":522,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000045#SS00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1405005600,"counter":523,"content":"<p>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders or the order of the D&aacute;il of this day, that a division demanded on the Second Stage of the Court of Appeal Bill 2014 tomorrow, 11 July 2014, shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday, 15 July 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000045#SS00800","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405005600,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Bill 2014: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Remaining Stages","time":1405005600,"counter":525,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000045#SS01000"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405005600,"counter":526,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 6:In page 6, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:&ldquo;(2) Following the passing of this Act the Minister shall direct the Central Bank to publish the SME debt restructuring targets for banks and the performance of the banks in reaching these targets on a quarterly basis.&rdquo;.-(Deputy Pearse Doherty)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405005600,"counter":527,"content":"<p>First, the proposed amendment is well beyond the Long Title of the Bill.

In June 2013, the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto long-term forbearance solutions.  The targets set reflect the banks' capacity and processing systems.  The Central Bank has informed the officials in the Department of Finance that the banks have reported that they have met their required targets to date.  This perspective has been re-affirmed by both the IMF and the European Commission, who report that the work-out of SME arrears is progressing and that imposed targets are being met.<\/p><p>  Recently published results from the covered Irish banks indicate that both banks are well advanced in restructuring their SME loan books.  Bank of Ireland's most recent published results indicate that it has reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases.  Similarly, the AIB results indicate a resolution level of approximately 65%.  It is also worth noting that defaulted loans for both banks have reduced year on year.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank's process of assessing financial institutions in their efforts to move the stress tests of re-borrowers onto longer term sustainable solutions is an important element in assisting SMEs to potentially transition from a distressed to a more sustainable state, and will continue in 2014.  Additionally, the Government's decision to fast-track legislation to allow small companies, as defined by the Companies Acts, to apply to the Circuit Court for examinership and the ongoing work of the Credit Review Office, which has been given an expanded remit, are all initiatives that will assist viable SMEs in addressing their debt situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000045#SS01400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1405005600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>In case I missed it, does the Minister believe these targets should not be made public?

I am sure the Minister of State will have some positive information to impart.<\/p><p>  Carrigtwohill was a village and is now a town between Cork city and Midleton.  Because of the Cork area strategic plan, CASP, and the opening of the rail link to east Cork a number of years ago, a lot of zoning was done in Carrigtwohill, the population of the town increased dramatically in recent years and there are plans to increase it even further.  There are three schools in Carrigtwohill, two primary schools - a boys school and a girls school - and a secondary school, St. Aloysius' College, which is also a girls school.  They are very successful schools but, at this stage, the two primary schools are chock-a-block with students.  I believe there are close to 900 students between the two of them, although the Minister of State might have more up-to-date figures, and there are prefabs stacked on top of prefabs at the boys school.  The Minister of State has visited these schools, as I have, and will know they are excellent schools.<\/p><p>  A number of years ago, an agreement was made to amalgamate the two primary schools and build one new primary school.  For some time, work has been ongoing to locate a site in order to build these new schools.  I understand funding is in place and everything is ready to go, except a site is needed.  This has been ongoing for a long time and it is now reaching a critical point in that the schools are really and truly at breaking point because there is no space left in which to put any more prefabs and the number of children is set to increase in the next year or two.<\/p><p>  I know the Department and the Government have decided that a new school is going to be built.  I also know there are plans to build a mixed second level school in Carrigtwohill, which is badly needed.  A survey was carried out among parents and I believe it is to be an ETB school, in conjunction with the Bishop of Cloyne, which is fine and is what the majority of people wanted.  <\/p><p>  What is needed now is some action on the ground.  I urge the Minister and the Department to redouble their efforts to acquire a site, get planning and have these schools built.  Two schools are needed, a new primary school, which is an amalgamation of the two existing primary schools, and the new secondary school.  My understanding is that when this new primary school with 24 classrooms is built, it will just about accommodate current numbers so, even as we speak, we may be looking for another primary school.  Perhaps the existing buildings could be used for other educational purposes.<\/p><p>  This is now more than urgent.  A very welcome extension is underway at the CBS secondary school in Midleton, a project worth over &euro;3 million, and that school is planned to increase to 1,000 students.<\/p><p>It is the same in St. Colman's Community College in Midleton, where another extension is planned, and other schools in east Cork.  The big issue here is that east Cork is developing.  Since the rail link was established, a lot of land has been zoned, many houses have been built, many young families have moved in and many children are coming on stream who need schools and education.  A lot of work is ongoing there in east Cork but Carrigtwohill urgently needs attention and needs new buildings for the amalgamated primary schools and the secondary school.  Having said that, we probably need another primary school to be planned for Carrigtwohill because even if a 24-room school is built now, it will be inadequate to cater for what is there as we speak let alone what is coming down the tracks, pardon the pun, in a little while.  <\/p><p> I am very interested to hear what the Minister of State is going to say on this.  He might give us an idea of what the timescale for construction of the schools is once tendering has been completed and how big this proposed secondary school might be when it goes ahead and the plans for that.  Is the Minister of State confident that the timescale laid down with construction to start in 2014-15 will happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000046#TT01600","speaker":"978","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405006800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter.  Both Deputy Stanton and I are playing as a tag team in respect of this issue because it is pertinent to our constituency.  The area referred to has been identified by my Department as one of the areas where due to demographic changes it is projected that there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  I think Deputy Stanton first identified the precipice that has been reached in respect of those demographic issues in the first instance.  Since that time, we have been working together to get these projects over the line.  We have had success particularly in respect of Midleton and the Gaelscoil at Mainistir na Corann.<\/p><p>  Building projects for five primary schools, one of which involves the amalgamation of two existing schools referred to by Deputy Stanton, are proposed for the Midleton and Carrigtwohill areas to meet demographic growth.  Scoil Chlochair Mhuire and Scoil Mhuire Naofa are existing boys' and girls' primary schools currently operating on separate sites in a combination of temporary and permanent accommodation.  A project to deliver a new 32-classroom primary school building in Carrigtwohill is planned to facilitate the amalgamation and expansion of these two schools, as Deputy Stanton has outlined.  The Department has approved additional temporary accommodation for both of these schools to meet their interim needs for September 2014.<\/p><p>  In addition to this particular building project, a further four building projects are proposed that involve three primary schools and one post-primary school in order to meet demographic growth in the area.  There will be a new 16-classroom school building to replace an existing temporary school building for Midleton Educate Together national school, Midleton.  The site acquisition is ongoing at present.  I have already referred to the new 24-classroom school building to replace an existing temporary school building for Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann.  This is going through the rapid planning process as we speak.  The Deputy has also referred to the possible need for another primary school because of the demographic challenges.  In that regard, a new 16-classroom primary school with patronage to be decided will be built and a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school is due to be established under the patronage of Cork ETB involving the Catholic Bishop of Cloyne.  <\/p><p>  The Department, with the assistance of Cork County Council, has identified and is currently engaged in the site acquisition process for the primary and post-primary school projects in Carrigtwohill referred to by the Deputy.  Once sites are acquired, the school projects concerned will be progressed immediately through the architectural planning process.  I want to assure the people of this area and Deputy Stanton that I as a Minister of State in that Department am personally overseeing those projects.  The Deputy and I have discussed the commercial sensitivities around specific sites.  Given that we have had some success so far in respect of Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann, an issue that went on into its second decade, and the fact that the planning process has now started, I am confident we will continue to give this top priority in respect of Carrigtwohill.  I can assure the Deputy and the people of that area that we are working on this on a daily basis and we will continue to work, if I dare say it, as a tag team on the Government side of this House to deliver these necessary projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000047#UU00200","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1405006800,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response, which was very positive.

Given that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport represents the neighbouring constituency on the north side of the Liffey, he may have received complaints as well.  I would be interested in hearing his response.  From the answer I received from eFlow arising from a parliamentary question, I understand there is quite a comprehensive customer service mechanism in place but at the same time, problems arise from time to time.  In a particularly extreme case, a constituent of mine whose licence plate had been cloned by individuals engaged in criminal activity was charged for journeys the constituent definitely did not make.  It was extremely difficult to get eFlow to deal with this issue.  Eventually, it did deal with it but we had to involve the garda&iacute; who had to prove that this was correct.  Even when it was proved, eFlow was still very reluctant to resolve the issue, although it was resolved in the end.<\/p><p>It was incredibly difficult but I appreciate that is a rare occurrence.<\/p><p> However, the system is too inflexible with automated responses being generated without any reviews by staff who could exercise their common sense.  That causes difficulties for motorists.  What is the relationship between the NRA and eFlow in the context of oversight?  I understand the implementation of individual national roads schemes, which provides for tolling, is a matter for the authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007.  Is a service level agreement in place that contractually requires eFlow to deal with customer queries in a timely and efficient manner?  Has the NRA power to require the company to do so?  What is the position regarding informing customers that they have failed to pay a charge?  It is my understanding that within two months, a person may face a fine of more than &euro;150 and a court appearance without realising it.  One of the key issues I would like to address is the need for eFlow to remind somebody who may have forgotten to pay a charge to do so.<\/p><p> For a road that is travelled by so many people on an infrequent basis, more could be done to make the public aware of the importance of paying tolls and customers who fail to do so more quickly should be contacted in order that they do not face excessive charges.  Could a warning system be provided for those who forget to pay the toll?  The penalties mount up quickly.  If one crosses the toll in a car and does not pay the &euro;3 charge by 8 p.m. the following day, the charge is immediately doubled and it increases by &euro;41 if it is not paid within 14 days after that.  Ideally, no one should end up in a court case like a constituent of mine recently and a warning system would ensure the deadlines are met.<\/p><p> What are the procedures regarding foreign-registered vehicles?  I understand special numbers are in use to receive calls in this regard.  What powers has eFlow to track down the owners of vehicles registered abroad?<\/p><p> Where do eFlow's profits go?

I have responsibility for overall policy and funding relating to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the NRA under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Furthermore, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads such as the M50, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007.<\/p><p>  The Roads Acts authorise the making of by-laws to deal with the operation and management of a toll road and to deal with various operational matters.  By-laws for toll roads generally specify who is to be liable to pay a toll and the different levels of tolls for different types of vehicle, regulate the way in which payment is to be made, specifically require the payment of the appropriate toll before a vehicle may use the toll road and impose that obligation on the driver of the vehicle and provide that failure by a person liable to pay the toll is an offence.<\/p><p>  Since 2008, a barrier-free tolling scheme called eFlow operates on the M50.  This allows all motorists to pass through the toll at motorway speed, with their journeys and consequent liability to pay a toll being recorded by the barrier free system that has been put in place.  The principal types of road users are a tag holder, whether issued by eFlow or some other tag issuer; a video account holder where a camera at the toll booth recognises the pre-registered registration number of the vehicle and charges the account by reference to the registration number of the vehicle; and an unregistered road user where he or she has until the following day at 8 p. m. to pay the toll at any Payzone outlet, online or by telephone.  The tolls payable vary depending on the category of user.  There is significant signage on the approach to and from the M50 toll point indicating tolls are in place.  Every effort is made to ensure motorists have an opportunity to comply fully with the toll system and there are a variety of ways such as telephone, online, pre-pay and shops with Payzone logo to pay the legally due tolls.  I understand that a guide for tourists using any of the Republic's 11 toll points is available on the eFlow website.<\/p><p>  The NRA has established an enforcement policy to assist in the recovery of unpaid toll charges and fines and the prosecution of all toll evaders of Irish or foreign-registered vehicles.  An effective enforcement policy is necessary for barrier free tolling to work.  Sanef ITS Operations is the operator of eFlow on behalf of the NRA.  It is a customer focused e-commerce business with more than 2 million customers and I understand it handles approximately 45 million transactions per year, making it one of the largest customer operations in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Moving from a toll plaza facility to barrier-free tolling was a significant change not just for Ireland but also within Europe.  The M50 motorway was the first European barrier-free toll system that catered for all vehicle types.  Other European countries had only implemented barrier-free toll systems for HGVs.<\/p><p>  Prior to the introduction of barrier-free tolling on the M50, traffic in 2007 had reached 90,000 vehicles per day, almost three times the original forecast level.  Major traffic congestion was frequent, with delays of up to an hour at peak times.  The free flowing system which was introduced as a result of the M50 upgrade has led to increased efficiency, faster journey times and increased capacity for motorists.  The M50 is Ireland's busiest road, with more than 110,000 vehicles passing along it each day.  Traffic analysis undertaken as part of the widening scheme of the past few years suggested that, by 2023, many sections would have traffic flows in excess of 200,000 vehicles per day.  As such, it is important and vital that the M50 can perform its function for the foreseeable future and barrier-free tolling is a key component of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000048#VV00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1405007400,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Could a warning system be introduced for motorists who forget to pay the toll in order that they are contacted because that is one of the key issues I raised?

I have no chance of getting a call, and I do not think the signal works in here.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise the issue.  It came to me from a constituent whose son, for whom she was the carer, had passed away.  The carers are very important and the work they do is vital to ease the burden on our health services.  Deputies on all sides appreciate the work they do.  From this perspective, the respite care grant is payable to all those who receive carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance or prescribed relative's allowance and is a very welcome payment.  Approximately 57,000 people receive the respite care grants each year, a total of more than &euro;800 million in 2014.<\/p><p>  The payments were made recently, in early June.  The cut-off date was 5 June, and there is a six week grace period during which one can receive the respite care grant.  However, if a person passes away just before the six-week period, his or her carer receives nothing.  It seems slightly unfair that a person who passes away on a Thursday would not receive the grant while a person who passes away on a Friday would.  Could we consider a phased payment of the very helpful respite care grant?  Why was the first Thursday in June chosen as the payment date when the legislation was enacted in 2006?  Could we phase in a payment for those affected by the cut-off date?  Notwithstanding the difficult economic times, given that the carers do significant work for society by looking after people in their homes could the grant be increased?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000049#WW01000","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1405008000,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  As the Deputy said, we acknowledge the crucial role carers play in society.  In 2014 the estimated Department expenditure on various supports for carers will be almost &euro;886 million, comprising approximately &euro;557 million on the carer's allowance, &euro;21.5 million on carer's benefit, &euro;122 million on the respite care grant and &euro;105.1 million on domiciliary care allowance.  I welcome the opportunity to highlight one of these key supports for carers provided by the Department, namely, the respite care grant.<\/p><p>  The grant was introduced in June 1999, at which time the Department of Health also paid a respite care grant to people receiving domiciliary care allowance who were not in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit from the Department of Social Protection.  The domiciliary care allowance scheme transferred to the Department of Social Protection in 2009 as did responsibility for the related respite care grant.  In 2005 the stand-alone respite care grant was introduced for all full-time carers.  All respite care grants are now administered by the Department.<\/p><p>  Although the grant is not subject to a means test, applicants are not eligible for the grant if they are working more than 15 hours per week outside the home, if they are getting a jobseeker's payment or if they are signing on for credits.  There is no obligation on carers to use the respite care grant to access respite services.  The value of the grant stands at &euro;1,375 and this year it is estimated that the grant will be paid to some 87,000 persons at a cost of &euro;122 million.  A person caring for more than one person receives a grant for each person for whom they care.  The grant is paid on the first Thursday in June of the relevant year to cover 52 weeks from this date.  As it is an advance payment, the type of circumstance to which the Deputy referred is already covered.<\/p><p>  The grant is not paid on a proportional basis and in order to qualify a person must, in addition to other criteria, be caring for at least six months.  The mid-year June payment date allows carers to avail of respite over the summer months, facilitates the administration of the grant and ensures that the grant is targeted at those providing full-time care over a significant period of time.  In a review of the grant undertaken by the Department in recent years, carers were asked about their preference regarding payment.  The options of splitting the grant into two or three payments through the year were put to people and the vast majority of respondents, 84%, indicated that they would prefer no change to the current arrangements.  This view was prevalent irrespective of age group, social welfare status, gender, location, number of care recipients or marital status.<\/p><p>  In favouring the current annual payment, people expressed the view that a large lump sum would be more likely to be used for a specific purpose, such as a holiday, whereas smaller sums paid more frequently would be more likely to be absorbed in the day-to-day expenses of the household.  In general, respondents stated that they were very pleased to receive the grant and that it was very helpful to them in easing the financial stress they had been experiencing.  Those who used the grant for a holiday generally felt that the break would not have been possible without the grant.  People who use the grant for other purposes, particularly to pay regular household bills, considered that the grant eased their financial worries generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000049#WW01100","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1405008000,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive reply.

Investigations have been frustrated by misdirection and lack of co-operation right up to today.

Those atrocities resulted in the highest number of casualties on any one day during that very difficult era commonly referred to as &quot;the Troubles&quot;.  The UVF, a loyalist paramilitary group, claimed responsibility for the bombings, but there are credible allegations that elements of the British security forces colluded with the UVF in the bombings.  Some years ago, the Oireachtas joint committee with responsibility for justice affairs called the bombings an act of international terrorism.  Six years ago, the then Government Chief Whip, Pat Carey, moved a motion on the matter which received the unanimous support of all parties and Members in the House.  A similar motion was also passed in May 2011.  By way of the motions, the House requested the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents held by the British Government relating to the atrocities that occurred in this jurisdiction and which were inquired into by Mr. Justice Barron.

Only a few short weeks ago, we saw the 40th anniversary of the savage bombings in Dublin and Monaghan which resulted in the tragic loss of life and injury referred to by the Deputies.  On that day in May 1974, three bombs exploded around Dublin during the busy evening rush hour, including one not far from where we are now.  Approximately 90 minutes later, another bomb exploded in Monaghan town.  As a result of these brutal bombings, 33 people were killed and over a hundred people suffered injuries.  While the passage of 40 years may have eased the pain of the families of those killed and injured to some small degree, we must always remember that they have had to bear the consequences of their injuries and the grief of those tragic events.  Their suffering has not gone away and the memory of their loved ones lives on with them and will do so forever.<\/p><p>  The late Mr. Justice Henry Barron carried out a detailed and painstaking inquiry into those awful events and, indeed, other atrocities between 1972 and 1976 in which so many innocent people lost their lives.  Related matters were also investigated by a commission of investigation led by Patrick McEntee SC.  While acknowledging co\u00adoperation received from the British authorities, both the Barron and McEntee inquiries concluded that they had been limited somewhat by not having access to certain British Government documents which may be relevant to their terms of reference.  This House and the Seanad have unanimously called on the British Government to make this documentation available.  It is a matter of regret that, to date, it has not proved possible for access to be made available to such documentation as may exist.<\/p><p>  As he has stated to the House, the Taoiseach has raised the matter directly with the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron.  The matter has also been raised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers.  The Government remains in discussions with the British Government in support of the families' request for access to documentation.<\/p><p>Dealing with the legacy of conflict and facing up to the past is not an easy task and there is no ready formula of words or set of actions that can put things right.  The House will be aware that work is ongoing to try to find ways to address the legacy of conflict in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> Although there is no easy resolution to the complexity of addressing the past, as is clear from recent events in Northern Ireland, the Government remains strongly committed to working in partnership with the British Government and with the parties in the Northern Ireland Executive to find a way forward.  It is a challenge that the two Governments and the Executive are determined and willing to undertake.  That said, it is also a challenge that all of those who were party to the conflict must also be willing to take up.<\/p><p> The Good Friday Agreement recognised the special position of victims and, in remembering the victims and their families, we should be strengthened in our resolve to construct a changed society in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  As we seek to build a better future for all communities on the island and those who live on the neighbouring island, we cannot forget those who died, those who were injured and those left behind to mourn the loss of their loved ones.<\/p><p> As in the past, this House is unanimous in its message to the British Government to make the relevant documentation available.  I hope we can also send a message of solidarity to the families of those who were so tragically killed in Dublin and Monaghan and to the families of all those who lost their lives in the conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000050#XX00600","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405009200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>In the past, we heard what could not be done and today we want to hear what can be done and what the Minister will do.

In his good work undertaken and completed in 2003, Mr. Justice Barron referred to the clear collusion that occurred with some British State security forces in assisting the UVF in those desperate atrocities and other murders.

The disease is serious and affects many species, but larch is particularly susceptible to it.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine issued a legal disposal notice instructing Coillte to carry out felling at Gougane Barra.  The decision was not taken lightly.  It was important to take it in order to limit further spread of the disease, which was found in various parts of the forest.  <\/p><p>  I believe it is important to point out that the forestry inspectors from the Department took samples from the forest and sent them for analysis to two separate laboratories, the Department laboratory in Backweston and the Coillte laboratory in Wicklow.

I am not a scientific expert.  I am open minded on this and do not assume the worst, but I believe one of the things missing in regard to this is consultation, particularly in regard to the cutting down of 16,000 trees in a national park on what appears to have been a preventative basis.  Subsequently, there has been some controversy over whether this was necessary.<\/p><p>  I am sure the labs say it was necessary.  However, one thing Coillte is bound by, with its eco badge, is a commitment to public consultation on any significant action affecting the forests in its care and stewardship.  As far as I am aware, there was no public consultation about this action, which has had such a huge impact on Gougane Barra, which is one of our most important national forests.  Therefore, there are still questions to answer, but we can discuss them when we get on to the issue of the public consultation and the importance of having the most robust system of public consultation for dealing with forests.<\/p><p>  Much of the Minister of State's response to the proposal made in my amendment centred on the fact that with special areas of conservation and so on, our concerns are covered in terms of the protection of ancient woodlands.  However, the point that has been made to me is that what we are missing are specific management plans for the remnants of our ancient woodlands.  We need this because of their incredible importance as a crucial part of our heritage and as a genetic bank of biodiversity.  We do not have this genetic bank with industrial forestry, which is mostly based on species that are cloned or imported, which are, therefore, genetically weak and more vulnerable to disease.  Our native ancient woodlands are a genetic and biodiversity storehouse of our forests.  Therefore, we need specific management plans to protect them against possible dangers and threats such as disease.  That is the reason for these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000052#ZZ00500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405009800,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405009800,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 is in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, but as he is not present it cannot be moved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000052#ZZ00700","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405009800,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405009800,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<blockquote><b><\/b>In page 6, line 19, to delete &ldquo;0.1 hectare&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;0.5 hectares and five metres in height&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>Deputy Ferris sends his apologies and has asked me to take his place here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000052#ZZ00900","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1405009800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that on Report Stage, the first contribution is unlimited, but a second contribution is restricted to two minutes.

As I already stated on Committee Stage, for international and national reporting requirements Ireland has defined a forest area as being at least 0.1 hectare as described in the Bill.  We are committed to using the same forest definition for reporting to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The Food and Agricultural Organisation definition may use 0.5 hectares, but countries reporting to the FAO can use their own definition, with Ireland having adopted the use of a 0.1 hectare threshold.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting that a number of other member states, including the UK, use the 0.1 hectare threshold for reporting purposes under the UN framework.  Some other countries define forest areas at a lower threshold than 0.1 hectare, for example, the Czech Republic and Austria.  Changing the definition would mean that all carbon stocks previously reported to the UN would have to be revisited, as well as an estimate being provided to the European Union in regard to projected levels of carbon sink.  The 0.1 hectare threshold is also the minimum area where consent is required for all proposed afforestation projects as described in Ireland's forest consent assessment regulation 2010.<\/p><p>The area definition should also take into account the fact that this Bill describes trees as either inside our outside forests.  If the threshold were lowered, it would mean that all areas below 0.5 hectares could be removed without either a licence or a requirement to replant.<\/p><p> From the point of view of Ireland, with its historically low levels of forest cover, it is important to record as many forests as possible.  Reducing the threshold would facilitate deforestation and result in a potential loss of biodiversity.  In many cases, small woods interlink with and adjoin the massive network of hedgerows in Ireland and are an integral part of our landscape.  As stated previously, my Department has provided grant aid since the early 1990s in respect of broadleaf woodlands which meet the threshold of 0.1 hectare.  Many important areas of woodland along rivers and valleys are small in size, and an upward movement in this threshold could result in their being deforested and in no replanting taking place.

They go to the heart of what I and people concerned with the future protection and development of Irish forestry and woodlands believe to be quite central to this matter - namely, putting in place a proper definition of what constitutes sustainable forestry.  Such a definition would inform both the Bill and our overall approach to forestry.  The highest standard of definition that has been laid down in this regard is that which is contained in the forest principles adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which took place in Rio in 1992.  Those principles make for fantastic reading because they provide a real sense of the multiple values and downright importance of forests and trees.<\/p><p>In the day-to-day rush of life, work, stress and pressure, what is happening with our forests might not seem of immediate importance.  However, the 1992 principles set out - in a wonderful way - how existence on this planet is dependent on forests, which are the lungs of the world.  Our failure to protect them has probably been the single biggest contributory factor to climate change.  Forests regulate both climate and weather, and massive deforestation have not helped in that regard.  The World Cup is taking place in Brazil at present and the destruction of the equatorial rain forests in that country is a threat to the existence of humanity.  An area of trees equivalent to that football pitch is cut down each day by people who either do not understand or do not care about the value of forests not just to the people of Brazil or the indigenous tribes that live there but to the entire world.  If we do not do something to protect these forests, the whole planet will be under threat.<\/p><p>What I am talking about is not a matter for the long-distant future.  The impact of deforestation is apparent in events that are having an adverse impact on people in this country.  I refer, for example, to flooding.  Our native forests were cut down as a result of successive waves of British invasion and colonisation and we have done relatively little to replant them.  This deforestation did considerable damage to the cohesion of the soil in this country.  In so far as reafforestation has taken place, it has been industrial and monocultural in nature and the focus has mainly been on planting Sitka spruce rather than native species.  That has contributed significantly to soil erosion, to the acidification of soil and rivers and to silting, all of which have an impact with regard to flooding, disease, etc.  In general, the fertility of the soil has been adversely affected.<\/p><p>I do not really want to do so but if I were to argue the matter in the context of economics, I could state that there would be huge potential - from the point of view of the economy and job creation - to expand activity in respect of the planting of native species way beyond the level that has obtained to date.  Up to now, we have been far too focused on a particular industrial model of forestry that has failed on all sorts of levels.  We are not meeting our afforestation targets and we were recently obliged to revise them.  We are failing to diversify our afforestation activities by increasing the number of native species we could and should plant.<\/p><p>The Rio principles set out why all of the matters to which I refer are so important for society and culture and refer to the importance of striking a balance in the context of social, economic and environmental concerns.  They are vital to understanding the impact of forestry on many levels.  The definitions contained in the principles were developed in Rio and it was a fantastic achievement on the part of all involved that they achieved a consensus about the vital importance of forestry.  In such circumstances, it would seem sensible that the definition to which I refer should be inserted into the Bill in order to inform both it and how we deal with the process of forestry.<\/p><p>In 2009, Mr. David Gunning, the former CEO of Coillte, when giving evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts, stated - I stress that it was not me or some environmental fringe group which did so - that, from many different points of view, the traditional forestry model used in this country was no longer viable and had to be changed.  However, that model has not been changed in the interim.  A major difficulty with the Bill is the fact that the review of Coillte, the largest owner of forestry in the country, has never been completed.  This is because the Forestry Act 1988, under which Coillte was established and which predates the Rio principles, has never been amended.<\/p><p>There is no review.  We have not received the review - it was never completed - of what is going on in Coillte.  The Bill that governs Coillte, the biggest owner of forests, does not take into account the Rio forest principles in terms of environmental protection, the importance of biodiversity and the multiple uses and value of forestry.  That seems to follow through in some of the thrust and bias of the objectives of the Bill.<\/p><p> I am hoping to insert these definitions of sustainable forestry from the Rio forest principles.  There is still too much of an emphasis on the narrow industrial or commercial view of forestry.  I use the term &quot;narrow&quot; because in arguing for the Rio principles and a more holistic view of forestry development I am not arguing against developing the economic potential or value of forestry.  I am trying to explain that we have had too narrow a view of them, with an industrial approach based largely on one species.  It has not really worked and is potentially damaging and threatening to the future of the forestry sector overall.  If we really want to develop the economic, employment, tourist, amenity, biodiversity and heritage potential of forestry, we need to have a more balanced and sustainable long-term view, rather than a narrow focused industrial view.  The Rio forest principles set the balance correctly in the most comprehensive way and better than any other forum.  That is why they should be included in the Bill.  That is the argument.  As we signed up to them, why not include them in the Bill?  I do not see any reason not to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000053#AAA00800","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405011000,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett.

In 2012 my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, published Our Sustainable Future: A Framework for Sustainable Development for Ireland.  More recently, he published the general scheme of the climate action and low carbon development Bill 2013.

It includes a commitment to continue support for the sustainable development of the forestry and forest product sectors.<\/p><p>  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett has brought forward amendment No. 5.  There is no universally agreed definition of sustainable forest management.  Sustainable forest management is not a fixed concept.  In Europe the most widely accepted definition is that developed by the FOREST EUROPE process.  Ireland has integrated the FOREST EUROPE definition with its national forest standards.  Discussions are under way in FOREST EUROPE on the criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management and to facilitate the evaluation of progress towards attaining that end.  Further to recent communications from the European Commission on a new EU forest strategy, discussions have been initiated at Council working party level and at the standing committee on forestry on the possibilities of applying sustainable forest management criteria to all uses of forest biomass.  The outcome of these discussions will, undoubtedly, have a bearing on any future evolution of the definition of sustainable forest management.  Given the foregoing, I continue to take the view that there is no need to include the definition of the Rio forest principles of sustainable forest management in the Bill.  The sustainable development of the forestry sector is sufficiently covered.<\/p><p>  Coillte has signed up to the concept of sustainable forest management through Forest Stewardship Council certification.

It is not legally binding, but we signed up to it.  Therefore, there is agreement on the issue.  This consensus is unprecedented at an international level on the nature of sustainable forestry.  It is the most comprehensive statement on the matter and brilliant.  My fear is that there is a reluctance to sign up to it in legislation because it would tie us to the sustainable forest model we need and that this might infringe on certain vested interests who have no wish to sign up to the model.  That concerns me.<\/p><p>  It is not as if everything is well in the forest, to use a pun, when it comes to the forestry sector.  We are failing to meet our targets.

Whether a forest is managed so as to maintain its full multiple value is a matter for the forest's owner or manager.

As in the case of many of the amendments I submitted, I stress in respect of this amendment the need to develop our native organic forestry which has been massively depleted in favour of deforestation, in the first instance, and in so far as we have started to recover forestry in Ireland, it has been too focused on an industrial and monocultural module and too narrowly focused on the idea of developing its economic potential.  This amendment proposes a different model and approach which recognises the multiple values - the environmental value but also the economic, social and cultural value of recovering and regenerating our native species and woodlands.<\/p><p>The Minister of State in his last response spoke about wanting to encourage people to take up forestry and to use land that is not being used for other purposes, and I agree with him completely on that point.<\/p><p>I do not want to do anything to discourage this.  What we need to do is create an understanding among people of a slightly broader view of what the forestry sector can be and how, if we embrace and develop that broader concept, everybody can be a winner, including the environmentalists, farmers, the economy, rural communities and even urban communities which should also develop forestry.  Everybody can be a winner in terms of job creation and the development of much more community-based forest-related industries rather than industrial processes and so on.  That is the thrust of many of my amendments, including this one.<\/p><p> The value of forestry has not been fully grasped.  When the case in this regard is presented, people immediately see the value of it.  This was evident in the huge outpouring of concern about sale of Coillte's harvesting rights.  When people thought about it, they came to the view that our native forests were important to us but that we did not think about them most of the time.  The more one thinks about and understands forestry, as I have come to do in the past year or two, one realises we are not getting it right.  We need to radically shift what we are doing if we are to make forestry sustainable and develop its enormous economic potential.  It will take a more holistic view of forestry to develop that potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000056#DDD02100","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405012800,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's positive attitude to forestry.

Many people do not appreciate forestry until such time as they come to understand the business of forestry, trees and the environment.  I would welcome a debate or legislation in this area in the future.  However, what we are doing in this Bill is trying to encourage people with marginal land to become involved in forestry because of its economic benefits, particularly in rural areas.  There is huge potential for the creation of jobs.<\/p><p>  A few weeks ago I visited a wood-related industry on the Cork-Kerry border.  It employs 1,000 people, 200 of whom were only taken on during the past few months.  There were no press releases or announcements, but the company is now exporting to the UK market.  There are great benefits to be gained in forestry and there is a need for a huge change of mindset.  I would welcome and encourage this and acknowledge that this is the thrust of many of Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's amendments.  I would welcome the opportunity to debate the issue int the future.  <\/p><p>  On amendment No. 13, continuous cover forest involves the use of harvesting systems and natural regeneration to promote uneven aged forest stands and continuous tree cover more typical of natural forests.  The use of continuous cover forests, although not widespread, is practised to a small extent in a number of areas in Ireland.  While there is little experience of continuous forest cover in Ireland, in recent years there has been an increasing interest among many forest owners and forest professionals in these forest management systems.  As forest estate matures and forest diversity increases a trend towards more continuous cover forest management systems in Ireland is likely.  While I accept that continuous cover systems should be encouraged, I must also recognise that other forest management systems such as clear felling and replanting also play an important part in the sustainable management of forests.<\/p><p>  It would not be appropriate to promote in primary legislation one forest management system over another.  The function of the Minister should be to promote all forest management systems as long as they are compatible with good forest practice.  This is provided for in section 5(c) which empowers the Minister to promote good forest practise within the forests and forest-related sectors.  The provision already provides the Minister with sufficient powers to promote the range of management options available to forest owners, ranging from continuous cover forest systems to clear felling and replanting systems.

What happens if the forestry sector in Ireland which has the potential to create jobs and so on is suddenly hit - it is very vulnerable to this because we are so focused on one species and one approach to forestry - by a serious disease that wipes out a substantial portion of our currently economically valuable forestry?  That would be a disaster and it could happen given what happened in Gougane Barra.  The point about this approach and specifically promoting and upgrading the importance of developing this type of forestry system is that it is more resistant because it encourages a greater level of biological diversity and, therefore, a type of immune system against threats, diseases, bad weather and so on.

People could learn from one another.<\/p><p> A farmer must make living and an investor in forestry does not want to be burdened with unnecessary regulations that might hamper his ability to make a living.  Sometimes, perhaps, environmentalists need to understand that.  Perhaps they do not fully appreciate it all the time.  Equally, farmers sometimes do not fully understand the knowledge and value environmentalists could bring to developing forestry to the benefit of everybody.<\/p><p> Over the past year or two I have been forced to learn a little about forests, given the campaign we are involved in.  I learned about agro-forestry and how planting native species on the boundaries of land used for growing crops or grazing cattle enriches the fertility of the soil on that land, thus benefiting the produce.  Therefore, there is a double benefit.  One is not only developing forestry, because there are also spin-off benefits  at all sorts of levels, including for the farmer and environment.  The land being used for a more conventional agricultural purpose benefits.  Perhaps this is not always fully appreciated.<\/p><p> These are examples of where more buy-in and participation from NGOs, concerned community groups and other stakeholders could actually result in the development of forestry to the benefit of everybody.<\/p><p> With regard to information, let me return to the subject of Gougane Barra.  There is suspicion about this matter.  I do not know whether it is justified, but there seems to be a lack of information on the basis for the decision that was made.  I submitted a series of questions, prompted by people concerned about the matter, and slowly information began to trickle out.  Should a decision as big as this not have been subject to the making available of much more information?  Should there not have been much more pre-consultation such that everybody would understand that action would have to be taken if there were a very big threat?  On the basis of evidence to prove certain action is necessary, everybody could be satisfied.  That has not happened in this regard and, therefore, there is suspicion and a bit of a cloud.  I do not know the truth of the matter but I contend that there is concern and some suspicion.<\/p><p> If this Bill is to help develop forestry, it must recognise these problems and set out to achieve an improvement by having a more robust regime for giving information to the public on what is happening with forestry.  The public should be involved in decisions on the planning, management and development of forestry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000057#EEE00700","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405013400,"counter":666,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 21 is similar in intent to amendment No. 16.

We are moving towards a more  enlightened model of community participation, not one based on the type of consultation we have always been talking about.  The Government and industry are learning that if people are involved from the very beginning, one ends up with better decisions and outcomes.  This is because the choices are more informed.  Amendment No. 21 would simply encourage openness such that information would flow freely to people, and it would ensure people were involved at each stage of decision-making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000058#FFF00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1405013400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I do not see the need for amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 21.  Consequently, I do not propose to accept them.  There is already legislation in place that entitles citizens to information on forestry and to participate in forestry planning.  I remind the Deputies that my Department, like all other Departments, is a public body that allows access to information on the environmental regulation, which allows members of the public to request environmental information held by public authorities.  This places an obligation on public authorities to be proactive in disseminating environmental information to the public.<\/p><p>  Under the European Communities (Forest Consent and Assessment) Regulations 2010, my Department is already required to consult stakeholders and the general public when deciding whether to grant consent for afforestation and forest road projects.  My Department is also an authority for the purpose of the European Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes) Regulations, which require the Department to carry out a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, of any proposed programme for forestry and to consult widely and facilitate public participation during the process.  In this regard, I announced on 10 March the formal signing of a contract to carry out, among other things, an SEA of the new forest programme for the period 2014 to 2020.  The SEA process includes consultation with all stakeholders, including environmental NGOs.  The first round of stakeholder consultation on the proposed measures for the new forest programme for 2014 to 2020 has already been completed, and further consultation on the environmental report and revised forestry programme will commence shortly.  My Department already publishes and disseminates a wide range of information on forestry, including statistics and information on the condition of Ireland's forests.  Deputies may recall that only last December I announced the publication of the main findings of Ireland's second national forest inventory.  This information, along with more detailed information generated by the inventory, is available on the Department's website.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, section 5(j) of the Bill already provides the Minister with the general function of collecting and disseminating information and statistics on forests, forestry and forest-based industry.<\/p><p>  I agree that we need to involve people.  The point Deputy Boyd Barrett made about trust between landowners and environmentalists is good.  Trust certainly needs to be built up.  I see regularly in my rural constituency the lack of trust that exists.  There would be many fewer objections to projects around the country if more information were shared and there were more trust among the various groups.  As Deputy Colreavy rightly pointed out, we are moving away from the era of not giving out information.   The information is available.  When I was a public representative on the other side of the House, I was often critical of the Department and various public bodies not giving out information but now that I work in the Department I see it from a different angle.  Public officials are quite intent on giving out information they have to hand.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of Gougane Barra and the lack of trust.  Last night, when I went straight to the departmental officials, everything was forthcoming.  There was no hiding of information.  The Deputy has tabled parliamentary questions on this matter and I read them and the answers.<\/p><p>A great deal of information was provided and there was no hiding.  With regard to what happened in Gougane Barra, nobody took that decision lightly.  The decision was taken on foot of two tests reports from two independent bodies.  I have the two reports with me.  They directed the Forest Service, which directed Coillte, to carry out an operation that was needed for the future of the forestry industry and to protect the trees of the country.  That is what happened.  The information is in the public domain for everybody to see.  I have the two reports and they are available to the public.  It was not nice to have to cut down the trees but it had to happen for the reasons outlined in the two independent surveys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000058#FFF00300","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405014000,"counter":669,"content":"<p>We are probably on the same page in terms of trying to move the situation forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000059#GGG00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1405014000,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000059#GGG00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1405014000,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I do not dispute that matters are progressing and that, hopefully, we have moved substantially from the era when decisions were made at the top and people were seen as a problem and an obstacle.

This is not to cast aspersions on the people in Coillte, but there is concern about them being the owner of all of these forests and a concern that when many decisions are being made, people outside do not really know what is happening.  That criticism comes from many different sectors.  There is an imperative to overcome that and to have real information flow and real participation, not just consultation.
