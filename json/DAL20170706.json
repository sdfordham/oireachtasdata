I have already had the opportunity to appear in front of the committee to discuss the latest quarterly report on Rebuilding Ireland.  It was a good engagement and I want to thank individual members of the committee who were very generous with their ideas and time outside of the committee.  This opportunity for statements on the latest report is very welcome.  To those Deputies not on the committee, I would like to direct them to my opening statement at the committee.<\/p><p>I would like to use this opportunity to discuss the report, as well as some broader issues relating to Rebuilding Ireland.  Rebuilding Ireland is an excellent plan, and I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, for the time and effort they have put in to it, together with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  A lot of work and detail has gone in to designing the framework for providing new homes and it is already showing progress, be it in rent pressure zones, where the latest data shows us a stabilisation in these zones on rents that were quickly escalating, or the new build activity that is underway.<\/p><p>There has been an increase of almost 40% in planning permission applications year-on-year to March 2017 and an increase of almost 40% in commencement notices year-on-year to March 2017.  There has been an increase of roughly one-third in the connections to the ESB grid in Dublin year-on-year to March 2017.  There has been an increase in the number of homeless families and individuals who have been given homes since the plan was launched.  More than 3,000 homeless individuals found sustainable solutions in 2016 and roughly 1,200 families prevented from having to stay in hotels or were moved out of hotels to better and longer-term accommodation in the past 12 months.  <\/p><p>  Rebuilding Ireland is working.  In respect of any new policies or any new direction that a Government might take, it is good practice to review those policies and plans from time to time.  That is what I have been asked to do by the Taoiseach.  He has asked me to review Rebuilding Ireland within three months, to identify additional measures, to assess the need for greater quantum of social housing build, to consider a vacant homes tax and to examine new measures to support and-or encourage landlords.<\/p><p>  I do not claim to be an expert on housing, neither am I coming at this review cold.  I have had a particular perspective from my time in the Department of Finance this past year as new initiatives on the housing and homelessness front have come through that Department.  I have also dealt with the issue in regard to the wider mortgage and investment market that were part of my brief.<\/p><p>From my time on the banking inquiry with the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, I also have a good store of knowledge of how we got things wrong in the past as we sought to meet the housing needs of our growing population, the different incentives that were brought in to the market, the different arguments that were made at the time by the different lobbyists and interests, which had very easy access to Government, and the difficulty there was in removing these incentives when they were well past their usefulness.In terms of the current review, I have already said that I am considering all ideas and not taking any off the table until they have been thoroughly stress tested.  I do not care whose ideas they are or what motivates them.  If they work, they work.  <\/p><p>  I would like to outline some of the things I hope to address or have already addressed as part of my review.  It is regrettable that there are still too many families who are homeless living in hotels.  Living is probably not the best way to describe what they are going through and the difficult circumstances they face.  While it is much better than these families having to sleep rough, in no way is it an answer.  The target for this year was ambitious but necessary.  It drove a major effort to help families.  As I said, 1,200 families or more were assisted in the past 12 months.  My first target is to prevent families from entering hotels and find them other accommodation, including hubs.  While hubs are not a long-term answer, they are better than hotels and are only a first response.<\/p><p>An extra &euro;10 million has been allocated to build new hubs for more than 200 families.  My second target is to get those families currently in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels out of them.  Last week, I reported that of the 650 or so families in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation at the end of May, one third had been offered sustainable long-term homes, one third had been offered accommodation in hubs and one third had been offered HAP solutions.  This is progress for these families and I would like to thank everyone who has done such important work to help them.  I have met a number of these workers and volunteers at this stage and their enthusiasm and determination is to be admired.  I have also visited some of the facilities and emergency accommodation where they help so many people every day of the week.  Unfortunately, presentations of families continued in June, though the numbers were down in May which is welcome.  Exceptional cases means that some families will continue in hotels for some time because they will need tailored solutions.<\/p><p>Another issue we need to address in the review is the numbers involved.  I have already agreed to examine whether there is a better way of counting and publishing our homeless numbers.  As I have announced, we are going to stop referring to ESB connections as completions.  ESB numbers are good because they do represent new or empty homes being available, including new house completions, but the data is not accurate enough.  My Department is engaging with the ESB to see if we can get better information from it, and two groups, one in the CSO and another in my Department, are examining how we can improve our numbers and more adequately capture the completion of new homes.<\/p><p>This work may not be completed within three months.  Getting a true picture of completions is not as simple as looking at BER certificates or BCMS.  If we are going to develop a new way of counting the method has to stand up and be robust.  We have to know our numbers, and we all have to trust those numbers, in order to know where we need to go.  I am also examining how we report our numbers in the quarterly reports, because it can be confusing, as Deputies pointed out to me at a committee meeting, and our reporting mechanisms could be streamlined and simplified.<\/p><p>As for the wider numbers and targets, I am looking at these as part of the review.  If a Deputy tells me he or she does trust the pipeline or do not think it is accurate, then I have to look at this.  It would be irresponsible not to.  It is also important to recognise that the 90,000 people on the housing list will not all have social housing homes by 2021.  We will need to take a longer-term approach in addressing some of the aspects of the housing problems we face.  We also have to be mindful of building in a sustainable way.  We have to take care that, in moving quickly to address a crisis, we do not build in crises of the future, be they economic or social.  <\/p><p>As we build we have to think of more than just the numbers.  We have to think of the material, environment, location and social mix, as well as the wider and community needs and the needs of the elderly and the less abled.  We also have to think of the responsibility of the State, and we have to ask ourselves whether we should be building more.  That does not mean we are dropping our 2021 targets - they are targets, not deadlines - nor are we dropping our ambitions within Rebuilding Ireland.  It is important to have targets to drive policy and action, and in Rebuilding Ireland we have a significant and ring-fenced capital commitment of &euro;5.35 billion to providing social housing homes up until 2021.  I am certainly not dropping that; in fact, I want to increase it.<\/p><p>  I have reviewed the first draft of the vacant homes strategy.  It is very good, but it is not ambitious enough.  I will be using the current review of Rebuilding Ireland to see what new ideas we can bring to bear.  This will require engagement with the Minister for Finance.  As I have already stated to the committee, if budgetary measures are needed to reinforce the ambition, this may delay the publication of the strategy but this will not delay the commencement of work.  There is a lot of information to be gathered in order to have a targeted, effective approach but existing property interests should note that changes are coming.<\/p><p>  I am also waiting for the completion of a number of other sub-reviews, dealing with the input costs for construction, the Help to buy scheme and the tax treatment of landlords.  These are all expected to be completed prior to the budget, but may also delay publication of the outcome of the review of Rebuilding Ireland.  Again, if that is the case, the delay will only be in publication and not the commencement of the work.<\/p><p> Deputies will note that I will fast-track a provision of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill next week.  Having consulted the Ministers of State, Deputies Damien English and John Paul Phelan, it was apparent that the Bill, which is before the D&aacute;il, would not pass all Stages before the end of July.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party made a number of good proposals which we want to introduce as amendments.  As a result, I decided that it would be prudent to take the specific provision in the Bill that pertained to the extension of planning permission and have it implemented by the recess.  What this means, if the House agrees, is that on building sites on which homes are being built but for which planning permission is at risk of expiry, it will not be necessary to down tools and work will be able to continue.  This is a welcome step which I hope will be supported.<\/p> <p> Deputies will also note that since my appearance at the committee, I have signed the order that will enable planning applications to be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for large-scale housing developments of 100 units or more and large-scale student accommodation projects.  This is another welcome measure which will help to quickly increase the supply of new homes to particular demographics.  The order came into effect on Monday of this week and yesterday An Bord Plean&aacute;la held an information seminar for interested stakeholders which was well attended and, I gather, well received.  It is now over to developers to start their pre-planning discussions with both local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to get these large-scale proposals into the system and approved as efficiently as possible.<\/p> <p> New homes are being built and opened to new tenants every week.  Since taking office, I have had the privilege of visiting Annamore in Ballyfermot where 70 new homes have been provided for older persons and an additional 16 family homes have been freed up in the community.  I have also visited O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, a regeneration project which will yield more than 600 much needed social, affordable and private homes in the centre of Dublin; a project in Harold's Cross where 28 new homes have been provided; a rapid build project at St. Helena's Drive in Finglas with 40 new homes; and the Mater Dei family hub in Drumcondra which will accommodate 50 families who are currently being accommodated in hotels as a first response.  Next week I will visit a project in Ballymun with Deputy Noel Rock.  I intend to visit and monitor progress on the hundreds of social housing schemes that are advancing across the country.<\/p> <p> New homes are being built on more than 150 sites in Dublin and there are many more active sites across the country.  While this is encouraging, we need to see more activity and more homes on these sites more quickly.  More than 2,400 new social housing homes are being built.  Our constant focus has to be on supply and getting new homes built for people and families who are homeless, people on the housing lists, those who need homes and more affordable rents, first-time buyers, empty nesters who are seeking to trade down while remaining in their communities and less abled people who want supported independent living.  We must also get these homes built in different ways from the way we built them before such as using the rapid precast method which is already being employed or the so-called plug and play approach used abroad to provide homes for first-time buyers.  We need new financing arrangements to bring homes on line that will meet people's needs and also be affordable.  It was for this reason that I recently met the European Investment Bank and I will meet other finance houses in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> In addition to our focus on supply to catch up for the lost years of construction, we must also focus on how we manage existing stock and make more efficient use of land and the homes and buildings we already own.  It was for this reason that I recently met the Office of Public Works and I am examining above-the-shop living.  This is also the reason I am not ruling out former models of shared accommodation, provided we can get the standards right.  We also have to be ambitious and determined in making sure vacant homes that are truly vacant will be lived in as homes.  This may require a carrot and stick approach.  <\/p> <p> I thank Deputies again for their engagement at the committee and look forward to hearing their ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600003#A00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499332200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Housing and homelessness, as the Members and officials present know, is the most critical domestic problem facing people at this time.  Children are spending years of their childhood in hotel rooms as a result of the lack of social and affordable housing.  This is a terrible indictment of Government policy, particularly when there are more than 2,000 voids, the term used for empty and locked up local authority homes which are waiting to be refurbished.<\/p>  <p>  The housing crisis is the most serious issue facing the country and a sea change in attitude is required to enable it to be addressed.  It is no longer acceptable for the Government to make announcement after announcement when the change delivered is minuscule and the number of homeless families continues to rise.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is allowing the problem to appear less dire than it is.  Rents are soaring and the introduction of the help-to-buy scheme has resulted in rising house prices, making it more difficult for hard pressed families to afford even a modest home.  The lack of supply has also caused a substantial increase in rents, yet the Government has refused to state it will change the VAT rate for construction.  It is hard to understand this logic when the previous Fine Gael-led Government reduced the VAT rate to stimulate activity in the tourism sector when it was needed.<\/p>  <p>  Housing policy failure as a political issue was a significant contributory factor to the devastating recession we have come through.  The housing sector was left abandoned by the previous Government in a dereliction of duty.  While the housing crisis has been recognised by this D&aacute;il as the number one issue facing the country, the problem has continued to spiral out of control.  The housing issue was first described as a humanitarian crisis by Peter McVerry in 2014 and the new D&aacute;il started well by prioritising housing.  A cross-party committee on housing chaired my party colleague, Deputy John Curran, produced an excellent report while the Government formation process was under way.  This was a clear indication of the seriousness of the homelessness and housing crisis by a new Parliament.  At the time, the incoming Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, and his Government colleagues pledged their total  commitment to work to solve this problem in an inclusive and open-minded way.  We took the then Minister at his word.  However, when the Rebuilding Ireland report was launched with much public relations spin and fancy websites, we found that it was already a watered down version of the committee's report.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il decided to give the Minister the benefit of doubt because we were convinced that the magnitude of the crisis would dictate a radical Government response.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat a point I made one year ago because it strikes at the heart of the current housing difficulties.  According to the opening statement in Rebuilding Ireland, \"Housing is a basic human and social requirement\".  The House should note the deliberate use of the word \"requirement\" to give the impression of a strong commitment.  However, the use of this word falls short.  The use of the word \"right\" instead would have given the State direct responsibility for delivering housing.  If Rebuilding Ireland had opened with the line that housing was a basic human and social right, the role of the State would have been clearly and correctly defined.  The use of a rights based view can be open to being manipulated by ideologies on both the extreme left and right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600004#B00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1499332200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Let us not forget the extreme centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600004#B00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1499332200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>My approach is one of common decency and compassion.  I firmly believe the State has the responsibility to provide housing for those in our communities who cannot access it on their own.  The more housing the State provides, the less it must depend on private landlords to provide stop gap solutions.  We all have to accept that there is a social right to a home.  I am more convinced than ever that this is the essential starting point.<\/p>  <p>  By last Christmas, our doubts and concerns about the commitment of the Government to solve the homelessness and housing crisis which was escalating month on month were further increased when it engaged in showmanship by refusing to compromise on rent caps and brought the planning Bill and the Government to the edge.  I decided that, with a leadership contest imminent in Fine Gael, we would have to put up with the showmanship on the basis that the commitment to solve the housing crisis remained.  The Government even committed to specific deadlines for achieving the many great actions it promised that Rebuilding Ireland would deliver in its five pillars that contained a grand total of 84 separate actions.  While the report's statistics are great for the communications gurus to throw around, they make little difference to the children and parents who have spent more than two years in hotel rooms.  During this Fine Gael-lndependent Alliance Government, with its five pillars and 84 actions, 11 people, including children, have presented as homeless every day.  Fianna F&aacute;il took the Government at its word and we have worked in a non-party political way, as many Members have, not only to point out flaws in Rebuilding Ireland but also to suggest solutions.  We have done so because it is what people expect us to do and it is the right thing for responsible politicians to do.<\/p>  <p>  One of the major deadlines the Government had set with regard to homeless families and the use of hotel accommodation has failed.  The Minister who spoke to the nation and the D&aacute;il about his total commitment to address housing and homelessness and his personal determination to complete this task has swanned off to another Department after one year.  Since housebuilding ground to a halt in 2011, we have had three Ministers with responsibility for housing, namely, Mr. Phil Hogan, Deputy Alan Kelly and the current Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney.  It seems all of them had more conviction about themselves than they had about providing housing solutions.<\/p><p>This is the wrong thing for politicians to indulge in and it totally corrodes the people's trust in our parliamentary system.  Ministers must deliver solutions, not focus on political crisis communication.  It is also damaging to those in our Civil Service.  While they may be used to this, even civil servants must be disillusioned at watching the same old cynical political manoeuvrings at the expense of doing the right thing.<\/p> <p> I thought that the appointment of a new Minister would at least allow us to focus on the work at hand.  We were then told, however, that the new Minister&rsquo;s first task would be to review the Rebuilding Ireland report.  We were told that this would be a three-month review, despite the fact the report itself is barely a year old.  This review is political speak for avoiding responsibility.  It is a review to cover the Government in a cloak of convenience while the spin doctors dream up more slick housing slogans to roll out.  What are we doing in the D&aacute;il Chamber and at committee if not reviewing Rebuilding Ireland?  We are continuously providing honest and sincere analysis and suggestions for improvements.  By the end of this debate the Minister's review should be completed.  I understand that a new Government brings new dynamics but the Minister should stop treating the housing and homelessness situation as an exercise in crisis communications.  While this three-month review takes place, a further 954 people will become homeless.  We do not have the luxury to make this review.<\/p> <p> Three years after it was first announced, we are still awaiting the special purpose vehicle which will allow up to &euro;2 billion of credit union funds to be used to deliver social and affordable housing.  The promise to end the use of hotels for homeless families by the end of June has failed.  Today there are 695 families still living in hotels in Dublin alone.  The promise to build 1,000 rapid build homes by the end of 2017 is also going to fail.  The Government has only delivered 22 of these so far and has only identified the possibility of delivering another 177 by the end of the year.  The Government's housing construction programme consists of over 600 projects, 75% of which are for 20 houses or fewer.  Only two projects nationwide are for more than 100 units: one 100-unit project in Dublin and one for 106 units in Louth, the largest housing development on this construction programme.  Out of the more than 190,000 vacant properties identified by the Department only 800, or 0.4%, are being targeted to be converted back to homes.<\/p> <p> This is the reality of this Government's performance.  We need to get real and radical and we need to do so quickly.  There is no more time for review and there is definitely no more time for spin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600004#B00400","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499332800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We have had an undeclared crisis in housing for the last number of years. The Government refuses to call it for what it is.  What the Government is doing is clearly not working.  The homeless figures are increasing and the waiting list for housing have remained high, with 91,600 households currently on local authority waiting lists.  There are also 4,922 homeless adults and 2,777 children currently in emergency accommodation, an all-time high.<\/p><p>Once again the Government has failed to meet its target date for ending reliance on emergency accommodation.  The Government needs to do more as it is clearly not doing enough.  It is pandering to the private sector and its reliance on the market is a cause of grave concern.  At the moment average house prices across the country are almost 12% higher than this time last year.  Rents in Dublin are at an average of &euro;1,400 per month, making it impossible for people to buy or rent a house.  The answer to this is to ratchet up the delivery of social and affordable housing.  The Minister has acknowledged that we need to build more houses but what we need to concentrate on is social and affordable housing.  It is time for the Government to be more ambitious and radical in its approach.<\/p><p>The answer to the lack of social and affordable housing is straightforward.  Local authorities should be given the lead here.  Rather than relying on the private sector, the Government should provide local authorities with the funding to build these houses.  They can, in turn, sell as well as rent the properties at an affordable rate, with any moneys earned put directly back into the local authorities for housing.<\/p><p>  Co-op housing bodies, such as &Oacute; Cualann Housing in Ballymun, were mentioned earlier; &Oacute; Cualann is delivering affordable housing in the &euro;150,000 bracket and next week five of these houses will be handed over to their new owners.  I know that the Minister will be in attendance and I hope I will be too.  This is an example of how affordable housing can be delivered using local authority lands and infrastructural funds.  We need more of these, however, and there is scope for more.<\/p><p>I call for an inquiry into the price of housing and into what appears to be a cartel of price-fixing builders and setting the pace of price rises.  By any stretch of the imagination, it is clear that huge profits are being made and that some builders are sitting on lands waiting for prices to further rise.  Recent figures from the construction industry show the construction of a three-bed 113 sq. m. house, with the land and acquisition costs, is &euro;57,500.  Finance costs for the builder coming in at &euro;20,002.  This gives the builder a minimum profit margin of &euro;37,980.  These are highly inflated figures when we consider the land acquisition figures and the fact that some of this land has been sat on for many years.  Much of this land had previously been bought at knockdown prices so it is excessive to use today&rsquo;s figures for land acquisition costings.  This gives a false and inflated view of the actual cost of the land.<\/p><p>  There are also thousands of shops lying idle around the country, in some cases for 20 years or more.  We see this in my own constituency of Dublin North West.  We see shops left idle across the country.  I cannot understand why we allow this to happen as these could all be converted into liveable accommodation.  Having done an audit on vacant houses, let us now do one on idle shops and see how many there are.  I suspect that they are well into five figures.<\/p><p>In his opening address, the Minister mentioned the 200,000 or so vacant houses.  There is scope to examine some of these to see if they could be taken over by the local authorities for housing.  The latest figures also show that there are approximately 80,000 families currently in mortgage arrears and every day five families lose their homes.  This is unacceptable.  The much-discussed mortgage-to-rent scheme has delivered very little.  This is another issue that needs to be looked at more carefully as this scheme needs to deliver more than it has.  <\/p><p>NAMA's remit should have been changed a long time ago to prevent the selling-off of large portfolios of properties.  This has, no doubt, contributed to the homeless crisis and to the housing waiting lists.  The Minister also mentioned fast build houses and I know that 39 of these units will be delivered in Finglas shortly.  The timescale for this, however, has increased dramatically.  The Minister also mentioned that he planned to build another 500 or so of these units by 2018.  It is very obvious that this figure will not be met.<\/p><p>Private public partnerships have failed to deliver in the past.<\/p><p>The Minister's targets and ambition are not very good.  While the use of homeless hubs is a hell of a sight better than people being in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, such hubs certainly should not be used for long-term housing.  They should be used for the short term and we should ensure that they are only used for the short term.  It would be unacceptable for people to end up in hubs for long periods.<\/p> <p> Greater use of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, by local authorities would also help.  Many houses and places are lying idle.  They are boarded up for years and years.  In my own area alone, there are literally dozens upon dozens of them.  There is no sign of anything being done with them.  They are overgrown.  The councils are ending up with the nightmare of dealing with these properties.  We need to put pressure on the local authorities to make more use of CPOs.<\/p> <p> The senior citizens financial contributions scheme, which has not been reintroduced, should be reintroduced at local authority level.  There should be more concentration on building accommodation for senior citizens.  That would free up large amounts of housing for local authorities.<\/p> <p> Since I was elected to the D&aacute;il in 2011, five different Ministers have been responsible for housing.  That does not say to me that we are taking this as seriously as we should.  This is the worst crisis to hit this country in many years.  I am not saying that the Minister will not do his job but the previous Minister was only in his position for a year.  I hope the Minister will be here for a lot longer than that and will see this through.  It is not good enough for us to change Ministers when they are only settling in: they are only getting to know the problem when all of a sudden they are gone.<\/p> <p> The impact of the housing crisis on men, women and children the length and breadth of this country has been enormous.  Young children are living in hotels.  The issues that presents in terms of the welfare of children and families are massive.  I have met many families who have gone through the mill.  They have been dragged from one end of the city to the other with their children.  The impact this has had on them personally has been enormous.<\/p> <p> I praise the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, the different agencies and the Minister's officials who have put together the outline of a good plan.  It is a good plan, but the delivery of it and the timescale involved is key.  We are not meeting the targets and it is very obvious that we will not.  We need to build at least 10,000 social housing units a year to get us anywhere near where we need to be.  I have identified some of the problems but let us get the local authorities building housing.  The voluntary housing bodies are doing a certain amount and that is welcome but the local authorities need to deliver more social and affordable housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600005#C00200","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499333400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and Minister of State.  While I think reviewing Rebuilding Ireland is a good idea now that we have a new Minister, and I know that process is ongoing, I would be very concerned about any delays that might cause in terms of implementing the various actions which are in the programme.  Clearly there has been delay already in respect of a number of the actions, such as the rapid build programme for example.  This programme was meant to have delivered a considerable number of houses by now but it has only delivered 22, which were delivered quite early on and which were in train before the Government even came into office.  I am very concerned and I hope the Minister will not allow the various elements of the reviews which are taking place to delay in any way the necessary actions.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard I would particularly like to talk about the vacant homes strategy, which the Minister has just told us will be delayed.  We have been expecting that on an ongoing basis.  It was due to be delivered in the first quarter of this year and still has not been published.  That is a real opportunity to provide homes for people more quickly than by constructing them.  The fact that we have nearly 200,000 vacant houses in the country, excluding holiday homes, and that a large number of those are in our urban centres and in our cities in particular, is a real opportunity and there is not the sense of urgency which there should be with regard to bringing a reasonable percentage of those homes back into use, to be used by people who are currently homeless or on housing waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  If one looks at the average number of empty houses per head of population in other comparable countries, our percentage is much higher.  There are examples from which we can learn.  For example, the Peter McVerry Trust has suggested many times that there should be vacant homes officers in every local authority.  Their job would be to find out proactively why houses, homes and apartments in their area of responsibility are vacant and to produce practical proposals for bringing them back into use.  I support Deputy Ellis's comment that these proposals may well have to involve compulsory purchase orders, but there are other ways.<\/p>  <p>  I know we have schemes, such as the repair and leasing scheme and the buy and renew scheme but, when talking to those involved in the sector, I am being told that these schemes are not delivering as quickly as they should be and that elements of these schemes are causing delay and difficulty and are unnecessarily bureaucratic.  One would think that it would be relatively simple for the voluntary housing sector or the public housing sector, the local authorities, to go out and either buy and renovate these houses or to get involved in the repair and leasing scheme, but apparently there are difficulties.  Surely it should not be too difficult to iron out those problems because they are the low-hanging fruit and they are opportunities which are there.  I have seen examples of houses being bought by the local authority - in the centre of towns in particular - then being renovated by local builders and given to people who are on the housing waiting lists.  These are very practical ways in which we can provide homes for people.<\/p>  <p>  I would support the Minister if he were to bring in a tax on vacant homes.  If that is one of the reasons he is saying that he will have to delay until after the budget, let us by all means move on some of the other measures and then bring this tax in at that time.  I would certainly support it because we need the stick as well as the carrot.<\/p>  <p>  I also support what Deputy Ellis said on those interesting statistics about the cost of building.  The construction industry is telling us all the time that it cannot afford to build because there is not enough of a return and that it has to factor in the cost of building, the cost of the site, the cost of borrowing money and so on.  The fact that the Minister has a background in finance should enable him to figure out whether these arguments are true and to challenge the construction sector.  The Minister has said that he will fast-track the legislation on existing permissions.  There is existing permission for more than 20,000 homes in the Dublin area.  Why are they not being built?  There is a demand, particularly in the greater Dublin area.  I hope the Minister will challenge the construction sector in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  On some of the other issues, it is a huge disappointment that the target for families in hotels has not been reached, particularly for people who are living in hotels with their children and who have been telling their children that they will get a home.  Even if it is a hub, it is better than a hotel.  They are now realising that will not happen.  I will be introducing a Bill next week in respect of the rights of children of families who are homeless.  This Bill will ensure that what happened recently, where families were sent to Garda stations and one family slept in a park, will not happen again.  I hope to introduce that Bill next week.  The rapid delivery has clearly also been delayed.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to refer to the fact that my colleague in the Seanad, Senator Kevin Humphreys, is introducing a Bill in respect of Airbnb.  While Airbnb is clearly a positive for short-term rentals in some cases, it is causing displacement.  Homes are being used on a full-time basis where they could be available to families.  That needs to be addressed as well.<\/p><p> I am particularly anxious to stress the opportunity that exists for the construction of mixed tenure estates, including significant numbers of social housing units, in the more than 700 publicly owned sites.  Public funds are being spent on infrastructure for those sites.  I strongly urge that the private building sector not be allowed to profit from those publicly owned sites.  There is a real opportunity to have a mixed tenure of social housing, affordable rental and affordable purchase on the sites.  I was disappointed with an interaction we had with the previous Minister about these sites during the last Question Time with him.  It appears that each local authority will have to devise its own plan for each site and bring it to the Department for approval.  That could drag on for years.  I strongly urge the establishment of a national affordable housing scheme or a national approach to these sites.  The control would be in the public sector and builders could tender to build the houses in those areas.  There should be a requirement for a certain percentage for each of the different sectors of social, affordable, affordable rental and so forth.<\/p> <p> This is a great opportunity.  The State owns these sites, rather than them being privately owned, so it can drive the process.  Given the crisis that exists, the State must drive this, not sit back and rely on the private sector which clearly does not wish to build until a significant profit can be made.  It is understandable that it has to make some profit-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600006#D00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499334000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Deputy's party is supporting it on the councils.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600007#E00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1499334000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We are not.  The glass bottle site is a good example, and I have heard people from the local community speak about it.  In that case Labour Party councillors worked with the local community and 25% of that site is allocated for social and affordable housing.  We must use that opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  I also ask the Minister to examine the scheme introduced by Deputy Alan Kelly.  Under that scheme, if a council was building 15 or fewer social houses and it was costing no more than &euro;2 million, the council only had to get one permission from the Department.  It did not have to go back and forth repeatedly.  As far as I know, there have been only two developments under that scheme.  The scheme has real potential because local authorities own many small sites.  The Minister should also re-examine the length of time it takes to get permissions for social housing in terms of the interaction between the Department and local authorities.  Again, there are opportunities in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister is re-examining the way units are counted.  There is something significantly wrong when we do not know how many houses are being built.  Using ESB connections clearly does not work.  I have seen data from Dr. Lorcan Sirr, who has analysed the data and appears to have an accurate picture of the number of houses.  The Minister said he is listening to people on all sides.  Dr. Sirr and other experts have relevant information.<\/p>  <p>  When will the Minister review the rent pressure zones?  Limerick is still not included despite large increases in the cost of rent.  That is also the case in Waterford and other areas.  Will the Minister also extend homeless HAP outside the Dublin area?  There are many homeless people in other cities throughout the country.  They cannot get homeless HAP, although there might be some exceptions.  That would be an opportunity to ensure that homeless people can access accommodation.  We need that to work and to enable people to access it.<\/p>  <p>  Housing First is a fantastic scheme but it is limited in its application at present.

That follows six years of Fine Gael Government since 2011, during which time I and others, week in, week out, told five different Ministers that the Government's policies were creating and accelerating a housing and homelessness crisis.  Now, the Minister tells us it will take decades to resolve.  He is right.  With the current policies and Rebuilding Ireland, which is not working, it will take decades.  In fact, it will never be solved.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak in simple terms because I do not have much time.  The answer to the housing and homelessness crisis is to break from the fantasy that the private market will provide social housing to the extent that it is required.  Private developers, property speculators and landlords do not do social housing, full stop.  Rebuilding Ireland is dependent on private developers, speculators and landlords for approximately 75% of its targets.  It is not working, and cannot and will not work.  That fantasy must be abandoned.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister must also abandon the fantasy of HAP.  I have a letter with me which I will send to the Minister, as I do not have time to read it.  It relates to somebody in my office who is well resourced trying to locate the Dublin Place Finder Service.  In a reply to a parliamentary question in 2015 the Minister's office told us it existed in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  When the person called the office on the number provided and asked for the Dublin Place Finder Service the person at the other end of the telephone asked what that was.  That is what is happening.  The Minister must abandon the fantasy of the HAP and the fantasy that the private market will deal with homelessness and social housing.<\/p>  <p>  He must immediately freeze all further sales of National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, property.  It has sold &euro;38.1 billion worth of assets in the last five years, assets that could have solved the housing crisis.  He must immediately stop the handover through public private partnerships, PPPs, of 800 publicly owned sites to private developers for unaffordable housing.  I hate to inform Deputy Jan O'Sullivan that this week in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party opposed a motion proposing that the Shanganagh site, which is publicly owned, be retained for social and affordable housing.  They voted against it because it is one of the sites they wish to hand over to private developers under PPPs.  Those developers will not deliver affordable housing.  They will deliver unaffordable housing, because they do it for money.  The market prices or even slight discounts on them will not be affordable under any circumstances in Dublin, Cork or anywhere else.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister must immediately start the compulsory purchase of vacant land and property as well as some of the property that was bought by vulture funds, REITs and so forth which is empty and which they are sitting on as they wait for its value to rise.  Indeed, they are evicting people as we speak.  He must immediately start an emergency local authority housing programme with a State housing and construction company to drive it.  That is the only way it will happen.  He must stop the economic evictions by vulture funds, REITs and profit driven landlords, and introduce rent controls that bring rents to affordable levels.  A constitutional amendment must be passed to establish a right to housing and to rebalance the right to housing over the rights to private property, which are being used to make people homeless.<\/p>  <p>  These are positive, serious proposals and the only ones that will solve the crisis, because the market has failed.  Two sites in my area could solve the housing crisis in D&uacute;n Laoghaire - Cherrywood, which has 800 units, and Shanganagh, with 600 units.  Currently, under the Minister's policies 90% of Cherrywood and 50% of Shanganagh will be unaffordable and the crisis will be worse.  If the Minister would build public housing on the Shanganagh site and a far higher proportion of public housing on the Cherrywood site, D&uacute;n Laoghaire's housing crisis would be solved.  That could be replicated across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600007#E00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1499334000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>One would not know from looking at this Chamber that there is a housing emergency.  Our group demanded a discussion on this issue in the D&aacute;il, but it is a pedestrian enough affair.  As I look around there is no sign of any urgency on the government benches.  We have been joined by only one other Member from the Government side.  I have seen depressing times in here but this takes the biscuit.<\/p><p>The media would obviously prefer to focus on the Taoiseach jogging through the Phoenix Park, and his socks.  That is absolutely of no consequence to the people who are affected by homelessness.<\/p> <p> Rebuilding Ireland is working.  That will be joyous news to the people on the housing lists.  I am not aware of how many homeless people the Minister meets in his clinics every week.  He is probably more likely to bump into developers and landlords in Fine Gael than people affected by homelessness.  If he was, he would have intervened to stop homelessness happening with the kind of measures that even Threshold has called for this week, which have been voted down when introduced in Bills by the Opposition.<\/p> <p> We have now reached intergenerational homelessness.  I had a mother who was homeless in my office last week.  She is in a B&amp;B with two children, one with special needs and they are all in a room.  Her daughter is also homeless with her child in another location.  That is how bad the situation is.<\/p> <p> The Minister indicated there had been a failure in reaching the target set by his predecessor to move families out of hotels and B&amp;Bs.  He is allocating &euro;10 million to move 200 families from hotels to so-called hubs at a cost of &euro;50,000 per family, which is a third of the construction cost of a house.  The money would be better spent building social and affordable housing.  Instead of hubs, why does the Minister not acquire vacant housing at a cost of &euro;200,000 according to the previous census?  It is never possible until it is possible, as we saw with the Tories in relation to Grenfell Tower.  Suddenly, after massive pressure, they were able to find 68 luxury apartments.  I expect the Minister could do the same if he really tried.<\/p> <p> There has been talk of a vacant home tax and a doubling of the property tax.  Investors who leave property lying idle for six months or more should have them CPO'd or requisitioned.  Those are measures a left-wing Government would certainly take but it seems that the notion of building public housing on a major scale is ideologically unacceptable to a right-wing Government.  Instead, we have priority given to incentives for private developers to provide trickle-down social or affordable housing.<\/p> <p> The taxpayer has ponied up &euro;200 million in the local infrastructure fund.  How many affordable houses has it produced?  Is there a maximum price a developer can charge for such houses if they have benefitted from the scheme, or does affordable mean different things in different places?  An investigation showed no agreement was signed between the Government and developers before they availed of the scheme in terms of how much affordable housing would be provided.  The Government continues to misidentify the planning process as the reason for a lack of homes.<\/p> <p> An independent think-tank, TASC, has said it will take 40 years to house people on the Dublin City Council waiting list at the current rate of building.  It seems that is the best capitalism can now offer people.<\/p> <p> One of the key reasons for the positive response to Jeremy Corbyn's manifesto in Britain was the fact that he promised to build 500,000 council houses to deal with the housing emergency the Government&rsquo;s like-minded neoliberal friends have created in Britain.  If one adds in those who are facing what is academically called, severe housing unaffordability and insecurity, there are an extra 211,600 households, which is double the number on the waiting list.  I assume they will have to wait 80 years to get a permanent home at the rate the Government is going.<\/p> <p> The Government throws around figures for what it is spending.  The important figure in the entire debate is that 652 new social units were provided last year either by local authorities or voluntary housing agencies.  That is a total of 652 units in the throes of an emergency that has been raging for more than three years at its highest point.  In spite of that, the Minister tells us Rebuilding Ireland is working.  We were told 19,000 had their housing needs met because the Minister thinks somebody getting temporary private accommodation meets their housing needs.  People who need housing, health care and SNAs are a burden to the Government.  They really should not want what would have been considered acceptable 20 years ago.<\/p> <p> There is no way out of the situation other than by funding local authorities to use public lands and preferably, directly building houses themselves, as that would ensure the work would be done more cheaply.  They must build at least 100,000 public homes in the next five years and acquire at least 60,000 vacant units for public housing.  The Government can finance that by raising taxation on big business and the wealthy but also by using three funds we have, namely, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, NAMA, and the fund the Government got from the windfall from the sale of shares in AIB, which it is using to pay down debt so as not to upset its EU friends but could be used to build housing with no charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600007#E00500","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499334600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Mick Wallace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600008#F00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1499334600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Unfortunately, all we have seen recently is targets with nothing happening on the ground.  The housing crisis is a social emergency and poses a major risk to the economy.  However, the Government policy response has not been adequate and, as far as I can see, has worsened the crisis.  The core failing is the over-reliance on a private market approach to housing provision.  Only 15% of the 134,000 new social housing outlined in Rebuilding Ireland will be built by local authorities and housing associations.  The vast majority is meant to come from the private sector.  However, the private housing market in Ireland is broken and it defies logic to expect the private rental sector to deliver such a vast number of housing units given the insufficient supply and the lack of long-term security for tenants.  It is also not cost effective as State subsidies have to chase ever-rising rents.  The over reliance worsens the wider housing crisis by increasing demand and reducing supply in the private rental sector.  Rebuilding Ireland failed to reach its own target of 2,200 new social builds with only just 650 units built in 2016.  Only 175 of 1,000 rapid-build social housing, which was supposed to provide housing to families in emergency accommodation, will be completed by the end of this year.  In order for public private partnerships to deliver social and private housing the sale of up to 730 State-owned sites to developers is proposed.  A total of 30 ha of State-owned land is currently being advertised to the market by Dublin City Council in three new developments, namely, St. Michael&rsquo;s estate, Oscar Traynor Road and O'Devaney Gardens.  Of the 1,300 housing units planned for that land, just 30% or 390 units will be social housing and the rest will be unaffordable housing.  This approach is more expensive than public provision and has a major downside risk visible in the collapse of PPPs in 2008.  Private finance will dictate the delivery timescales and the mix of unaffordable private housing will inevitably entail a large transfer of public wealth to private investors.<\/p>  <p>  I previously tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister on the Neary report and the cost-rental recovery model used in Europe.  I received a number of responses.  The first was from the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, who said the Neary report links very well into the proposals in Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; it does not.  The Neary report, in effect, said that by setting up a new housing agency and using funding from Europe we could build up to 10,000 affordable cost-rental recovery housing on those lands.  That is what needs to be done.  Radical efforts must be made.  We cannot wait 40 years.  The hubs will take a certain amount of people out of hotels but the amount of people coming into homelessness will increase so we will never see the end of hotel and B&amp;B accommodation for homeless people.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to ask one question before I finish.  AIB has been in discussions with David Hall from the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation about the distressed loans in AIB.  Will the Minister support that approach rather than giving the loans over to vulture funds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600008#F00400","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1499334600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I wish both Ministers good luck.  They will probably need it.  It is not an easy job.<\/p><p>Someone from Gorey contacted me recently to explain their situation.  The maximum rent supplement for a couple or one-parent family is &euro;530 and it is &euro;565 for a parent with two children.  The cheapest available accommodation on <i>daft.ie<\/i>is &euro;760 and the next cheapest is &euro;825.  I realise that if the rent supplement in increased the landlord will probably raise his price as well.  I am the first to admit that it is not an easy problem to solve.  A number of challenges face the Minister in the long term, and partly in the short term.<\/p><p>These include homelessness, high rents and lack of affordable housing.  In the long term, the Government will have to change its philosophy if it is to work for it.  In the report the Minister states that last year 5,724 social housing units were built, refurbished, leased or acquired.  In 2016, 200 were built and 37 were delivered through Part V.  This will not solve things.<\/p> <p> Many of the Minister's problems today around homelessness, lack of affordable housing and high rents are linked to the fact that since 2011 we have allowed things to continue to get worse.  Real estate investment trusts, REITs, and the vulture funds have availed of a wonderful scenario.  Prices were discounted for them, there was no credit available for the Irish to buy, home ownership was dropping and rent demand was going up.  It was a perfect scenario that has brought us to a point where Irish Residential Properties REIT plc, I&middot;RES REIT, is now advertising one-bedroom apartments to be launched soon at &euro;1,900 a month.  The system is broken.  High rents lead to evictions which lead to homelessness which leads to an extra cost to the State.  It is not rocket science.<\/p> <p> NAMA is talking about supplying 20,000 units.  Some 18,000 of them are to be supplied at approximately &euro;360,000 each, with 2,000 available for the social end.  Last year Dublin City Council claimed that it could supply houses for &euro;205,000 each.  With inflation and other rises, let us call it &euro;230,000 today.  A house can be supplied for &euro;230,000 in Dublin.  It is State land, but so is NAMA's.  It belongs to the people.  However, NAMA's price is &euro;360,000.  The difference is &euro;130,000.  NAMA is not building houses at an affordable price, and often there is a developer involved and the price is not dissociated from the market price which involves a land banker.  In that case of the land banker and the take from the investor-developer, we are looking at a difference of approximately &euro;130,000.  Where is the logic in that?  Why would we allow this private sector to make an extra &euro;130,000 on 18,000 units?  If the Minister did nothing else in his time in the Department but change NAMA's remit and get it to supply 50% social housing and 50% affordable housing, it would make some impact.  It can be done.  If the Minister asked me to build those 18,000 houses on State land and told me that he would give me &euro;230,000 for every one of them when they are ready to be moved into, I would take the hand off him because I would make lovely money.  I guarantee it.  There is no logic or rationale in NAMA selling 18,000 houses on State land for &euro;360,000 each when we have a housing crisis.  It does not make any sense.<\/p> <p> From the day I came in here in 2011, the State has been depending on the private sector to solve its housing problems.  Right now Cairn Homes and Hines control more than 20,000 units with permission that are ready to go in the Dublin region but they will not even build 1,000 of them this year because it will not pay them.  I would not shoot them.  Their job is to make money.  The people that disappoint me are those who do not address the problem, that is, the State.  The Government must play a different role.  Tax them for banking the land.  The Government cannot force them to build, but the Government is not taxing them for banking the land.  At the moment, when the price of a house goes up 10%, the price of the land that they are banking is going up a minimum of 30%.  From an economic point of view, they would be foolish to build at the moment.<\/p> <p> Principle number one is that the State should stop depending on the private sector to solve its housing crisis.  We have a serious problem in how we supply housing.  The answer lies with the State playing a hands-on, active role in ensuring that housing is supplied on its land at affordable prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600008#F00500","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499335200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Mattie McGrath, who is sharing time.

Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, I compliment the Minister, and his Minister of State, and wish him well, but he has to do better than the last man.  What about County Tipperary?  Do we have any crisis in County Tipperary?  We have.  More than 3,100 people have been approved for housing, never mind the 10,000 or 12,000 applicants.  The report also mentions that there was keen interest in local infrastructure housing activity funding with applications from 21 local authorities covering 74 separate infrastructure projects.  The problem is that expressing interest is all they seem to be doing.  What is actually being done by the local authorities?  It is just not acceptable.  Nothing is happening.  I also see that the report acknowledges that the assessment and approval decisions have taken a little longer than anticipated.  Given the scale and complexity of some of the proposals, this is extremely frustrating.  What has gone wrong in the system?<\/p>  <p>  For decades, when we had nothing, local authorities were able to build houses and provide social housing.  We had no equipment or cranes like we have now and none of the modern technology but now they cannot build anything.  Is it all too complex?  It requires endless consultations, reports and reviews.  A report goes up to the Department, we wait six months, and it goes back down to the council, and then it goes back up six months later.  It is a game that is being played and it is not delivering houses.  Those involved should be ashamed of themselves.  Local authorities, nationwide, including Tipperary County Council, have completely lost their way in terms of the provision of social and affordable housing and the Government should come out, put its hands up and accept that.  The Government and the State have lost their way completely.  I take responsibility as a Member of this D&aacute;il, but it is just not good enough.  The Minister can laugh all he likes but I do not know what is so funny.  It is not funny for those who are waiting on houses and are sleeping on the streets.  The ineptitude is frightening.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace referred to it not being profitable.  We cannot expect smaller builders, in particular, to build at a loss.  Deputy Michael Noonan is no longer Minister for Finance but the new Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, could make a decision in the morning to reduce the VAT.  We brought that up in the talks on forming a Government.  There had to be two rates of VAT and this, that and the other.  Do something that will stimulate the industry in the upcoming budget.  I beg it of the Minister.  It is that simple.  Then talk to the county councils and tell them to cut down their development charges.  Development charges, VAT and tax make up 50% of the cost of the houses.  It is not rocket science.  Any second class national school student would know that this is a huge blockage.  We have a huge problem staring at us and we are talking around it.  We are holding conferences and delivering quarterly reports but it is all poppycock and pie in the sky.  Get out and get the houses built.  The capacity is there and they should be built.  Cut out half the red tape.<\/p>  <p>  The voluntary sector was mentioned by many people.  I am a big supporter of it.  It can do it too but it was too successful and the mandarins in the Department did not like it.  We had one office - a one stop shop - but now we have seven different official areas to go through and we have to go to buildings in different parts of the country.  It is a game that is being played by the Civil Service and it is exposed now in all its nakedness.  It is time that they got off their backsides.  Otherwise they should get out of the job and let someone in who can do it do it.  I am sick and tired of saying it, and I do not say it lightly, but we have lost our way completely.<\/p>  <p>  I am 58 years of age.  I remember as a young fellow houses being built.  They had only picks and shovels and the councils could build them.  We did not build a house in County Tipperary last year.  We are codding the people and everyone else as well.  We are spending money on reports, commissions and this, that and the other and leaving it all to NAMA.  Deputy Wallace quoted figures on what NAMA is charging for the houses.  It is a State-owned, rotting, stinking cesspit which did not provide either and when it did provide houses, Tipperary County Council refused them.  I questioned it back and forth for nearly two months to know what was wrong but all I got were long replies and no answers.<\/p><p>It probably cost the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, his leadership ambitions because it was another failure.  He worked very hard but all the others would just talk and talk and talk, at meetings and to the housing committee, until they were blue in the face, while doing absolutely nothing.<\/p> <p> We will have to scratch our heads and ask if we are really representing the people or just an abject failure in this matter.  Are we going to allow the mandarins and all the bodies and agencies to do this?  At the housing committee yesterday, the Construction Industry Federation decided it would put an emphasis on people building their own houses and would get the job of overseeing it all, without even a procurement tender.  There are cosy cartels in all this that need to be shattered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600009#G00500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499335800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>There are a number of small things that could be done to help sort out much of the homelessness problem.  Some genius decided that bedsits could not be used anymore, while fortunes are being paid to hotels to house people and people are still lying on the ground close to the hotel where I stay for two or three days every week.  I am sure they would be much happier in a bedsit.  I am not saying that all bedsits were perfect but some were fine and they would give shelter to people.  The rule preventing bedsits must be reviewed.<\/p>  <p>  There are big grants for the repair and lease scheme, which is a fine scheme but the councils tell us it will only be available where there is a demand for social housing.  It should be extended to towns and villages where there is no pressure for social housing.  The home improvement grant suits some people, notably PAYE workers, but not others such as sole traders or private operators.  It should be expanded to include more people if we are serious about addressing homelessness.  Yesterday I asked about reducing the age for grant aid for the elderly to 50, to help the people of whom I spoke.<\/p>  <p>  As regards social housing, in Kerry there are 5,000 on the list.  I do not agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath's assertion that local authorities have lost their way when it comes to building houses.  There are too many hoops to jump through and stipulations by the Department for people to get planning permission for even a rural cottage.  That is wrong.  As I said to the former Taoiseach, when one goes too far east around the globe, one comes back again to the west.  That is what has happened.<\/p>  <p>  Some 82% of people who apply for the tenant purchase scheme are not successful.  This deprives people on pensions from buying out the house in which they have lived for 40 or 50 years.  They may come into a bit of money, perhaps by way of a lump sum, and they would like to buy out their house and stay there for their remaining days but they are being denied that opportunity in the new tenant purchase scheme.  This must be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  The former Minister, Deputy Coveney, said in Tralee that pensioners who went back to live with their offspring and left a vacant house could lease that house, but if they do that their pension will be taken off them.  They do not want to sell the house to someone else as they may want to go back to live there so something needs to be done in this regard.  There are many such houses lying around.<\/p>  <p>  For private builders, &euro;80,000 of the total cost of &euro;210,000 for building a house goes in VAT and levies to the local authority.  Something needs to be done about that to kickstart private builders into building more.  At the moment they cannot make a profit with all the regulations and red tape.  It would get more builders building and more people working.  The Minister should look at these suggestions if he is serious about reducing housing lists.  They are small but they will help a lot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600010#H00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1499335800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I will share time, four minutes, four minutes and two minutes, with Deputies Eamon Ryan and Seamus Healy.  There is no doubt that this is the biggest emergency facing this country yet all we are doing is having a three-month review.  Some of us flagged this issue several years ago.  We said we should have been almost on a war footing then.  The fact that we are still talking about this in 2017, with a deepening crisis, is unacceptable.  We were constantly told there was no money but some of us pointed out that the European Investment Bank had available funding even when we were in the programme, though requiring us to be co-guarantor.  We have been far too slow to leverage that funding.  Had we taken up the option four or five years ago we would have some supply now.<\/p>  <p>  We were told for years that this was a supply-side issue and that it would take time to resolve it.  We will continue talking if we follow the mighty market, which so spectacularly failed and caused the crash.  There is far too much emphasis on the market resolving the housing problem.  We have to directly build social housing using the tier 3 housing associations, co-operative housing, etc.<\/p>  <p>  I recently discovered that there were only four staff in the delivery unit of the Department.  How do we expect to become effective in delivering houses with such a complement?  Two years ago the Social Democrats called for the establishment of a national housing delivery agency, to tie in with the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency to perform the function of project-managing large sites to give economies of scale and mixed tenure.  I still believe that such a body is necessary because it will drive down the cost of building houses.<\/p>  <p>  It is frustrating that the scale of the housing emergency continues to be denied.  We are told there are 90,000 people on the waiting list but that is nonsense.  There are 90,000 applications but they must be multiplied by three as they are not all single people.  That gives 270,000 men, women and children on the waiting list.  It is equal to the total population of five counties, Carlow, Longford, Sligo, Roscommon and Monaghan combined.  We do not even count some people, such as those who could move out of direct provision but are stuck because they have nowhere to go.<\/p><p>The rental situation is still out of control.  A three-bedroom semi-detached house in Lucan costs &euro;2,200 per month.  Why would it not drive wage inflation?  When people argue with their landlords, even in a rent pressure zone, there is only one winner.  Many are ignoring the 4% cap.  We should have a fuller debate on this issue where we focus on solutions that are very obvious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600010#H00300","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499336400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Eamon Ryan.

My hands are clean.<\/p>  <p>  I have not had a chance to congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on his appointment and to wish him the very best of luck in his new job.  I look forward to working with him, in particular on sites in our constituency such as the Irish Glass Bottle site, RTE and the docklands, where the State has an influence.  I echo the words of Councillor Patrick Costello of Dublin City Council who said it is a sad state of affairs when tourists are staying in homes and the people who should be in homes are staying in hotels, hostels and emergency accommodation.  There is something very wrong given our homelessness crisis.  We are going back to the land hoarding that got us into our housing difficulties.  We have to break the landowners' control to solve our housing crisis.  There are three measures the Minister should advance which would help us in this regard, first, as we set out in proposed legislation, advance a vacant sites levy to tackle the supply issue.  In the last Government's original programme for Government a form of site value tax was proposed but was ditched.  It would act as a signal that all land be used efficiently.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with what Deputy O'Sullivan said about needing a mechanism to stop the incentive to hoard land through a rise in profits on land ownership.  We introduced that mechanism in 2010 with a supernormal tax of 80% on any profits from rezoning of land.  The last Government got rid of it because it was not raising revenue.  It was an important signal to the market not to keep investing in hoarding land, that it would not turn a quick buck when it was rezoned.  I do not know why that measure was removed.  It was a sensible lesson and it applied the Kenny report, going back 40 years but for no reason that I can see the last Government withdrew it.  It is legal.  It was in operation and while it did not raise revenue it was a signal that landowners could not make money out of hoarding land.  We need to go back to that.  <\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight heard from Andrew McDowell the new vice president of lending in the European Investment Bank.  We asked him what more we could do about social housing.  He gave a very clear signal that if the Government only did what it says it wants to do, the cost rental model, there is a quantity of money available for lending for that.  Unfortunately, he said we do not seem to have a system whereby one can borrow against a future rental income stream, which is sufficiently high to cover that borrowing cost.  The beauty of the cost-rental model is that it allows one to raise money on a 20 or 30 year return from what is effectively a market rental system that funds that lending.  For those who are unable to afford that rental rate we would have a rent supplement scheme which, instead of going to the private rental sector, would go to that sector, provided for by local authorities or housing associations.  I cannot understand why the Government is not doing cost rental.  Going for that is my one big recommendation to the Minister as he sets out to develop the Irish Glass Bottle site and other sites because it makes economic sense. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600011#J00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1499336400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The policy of reliance on the market has created a housing emergency.  A total of 91,000 families are on local authority housing lists, a number that has doubled since 2005.  There are 21,000 families on housing assistance payment, HAP.  There is a homelessness crisis, including 2,700 children in homeless accommodation and many thousands more are couch-surfing and doubling up with relatives and friends.  The policy of reliance on the market has failed disastrously.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Taoiseach told us that approximately 2,000 social houses are at various stages of construction or planning, as if that was going to solve the crisis.  The Taoiseach knows that the current Government policy guarantees increasing homelessness as shown by the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, in a recent research paper and that it is totally and pathetically inadequate.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the points made recently by Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who said that the market system has failed and is entirely dysfunctional in housing.  She said hundreds of thousands of our citizens are affected and large numbers of children are being damaged.  She said Europe must wait, and be told to wait, for payment of debt, that local authorities must be immediately funded to build social houses and local authority land should be used for social houses only.  She also said vacant houses should be brought into use with compulsory purchase powers where necessary and that the &euro;3.5 billion raised from the sale of AIB shares should be used to build social houses and not to pay down debt.  <\/p>  <p>  More needs to be done.  A formal national housing emergency must be declared in legislation.  Evictions and repossessions generally must be stopped and the Government must instruct the banks it owns, AIB and PTSB, to stop repossessions and evictions.  We must repeal the law which allows vulture funds their right to evict sitting tenants.  Yesterday's statement by the Taoiseach confirms that this Government will persist with its disastrous housing policy.

In Dublin alone there are over 30,000 empty homes.  I know hundreds of them.  I see them every day.  They are empty, boarded up and families are camping outside local authority housing offices waiting to get in.  Families living in cars is a shame and a disgrace.  What do we do?  What is the practical solution?  There is one that is working in County Louth where the council has set up a unit that is tackling boarded-up, empty homes.  It has been doing this for some months.  Over 50 houses which were empty and boarded up are back in commission.<\/p>  <p>  The council used compulsory purchase orders, CPO, which cost less than &euro;1,000 in each case to do the legal work.  The average compensation paid was &euro;55,000.  The average compensation paid post-CPO was &euro;15,000.  The average refurbishment cost of these homes was &euro;48,382 and the valuation of the properties before they went in was approximately &euro;40,000.  Those are the facts and families are now in homes that were boarded up.  Let us tackle this around the country and bring the example of County Louth to every constituency and into the heart of Dublin city.  Louth did it and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government supported it.  Let us consider what we can do in Dublin city.  To tackle the empty homes, the council must first appoint empty homes officers.  This was done in Bolton in England, which has a population of 250,000.  In the past year, over a six month period, it put 625 empty homes back into commission.<\/p><p>That means people living in houses, not protesting or living in tents but moving in.  That is what we need to do.  We need to change the planning laws.  We also need to make change-of-use arrangements for business areas that are derelict.<\/p> <p> There has been nobody living in the centres of our cities and towns for yonks.  Houses are empty and properties are almost demolished.  Let us get in there and do it.  It has been done in County Louth and I believe the Minister has the capacity to do it.  There are incentives.  I agree with incentives to have people live over shops.  According to the censuses of 1901 and 1911, every single town centre was populated by large numbers of families, but there is nobody in those homes now.  I agree with having a new living city initiative for towns such as Drogheda and Dundalk.  Let us incentivise the reconstruction and refurbishment of town centre properties.  Provided they meet fire and sanitary regulations, we should work within the existing physical structures of the buildings, many of which are old, but we should be able to put families, single persons, childless couples or whoever else into them.  We can do it and it can be done if we have the will.  I believe the Minister has it.<\/p> <p> The Peter McVerry Trust is doing a fantastic job and we should hold up its work to national examination and support.  There are lots of agencies doing excellent work and the Minister is the person to bring them together to get the action we so badly need.  There has been a huge failure on the part of local authorities and the Environment Department has failed miserably in the past.  The Housing Agency has also failed.  NAMA offered over 6,200 homes to local authorities around the country, but not more than 2,500 were taken up, which is both a shame and a disgrace.  The agencies must be put to the pin of their collar to ensure change.<\/p> <p> We have the carrot of incentivisation for landlords who are doing very well in most cases.  Never have they had more money for less value.  Families are being absolutely crucified by increases in rents.  Some places are not within the system of rent control, including Drogheda, which is wrong and needs to change.  Alongside the tax incentives for landlords, we must tackle the empty homes crisis by putting a tax on empty homes that fit into specific categories such as being in rent pressure zones such as Dublin city or areas such as Drogheda which are not rent pressure zones but which have seen very significant additional increases in the last six quarters.  If we were to tax empty homes, particularly those that are not principal private residences and not subject to legislation or other issues such as family legal disputes, it could result in thousands of homes being put back on the market.  I believe the Minister and the new Taoiseach have the will to do so.  I ask them to make use of our initiative and the ideas we bring to them.<\/p> <p> A lot of this D&aacute;il stuff makes it a talking shop.  The housing committee is also a talking shop, if one can get in to talk at it.  I was not able to do so the last day when the Chairman very kindly left me out, although he had allowed everybody else in.  The Minister was present, but I did not have the opportunity to share my wisdom with him.  That left me very cross, but now I have made my protest and my six minutes are nearly up.  We need to be listened to.  We have damn good ideas and know the way forward.  We can help the Minister to achieve what all families and the nation want, namely, a country in which families' needs will be treated adequately, fairly and objectively.  The Minister has the vision and we can provide him with the way to implement it.

We have to go back to the genesis of the problem about 15 years ago when the Government of the day decided to shift responsibility away from the local authorities and handed it to special housing bodies and the Department of Social Protection.  I remember speaking on the issue in this House at the time when I made myself quite unpopular in certain areas by saying it was crazy stuff and would not work.  They told me that it would, that they had tested it.  They had not and it did not.  Now we are reaping the whirlwind from the seeds sown at the time.<\/p>  <p>  We have to put the onus back on the local authorities to set themselves in motion rapidly.  I cannot understand why it takes up to four years to draw up plans to build a housing scheme to provide affordable housing or serviced or serviceable sites on lands already zoned or which are capable of being zoned.  One way or another, that combination of efforts would result in two things.  It would help to reduce the cost of housing generally.  Whether we like it, the cost of housing for the average buyer, let alone those on local authority housing lists, is way too high.  It is not possible for a family or an individual to pay &euro;400,000 for a house, the cost in some of the pressured places in this city and adjoining counties.  They also have childminding and educational costs to meet.  One would need an income of &euro;150,000 to fund such a loan.  There is no use playing around on the matter; that is the way it is.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest we have an emergency plan to deliver serviced sites.  The local authorities could do this, as they have sites available.  Some of us have done this and availed of them in the past.  Incidentally, at the peak of the boom I was involved in the development of a number of serviced sites in my constituency, comprising about 100 houses built for those on the local authority housing list.  When they were finished, they were exactly twice the value of what they had cost to build.  The local committee had to pay &euro;25,000 for each for the sites, while the approved housing bodies received them for &euro;1.  That was the difference.  I cannot for the life of me understand why we cannot do more of that to deliver houses quickly.  By the way, the houses were built before the paperwork was finished in the local authority.  That is a sad reflection, but that is the way it was.<\/p>  <p>  There are multiple facets to the housing issue with which we could deal quickly.  However, we have to put the onus back on the local authorities.  We must ask them how quickly they could produce the goods.  In a constituency such as Kildare North, for example, we need nothing less than 1,000 houses at this stage to stabilise the market, provide the urgently required housing and stem the flow of homeless persons.  The problem is in the here and now, not two years down the road.  Some claim that it is recent.  Some of us were dealing with these issues at the peak of the boom.  There were people homeless then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600012#K00700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1499337000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600012#K00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1499337000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>They were camped in tents on roundabouts.

In theory, it is a human right to have a home and there are many ways by which one can have it.  We have to provide the means for the young generation to get into the housing market and I have no doubt that the Minister has the ability to do so.  I know that he understands the problem.

Their income is, say, &euro;38,000 and the presumption is that they can buy a house - like hell they can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600012#K00900","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1499337000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Yes, that has to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600012#K01000","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1499337000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>They cannot buy any house on that income.

I geneuinely wish him well in the task that lies in front of him which affects all of us and those in our communities.  It is a serious responsibility.  I express a little disappointment that the previous Minister who had developed the programme is no longer presiding over its implementation.<\/p><p>However, that is as it is.<br\/><br\/>When Rebuilding Ireland was published, I told the Minister that while it was not exactly what we would have done and there were things we would have done differently, it had the potential to impact very positively on those it was intended to help if it was implemented in a timely fashion.  I reiterate that.  I pointed out a number of differences our all-party committee had on our housing proposals.  I acknowledge that Rebuilding Ireland adopted many of the proposals from the all-party Committee on Housing and Homelessness, but the real challenge is implementation.  I reiterate that.  The Minister said today that there will be a review within three months.  While I am all for a review, it must run in parallel with the implementation of what is there.  It is not a matter of &quot;either, or&quot;.  The plan must be driven forward forcefully.  One of my initial concerns was the capacity of the Department.  I still have that concern.  Our committee felt an independent entity should be established to drive housing policy but a decision was made that it would remain within the Department.  I have concerns about implementation which I will set out as I go through my contribution.<br\/><br\/>The Minister and others have spoken today about people becoming homeless and that is the first challenge.  How do we address those issues?  One group still presenting in my office is people who are tenants of private landlords who are placing their properties for sale.  I am sure it is the same for many Members.  The Minister must revisit that issue to strengthen tenants' rights.  If someone has a tenancy with a single landlord with only one property which is a commercial buy-to-let property, the tenant should have the right to remain for the duration of the tenancy even where the property is sold.  The property should be sold with the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>.  That is what happens with commercial properties.  If a shop or office is being sold and the tenant has a lease for five or ten years, the transaction takes place but the tenant remains.  One sees the signs up all around Dublin which state &quot;Tenant not affected&quot;.  We must look at considering strengthening protections for tenants because they are presenting.<br\/><br\/>I have told the Minister that I have concerns about capacity within the Department.  I am not here to knock the Minister, give him a kicking or play political games.  My real interest is in seeing delivery.  For us to be effective and meaningful, the Minister must play ball with us.  I sometimes feel there is a cloak and dagger approach.  One asks a question but the transparency and in-depth reply which is necessary for us to be able to offer meaningful solutions is not always forthcoming.  I say that with my hand on my heart.  I am not here to get a reply which I will throw back, stating it is rubbish and that the Minister is doing nothing.  I know the Minister is trying.  However, when delivery is not being met within the specified time limits, we want to know why.  Where are the blockages?  Is it at local government level or in the Department?  Is it funding?  We honestly do not know.<br\/><br\/>The first issue to which I will refer specifically is the rapid build programme.  When Rebuilding Ireland was published last summer, the target was that there would be 200 units provided in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 800 during 2017.  Those are to be in place by the end of the year.  It is something I have been keeping an eye on.  While I am not on the housing committee, I was on the original all-party committee and, like previous speakers, have a very keen interest in and, like Deputy Durkan, a very good knowledge of the area.  As such, I have pursued this matter.  However, the answers I receive refer me first of all to what is in the pipeline and what is being planned.  They are regurgitated and provided to us time and again.  Eventually, having rephrased my questions, I start to get specific answers as to the various projects that will be delivered and when.  This is an issue that predates the Minister's time in office.  No matter what way one looks at it, instead of the 1,000 units anticipated in Rebuilding Ireland, somewhere under 200 units will have been provided by the end of 2017.  These are the figures from the Minister's own Department.  However, that does not help us because we really do not know what the underlying issue is.  We do not know where the blockages are in delivering those units.  The Minister has identified sites and what is on the input side, but we cannot fully understand where the blockages are.  In the absence of that information, it is very hard for us to provide meaningful solutions to aid the process.  That is what everyone in the House wants to do.  There are issues there but we cannot see them from the answers the Minister is providing.<br\/><br\/>The same is true of social housing building albeit I acknowledge that a progress report is published on a regular basis.  As Deputy Casey stated earlier, there are some 500 schemes with 8,500 houses, two of which schemes have over 100 units, many of which are small.  The information the Minister provides shows the different stages houses are at, but what we really want to see is another column which states when they are due to be completed.  It is not great to tell us a house has moved from stage two to stage three or that workers are on site when we want to know is the anticipated completion date.  That transparency would help the Minister as well as us because there is nothing more important for people than to meet the deadlines they have set for themselves and to deliver programmes, including local authorities.  That information is sadly missing, however.  The Minister has an opportunity as he refines the programme to put that information into the quarterly reports on the construction side.  The Minister has shown the 8,500 houses, the inputs and the early stages, but we want indicative dates as to when the units will be ready for occupation or at least completed on site.  That would be a useful step which the Minister might consider taking as part of his review.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge that the repair and leasing initiative has taken a quantum leap from where it was on budget day when some 150 units were anticipated to be delivered in 2017.  We are now up to 800.  In replies, the Minister indicates where the 800 are to be, local authority by local authority.  We are halfway through 2017 but we do not have a measurement of what has been secured to date, what is being negotiated and what we are likely to hit on a local authority by local authority basis.  In some of his replies, the Minister indicated that if local authorities can go further, he is open to that as well.  It is an important first step.  The Minister has heard the figures on vacant properties before.  We have seen a figure of 40,000, not all of which, I realise, are in the greater Dublin area.  We know they are not all suitable, but a few thousand would eradicate the use of hotels overnight.  We are ten months into Rebuilding Ireland and I am disappointed there has not been greater progress to address the issue of vacant properties.<br\/><br\/>A great deal has been made of the supply side issue, which we all acknowledge.  I spoke to the Minister previously about the local authority needing to spell out its delivery programme and timelines.  The private sector is not engaging actively in the market and there is an ideal opportunity for local authorities to build while there is some capacity there.  In two or three years' time, it may not be as easy to get contractors.  We are missing an opportunity by not being on site at the moment.  That said, I acknowledge that &euro;225 million is being invested in local infrastructure.  The concern I have with the fund is that it has been divided over four years.  I would have liked to see infrastructure front-loaded.  That should be revisited in the sense that it is &euro;225 million over four years.  If it were front-loaded, one would then be pushing sooner for the delivery of houses.  The consequence of that is that the landowners whose land will benefit from the infrastructure may not play ball and develop the land for housing quickly.  If that happens, penalties must attach.<br\/><br\/>Speaking of penalties, many people have spoken about vacant sites.  Replies to parliamentary questions indicate that we will have a vacant site tax from next year to be collected in 2019.  There has always been concern about a balancing act from the point of view of the constitutional right to private property and the rate to be applied.  It is really important to ensure the vacant site tax is meaningful and acts as a real deterrent to the hoarding of land.  We need for the foreseeable future a vibrant housing construction industry and new housing schemes coming online year after year.  Land hoarding has been and certainly continues to be an issue and I am concerned the rate of the vacant site tax will not be enough to get the results we are striving for.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd stated that when NAMA appeared before the committee, it indicated that it had offered local authorities 6,700 units but only approximately 2,500 were accepted.<\/p><p>The local authorities had a variety of reasons such as they were in the wrong location or the wrong size, yet people ended up living in all of those units.  I cannot understand why the State, either through NAMA, a housing agency or a variety of local authorities, did not take ownership and dispose of them in a variety of ways.  I believe in having mix of tenures.  They could have been sold to ordinary first-time buyers or there could have been an affordable or social housing scheme.  We could have had a mix of tenures, but we adopted a hands-off approach, which was a mistake.  On the future of NAMA and the State, we need to be proactive.  In the future, when assets are being disposed of, the State cannot say it only wants this or that bit.  We need to control the process.  The properties sold by NAMA which the State did not take up through the local authorities were very definitely a missed opportunity because all of them have people living in them today.  The State could have managed the issue in a far better way.<\/p> <p> As a committee, we spent a lot of time on the issue of developing an off-balance sheet special purpose vehicle to allow the likes of the Irish League of Credit Unions to invest substantial funds in social housing.  I note that representatives of credit unions were here recently.  For God's sake, the Minister should deal with it or bury the idea.  If it is a non-runner, he should say so.  It goes around and around.  If it is not meaningful, cannot be done, the cost of funding is too expensive, there are technical reasons and it is not allowed as an off-balance sheet transaction, the Minister should say so, but he should not allow the process to go on and on.  I urge him to deal with some of these issues and, for God's sake, be honest and direct with us.  We will try to help in the delivery of meaningful solutions and not play political football with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600012#K01300","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499338200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity to speak about this very important issue which affects tens of thousands of families across the country.  The figures released by the Department in the third quarterly progress report on housing and homelessness show clearly that the Government's plans are not working which comes as no surprise to me.  My party has consistently called for a range of measures to be implemented to address the issue.  We have called for an increase in social housing stock to 10,000 units per year.  We have called for security of tenure and rent certainty to reduce the flow of families into homelessness.  We have called for a Government-led affordable housing scheme.  The piecemeal approach of the Government has done absolutely nothing to address the crisis that is spiralling out of control.  It is almost as if it is trying to put out an inferno by sprinkling drops of petrol on it.<\/p>  <p>  Families are paying the price for the Government's failure to tackle the issue.  There are now 4,922 adults and 2,777 children in emergency accommodation, an increase of over 500 since December which I am sure Members will agree is unacceptable.  There are 91,600 households on local authority waiting lists across the State.  Five families a day are losing their homes, while 80,000 families are in mortgage arrears.  Last week in my constituency office I dealt with a lady who was in mortgage arrears.  She had fallen into arrears because she needed a serious, life-saving operation in London.  She has done her utmost to work with the banks and meet their demands, but she ended up in my office last week in a very distressed state with a heavy-handed letter, of which I still have a copy.  It has to stop immediately.  The banks should be instructed to abandon their bully-boy tactics and treat people with fairness, empathy and dignity.  <\/p>  <p>  In my constituency of Offaly-North Tipperary over 2,500 people are on the social housing waiting list.  My office is dealing with people who are living in overcrowded accommodation, being evicted from private rented accommodation, in mortgage arrears and, increasingly, families seeking emergency accommodation.  County Offaly has the highest rate of homelessness in the midlands region, with 35 adults living in emergency accommodation in May.  We need to use CPOs and look at using vacant shops which should be converted into residential accommodation in towns and villages.  Twelve single parent families and a total of 54 children are living in emergency accommodation in the midlands region.  This fact cannot be ignored.  We talk all the time about mental health and building resilience in children.  These kids will end up with serious problems and we will have more problems than we currently have.  We need to deal with this issue head on and to protect the most vulnerable.  If this is to be a true republic, we much cherish all of the children of the nation equally and give people fair play.  It is about time we stopped caving into the banks.<\/p>  <p>  Homelessness is not confined to large urban areas.  It has spread to every region in the State.  To add insult to injury, census figures show that there are 3,000 vacant dwellings in County Offaly.  These dwellings should not be lying idle at a time when families have nowhere to call home.  The majority on housing lists could be housed in these dwellings.  The Minister needs to provide sufficient funding to bring them into use.  We need urgent action; words will not do it for us.  I urge the Government to be more ambitious in its vacant homes strategy by targeting a larger proportion of vacant stock over a shorter period.  This would be a pragmatic approach which would be realistic and we should be taking.  A properly funded vacant homes strategy could potentially transform the situation in a relatively short timeframe and at lower cost.  I urge the Government and the Minister to prioritise it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600014#M00200","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1499338200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>It is close to 12 noon, but I propose to conclude the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600014#M00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1499338200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I will facilitate the Acting Chairman in that regard.  Many questions were asked during the debate and I will not get a chance to answer all of them, but we can come back. to them.  We had a good discussion at the committee on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of this side of the House, I thank everybody for his or her contribution.  It has been a wide-ranging and well informed debate in which many issues were raised.  It is important that we take them on board and try to work with the Opposition as we have in the past.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I recognise the work put in by the housing committee in the past year and a half.  It is a constant process of engaging and trying new ideas.  That is what we are here for, to try every idea to address the issue.  In the House we recognise the urgency of dealing with it.  It is important that the message get out that it is urgent for all stakeholders that are working with us across the system.  There are plenty of ideas, schemes and actions which need to be driven with urgency.  We all have a role to play in that regard.  We acknowledge that we need to keep pushing.<\/p>  <p>  Some Members have expressed a fear that a review of the housing action plan in Rebuilding Ireland will cause a delay.  It absolutely will not because it is a review that is ongoing.  The Minister has said very clearly on numerous occasions that it will not delay progress.  We were very clear about this from the start.  There has to be a constant review of the actions being taken and the adding of more because all Members have new ideas.  We are all learning.  That is what we are prepared to do and what the review is about.  The Action Plan for Jobs was an annual review which involved adding new actions every year and the process worked very well which did not suit most in the Opposition because it was a success.  In the first year of the Action Plan for Jobs not everyone bought into the progress made because not everyone could see it.  In the past three or four years, however, it took off and smashed every target set for it.  Likewise, with the housing action plan, we will be able to do with it takes t solve this problem.  That will mean reviewing and adding actions as we go along.  That is exactly what the Minister is doing and part of the discussion this morning will feeds into it.  Members should, therefore, have no fears about it.  The purpose is to push things along, as opposed to delaying anything.<\/p>  <p>  I will address the issue raised by Deputy John Curran first because it is relevant to what happened at the committee meeting yesterday.  With regard to tapping into the resources of the credit unions, we absolutely want it to happen.  The Department has been engaging with them for many years and certainly in the past few months.  We have met them umpteen times to make this happen.  There are funds available.  Not all of their funds should be put into housing but a certain amount should.  They also want to be involved in seeking solutions locally and that is happening.  The required changes are coming through the Central Bank.  We are ready when it is.  The credit unions are also ready.  It will not suit every credit union, but it will suit their overall investments portfolio and how they invest money which we need.  We are committed to making it happen and it is something we want to see happen.  I want to be very clear that it will not be delayed from our side. <\/p>  <p>  We all agree that not enough progress is being made on the issue of vacant properties, but we have to remember that they are private properties; they are not ours.  Where properties are owned through local authorities, we have taken serious action and over 7,000 vacant social houses have been brought back into use in the past few years.<\/p><p>There is enough money allocated this year to end that problem.  There should no longer be any voids of social houses.  We have led this by example.  There are enough schemes out there now, the repair and lease back scheme, the purchase and renew scheme, and other schemes that will be announced in the future to deal with vacant properties.  The numbers that people keep quoting, of 190,000, are the census figures.  They are not our figures.  I do not fully believe that all of those are available for housing.  It is probably much less, but the Deputies are absolutely right that there are at least a couple of thousand and we need to get our hands on them.  We want them as well but we recognise that they are private properties.  We have to engage with the owners and we have used the carrot approach, but in the reviews, we will look at all approaches, both carrot and stick, to try to make this happen, because they need to be brought back into use and that is what we are committed to.<\/p> <p> Politicians have a role to make this happen.  I still meet people on a daily basis who are not aware of the schemes and yet we have all our councillors, all the Deputies in here, and we know about the repair and lease back scheme and we know there are different versions that might suit different people better as well.  Let us put the word out there.  We are engaging with people who tell us that they have vacant properties.  Put them in touch with the local authority and let us make it happen.  We have provided the money and the money is there to make this happen, but we need to get the message out there that we want it to happen as quickly as we possibly can.<\/p> <p> Likewise, on the matter of State-owned lands, we have identified over 800 sites.  We have asked local authorities to take the lead on these.  There are a number of options to make that happen, but we need to drive that urgency.  I ask Deputies to ask all their councillors at a local level to drive that urgency to have those lands developed.  We have resources to make it happen and we have identified the sites, but the onus is on each local authority to drive it on, and we will facilitate that as well as we possibly can.  There is endless opportunity there.<\/p> <p> On the infrastructural fund, somebody raised the question about the delay of three or four years that it takes for infrastructure to happen.  We are saying that one can develop the houses in parallel with the infrastructure.  It is not a case of waiting for a bridge for two years and then starting to build the houses.  One can phase the developments, start the construction of the houses and have them ready when the infrastructure is ready, if it is a road or a bridge.  It is a little different if it is other infrastructure.  Common sense applies here.  One can move on much of this activity in a planned and phased way.  It certainly will not delay housing.  We have already seen some local authorities coming into us and saying that they are applying for funds to start building houses on those lands.  That is the proper order, because that is what the local authorities are meant to do.  There are other versions of the infrastructure fund that we can use to try to open up sites as well, but again, it is to try to kick-start and develop as well.<\/p> <p> There are other matters that we can touch on and we will do that in the weeks ahead.  We are absolutely committed to making this happen.  Everyone says that there are not enough programmes.  We know that we cannot fix it overnight, but the quarterly reports will show that we are making steady progress here.  The trends are going in the right direction.  It cannot all be visible.  We cannot see all the houses we want to see.  However, much progress has been made, even compared to where we were last year, with projects at local authority level.  We now have over 600 projects.  Some are for 20 or 30 houses, and some are for many more, but they were not there a year ago.  Now they are in the system and moving, and we need to push them even harder again.  Likewise, we need to see the private sector coming forward.  Some of the planning changes we will do, that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced today, will be discussed here next week.  We need the help of the House to make that happen, so that those sites can move on and start delivering houses as well.  Progress is being made.  We recognise that it is not nearly enough and we have to keep it happening, and that is what we are here to do as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600014#M00400","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1499338800,"counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600015#N00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1499338800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Last year, we went to much trouble to shut down tax avoidance by vulture funds.  The then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, stated clearly that the funds were using the loophole called section 110 in a way that was not intended.  Critically, they were using section 110 to avoid paying taxes on profits generated in the Irish economy.  This week, we have new revelations that other investment funds are using section 110 to avoid paying taxes on Irish profits, that they are doing so with the full blessing of the Government, or at least the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, when he was <i>in situ<\/i>, and that they are working directly with the State via the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  Not only is public money being used in a tax avoidance scheme, so too, potentially, is money from the European Investment Bank.  In response to parliamentary questions by Deputy Michael McGrath, the Government has admitted that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is availing of four section 110 companies.  The journalist, Mr. Jack Horgan-Jones, has obtained the accounts for two of these companies, and reported on the same in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>.  Earlier this week, we received copies of those accounts.<\/p><p>The first company is called WLR Cardinal Mezzanine Fund.  &quot;WLR&quot; stands for Wilbur Ross, the current United States Secretary of Commerce.  It is a new investment fund in Ireland, with &euro;70 million in assets and its notes are listed on the stock exchange in the Cayman Islands, for obvious reasons.  In 2015, it took in &euro;3 million from its activities, and it paid &euro;250 in tax.  The second company is called BlueBay Ireland.  BlueBay has &euro;160 million loaned out.  Between 2015 and 2016, it took in &euro;36 million, and each year, it paid &euro;250 in tax.  Both of these funds make their profits from the domestic economy, including real estate, renewable energy, forestry, restaurants, televisions and so on.  Both are able to get their profits out of the country completely tax free, other than a notional payment of &euro;250.  I am aware of no other country that allows investors to make money on the domestic economy and to then export those profits tax-free out of the country.  My understanding from the work we did on the vulture funds was that this type of thing was going to be stamped out, and if one made profit on domestic activity, one would pay taxes here.<\/p><p>My questions are as follows.  Is the Minister aware that no other European country tolerates tax avoidance of this kind?  Does his Government stand over this practice?  Does his Government stand over the State investing money from the European Investment Bank in this way?  If not, will he, as a matter of urgency, initiate a full independent review of the use of section 110 companies in Ireland?  Will he commit to this House that profits made in the domestic economy in Ireland will be taxed in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600015#N00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1499338800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for raising this issue.  The position is that every year, in the Finance Bill, we review tax avoidance.  As long as I have been here - which has been a long time - we have seen loopholes being closed each year when they are being abused or exploited in a way that was never intended.  In all cases, initiatives in the tax code - which I have seen over many years - are designed by politicians with the best of intentions.  Others employ armies of accountants to find ways of using them for other purposes and, every year, one has to deal with that.  We have given the Revenue very strong powers not only to pursue abuses, but to put those who are designing schemes that might be anticipating abuses under threat as well.  We have a very strong code in this respect.<\/p>  <p>  On our international position, we are taking a leading role in the base avoidance and profit-shifting initiative of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.

As far as I, Fianna F&aacute;il and everyone involved in the vulture fund tax loopholes are concerned, this is an improper use and it needs to be shut down.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the Minister will raise this with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, but we are asking that he goes further.  We are asking that the Government commits to a full independent review of the use of section 110 companies in the Irish economy and that it makes a commitment to the House that, as a policy principle, profits generated in the Irish economy must be taxed in the Irish economy as they are in every other country on earth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600015#N00500","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499339400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>First, I am strongly of the view that we should use the Revenue to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax and that has always been the case.

Jacob is the middle child of Edel and Anton Dooley and he has been diagnosed with severe autism.  The Dooleys are, in their own words, \"a family in crisis.\"  For months they have been appealing to Ministers for help but they have been ignored.  I have written and spoken directly to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, about this family and their desperate search for respite care for their son.<\/p>  <p>  At a recent case conference where their case was discussed, the Dooleys predicament was laid out in detail.  Jacob is eight years of age and engaged in aggressive behaviours toward his parents and siblings causing injury.  As Jacob gets older and stronger, he poses a greater risk to his family, other students and staff in Foxfield school, and to the staff working within the family home.  Jacob is displaying significant behaviours that challenge, such as biting and scratching.  Edel herself has been bitten and scratched on a regular basis and Jacob recently tried to strangle his mother.  Previous applications to St. Michael's House for respite, host family and link have all been submitted but to date none of these have been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  This is one case of dozens I have been dealing with.  The Minister will be keenly aware that there is not a Deputy in this House who does not receive emails and calls on a daily basis from desperate parents and family members who are seeking nothing more than respite.  Anecdotal evidence may not count for much and given the responses to the desperate pleas from the Dooley family, and no doubt the Minister's unwillingness to comment on individual cases, I will look at the facts.  Figures released to me by the HSE show that while the number in need of respite is going up, the allocation of respite hours is decreasing.  In the first quarter of last year, 44,141 overnight hours were provided.  This year the figure had fallen to 40,597.  There is no urban-rural divide on this.  All counties in this State are being treated equally badly.  For example, Dublin North, where Jacob lives, is down 503 hours.  If we look at Donegal, there has been a loss of 559 hours from last year.  Shockingly, Dublin Central has seen a loss of 1,553 hours of overnight respite care.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Dooleys told their story on the Sean O'Rourke show.  They are a quiet, private family and it pains them to have to do this.  However, it appeared to work because immediately following the programme they received all sorts of calls from interested politicians.  Indeed, they have now secured a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, a mere seven months after asking for it.<\/p>  <p>  My question is this.  Will there be an increase in respite hours to cope with the additional demands that the school holidays place on families?  Will Edel Dooley have to watch life pass her and her family by again this summer while she is unable to leave her home?  Will the Minister acknowledge that there is a serious problem here?  Will he commit here this afternoon to halt the decline in the provision of respite hours and to increase this basic service for struggling families such as the Dooleys?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600016#O00500","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1499339400,"counter":73,"content":"<p>First, I express my full sympathy with the family.  I have dealt with many families who are very distressed in dealing with children of this nature, trying to access services and having a clear understanding of what is available for them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has been working hard to try to improve the access to both information and service and he has applied additional funds to these purposes.  The Minister of State has expanded the number of places, for example, for adults - children who reach the age of 18 and need additional places.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, this is an area of respite which, from my own experience, is a particularly acute pressure point in that provisions have been made in good faith for respite provision but because of a particular individual who has very challenging behaviour, sometimes it is not possible to continue to provide the planned respite because all attention has to be devoted to one very complex case.  We need to have a better planning framework for this.<\/p>  <p>  In my own area in education, we have made very substantial increases in provision for children with special education needs - a 41% increase in the case of resource teachers and 32% in the case of SNAs.  We are investing very substantial funds to try to support children like this, staying in the education system and having their caring needs supported through the education system.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad that Deputy Louise O'Reilly is able to report that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is meeting the family in question and I will certainly bring her concern to his attention.  In my own area, I have seen pressure on respite in the recent past due specifically to difficulties in dealing with particular individuals and we need to try to plan for that in a better way.  That is why we are seeking to develop a ten-year approach to health issues so that we can plan these resources in a consistent way.  In the same way, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is developing a disability strategy so that these various elements can be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE keeps a certain emergency capacity to try to deal with very special cases in a sympathetic way.  Clearly, this is a case that it has sought to respond to.<\/p>  <p>  All I can say is that I will certainly report the Deputy's concern to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who, to be fair to him, is striving continuously to make the case not only for additional resources but for additional understanding of the needs of people with a disability throughout our services.  He is making very significant progress in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600016#O00600","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1499339400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>One need not be a genius to figure out that while demand for this service is going up and the number of hours are going down, the Government is contributing to the problem.

That is not due to one, two or three individuals.  That is due to a failure by the Government to treat these people with any sort of decency and respect.<\/p>  <p>  The family got a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, after they had been on the Sean O'Rourke show, just as the Devereaux family had their case dealt with after they had been on Joe Duffy's show.

That is the nature of this problem.  Deputy Smith's party is a party that talks about taking our global responsibilities seriously.  If we want to respond to the challenges of climate change, the problems of global waste and the impact it is having on resource use in our world, then we have to change behaviour.  We have to see people who deal with waste in their normal daily lives changing the way they do that.  That has to happen in businesses but it also has to happen in homes.  What we have at the moment is that many homes do not segregate or try to minimise the amount of waste.

That is what is happening here.  The system applies to half of households in the country already.  Customers have an incentive system based on either a charge per lift or a charge per weight.

As a result, there will be an incentive for people to minimise waste and to use the three principles of good waste management: reduce, reuse and recycle.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Smith probably knows, we have a real problem with contamination of the waste streams.  Elements are put into segregated waste - whether into the green bins or black bins - that are not supposed to be contaminated by food products.

It is a listed building, for which plans for its future use need to be formulated.  We are all aware of what happened this week to a similar building, the former Our Lady's Hospital in Shanakiel.  Much of it was burnt to the ground.  At one time there were 800 patients and 800 staff at St. Finan's Hospital.  Years ago the building and lands were owned and managed by Kerry County Council, but they were then transferred into the ownership of the HSE.  On behalf of many interests in Killarney and surrounding areas, I raised the issue of the future plans for the building and lands at forum meetings of HSE south.  It is important that they are not sold to private interests.  The Government and the Minister for Health need to work together to formulate a plan for what is to be done with this valuable property.  I sincerely hope it is insured and that there is security in place 24\/7.<\/p>  <p>  Killarney is to shortly have a new community hospital which is expected to be built on part of the lands surrounding the former hospital.  I am asking the HSE to liaise with Kerry County Council on the proposed use of the remaining land.  As all Members are aware, we are experiencing a shortage of housing and many houses could be built on these lands.  Also, part of the grounds could and should be used to provide a safer route from the town onto the bypass.  There have been many accidents at the Lewis Road junction and further accidents could be avoided if another access road to the bypass was provided.  The former hospital building could be adapted to provide social housing apartments or offices or for amenity use and made available to local voluntary sports clubs and other groups.  As parts of the roof are leaking, the building will soon be derelict.  As it is situated adjacent to the Fitzgerald Stadium, it would be shame if it were allowed to fall into dereliction.  If the property was owned by private interests, it would not be left unused, as it is very valuable.  It was suggested previously that the land could be used as a graveyard or a car park.  As there are many uses to which it could be put, it should not be left idle.  As I said, if the property was in private ownership, it would be developed and used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600018#Q01200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1499340600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I am not familiar with the site, but I can assure the Deputy that the HSE would be very interested in working with local communities if there were viable proposals for its future use.  Clearly, they would have to be stand-alone proposals.  I am sure any Department would support a local initiative of that nature.  I will ask the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Damien English, to examine whether there are opportunities and demands in the area.  The Deputy will be aware that there has been a considerable trawl of properties in State ownership in an effort to respond to social housing needs.  Where a property is identified, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is keen to support proposals for its use, but they must make sense in the context of the social housing programme in meeting demands and so on.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, has reminded me that this year Killarney House was restored as part of an initiative taken by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  That is indicative of the Government's interest in restoring assets that can become considerable tourist attractions for communities.  I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of the appropriate Ministers to see what can be done to respond to them.  If there is a local group that is putting plans together for which there is a solid business case, the Government will be keen to examine them in the context of whether they could be factored in in planning the future use of the site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600018#Q01300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1499340600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

It amends the Roads Act 1993 to exempt sea and river rescue teams, the RNLI and Civil Defence from paying road rolls when participating in search and recovery missions.  <\/p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the tragic loss of Rescue Helicopter 116, which crashed off the coast of Mayo in March of this year, I was contacted by volunteers who were participating in the efforts to recover the coastguard crew of that doomed flight.  They were justifiably frustrated at having to pay road tolls while making the journey to and from Mayo.  Some were coming from Dublin city and others from as far as from Cork in order to participate in a hazardous mission, for which they had volunteered their time.  When I raised the matter with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, he confirmed that only ambulance, fire brigade vehicles and vehicles used by An Garda S&iacute;ochana or the Defence Forces are exempt from having to pay road tolls.  He went on to say that voluntary and community organisations such as river and sea rescue teams had to pay road tolls in order to ensure a fair and robust system of tolling enforcement.  He further claimed that exempting the voluntary and community sector from tolls would incur a cost to the Exchequer as the toll operators would have to be reimbursed for their losses.<\/p><p>I believe the Minister's excuse for refusing to exempt voluntary sea and rescue vehicles from having to pay road tolls was demeaning to the brave men and women who assist the State during those emergencies and that is why I have put forward this simple, short Amendment Bill.  The cost of voluntary rescue crews travelling through road tolls places an unnecessary financial burden on the search and rescue volunteers who are penalised for fulfilling their potentially life-saving work.  Some of those who contact the office calculate that they were paying nearly &euro;15 daily if they were travelling from parts of Dublin to Mayo.  That adds up.  They should not be penalised financially for trying to help.  Any cost to the Exchequer from exempting voluntary rescue services from paying road tolls is totally justified.<\/p><p>It is wrong that they are expected to pay those road tolls <i>en route<\/i>to assisting in emergencies that often occur in very tragic and difficult circumstances.  Therefore, I encourage the Minister to consider this amending Bill and perhaps endorse it.  When it comes to Second Stage, we can have a proper debate on the topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600020#S03000","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499342400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600021#T00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1499342400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600021#T00225","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1499342400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1499342400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>As this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600021#T00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1499342400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600021#T00600","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1499342400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Genuine Progress Indicators and National Distributional Accounts Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1499342400,"counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600021#T00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1499342400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to confer functions on the Central Statistics Office and the National Economic and Social Council in relation to the publication of indices, to be known as Genuine Progress Indicators, designed to take fuller account of the well-being of the community by incorporating environmental and social factors which are not otherwise measured, in relation to the publication of National Distributional Accounts that aim to measure the distribution of national income and economic growth and in relation to an annual report on the impact of the Budget on economic and social inequality, poverty reduction and income and wealth redistribution; and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>Over the past two years a debate has raged around the validity of gross domestic product, GDP, as a measure of Ireland's economic progress.  There is some merit to that debate and the adoption of gross national income, GNI, as perhaps a more reliable indicator but the debate has missed a fundamental point.  In fighting over how we measure our economy, we have ignored the fact that our national well-being relies on much more than simply the notional strength of our economy.  The Bill I am introducing on behalf of the Labour Party seeks to rectify that.  It seeks to ensure we measure all aspects of the progress of our nation and consider this progress in the round.<\/p><p>The annual publication of genuine progress indicators would build on the work done by other bodies such as the Social Progress Index.  That global measurement indicates that Ireland does reasonably well compared with other countries around the world.  The time has come for a national measure that will focus on and drive improvements to social progress in Ireland.  Genuine progress indicators do not disregard economic growth but include it and embrace it.  They also include other very important indicators, such as the health of our people, the amount of time they spend commuting or volunteering and the state of our national infrastructure.  They measure levels of poverty in society and its distribution, as well as our ecological footprint.<\/p><p>This Bill gives responsibility to the National Economic and Social Council, working with the Central Statistics Office, for the publication of genuine progress indicators each year.  This would be a significant step forward for how we debate our national progress.  The Bill also includes a requirement for the same bodies to publish a set of distributional accounts each year.  The national distributional accounts would measure how our national income and the fruits of our economic growth are shared among our people.  They would include growth rates for each cohort of Irish people so we could see clearly if economic growth is benefitting only those with the most or if it is having an impact on each element of Irish society.  There would be inclusion of estimates of the distribution of both pre-tax and post-tax income.<\/p><p>This process would also give an assessment of how tax and social welfare redistribution has an impact on income, as well as wealth inequality and distribution.  The genuine progress indicators and national distribution accounts would be designed to shift the debate fundamentally in Irish society.  We want to move away from simply speaking about GDP, GNI, fiscal space and productivity.  Instead, we want to talk again about how our people are advancing and we are working to build a more equal country.  To underpin these proposals, the Bill will include a requirement for the publication of reports each year and again every five years to assess the impact of budgets on economic and social inequality.  These assessments will consider whether budgets have increased or decreased social and economic inequality.  They will determine if budgets reduce poverty levels and what impact there is on the distribution of income and wealth across our nation.<\/p><p>This Bill is a progressive measure and it imposes no burden on a Department.  It gives a meaningful and valuable task to the National Economic and Social Council, a topic that has been discussed at many Leaders' Questions.  Above all it would change how we debate how Ireland is progressing.  The Cabinet is meeting today in a special session to discuss economic progress.

However, I would point out there may be slight differences in the text, which I will deal with from the point of view of the Opposition and the Government.  Our amendments are essentially identical to those put down by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and they differ slightly from those put down by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan in the sense that while we provide that a victim can be accompanied in court by a parent, relative, friend \"and\/or\" a support worker, Deputy O'Callaghan proposes the text should read \"and\" a support worker.  What all of the Opposition is trying to do, which the Government has not allowed for, is allow a scenario where somebody wants a family member and a support worker to be present.  I do not see why that would not be accommodated by the Minister.  We feel the Government amendment, while better than what we had, is a little too limiting.<\/p>  <p>  The role of support workers is key and where somebody is in court as a victim of rape or a sexual crime, it is very important they have the right to be accompanied by a support worker in the absence of, say, a family member or friend.  That is precisely because the victims of a rape or sexual assault go through the legal process, at least from a legal point of view, alone.  The alleged rapist is legally represented whereas the victim, ironically, is only a witness to the case and unless their past sexual history is being brought up, they do not have a right to any legal representation.  That is why we consider, in circumstances where the judge decides to exclude the public or certain persons, that support workers should be among the list of people who will not be excluded and that the choice should be left to the victims themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600023#Z00700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1499343600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 3 deals with the definition of restorative justice.

I can be helpful to the House and regret there are 16 amendments in the one group, but it looks more cumbersome than it actually is.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Clare Daly, we gave consideration to the points raised on Committee Stage.  The difference between us is minimal and I hope that in the circumstances we can agree.  The difference between the Opposition amendments in the groups and mine on each of the Acts mentioned is the use of the word \"or\" or \"and\" between clauses.  In effect, we are dealing with a drafting rather than a policy issue.  I am satisfied that the use of the word \"or\" in the text will more correctly achieves what Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace wish to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  The disjunctive \"or\" is used to distinguish between the right of a parent, relative or friend, a support worker, or a relative of the accused to remain in court for the hearing.  Of course, the power of the court to exclude the public is without prejudice to each of the rights individually, but that does not mean that only one of these persons is permitted to remain in court.  It means that each clause refers to a separate and distinct right.  If we were to use the word \"and\", it would imply instead that there was one single right for all of the persons listed to remain in court.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt that my amendment actually deals with the point at issue in the amendment tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.  The Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 provides that the power to exclude the public is without prejudice to the right of a parent, relative or friend of the complainant, or where the accused is not of full age, to remain in court.  Clearly, this provision does not mean that either the complainant or the accused may have a person with him or her.  Even though the word \"or\" is used, both parties are and will be permitted to have a person remain in court with them.  It is my belief the text, as it stands, allows a parent, relative or friend and the support worker to remain in court, which is the point that has been very well made by Clare Deputy Daly.

Amendments Nos. 3, 6, 24 and 35 insert into the Bill provisions on the rights of victims who participate in restorative justice schemes.  Deputies on all sides of the House are in favour of and have highlighted the need for such amendments to be made to the Bill.  I am happy, following Committee Stage and a period of reflection since, to bring forward these amendments.<\/p><p>Everybody agrees that there are proven benefits under the concept of restorative justice in addressing the matter of criminal behaviour and giving the victims a real voice in the process.  The schemes provide victims with an opportunity to challenge the offender and explain the impact the offence has had on them.  However, bringing the victim together with the person who has harmed him or her is a pretty risky business; therefore, of course, it is important that appropriate safeguards be in place to protect the victim from even further hardship, suffering or trauma.  That is the aim of the amendments.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that the delay in bringing forward the amendments was not due to any difficulty in practice in providing the necessary safeguards.  The majority of these rights, for example, on the issue of informed consent and voluntary agreements, are intrinsic to the successful operation of any restorative justice scheme.  They are already part and parcel of the schemes operated by the courts.<\/p><p>I will turn briefly to the specifics of the amendments.  Amendment No. 3 defines restorative justice schemes.  The definition broadly follows that included in the EU directive, with some revisions to reflect the administrative nature of the schemes we operate through the courts in the State.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 provides that information available on restorative justice schemes must be given to a victim when he or she first makes contact with the appropriate authorities.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 24 sets out the rights to which a victim is entitled when he or she elects to participate in a restorative justice scheme.  The scheme cannot be used unless it is the interests of the victim and, of course, the offender must acknowledge the essential facts of the offence.  The victim and the accused must be fully informed about the process and the potential outcomes and both must freely consent and volunteer to participate.

Restorative justice can be an extremely valuable process for both victim and perpetrator, if done right.  A victim being given the opportunity to confront somebody who committed a crime against them can be empowering.  It can also have a profound effect on the perpetrator for the simple and obvious reason that when a perpetrator understands the effects and consequences of their actions, it can be a powerful lever for rehabilitation.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are a few issues with the Government's proposal which our amendment seeks to address.  Article 12(1)(d) of the victims directive provides that any restorative justice agreement is arrived at voluntarily and may be taken into account in any further criminal proceedings.  We have to be careful because a victim may believe that an offender is only engaging in restorative justice with a view to getting some credit in a sentencing hearing.  As a result, if the victim does not have the assurance that an agreement reached between parties will only be taken into consideration by a court with the consent of both parties, then they may not find the restorative justice process as valuable and useful as they might otherwise do.<\/p>  <p>  Our amendment, therefore, seeks to fix this gap in the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment does not explicitly set out that an agreement will only be considered by the courts if both parties have consented.  Our amendment does.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth pointing out also that a victim may not engage in the process, or they may delay in engaging in it if they believe an agreement could be presented to the court.  They may be nervous, concerned about confidentiality or any number of matters.  To protect the integrity of the restorative justice process and to encourage victims to engage with it, it is crucial any agreement reached between the parties should only be disclosed to the court if both parties agree to it.<\/p>  <p>  Article 12(1)(c) of the victims directive states that restorative justice should only be facilitated where the offender has acknowledged the basic facts of the case.  Our amendment No. 38 will insert this important safeguard in the Children Act 2001.  It is the same amendment as those tabled by Deputies O&rsquo;Callaghan and Jonathan O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600025#BB00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1499344800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>The only difference between my amendment No. 24 and amendment No. 25 is the requirement in section 25(4)(b) that the consent of both parties required for agreement reached as part of the restorative justice process can be admitted to court.

However, there is a difficulty which arises with requiring a garda or an officer to provide information regarding medical support to a victim.  Difficulties arise about the nature and level of information required regarding medical support.  Where immediate medical care is required, the garda at the scene of an incident already has an obligation to request such care.  Aside from this, it is not clear how general information could be provided on medical support and, more particularly, on how a garda or officer could determine where such information is relevant without a level of questioning that may well be invasive.  In such circumstances of first contact, a garda could face an obligation to provide information that he or she could only glean by way of first contact that might not be fully appropriate.<\/p><p>In addition, the first point of call for most medical support would be a GP.  However, only the victim will know the identity of his or her GP.

It arose out of the Committee Stage debate and issues we raised.  It is broadly similar to amendment No. 8 but, as with many of our amendments, there are subtle differences.  The subtle difference in this case is that ours provides that if a victim specifically requests that the information would be given to him or her orally, as opposed to in writing, or in writing as opposed to orally, the request \"shall be\" complied with.  The Government's amendment, by comparison, uses the wording \"in so far as is practicable\".  We believe that in the spirit of the victims directive, the obligation should be on the Garda.  Where there is a deaf person, for example, there is no point in giving him or her the information orally.  He or she should get it in writing.  The garda could say he or she has not time to be giving the information in writing and that it is not practical but the obligation should be to meet the needs of the victim.  The information we are talking about is critical information on which victims need to rely and that they need to understand.  While we welcome the point made, if victims are to be discriminated against at this stage it would actually go against the spirit of the directive itself.  It is better not to include \"in so far as is practicable\" and instead oblige the garda to give the information orally or in writing as the victim requests.

I do not believe the spirit of the legislation or the letter of the legislation is in any way weakened by including the words \"in so far as is practicable\".  Of course, there will be circumstances in which that will be tested.

The amendment does not go on to state, as the Government amendment does, \"in so far as is practicable, in the manner specified in his or her request\".  He or she should always be entitled to it in the manner in which he or she requested.  However, we accept that that may not always be immediate.

I will discuss amendments Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive, first.  They are pretty similar but slightly different.  This first mini-group has the aim of ensuring victims are provided with all the information they need, including all the information they need to request a review of a decision by the DPP not to proceed with a prosecution.  As it stands, this section provides that victims shall be provided with information relating to any significant developments in the investigation of the alleged offence, information regarding a decision not to proceed with or to discontinue the investigation and a summary of the reasons for the decision, information regarding a decision not to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the alleged offence and a summary of the reasons for the decision as well as the victim's right to request a review of a decision referred to in subparagraph (i) and the procedure for requesting the review.<\/p><p>Obviously, the ideal would encompass all information but that would likely be rejected out of hand because the garda&iacute; and the DPP would have strong grounds to say that at least some information with regard to a decision not to proceed will always be too sensitive to be released.  I understand the Minister will say that the term &quot;all relevant&quot; is not necessary and that victims will get all relevant information as a matter of course but I am afraid I just do not buy that.  In particular, when we are talking about the DPP, I think it must be made crystal clear that the DPP cannot get away with fobbing victims off with dribs and drabs of information but must tell them everything that is relevant.  It is only very recently that the DPP has started to open up at all about decisions to prosecute or not prosecute after years of stony silence.  Gentle pressure needs to be brought to bear to keep up that culture change and to ensure the DPP does not fall back into old habits of stony silence.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 15 to 17, inclusive, add to the already long list in the Bill of types of information that are to be provided by investigators to the victim on request.  They add a number of extra categories of information, including conditions under which a sentence is suspended or part suspended, any post-release supervision orders imposed on the convicted person, conditions of bail and the procedure the victim should follow if bail conditions are breached, for example, in the case of a sexual offence, if the offender approaches the victim.  As the Rape Crisis Network points out, in sexual cases, there may be a very lengthy gap between the institution of proceedings and the first court date and between the first court date and the trial date.  This leaves many victims feeling frightened that they or their loved ones will be intimidated by the accused and-or their associates during this period and it is important that they know not only whether there are any bail conditions restricting contact with themselves but also what they can do if some breach of same or separate intimidating or harassing behaviour occurs.  It would also be very helpful and reassuring for victims to be told the details of any post-trial or post-conviction order other than imprisonment which is aimed at preventing them from suffering harm at the hands of the person accused or convicted.  It would seem absolutely appropriate to provide information about things like bail conditions, post-release orders and harassment orders to, for example, victims of sexual crimes, as there are several different kinds of orders which may be made post-trial or post-conviction in this kind of case and it is important victims understand that these orders are available, that they may be applied for and that once made, they may be enforced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600028#EE00500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1499346600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the points raised by Deputy Wallace in the context of this series of amendments dealing with the provision of information and do not doubt the sincerity of the points raised by him.  A number of different issues are raised in these amendments and I will address them in turn.  I see a difficulty with the insertion of the words \"all relevant\" in section 6, which is proposed in amendments Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive, in terms of workability.  I go back to what I said earlier about ensuring that what we enshrine in legislation by way of explicit provisions has a practical effect and that the legislation will not be ambiguous, uncertain or unduly cumbersome.  Amendment No. 12 would require all relevant information regarding significant developments in an investigation to be provided upon the request of the victim.  The scope of the information that could be designated as relevant could encompass the entire case files with many documents, some of which by their nature might be required to remain confidential or would be so on the basis of an investigation taking place.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 13 would require all relevant information regarding a decision not to pursue or, indeed, to cease an investigation to be provided.  The reasons for not pursuing or ceasing an investigation could be based on a large number of sources and documents, all of which could be relevant to that decision.<\/p>  <p>  The production of all relevant documents relating to a decision to discontinue a prosecution, as provided for in amendment No. 14, would require the DPP to produce a potentially vast number of files, some of which would be confidential, in order to satisfy this requirement.  I have no doubt that such a requirement would place a pretty significant burden on the office of the DPP and I wonder what the benefit of what might be an unreasonable disclosure to the victim would be.  I do not see how the victim would at all times benefit here.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to look at the objectives of the victims' directive, an important goal of which is to keep the victim informed of the progress of an investigation, not to give him or her access to all of the material that is relevant to it.  These amendments could require vast amounts of information to be provided to victims going far beyond the scope of the directive or, indeed, going far beyond what in the circumstances might be the needs and requirements of victims.  It is important we remain proportionate here and I do not believe these amendments are proportionate and even appropriate, so I am not in a position to accept them.  I believe the legislation adequately covers in practice what in the circumstances might be required to fulfil the stated aim of Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly.  <\/p>  <p>  The changes proposed in amendment No. 15 are already provided for in section 7(2) of the Bill.  Section 7(2)(j) requires the victim to be given information on the sentence imposed or any orders related to the judgment.  Any conditions under which a sentence is suspended form part of that sentence and any conditions attached to a post-release supervision order form part of the order in any event so the provision of this information is already required under the Bill.  I do not believe the insertions of provisions for subcategories of sentences and orders is necessary because we have already provided for the outcome in any event.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 16 seeks to add bail conditions which relate to the victim to the list of information he or she is entitled to receive.  On Committee Stage we added to section 7(2)(a) an amendment which actually meets that issue.  The remainder of amendment No. 16 seeks to have information provided for victims on the procedures to be followed where a bail condition is breached, including information on the offence of witness intimidation.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 17 would require additional information to be provided for a victim on request on various procedures and offences.  I agree with Deputy Mick Wallace that this information is important and should be provided for victims.  Most of it will be provided under section 14 of the Bill.  Under that section, every victim must be individually assessed to identify his or her protection needs and protection measures required, in addition to special measures during the investigation, or special measures that may be necessary in the context of core proceedings.  The protection measures that must be provided for in every circumstance where the victim would benefit from them explicitly include information and advice on personal safety, information and advice on harassment orders, applications for bail add conditions of bail, all of which must be discussed with the victim at the time of the assessment.  The section already provides in a more comprehensive and victim-focused manner for the making available of most of the information which Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly seek in their amendments to have provided.<\/p> <p> While I am conscious of the time - as we are on Report Stage, I might not get another opportunity to speak - in respect of the harassment order under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, a range of amendments to this Bill will be necessary to take account of the 2017 Act, particularly with regard to the provision of criminal evidence.  The amendments are being prepared and will be introduced in the Seanad.  Consideration is being given to whether information on harassment orders under the Act might explicitly be included in the definition and protection measures in this Bill.  Where such an order is made, information will be provided for the victim under section 7.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600028#EE00600","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499347200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I am prepared to accept that the giving of information on some of the issues such as bail conditions and harassment orders is already provided for in a different arena.  In that context, we want to strengthen that measure and add it as an extra burden.  I am definitely pushing the first group of amendments in this broader category which are more important to us.  I think the Minister has made a straw man argument in asking what information would be needed and if we are making it too cumbersome.  That is precisely the point we make.  Victims are entitled to the information.  That is their prerogative and the Bill, in the way it has been designed, specifies that they are entitled to information.  We do not say they should be entitled to receive all information.  In fact, we have said our preference is that they be entitled to receive all information, but as that is not practical - particularly with reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions, some information will have to be confidential - we specifically do not say that.  We instead refer to \"all relevant information\".  Confidential information linked with the prosecution would clearly not be relevant in this scenario.<\/p>  <p>  What it is really about is achieving a culture change and putting the rights and interests of victims first, which is what the directive asks us to do.  When one is dealing with State bodies which are coming from a closed background where they have not had to justify or provide information on their decision-making, the legislation, as we put it forward, should encourage a process of openness, a right victims have.  The Minister says somebody could lean on it and say to the Director of Public Prosecutions that he or she was going to take action against them because the Bill referred to \"all relevant information\" and that he or she had not received all relevant information.  It would then become too cumbersome.  One could make that argument based on the fact that the Bill already refers to \"information\", but we are trying to lessen the challenge to the Director of Public Prosecutions by forcing a culture change in the organisation or assisting of that process by saying it should be opened up to include all relevant information, not just the bare minimum.  It would put a greater onus on the Director of Public Prosecutions and, because of the history of that organisation and what it has traditionally been, when we are in a transition period, it is important to insert the words \"all relevant\".  In fact, by inserting the word \"relevant\", we have met the concerns of the Minister that it would be a free-for-all, that people would receive everything and that the Director of Public Prosecutions would not be able to do anything because the needs of victims were being accommodated.<\/p>  <p>  We have to see this for what it is.  It is the victims directive and about victims' rights which will put more of an onus on the State bodies that deal with victims, as it should, because that is what we are trying to deal with.  Victims have rights, inlcuding a right to be heard and receive information.  The last point is that we all know the damage that has been done where, for example, cases have not proceeded because people did not have access to information and the questions and uncertainties surrounding it.  That, in some ways, revictimised them because they had been kept in the dark.  We are precisely trying to avoid that scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600029#FF00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1499347200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>&quot;All relevant information&quot; raises the question of to what it is relevant.  Is it relevant to the decision or the victim?  I do not disagree with what Deputy Clare Daly has said about the provision of important information.  Of course, it should be provided for the victims and that should be required under the Bill, but many of these points are already provided for within the legislation in another area.  What I want to do and will do between now and the enactment of the legislation is to ensure there are no gaps in it.  I have found what the Deputies have said on Committee Stage and today to be helpful, but in essence I do not want anything in the Bill to be impractical, unworkable, uncertain or unduly onerous in circumstances where there would not be a benefit to the victim.  That is the important point.  We need to ensure what is in the Bill is of practical import.<\/p><p>I want to make the point on the matter of orders on sex offenders that it is the exception.  The orders are not linked with a specific offence but rather the subsequent behaviour of an offender.  It may occur many years later and might not have any connection at all with the victim or the offence.  It may not be possible or appropriate to provide a victim with this information, but I will examine the points further.  Having regard to the fact that we have had a constructive debate so far and not divided and that I have been prepared to accept a number of amendments, I ask the Deputies to accept my <i>bona fides<\/i>on this issue.

I wish to acknowledge the work of the Minister, the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the officials in the Department for taking on board much of the discussion on Committee Stage, even before we got here today.  It is good when we are arguing over an \"and\" or an \"or\".  That is always useful because it shows we have scrutinised the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I am keen to make one point about the amendments that were ruled out of order and that the Government did not take on board on Committee Stage.  These related to the urgent need for the establishment of a victims ombudsman.  On Committee Stage Deputy O'Brien in particular had urged that the Government might bring in some of our amendments.  Unfortunately, the Government did not do so.<\/p>  <p>  My only point is that the recital in the victims directive makes the point about the need for a sole point of access or one-stop-shop.  There is an urgent requirement for a victims ombudsman.  As was said before, many of the groups that deal with victims have engaged in numerous discussions with existing ombudsman offices.  They could see a victims ombudsman being incorporated under one of the existing offices, for example, the Ombudsman for Children or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  It need not cost a great deal of money.  A stand-alone victims ombudsman would be better.  I strongly urge the Minister to return to this option.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the excellent work and input from the voluntary organisations and non-governmental organisations that deal with victims at the coal-face all the time.  Their input has been invaluable.  In particular, I acknowledge the members of the Victims' Rights Alliance who addressed the committee and informed us so well.  They have played a positive role in bringing this Bill to fruition.  Maria McDonald from the Victims' Rights Alliance deserves our special thanks and recognition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600031#HH00900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1499348400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality and the former Minister for Justice and Equality for the work done on this important legislation.  I acknowledge the role played by the justice committee.  We had good review of this legislation at the justice committee.  As Deputy Daly said, we had presentations from the Victims' Rights Alliance.  I too wish to acknowledge the role played by Maria McDonald.<\/p>  <p>  It is important legislation.  It may not get the same coverage that other legislation can get in this House.  However, for the first time serious legislation dealing with the rights of victims has been put before the Oireachtas and has got through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today.  I hope it will not be long before it is fully enacted and in law.<\/p>  <p>  For many years the criminal law has concentrated on the rights of the accused and on the obligations of prosecutors when it comes to prosecuting the accused for criminal offences.  It is right and proper that those laws should exist in statute, but for too long the rights of victims and the place of victims in the criminal justice process has been ignored.  I welcome the fact that this legislation will signify the fact that victims of crime are taken seriously by this State.  Our legal system recognises that they have a role to play.  Our legal system recognises that the State acknowledges that it and its officers have a responsibility to victims of crime.  I hope that in future victims of crime will take their place as individuals who are acknowledged by this State as being individuals who have in many instances suffered life-altering experiences.<\/p>  <p>  It is incumbent on all of us, not only legislators but those in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Ombudsman and other individuals involved in the criminal justice system, to ensure that this legislation is actively used.  We do not want this to become legislation that sits on the shelf and is sometimes availed of.  That is why it is important to continue working on some of the provisions that are discretionary in the legislation.  We should move to ensure that these become mandatory in future and that greater emphasis will be placed by the State agencies, whether An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other agencies, on the fact that when a victim comes to report a crime, that victim has rights that will be acknowledged and respected by the State.  It is a good day because this is being passed through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600031#HH01000","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1499348400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the importance of this legislation.

I look forward to further engaging with members of the Upper House in due course.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies opposite not only for their engagement but for the valuable contributions they have made today and throughout the earlier stages of this legislation.  It is essential that we move towards a situation in Irish law whereby we acknowledge in statutory form the place and rights of the victims of crime.  We have now passed legislation that will provide victims with a measure of information and support to help them through what has been a time of great difficulty and trauma as victims of crime.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the comments of Deputy Daly not only today but at an earlier stage regarding an ombudsman for victims of crime.  I am not against the idea but I believe that we need to embark on considerable research before we are in a position to establish such an office, as proposed by Deputy Daly.  It could well be that at some stage in future we will be in a position to do so.  I would be happy to revisit the issue but I believe it is important in the first instance that we proceed to enact for the first time legislation that will acknowledge in statute the place of victims at the heart of the criminal justice system and the rights of victims to information and support.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for the constructive manner in which they approached this legislation.

The issue arises as a consequence of past transfer of function orders and Department title orders.  The issue was identified in the context of the drafting of provisions for the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill in regard to the introduction of a licensing regime for offshore renewable energy and offshore natural gas storage activities.  The Minerals Development Bill 2015, which amends section 4 of the Continental Shelf Act, represents the first opportunity to address this issue.  It will also allow my Department to continue to progress proposals for offshore renewable energy and offshore gas storage.  <\/p><p>The Continental Shelf Act asserts the State's right to the sea bed and sub-soil outside of our territorial waters, that is, our exclusive economic zone, EEZ, and designated extended continental shelf for the purpose of exploring such sea bed and sub-soil and exploiting its natural resources.  Section 5 of the Act is the key element in the consent process for the placing of structures in the sea bed in the EEZ and the continental shelf.  Sections 5, 7 and 12 of the Act currently reference two Ministers.  Subsection (5) of the Act currently requires that the two Ministers each grant their consent for the construction of structures or the removal of objects from the sea bed.  Section 7 of the Act authorises one Minister, with the consent of the other Minister, to make regulations prohibiting or regulating the discharge of oil, sewage and other harmful substances.  Section 12 relates to the inquiry powers under Act which can be exercised by either Minister.<\/p><p>Over the years the functions of the two Ministers in respect of these three sections have come to vest with one Minister, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  However, the sections continue to reference two Ministers.  To address this issue, the proposed amendments combine the references to the two Ministers into one Minister, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The amendments also propose to introduce a new subsection (2)(a) into section 5 of the Act requiring that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment consult with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport with respect to the safety of an allocation before granting a consent under the section.  These amendments will allow my officials, in liaison with the Attorney General's office, to proceed with setting legislative provisions to regulate offshore renewable energy projects and gas storage projects beyond the foreshore by way of the issue of consents under the 1968 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600032#JJ00600","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1499349000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1499349000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600032#JJ00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1499349000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>In page 30, line 3, to delete &quot;may&quot; and substitute &quot;shall&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>The purpose of these amendments is to ensure greater accountability to the Oireachtas in respect of prospecting licences, environmental issues and environmental protection.  Mistakes have been made in the past in regard to our natural resources, for which, unfortunately, parts of the country such as Silvermines in Tipperary, continue to pay.  There are some good examples of mining and some bad examples of it also.  Overall, this Bill is welcome in that it consolidates the legislation in this area.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 relates to the granting of prospecting licences.  We need to ensure that the Minister shall make regulations in this area and report back.  This will ensure that the manner of making the application for the company or the person, as well as the timeframe in that regard, is specific and regularly reviewed.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 seeks to ensure that regulations around the granting of licences is reviewed every five years, that these regulations will be on the public record and that they provide for a reporting mechanism.  The five-year timeframe is important.  We are being practical about this.  We are not seeking to shorten the timeframe too much or to make things awkward or difficult for people in this sector.  We believe a five-year review is practical.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 seeks to ensure that the Minister publishes a directive in regard to adherence to compliance to protect the environment.  We need to be as firm, legally, as possible in terms of any potential environmental implications arising from the mining practice.  This amendment seeks to place an obligation on the Minister to specifically ensure there is compliance in terms of environmental issues.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 5 proposes that the Minister shall report and review these environmental practices and directives every five years.  Again, we are seeking a regular reporting mechanism under this Act to ensure accountability and transparency.<\/p><p>The aim of these amendments is to ensure accountability in terms of the industry and to ensure we have good environmental practice to protect our natural resources.  At the end of the day, minerals belong to the State and the people and it is important that we have a good regulatory system in place in this area but not regulation that prevents or inhibits legitimate mining.  This is an important industry.  In 2012, the turnover was &euro;426 million and in 2011 it was &euro;454 million, such that this is a substantial industry.  We need to ensure it is not inhibited in any way and that we continue to enjoy the benefits of it in terms of jobs and revenue to the State in terms of taxation, PRSI, royalties and so on.  I will comment further on royalties later.  It is important we allow mining to happen while at the same time protect our environment, wildlife, wildlife habitats and so on.  The aim of these amendments is to ensure we get that balance right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600032#JJ00900","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1499349000,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for these amendments.

There is no mechanism under the legislation whereby fees can take account of market changes.  For them not to be bound by that would be a bad deal.<\/p><p>We have to address the important issue of royalties and the ability of the State to gain the best value possible from our resources.  We must ensure that the State receives a fair and reasonable return from our mineral resources because our people lost out in the past in terms of commercial developments.  That has been a particular problem with our offshore resources but we do not seem to be doing very well with our onshore resources.  I have some figures on that.  We need to achieve the best price possible.  It is worth noting that the State receipts from mining licences and leaseholders was &euro;6.16 million in 2009, &euro;6.9 million in 2010, &euro;9.68 million in 2011 and &euro;8.6 million in 2012.  They appear to be modest figures if we take account of the turnover figure for 2012.  We know that turnover does equal profit.  In some industries there can be a narrow margin of profit, which is understandable.  Mining, in general, tends to have a good turnover depending on what cycle one is at in it.  A benefit of &euro;8.6 million to the State out of a turnover of &euro;426 million appears to be on the slim side. <\/p><p>In amendment No. 9 we ask that the Minister shall seek a fair and reasonable return.  Amendment No. 10 is connected to that.  It proposes that the Minister may have regard to issue concerning commercial interests.  Amendment No. 11 proposes that the Minister must review the royalty regulations every five years instead of every eight years.  That is to allow for greater accountability and also changes in markets and so on.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 12 proposes that the Minister shall report  to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the Oireachtas joint committee on each review of royalty regulations and the rates that royalties are set, which is an important provision.  That will provide for transparency.  While new politics is something of a cliche, we have talked a good deal about strengthening the committees, giving them teeth and a strong role.  We have seen that this is important.  However, people outside this House might view that negatively as it slows down the passage of legislation.  During this D&aacute;il term not as much bad legislation has got through.  There has been greater scrutiny.  While some legislation has gone through with which we would not agree from our political perspective, best practice has been adhered to.  The committees have a role to place.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 13 proposes that the Minister must report to the Oireachtas on the waiving or deferring of a licence fee or royalties from minerals or one-off royalty payments on projected benefits from royalties.  That would ensure greater accountability to the Oireachtas.  We do not consider that to be over-onerous.  It would give the D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas committee their place, ensure people's interests are protected and that we achieve the maximum benefit from our natural resources.

The Minister might elaborate on that.  While it is laudable and worthy to always put the interests of the State first in terms of commercial matters when we are trying to incentivise and attract investment, I wonder if it could be misinterpreted or give rise to some confusion when investors are weighing up the competing jurisdictions in which to invest and enter into commercial activities.

In respect of amendment No. 8, Deputy Stanley has proposed that the mining licence would be reviewed every five years.  I have considered his arguments and I propose to accept that amendment.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of amendments Nos. 9 and 10, the royalty regulations will take into account what is a fair and reasonable rate of return to the State and to private mineral holders.  Mineral exploration and development is a high risk activity.  In the event of a successful discovery, a company would hope to develop the ore body and to cover all costs and make a reasonable profit.  Royalty rates should be set such that they are not punitive - punitive rates results in natural resources not being exploited or developed - but at a rate such that the company can make a reasonable profit and the country can benefit from the development of its natural resources.  As such, I am not proposing to accept these amendments.<\/p>  <p>  I note the debate on royalty regulations and, in that context, I propose to accept the Deputy Stanley's amendment No. 11, which proposes to reduce the frequency of receiving the royalty regulations from eight years to five years.<\/p><p>The Bill also provides for the laying of an annual report before each House of the Oireachtas under section 223, providing details of licences granted, money collected, acquisition and rehabilitation orders made.

Therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.<\/p> <p> I do not propose to accept amendment No. 13 as I believe flexibility is required in this section.  There may be a case where, for instance, prices of minerals decrease considerably and the Minister may at short notice have to make a decision to reduce, waive or defer payments or royalties.  Such a case might arise in order to keep a mine in operation and thus maintain employment.  This would only be expected to arise in very limited circumstances and will require the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Deputy Stanley quoted a number of figures.  He should know that there is also a corporation tax rate of 25% as well as royalties on mining licence fees and I believe the figures quoted were only royalty figures so there is additional tax as well as the tax generated from employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600033#KK01700","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499350200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I welcome that the Minister is accepting amendments Nos. 8 and 11.

It is always a benefit when a job is created and we want to do that.  We are in favour of that and that is why we are being careful on this.  In some offshore mineral extraction industries, royalties have been written off against corporation tax.  I do not know if the Minister of State can clarify this, I know he is not the Minister for Finance, but I would be obliged if he or his officials could clarify this point before we proceed.

In 2006, following incidents at active mine sites in Spain and Romania, the European Union introduced Directive 2006\/21\/EC on the management of waste from extractive industries.  Article 20 of the directive requires member states to produce an inventory of closed mine waste facilities.  The directive was transposed into Irish law by SI 566\/2009, also known as the Waste Management (Management of Waste from the Extractive Industries) Regulations 2009.  Article 20 of the 2009 regulations provides that the EPA shall ensure an inventory of closed waste facilities, including abandoned waste facilities which cause serious negative environmental impacts or which have the potential to become in the medium or short term a serious threat to human health or the environment, is drawn up and periodically updated.  Such an inventory which was to be made available to the public was to be carried out by 1 May 2012.<\/p>  <p>  In response to this requirement, a comprehensive historical mine site inventory was undertaken by the EPA, the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, and the exploration and mining division of my Department which carried out surveys and analyses of mine sites.  The work completed was published and included drawings, maps and diagrams of each of the closed mine sites.  The report on the study entitled, Historic Mine Sites - Inventory and Risk Classification, was produced in 2009 and has resulted in the most comprehensive inventory of closed mine sites in Ireland.  Geochemical site investigations were carried out at each mine site, consisting of analysis of solid waste, surface water, ground water, stream sediments and soil.  There is a detailed review of the geochemistry of each mine site studied for the project.  The report classifies the sites that present the greatest threat to human and animal health and the environment.  The project initially located 220 mine sites across the country at which there had been extraction of minerals using the GSI databases.  Of these, 128 were screened and 110 individual mine sites were identified for inclusion in the historical mine sites study.  In the historical mine sites inventory and risk classification study, 27 historical mine sites and districts were assessed using a source pathway receptor conceptual model and then scored and assigned to one of five classes.  Three mine sites, at Avoca, Silvermines and Tynagh, were scored at the highest risk.  The report is available on the EPA's website.<\/p>  <p>  Given the existing requirement in Irish law for the EPA to maintain a list of mine waste sites and the implementation and publication of the historical mine sites inventory and risk classification study, the Deputy's objectives have already been achieved.

Very often, it is a case of \"dig first and ask questions later\" in terms of any kind of remediation or tidy-up.  It has also been my experience that local authorities are not always best placed or best resourced to manage the remediation that is needed, and sometimes the ship has sailed when they come to try to pursue the operators.  However, I have been advised that the amendment may be slightly difficult to implement because the Department, acting on the Minister's behalf, may not be best placed to understand the local scene in regard to what roads remediation is necessary.  Perhaps there is an argument that the councils might be better placed to do this and perhaps the planning permission process is the right way to proceed.

With regard to the damage caused by access and other mining activities, the relevant local authority has the key role.  Mining operations are subject to planning permissions and the local authority engages with the company concerned on such issues.  Planning permission is purely a matter for the relevant local authority.  Outside of planning requirements, the Bill makes provision for compensation for any damage or nuisance caused by a mining licensee in section 98(1), which states:<\/p><blockquote>Where the exercise of-(a) a right under a mining licence,<br \/><br \/>(b) an ancillary underground right, or<br \/><br \/>(c) an ancillary surface right,causes a nuisance, or damage to the surface of any land or to water supplies, the licensee is liable to pay compensation for such nuisance or damage.<\/blockquote><p>In addition, section 79(1) provides that the Minister may make regulations setting out a number of conditions, including financial security.  Section 79(1)(r) is the relevant paragraph, and refers to, &quot;the provision of financial security in order to ensure that the licensee can pay compensation for damages or nuisance for which he or she may be liable under <i>section 98<\/i>&quot;.<\/p><p>These sections provide that the licensee has a strict liability to pay compensation in respect of any nuisance or damage caused and that financial security can be required from a licensee to ensure compensation is paid.  The provisions as set out in sections 98 and 79(1)(r) take a broader approach than the Deputy's proposed amendment in that they are not restricted to either infrastructure or a local authority.  The broader nature of this provision is appropriate.  A provision was contained in the Minerals Development Act 1940 whereby a licence holder was liable to pay compensation in the event of any damage to the surface of any lands.  In addition, all modern mining licences currently contain a condition in respect of financial security which must be put in place to ensure such compensation is paid.  Section 79(1)(r) provides the legislative basis for the provision as currently contained in the mining licences and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600037#OO00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1499351700,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I have listened to the Minister of State's reply.  Given water is a huge concern, I am glad that he has given assurances that section 79 of the Bill caters for that issue.  With regard to the local authorities, the problem is that their planning enforcement sections are under-resourced and at times hamstrung.  They are at times going after minor breaches of the planning code while major breaches are ignored.  In the light of experience during the years, I believe many other representatives would concur with this.  The breaches by major companies are at times not followed through as diligently because the local authority may fear it is taking on something that is too big and which it does not have the powers to pursue.  I believe this is an issue.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the assurances given by the Minister of State, but I ask that the point be noted.

During this period of consultation, members of the public and other interested parties shall be free to submit their views on the proposals.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>The amendment has a broad and specific purpose, namely, to achieve a degree of reuse of abandoned mines.  It follows from conversations with the Science Foundation Ireland centre, iCRAG, in regard to the dormant potential of abandoned mines, where rare earth minerals which were once thought to be of no use were included in tailings.  Some of the material that was essentially thrown away or left behind is now understood through research to be of great value in the electronics industry and elsewhere.  There may be significant merit to revisiting some of these mine sites to investigate their potential.  In parallel, where there may have been less than perfect clean-up or closedown of these sites in the past, there is an opportunity to revisit them, both to re-extract commercial or valuable minerals still contained within the tailings and also to avail of the opportunity to remediate and do a better job on clean-up.  This also ties in very much with the idea of the circular economy whereby, rather than doing everything from scratch, we re-use, revisit and recycle.  To take something that was considered waste and turn it into something that is valuable in every sense is a very valuable thing to do.<\/p><p>That is the specific purpose of the amendment.  As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesman on research, I believe every Department should encompass a research element to its work.  The broader concept of the amendment is to support and facilitate this in legislation in that the Minister and the Department would have a remit to commission or sponsor research along the lines of the various mineral rehabilitation opportunities that still present at some of these sites.<\/p><p>The amendment states \"any proposals emanating from this section which involves the revisiting of formerly disused sites shall engage in a period of public consultation prior to activity commencing at that site\".  This is to assuage the concerns of local communities that there might be activity on a site that was thought to be closed down.  It is recommended in the subsection of the amendment that there be a public consultation exercise to ascertain the views of the community and stakeholders prior to anything significant proceeding on such sites.  I commend the amendment to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600037#OO01200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499352300,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I welcome the amendment which is very positive.

The measures proposed for remediation are very important.

He raised the issue on Second and Committee Stages.  Under existing minerals legislation, State mining leases require the lessee to work minerals fully under the lease terms.  It should be said the modern mines at Navan, Lisheen and Galmoy are better equipped to extract the full mineral potential of the mine material than older mine sites.  There is some industry interest in reworking mine waste on legacy mine sites.  However, this is at an early stage and will be driven by the economic potential.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 the Geological Survey of Ireland commissioned a short call project, an economic assessment of Irish mining waste, to be undertaken by Aurum Exploration Services.  The project aimed to analyse samples from mine waste sites throughout Ireland.  Of the nine sites sampled, Avoca returned the most positive results.  The study recommended further analysis of waste dumps at Avoca.  Unfortunately, the majority of historical mine sites sampled were reported to have no economic value.  The provisions of the Bill facilitate the potential reuse of abandoned mines and associated waste.  The definition of minerals in section 2 of the Bill includes all substances, including scheduled minerals that occur naturally in or on land or that occur in extracted waste.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy James Lawless' amendment identifies an omission in the Bill, as published, on the important role of the Minister in promoting sectoral research and innovation.  While the Department has commissioned research such as the Aurum report and facilitated research activities such as iCRAG on an administrative basis, it is important that this role be formalised in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment also identifies two new focuses for research - research into recycling, reusing or reclaiming extracted waste where this is environmentally sound, thus supporting the concept of the circular economy, and research that may create opportunities where the reuse of mine waste could contribute to the rehabilitation of a legacy mine site.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputy's concerns that communities in areas where there is legacy mining may wish to express their views on potential research in this area and he has provided a mechanism for same.

It has been brought forward to give effect to one of a number of commitments arising under the Stormont House Agreement implementation plan, known as the Fresh Start agreement.  Deputies will recall that in September 2015 the Irish and British Governments convened a talks process in Northern Ireland to address the issue of implementation of the Stormont House Agreement of 2014, as well as trust and confidence issues stemming from the legacy of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland that had led to difficulties at the Northern Ireland Executive in the course of 2015.  Following ten weeks of talks, the Fresh Start agreement was concluded on 17 November 2015.  The agreement provides a roadmap for implementation of many aspects of the Stormont House Agreement of 23 December 2014, including measures to support institutional reform at the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive, as well as financial and welfare reform in Northern Ireland.  The agreement also sets out a strategic approach to ending paramilitarism in Northern Ireland and tackling organised crime, especially cross-Border crime.  It contains a firm commitment to achieve a society free of paramilitarism, to work for the disbandment of all paramilitary organisations and their structures and to challenge paramilitary attempts to control communities.<\/p>  <p>  An important thread that ran through the talks was the need to tackle the legacy of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland on a cross-cutting basis, if you will, to see it as a whole of society issue, rather than solely through the lens of security and policing.  In that regard, among the key elements of the agreement is the establishment of a joint agency task force as provided for in the agreement.<\/p><p>The task force is a cross-Border, multi-agency body which has been established to enhance co-operation between police, revenue and other law enforcement agencies, at both strategic and operational levels, in tackling cross-Border organised crime.  It is led by the police and revenue services in both jurisdictions.  It has been taking forward a range of targeted actions to tackle serious criminal activities which exploit the Border and impact, in particular on Border communities.<\/p> <p> Another key element is the Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s strategy to end paramilitarism.  In line with the agreement, the Executive appointed an expert panel to develop recommendations for the disbandment of paramilitary groups.  The panel comprised Lord Alderdice, Professor Monica McWilliams and Mr. John McBurney.  It reported to the Executive in June 2016.  Based on the panel&rsquo;s report, the Executive published its action plan on tackling paramilitary activity, criminality and organised crime on 19 July 2016.<\/p> <p> The action plan adopts an Executive-wide strategic approach to measures aimed at ending paramilitary activity, including measures to promote a culture of lawfulness, to support persons moving away from paramilitary activity to do so, to tackle criminality linked to paramilitaries and to address broader societal challenges, such as educational and economic disadvantage that can be exploited by paramilitarism.<\/p> <p> The Fresh Start agreement also provides for the establishment by the two Governments of a body to monitor and report on the implementation of the various measures in the agreement aimed at ending paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.  This body is the Independent Reporting Commission.  In my previous capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I signed an international agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom on the establishment of the Independent Reporting Commission on 13 September 2016.  The agreement, which is included in the Schedule, outlines the agreed structure, functions, objectives and other necessary arrangements for the commission.  The Bill before the House will provide for these in law.  It is the intention that reporting on the implementation of the Executive&rsquo;s action plan will be a priority for the commission to help to support and to ensure its implementation by the Executive.<\/p> <p> The Bill has 12 sections which provide for the establishment of the commission in accordance with the terms of the international agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p> Section 1 contains the definitions of terms used.  Section 2 provides for the establishment and status of the commission as an independent body with the legal capacity of a body corporate.  Section 3 articulates the objective and functions of the commission.  These are set out in the agreement between the Governments establishing the commission and they follow directly from the Fresh Start agreement.<\/p> <p> The commission&rsquo;s primary objective is the promotion of progress towards ending paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland in the interests of long-term peace and stability in society, and stable and inclusive devolved government in Northern Ireland.  Regarding the functions of the commission in dealing with the remaining threat of paramilitary activity, the commission will report on the progress being made towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> Section 4 provides that the Minister will provide the commission, on a basis to be determined by the Government, with funding, premises, facilities and other services as may be necessary for its proper functioning.  The costs of the commission will be shared between the Governments.<\/p> <p> Section 5 provides for the necessary privileges, immunities and inviolabilities of the commission.  These provisions are particularly important given the sensitivity of some of the matters with which the commission will be dealing.<\/p> <p> Section 6 sets out certain duties for the commission in the performance of its functions, notably that it will not do anything that might put at risk the life or safety of any person, have a prejudicial effect in Ireland or the United Kingdom on national security interests, legal proceedings, or the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of crime.  These provisions in sections 5 and 6 are particularly important given the obviously sensitive nature of the matters with which the commission will be dealing.  They are also important in ensuring there is no unintentional interference with the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in their ongoing work to tackle paramilitary groups and criminal gangs.<\/p> <p> Section 7 provides for controls on the disclosure of information obtained in the performance of their functions, unless authorised by or on behalf of the commission.  It also facilitates co-operation between the commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The lifespan anticipated for the commission in the course of the Fresh Start agreement talks was about five years.  Section 8 provides for the future dissolution of the commission by mutual agreement of the two Governments.<\/p> <p> Section 9 amends the Freedom of Information Act 2014 to preclude the application of the Act to the commission.  This is required by the nature of the sensitive information with which the commission will deal.<\/p> <p> Section 10 provides for the laying of the commission&rsquo;s reports to the two Governments before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commission will report at least annually.  Sections 11 and 12 are standard provisions for legislation relating to the expenses arising being paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, as well as the Short Title and commencement arrangements.<\/p> <p> As provided for in the Fresh Start agreement, the commission will be a four-member body.  The Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive have advanced matters by nominating the four commissioners.  The Irish Government has nominated Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Connor, a former Secretary General to the President and a respected former diplomat.  The British Government has nominated Mr. Mitchell Reiss, the US special envoy to Northern Ireland between 2003 and 2007.  The Northern Ireland Executive has nominated Mr. John McBurney, a well known and respected Northern Ireland solicitor and Professor Monica McWilliams, who has a long experience in politics and public service in Northern Ireland.  Mr. John McBurney and Professor Monica McWilliams were members of the Executive&rsquo;s expert panel on the disbandment of paramilitaries which reported in June 2016.  All four nominated commissioners have extensive experience of the situation in Northern Ireland.  They will have the full support of the Irish and British Governments and of the parties in Northern Ireland in bringing forward their work.<\/p> <p> There is an ongoing process of talks at Stormont aimed at establishing the Executive following the Assembly elections earlier this year.  While much progress has been made in reaching agreement on a range of important issues, it has not yet proved possible to finalise an agreement which will facilitate the formation of the Executive for the time being.  That is, of course, a disappointment shared by every Member.  The Government maintains its strong, ongoing commitment to the success of the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement and we will continue to play our full part in supporting the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland.  My successor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has encouraged all the parties in Northern Ireland to maintain contact with each other over the coming weeks with the aim of securing agreement.<\/p> <p> The Bill is not without precedent.  It follows in many respects the arrangements successfully put in place in regard to other bodies established to further the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement, notably the Independent Monitoring Commission.  The Independent Reporting Commission will have an important role to play in bringing forward work aimed at bringing an end to paramilitarism and its insidious legacy which impacts on all communities in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600038#PP02000","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499352900,"counter":530,"content":"<p>It is the first occasion on which I can publicly thank the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, for his work as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I wish him well in his current role in the justice ministry.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this legislation which is one of the key outcomes of the Fresh Start agreement of November 2015.  The Bill creates a new monitoring body to review and report on any paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.  It is a sad reflection on both Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP that such a body is still required almost 20 years on from the Good Friday Agreement.  The peace process was always about more than the absence of violence.  However, the zero-sum attitudes taken by the two main parties, which has led to the current impasse in Stormont, has hobbled the immense potential and optimism of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  This sterile political environment has allowed paramilitaries to continue to blight Northern Ireland in both communities.  This Bill was necessitated by the MI5-PSNI confirmation of the continued existence of the IRA and its role in formulating Sinn F&eacute;in policy.  Sinn F&eacute;in has fundamental questions to answer around its links to the IRA which has no part in a democratic state.  It is now time for Sinn F&eacute;in and DUP to move beyond tribal partisanship and work to ensure Northern Ireland is capable of addressing the most important challenge of our lifetime, namely, Brexit.  The existence of the IRA, its highly lucrative criminal network and role in setting the political agenda raises fundamental questions for Sinn F&eacute;in.  It must ensure there is no role for such armed groups in a democratic state.<\/p><p>That we are still dealing with paramilitarism in 2017 is a sad reflection on Northern politics.  The <i>rigor mortis<\/i>of the approach of both Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP has stifled development and fostered deepening cynicism that is leaving many communities behind.  These communities are ripe territories for paramilitary groups from which to operate.  The current crisis is the latest in an exhausting series of difficulties.  In the face of Brexit, the most serious geopolitical challenge this island has faced in generations, the Northern Executive remains in deep freeze.  The parties have to get their act together and find a compromise, recognising that it involves movement on both sides.  <br\/><br\/>The purpose of the IRC is to promote progress towards ending paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland in the interests of long-term peace and stability and stable and inclusive devolved government in Northern Ireland.  An international agreement between the Irish and British Governments was signed on 13 September 2016 and provides for the establishment of the IRC as an independent body.  The IRC will need to be established in the domestic law of each jurisdiction, as appropriate.  The nominations for the membership of the IRC have been announced by the Irish and British Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il welcome the nominations.  The names have been mentioned by the Minister.<br\/><br\/>In July 2005 the IRA formally ended its armed campaign and ordered all volunteers to assist in the development of purely political and democratic programmes through exclusively peaceful means.  It stated volunteers must not engage in any other activities whatsoever.  It subsequently decommissioned in September 2005.  The St. Andrews Agreement, dated October 2006, saw Sinn F&eacute;in agree to the PSNI and the re-establishment of the Northern Assembly in May 2007 following its suspension in 2003 after the Sinn F&eacute;in spy ring controversy.  In the intervening years, however, a number of serious incidents occurred that underline the fact that the IRA has not, as Deputy Gerry Adams said, &quot;gone away&quot;.  Events such as the brutal murder of Paul Quinn in October 2007 in County  Monaghan, revelation of the systematic cover-up of sex abuse in republican ranks and the recent tit-for-tat murders expose a continued presence. <br\/><br\/>The political crisis that led to the 2015 Fresh Start agreement arose from the investigation into the murder of Kevin McGuigan in 2015 which was believed to have been in retaliation for the murder earlier that summer of Jock Davison, a senior republican involved in the murder of Robert McCartney in 2005.  The investigation revealed the PSNI's belief the IRA continued to exist and was possibly involved in the murder.  Subsequently the Garda Commissioner backtracked on a February 2015 letter to state her belief the IRA existed.  The former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers also confirmed that she believed it existed.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Northern chair Bobby Storey was arrested but not charged in connection with the murder.  It is not credible for Deputy Gerry Adams or any other member of Sinn F&eacute;in to say Sinn F&eacute;in has &quot;no special responsibility&quot; for the IRA.  They are one and the same and any objective commentator or historian recognises that, behind the spin, that is a fact.<br\/><br\/>In October 2015 MI5 and the PSNI issued a report on paramilitary activity that had been requested following the McGuigan murder.  It reached very disturbing conclusions about the continued existence of the Provisional IRA, its army council and ongoing role in criminality and the belief of Provisional IRA members that the army council set out strategy for both the IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in.  That the army council decides Sinn F&eacute;in strategy is profoundly anti-democratic as it means that a political party operating in both jurisdictions is being directed by an illegal armed gang.  There is absolutely no space for this in any democracy.  <br\/><br\/>A separate Garda report set out how &euro;28 million worth of criminal assets had been extracted by the Criminal Assets Bureau from 50 IRA members since 1996.  This is part of a broader criminal empire worth a total of &euro;500 million, or &euro;70 million per annum.  One has to ask where this money goes.<br\/><br\/>Northern Ireland remains engulfed in yet another political crisis that has led to a protracted paralysis in the institutions.  The lack of progress in getting the institutions up and running is deeply disappointing and underlines our concerns that zero-sum politics is sustaining fertile ground for paramilitaries.<br\/><br\/>Let me mention some paramilitary incidents involving both loyalist and republican groups.  A report entitled, Police Recorded Security Situation Statistics, makes for alarming reading in regard to paramilitary activity on both sides.  In 2007-08, one death due to paramilitary activity was recorded, whereas in 2016-17 the number was five.  In 2007-08 there were 42 shooting incidents, whereas there were 61 in 2017.  In 2007-08 there were 23 bombing incidents, whereas there were 29 in 2016-17.  In 2007-08 there were 45 casualties of paramilitary-style assaults, whereas there were 66 in 2016-17.  The list goes on, with the exceptions being reductions in the numbers of firearms, rounds of ammunition and quantities, in kilograms, of explosives found.  These statistics, in themselves, show the uncertainty, instability and the continuing paramilitarism that needs to stop.  That is why Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this legislation.<br\/><br\/>Owing to the tight numbers in the House of Commons, the Tory Government is reliant on DUP support.  The DUP has secured a deal that will see &pound;1 billion over two years and further flexibility, amounting to around &pound;500 million, already committed to.  The deal appears to bypass the Barnett formula used in allocating funding across the component nations of the United Kingdom.  This has drawn criticism from other devolved administrations.  We hope there will be a focus on the key Stormont House Agreement and Fresh Start agreement measures, with the emphasis being placed on projects such as the A5 motorway to Derry which will be a key piece of infrastructure that will benefit the north west of the country.  In addition, the Narrow Water bridge project, in my county, should be completed, using some of the moneys to be made available.  It would be of great benefit to counties Down and Louth, in particular, given the tourism opportunities offered.  The Irish Government should uphold its commitment in respect of these measures. <br\/><br\/>The botched renewable heat incentive scheme which could cost up to &pound;490 million acted as the catalyst for the crisis.  Behind the immediate problems, however, lies a deeper malaise that has afflicted the institutions in recent years.  The political system has to move on from this addiction to crisis politics.  In the past few years there have been annual problems with the institutions, punctuated by a series of new agreements and arrangements designed to keep the system ticking over.  Since 2013 alone, there have been the Haass talks, the Stormont House Agreement and the Fresh Start agreement which aim to reinvigorate a stagnant political process.  History has shown it requires both Governments to engage fully and honestly to keep the peace process moving forward.  The DUP's leverage cannot be allowed to stymie progress and undermine long-established British policy for the sake of short-term political gain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600039#QQ00200","speaker":"1332","continuing":true}]
