He is joined today by Mr. Brian Hill, senior auditor.  The first item on our agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 8 February 2018.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  I have received apologies from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  The next item on the agenda is matters arising from the minutes.  Everything referred to in the minutes is moving ahead and we can move on.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence for today's meeting.  Correspondence No. 1079 is a briefing document from Dr. Brian Keegan on corporation tax.  We will discuss this in private session and there may some additions and changes as a result of this morning's meeting.  We will have a final document for next week.  I propose that we discuss it in private session but not publish it at the moment.  Obviously we will publish the final version next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Under category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up committee meetings and other items for publishing, the first item is No. 1067B received from Mr. Des Fitzgerald, president of University of Limerick, following the committee's request for an update on the implementation of the recommendations of University of Limerick's internal audit review of August 2017.  I believe we should take up Mr. Fitzgerald on his offer to provide further updates and request a copy of the Crowe Howarth review mentioned in the letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>At our last meeting, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to respond to claims that the university or people in it may have misled his office.  He said at the time he was doing his own report.  Obviously, we must come back to it at some point because we have dealt with it in the past.  We have the internal audit report which makes 42 recommendations.  The correspondence states 17 of the recommendations have been implemented and 25 are in progress.  It also states significant changes have been made to senior management structures.  Any time there is a report where issues arise in a public institute I ask the same question, which is who is held to account.  In this instance I do not know who is held to account.  It seems there is some restructuring going on, but if individuals misled the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General or if there were errors, procedural lapses, process failures or whatever by individuals, who is held to account in the university?  It does not seem on the face of it that anybody was, except there was a consolidation of positions.<\/p> <p>  In any event we have these 42 recommendations, and I am just looking for guidance on how we deal with it.  Perhaps this will depend on when the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General concludes.  Is this the basis on which we will bring in the Accounting Officer?  Should we do it before that?  I do not know.  We have this internal audit review which is being implemented as we speak.  We will have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I imagine, sometime in the summer or perhaps before it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#B00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518685200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>My office is drafting a report at present.

Looking back to when we first dealt with this matter and, as a committee, put a spotlight on this issue, we might remind ourselves that we were told by the HEA that there was no problem and nothing to see.  I felt there was pushback against members of this committee even asking questions.  The attitude was pretty much one that we should keep our hands off this issue, that members did not understand it, that it was very complex, that commercialising intellectual property is much more complex than we could have imagined, and so on.  That tone troubled me at the time.  Far from there being nothing to see here, we now have a report which shows that there was a lack of uniformity, to say the least, across the institutes, that the policy in some areas was quite weak, and that conflicts of interest in that area needed to be strengthened.  The report makes recommendations which I think are good and which will strengthen the ability of institutes of technology and universities to protect themselves as well as taxpayers.  All of that is to the good.<\/p> <p>  A separate report into Waterford is imminent.

We had a discussion on this last time and I think it was accepted that it was not as difficult as was being suggested.  We will have to come back to it at some point, maybe we should wait until the report comes from Waterford, but Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the HEA are all players in this.  We now have a report which makes changes and which came about as a result of the work of this committee.  I still have a number of questions.  I am not satisfied that all the concerns that we raised have been dealt with sufficiently in the report.<\/p> <p>  I will also put it on record that it is quite interesting that this report, the generic one, has been published and then we will have a Waterford report.  We cannot pre-empt what will be in that but it is somewhat similar to what has happened in other areas of the third level sector.  There was a \"Prime Time\" programme which highlighted issues on accountability, and the Minister published a report which said the Department was going to make changes.  Then our report came out.  The Department can point to its report and say that it is dealing with the matter already.  An element of that is going on in the HEA.<\/p> <p>  We have to come back to it.  We cannot merely bookend it and say that we have the reports and that is it.  Issues remain.  I propose that once we have the Waterford report and this national review of all institutes, we return to it.  I ask that Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, some of the third level institutes and the HEA would come before the committee and we would do a session on the matter because it seems to be very much geared toward the commercialisation part of it, and there seems to be a bias towards the enterprise side of it rather than protecting the institutes.  Several members have expressed concerns in that regard.  Questions remain to be asked.

Very often, industry wants to locate close to universities and does that for a range of different reasons.  Much of it has to do with partnering with universities.  There is no doubt there is a benefit and there can be a two-way benefit.  A lot of that is very desirable.  However, I was less than impressed with the HEA.  I thought it was very underwhelming in terms of its contributions at the committee.  We are relying on it to evaluate something it was not great at.  I agree with Deputy Connolly in that regard.  It may well be an academic who can do this but I would like to see an international comparator about how this is handled in other countries because we need to compare it to something else or somewhere else where there is something in the same family and where there is good practice.  I am quite sure that one of the business schools will have carried out some work in that area.  It is a bit ironic to ask an academic to input into something like this but I think we might not be getting a good look at the way we should be progressing on this by relying exclusively on the HEA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#D00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I have a final contribution.  As one of those who asked the questions and took an active interest in this, I want to put on the record that an awful lot of good work is being done by universities and institutes of technology in research and development, co-location and commercialising intellectual property.  None of that is bad.  Legitimate questions were asked about process, conflicts of interest and how the companies are established.  The point was that I felt we were being pushed back a bit on what were genuine concerns.  We now have two reports that verify those concerns.  They are a vindication of the questions we were asking.  The HEA was asleep at the wheel when it came to this issue because it was, essentially, throwing it back to Science Foundation Ireland.  I think Knowledge Transfer Ireland is the body that looks at it.  It possibly had a role but certainly the HEA has a role from a governance perspective and it allowed a situation to arise where there were different policies in different institutes of technology and universities.  Some were good while others were not so good.  If we now have more uniformity and a strengthened policy that underpins this, that is for the good.  The HEA should reflect on the fact that the questions we put are for the good because we want to see an improvement and if we get an improvement here, that will be good.  When we raised this issue previously, I was inundated with emails from people who work in this area telling me that we do not fully understand it and are being anti-enterprise and negative.  That is not the case.  At all times, we recognised that there is huge benefit to institutes of technology and universities engaging in research and development and with the private sector and individuals within those institutions commercialising their intellectual property.  None of that was seen as bad.  Genuine concerns were raised that have been dealt with to some extent but I do not think they have been dealt with fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#D00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>To conclude on this item of correspondence, members will recall that we included this topic - the full costing from all taxpayer sources - in our report last summer.  We received and considered the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and rejected it.  It just said it was impossible to do it.  The Revenue Commissioners expect people to do it if they are looking for tax credits.  It appears that the public service has not been on top of this.<\/p> <p>  No. 1077B, the note we received with this correspondence, is from the director of Knowledge Transfer Ireland, Alison Campbell.  We just asked a simple question about a spin-out project currently being considered for 2018.  It was a simple question and we received a half-page reply.  It states that it is at various stages of maturation and that any list of spin-out prospects will necessarily be larger than any number of prospects that ultimately launch spin offs.  We know that.  The note stated that the list of spin-outs being considered for 2018 is a snapshot at a point in time.  That is all we asked for.  The note said that in the timescale for response to the request from the committee, it was not possible to gather details of the number of spin-out opportunities under consideration across the 21 higher education authorities.  That is a clear admission that it does not have that information, which is shocking in its own right.  The note goes on to say that details can be included by way of a follow-on so we wait to receive that.  We will ask for that.  The note said that due to commercial sensitivity, the names of the technologies cannot be made public.  That is fine.  The note said that by way of context, the annual knowledge transfer survey showed that Ireland is creating an average of 26 to 30 new spin-out companies per annum from its 21 higher education authorities and a further five research performing organisations, RPOs.  The committee can see there is quite a bit in there.  Members can see that we asked a simple question and Knowledge Transfer Ireland said it did not have the information and would try to find it.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was asked how much money was going in and it told us it did not know.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#D00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Where did that come from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#D00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The covering letter from the HEA is No. 1077B1.

There is a special report on motor taxation which feeds into funding of local authorities.  When dealing with central government funding of local authorities, I propose that we address the Appropriation Accounts for the then Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the parent Department.  We will also have at that meeting a very senior representative from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland because up to 15% of all funding to local authorities comes from that Department.<\/p><p> When those officials are in, we may also deal with the motor taxation account special report as a separate item.

Given that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport representatives will be here - and motor taxation was generally collected through local authorities but has now gone to the Department, a matter on which a special report was issued - we will deal with all of that on one day as motor tax is the key element of the local government fund at this stage.<\/p><p> Will the Comptroller and Auditor General tell us who is responsible for the local government fund?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#E02500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518685200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Who is responsible for the collection of motor tax since the realignment of Government Departments?

This layer of government is the most important in people's every day lives.  We deal with headline figures here.  It is this level of government that we rely on for implementation of policy relating to housing, roads - which we discussed this week - or a new strand of social policy that local government is involved in.  I agree with my colleagues that we should have clarity of thought before these witnesses came in.  The worst thing would be to get bogged down in a quagmire that would suit the witnesses down to the ground, to run down the clock all day.  I know Deputy Murphy has said that it is a complicated layer of funding to work out and she is right but at the same time there is a Houdini act going on as was mentioned with regard to the local government fund, which no longer exists.<\/p><p>More Houdini tricks were pulled with the introduction of the local property tax whereby aspects that had previously been funded by the Department would become self-funded, as it were, by the councils.<\/p><p> The Chairman and Deputy Murphy mentioned progression, but I will tell them what that progression has been.  The Chairman stated that he wanted the principal funders to appear before us and make themselves answerable.  If so, we had better invite IBEC or some business representative to attend on the same day as well, given that 36% of all local government funding comes from the business people and SMEs of this country.  The past ten years have seen a 10% increase in the income derived from rates because local government has been starved of central funding like a mangy dog.  Income from rates has increased from a percentage in the mid-20s to 36% and now amounts to &euro;1.5 billion.  The Valuation Office appeared before us a couple of weeks ago, but we might as well have had my children in answering questions, seeing as how no one would take responsibility.  The Valuation Office told us it was the Department's responsibility.  When we asked the departmental official who was sitting here at the time, we were told that it was the Minister's responsibility.  I am not spending a day doing that in a couple of weeks' time with no one taking responsibility for the questions we ask.<\/p><p> I agree with the Chairman.  Let us bring everyone in, but some of the chief funders of local government are businesses.  IBEC and others emailed us about the pressures they were under on the day the Valuation Office appeared before us, although it was a pity they did so a bit late.  I would like to see representatives of business owners appear before us to discuss the imposition upon them.  When one considers that rates account for 36% of overall income, the local property tax pales into insignificance.<\/p><p> When we put it to Mr. Paul Lemass on the day that local government structures were underfunded, I was worried when he said - members can check the record - that there would be a reappraisal of the property tax, providing an opportunity to bring in more funding.  We are entering a dangerous sphere.<\/p><p> This is a big day for our committee.  The Department has the most impact, not just on ordinary people's lives but on business people and employers as well.  Business representatives should be present on the day, given that they are one of the chief income suppliers of local government.  In that way, we could have a debate in the round as to how local government is funded, where the money is going and what we are doing.<\/p><p> Deputy Cullinane mentioned the quagmire in funding for housing.  In my county a few weeks ago, &euro;11.2 million was supplied in a grant by the Department.  There was a big announcement.  Only 40 houses are being built, though.  That works out at nearly &euro;300,000 per house for social housing.  Something is wrong, and it is that site acquisition was built into the cost of each house.  When the council applied for the site acquisition cost, it was told the amount would be given to it, but only as part of the delivery of the 40 houses.  We will have many questions for these people on the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#F02000","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Grand.

The sector accounts for 37% of the overall contribution, having increased by 10% in the past decade, but the Department has starved one side.  Last year, for the first time in many years, many city councils increased their rates because there was a bit of buoyancy which allowed them to do so.  Populations are getting bigger and more is being demanded of councillors and officials, who are now under some pressure.  The only place they can get a bit of extra income is to increase rates.  I accept what Deputies Cullinane, Murphy and Connolly said about our remit and what can be examined, but they are getting off the hook by putting it onto this sector.  Over the past ten years it has grown from under &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion and it is only going to get worse.  We are discussing central government funding to a sector and there is scope to examine it on the day.

We propose to bring in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, because it sets the policy, the Department of Education and Skills, which is one of the biggest users of PPPs, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the principal user, and the National Development Finance Agency.  I want a letter to go from this committee to each of those organisations because I know what will happen otherwise.  They will talk about commercial sensitivity so that we can discuss nothing.  I do not know how far we will get but we can certainly get farther than a response such as that.  I propose we write to each of them asking them to provide as much financial information as they can by way of a briefing note a fortnight in advance of the meeting.  In particular, we will ask them to justify their inability to give us full commercial details of any contract more than five years old.  Commercial sensitivity might be valid at a certain point in time but not for ever.  This will give us the opportunity to consider the information before we have the public meeting.<\/p> <p>  We are holding over 29 March for the third level sector.  There are three or four different topics but we will not come to them today.  On 19 April, it will be the Department of Finance to discuss Government debt and the Exchequer outturn for the year, which is a key ingredient of our work.  On 26 April, we have the Department of Justice and Equality on the development of its IT system, on which there is a special chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will deal with the Garda internal audit report on its IT contracts on that day too.<\/p> <p>  On 3 May, we have Vote 29 - Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, particularly in relation to RT&Eacute;, which is substantially funded.  Deputy Cullinane is keen on this but on the day the Department was here it said it was obliged to have a service level agreement in place with RT&Eacute; and that it received &euro;170 million each year, the majority of its funding.  The Department has failed in its duty to do its work so the Committee of Public Accounts will do the job.  There is widespread agreement because the majority of its funding is from public funds and it is appropriate to bring the organisation in on that basis.  We will not get into anything about its editorial content as it is not in our remit.  We are going to discuss the financial aspects of the organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#H00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I presume there will be scope to look at items such as broadband.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#H01000","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>We had the Department in on that issue before Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#H01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Things have moved on since then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#H01200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>We have a draft report which we are going to discuss and that is in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#H01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#H01400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>The RT&Eacute; issue was mentioned at the time and we are dealing with that.

Towards the end of June we will have the National Treasury Management Agency because its 2017 accounts should be out by then.  On 28 June, we will have Revenue back to discuss chapters in the report of the Comptroller and General relating to the tax appeals office.  Before we break up, we will have the HSE's financial statement for 2017.  The HSE is normally very good and has this ready by May or June.  On 12 July, we have financial reporting in the public service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  There are issues not on the list to which we have to come back.  We might deal with the Courts Service through the Department of Justice and Equality.

I will try to indicate those amendments I will be opposing and those I will be supporting as I go on.<\/p><p>In respect of amendment Nos. 157 and 160, which are related, these are amendments proposed by Dr. Patrick O'Brien, who was referred to in previous sessions.  We have had a debate recently about the Government requiring, or at least the perception that it requires, discretion in relation to appointments.  I refer to the conflict between that and the desire to have a fully transparent process with the judicial appointments commission making as much of the decision as possible.<\/p><p>Where the person appointed to judicial office is not a person who was recommended by the judicial appointments commission, amendment No. 157 requires that a reasoned written decision would be published in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il <\/i>explaining the reason for that person's appointment outside of the judicial appointments commission process.  Similarly, amendment No. 160 relates to the placing of a statement before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 30 days of that appointment giving a written decision as to why a person was appointed who was not nominated by the commission.  There is clear and obvious sense to it.  Whatever the arguments about constitutionality, if the committee accepts the case that the Government must have a greater degree of discretion than the judicial appointment commission provides to it, then in the exceptionally rare circumstances that people would be appointed outside this process the Oireachtas and the public deserve to have an understanding as to why this was the case.  This provides for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#D05300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Before returning to the Minister, does anyone else wish to make a contribution on that or will I go to the Minister first?

Amendment No. 157 would require a proposed new subsection (2), the publication in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il <\/i>of a reasoned written explanation of any decision.  In addition, under the proposed new subsection (3), the persons who are recommended by the commission must not be identified in such publication.  My difficulty is that the amendment would require the Government to explain in writing the hows and wherefores of why, in any particular instance, the advice given to the President in regard to an appointment may concern a candidate other than the one actually recommended by the commission.  It, therefore, puts a clear onus and responsibility on the Government to justify actions taken on foot of the exercise of what is a constitutional provision.  There is that problem but aside from that, I am not sure what the value or benefit of such an amendment might be, and what its practical impact might be in terms of fairness to all those involved in the process, be they a recommended candidate or a candidate that did not make the cut.  I note what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said, that it is a desire on his part for increased transparency around the process of how, in what circumstances and in what way the Government would advise the President as to the appointment.  I have said this before and rather than delaying the committee's proceedings, I reiterate that my position is the same.  As a fundamental position, I cannot support any amendment that might give the impression or be perceived to undermine what is a clear constitutional prerogative on the part of the Government in the matter of judicial appointments.<\/p><p>Similarly, on amendment No. 160, I see it as compromising, interfering or even undermining the manner in which the constitutional position, where the Government is free to reject the recommendation of the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#E00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Deputy Jack Chambers and I will support amendments Nos. 157 and 160, partly because there is a similar provision in our own legislation which has passed Second Stage.  I note the Minister says he is opposed to it because he thinks that it is constitutionally frail and could impinge on the prerogative of the Government to nominate individuals for appointment.  That point is valid in regard to amendments Nos. 150 and 151, tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace, which we voted down.  I am not sure that their suggestions were unconstitutional but I had concerns if the Government was told that it must select, and could only select, a person from the three names given to the Government by the commission.  That is on the borderline of constitutionality.  However, what is proposed in amendments Nos. 157 and 160 is different.  What is proposed there is that the commission gives the three names to the Government.  Under the Minister's proposal in the legislation, as drafted, all that is required is that if the Government does not select one of those three names, it must publish that fact in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;l<\/i>.  That is exactly the same as the current position, so there is no substantive change in the law.  It is appropriate that if the Government makes a decision that it is not going to appoint one of the three people nominated, that it should provide a reasoned explanation as to why it is not doing so.  It does not involve referring to the individuals who have not been appointed.  If, say, Jack Chambers was appointed but he was not one of the three on the list, the Minister or the Government should say that Mr. Justice Chambers was appointed, although he was not nominated by the commission, and it should explain the reason it selected him.  Maybe he has particular expertise in medical legal law and the Government needed an expert in that area to hear many cases or perhaps he has an expertise in the Irish language and there was a vacancy in the area and we needed more expertise in the Irish language.  It is not something that is difficult to do.  If we do not have that, we will have gone through all this process of putting in a new structure when, ultimately, there will be no change from the current situation.  For those reasons, we will support the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#E00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>If no other members wish to contribute, I will return to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#E00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Callaghan put it well.

What this does is clearly quite different.  It tries to ensure that there is an incentive for the Government not to ride roughshod over the process, and to ensure that it is not too easy for Government to constantly go outside the process.  The process is very clear.  If the Government sees a compelling reason for appointing someone to a particular position, a person who was not considered by the judicial appointments commission, it is at liberty to do so but it is absolutely reasonable that it be required to justify that and give a reason in the process that is outlined in the amendment.

I thank members for their contributions.  We have had a very in-depth discussion over a number of meetings, and it is clear that members have highlighted differing views on a number of important aspects of the Bill.  The committee has amended certain components, sections and parts of the Bill in a significant way.<\/p> <p>  Arising from our deliberations, and I am sure this will come as no surprise to the Chairman, we still have much work to do on a number of elements of the Bill in the context of looking at approaches, acknowledging amendments we have made and taking stock as to how best we might approach matters prior to and on Report Stage.  During the course of the debate, I made a number of commitments that I would, on behalf of the Government, come back with some amendments, which I will do.  Of course, I am very keen to give adequate notice, in the circumstances of the Bill, unlike in the normal course of events, having been altered quite significantly.<\/p> <p>  Given the fact that what may likely transpire to be an additional complement of membership on the board of the commission, we need to do some more work on the matter of the specifications for membership, in light of the changes which have been approved by the committee and on how the lay members of the commission are recruited.  I acknowledge on my part and that of my officials, that further consideration must be given to the reformulation of aspects of the Bill to determine the best approach.  On whether, on the matter of recruitment, it will be entirely a matter for the Public Appointments Service or whether we can have a nomination arrangement to the satisfaction of the Deputies as debated, I need to see how that might be designed to meet the disposition and clear wishes of the committee.  I must consider whether we have a mix of people, some chosen by the Public Appointments Service and some nominated to the commission by specified nominating bodies.  Against the background in which the committee structure has been removed, I want to examine the balance between having a manageable number of persons on the commission and ensuring there is an appropriate contribution of all court presidents, having regard to the various strands of appointment.<\/p> <p>  I invite members of the committee to agree with me on the following point.<\/p><p>Our objective must be to have a structure with a balance between having a commission that is not so large as to be unworkable or unwieldy while holding fast to the initial design of the Bill.  Specifically, the central principles of the Bill are a lay majority on the commission and an independent chairperson.  Those must be reconciled with the importance of ensuring that we have the appropriate inputs of all court precedents, including the presence of the District Court and of the Circuit Court.  That is not quite clear now under the Bill as has passed Committee Stage.  I want to give the Chairman notice of my intention to table an amendment to address a technical issue concerning advances of funds to the commission.  I am sure that will be welcome.  Likewise, depending on what the Parliamentary Counsel has to say, we may need to look at tabling further drafting amendments consequential to those that have already been made, particularly in Part 4 regarding the removal of relevant committees as was originally intended, to ensure that there is no unintended impact on other aspects of the Bill.  Even looking at the Long Title, although we have agreed it, we all consequently agreed that it would not be the final word on that.<\/p><p> In light of the fact that we have made a large number of amendments, I am mindful of the need to proof where we are going to ensure that the contents are legally and constitutionally acceptable and that the drafting is fully in order.  There will not be an imminent or sudden tabling of Report Stage amendments.  I have acknowledged that some work needs to be done and that will take some time.  I would be happy to keep the Chairman fully informed of developments.  If any members of the committee wish to engage with me or my officials bilaterally, I would not only be open to that but would be keen to engage in such a discussion but we will have to take our time.  Ultimately, the Bill can only benefit from the opportunity that it now presents, which is a form of breathing space between now and Report Stage.  I also thank the Chairman for the efficient way in which he managed to steer us through almost 200 amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#J03000","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I will cherish those words of commendation from the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#K00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I would not take it too seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#K00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I will hold those words tight.
