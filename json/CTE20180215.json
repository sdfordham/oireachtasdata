He is joined today by Mr. Brian Hill, senior auditor.  The first item on our agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 8 February 2018.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  I have received apologies from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  The next item on the agenda is matters arising from the minutes.  Everything referred to in the minutes is moving ahead and we can move on.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence for today's meeting.  Correspondence No. 1079 is a briefing document from Dr. Brian Keegan on corporation tax.  We will discuss this in private session and there may some additions and changes as a result of this morning's meeting.  We will have a final document for next week.  I propose that we discuss it in private session but not publish it at the moment.  Obviously we will publish the final version next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Under category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up committee meetings and other items for publishing, the first item is No. 1067B received from Mr. Des Fitzgerald, president of University of Limerick, following the committee's request for an update on the implementation of the recommendations of University of Limerick's internal audit review of August 2017.  I believe we should take up Mr. Fitzgerald on his offer to provide further updates and request a copy of the Crowe Howarth review mentioned in the letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>At our last meeting, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to respond to claims that the university or people in it may have misled his office.  He said at the time he was doing his own report.  Obviously, we must come back to it at some point because we have dealt with it in the past.  We have the internal audit report which makes 42 recommendations.  The correspondence states 17 of the recommendations have been implemented and 25 are in progress.  It also states significant changes have been made to senior management structures.  Any time there is a report where issues arise in a public institute I ask the same question, which is who is held to account.  In this instance I do not know who is held to account.  It seems there is some restructuring going on, but if individuals misled the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General or if there were errors, procedural lapses, process failures or whatever by individuals, who is held to account in the university?  It does not seem on the face of it that anybody was, except there was a consolidation of positions.<\/p> <p>  In any event we have these 42 recommendations, and I am just looking for guidance on how we deal with it.  Perhaps this will depend on when the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General concludes.  Is this the basis on which we will bring in the Accounting Officer?  Should we do it before that?  I do not know.  We have this internal audit review which is being implemented as we speak.  We will have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I imagine, sometime in the summer or perhaps before it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#B00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518685200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>My office is drafting a report at present.

Looking back to when we first dealt with this matter and, as a committee, put a spotlight on this issue, we might remind ourselves that we were told by the HEA that there was no problem and nothing to see.  I felt there was pushback against members of this committee even asking questions.  The attitude was pretty much one that we should keep our hands off this issue, that members did not understand it, that it was very complex, that commercialising intellectual property is much more complex than we could have imagined, and so on.  That tone troubled me at the time.  Far from there being nothing to see here, we now have a report which shows that there was a lack of uniformity, to say the least, across the institutes, that the policy in some areas was quite weak, and that conflicts of interest in that area needed to be strengthened.  The report makes recommendations which I think are good and which will strengthen the ability of institutes of technology and universities to protect themselves as well as taxpayers.  All of that is to the good.<\/p> <p>  A separate report into Waterford is imminent.

We had a discussion on this last time and I think it was accepted that it was not as difficult as was being suggested.  We will have to come back to it at some point, maybe we should wait until the report comes from Waterford, but Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the HEA are all players in this.  We now have a report which makes changes and which came about as a result of the work of this committee.  I still have a number of questions.  I am not satisfied that all the concerns that we raised have been dealt with sufficiently in the report.<\/p> <p>  I will also put it on record that it is quite interesting that this report, the generic one, has been published and then we will have a Waterford report.  We cannot pre-empt what will be in that but it is somewhat similar to what has happened in other areas of the third level sector.  There was a \"Prime Time\" programme which highlighted issues on accountability, and the Minister published a report which said the Department was going to make changes.  Then our report came out.  The Department can point to its report and say that it is dealing with the matter already.  An element of that is going on in the HEA.<\/p> <p>  We have to come back to it.  We cannot merely bookend it and say that we have the reports and that is it.  Issues remain.  I propose that once we have the Waterford report and this national review of all institutes, we return to it.  I ask that Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, some of the third level institutes and the HEA would come before the committee and we would do a session on the matter because it seems to be very much geared toward the commercialisation part of it, and there seems to be a bias towards the enterprise side of it rather than protecting the institutes.  Several members have expressed concerns in that regard.  Questions remain to be asked.

Very often, industry wants to locate close to universities and does that for a range of different reasons.  Much of it has to do with partnering with universities.  There is no doubt there is a benefit and there can be a two-way benefit.  A lot of that is very desirable.  However, I was less than impressed with the HEA.  I thought it was very underwhelming in terms of its contributions at the committee.  We are relying on it to evaluate something it was not great at.  I agree with Deputy Connolly in that regard.  It may well be an academic who can do this but I would like to see an international comparator about how this is handled in other countries because we need to compare it to something else or somewhere else where there is something in the same family and where there is good practice.  I am quite sure that one of the business schools will have carried out some work in that area.  It is a bit ironic to ask an academic to input into something like this but I think we might not be getting a good look at the way we should be progressing on this by relying exclusively on the HEA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#D00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I have a final contribution.  As one of those who asked the questions and took an active interest in this, I want to put on the record that an awful lot of good work is being done by universities and institutes of technology in research and development, co-location and commercialising intellectual property.  None of that is bad.  Legitimate questions were asked about process, conflicts of interest and how the companies are established.  The point was that I felt we were being pushed back a bit on what were genuine concerns.  We now have two reports that verify those concerns.  They are a vindication of the questions we were asking.  The HEA was asleep at the wheel when it came to this issue because it was, essentially, throwing it back to Science Foundation Ireland.  I think Knowledge Transfer Ireland is the body that looks at it.  It possibly had a role but certainly the HEA has a role from a governance perspective and it allowed a situation to arise where there were different policies in different institutes of technology and universities.  Some were good while others were not so good.  If we now have more uniformity and a strengthened policy that underpins this, that is for the good.  The HEA should reflect on the fact that the questions we put are for the good because we want to see an improvement and if we get an improvement here, that will be good.  When we raised this issue previously, I was inundated with emails from people who work in this area telling me that we do not fully understand it and are being anti-enterprise and negative.  That is not the case.  At all times, we recognised that there is huge benefit to institutes of technology and universities engaging in research and development and with the private sector and individuals within those institutions commercialising their intellectual property.  None of that was seen as bad.  Genuine concerns were raised that have been dealt with to some extent but I do not think they have been dealt with fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#D00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>To conclude on this item of correspondence, members will recall that we included this topic - the full costing from all taxpayer sources - in our report last summer.  We received and considered the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and rejected it.  It just said it was impossible to do it.  The Revenue Commissioners expect people to do it if they are looking for tax credits.  It appears that the public service has not been on top of this.<\/p> <p>  No. 1077B, the note we received with this correspondence, is from the director of Knowledge Transfer Ireland, Alison Campbell.  We just asked a simple question about a spin-out project currently being considered for 2018.  It was a simple question and we received a half-page reply.  It states that it is at various stages of maturation and that any list of spin-out prospects will necessarily be larger than any number of prospects that ultimately launch spin offs.  We know that.  The note stated that the list of spin-outs being considered for 2018 is a snapshot at a point in time.  That is all we asked for.  The note said that in the timescale for response to the request from the committee, it was not possible to gather details of the number of spin-out opportunities under consideration across the 21 higher education authorities.  That is a clear admission that it does not have that information, which is shocking in its own right.  The note goes on to say that details can be included by way of a follow-on so we wait to receive that.  We will ask for that.  The note said that due to commercial sensitivity, the names of the technologies cannot be made public.  That is fine.  The note said that by way of context, the annual knowledge transfer survey showed that Ireland is creating an average of 26 to 30 new spin-out companies per annum from its 21 higher education authorities and a further five research performing organisations, RPOs.  The committee can see there is quite a bit in there.  Members can see that we asked a simple question and Knowledge Transfer Ireland said it did not have the information and would try to find it.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was asked how much money was going in and it told us it did not know.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#D00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Where did that come from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#D00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The covering letter from the HEA is No. 1077B1.

There is a special report on motor taxation which feeds into funding of local authorities.  When dealing with central government funding of local authorities, I propose that we address the Appropriation Accounts for the then Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the parent Department.  We will also have at that meeting a very senior representative from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland because up to 15% of all funding to local authorities comes from that Department.<\/p><p> When those officials are in, we may also deal with the motor taxation account special report as a separate item.

Given that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport representatives will be here - and motor taxation was generally collected through local authorities but has now gone to the Department, a matter on which a special report was issued - we will deal with all of that on one day as motor tax is the key element of the local government fund at this stage.<\/p><p> Will the Comptroller and Auditor General tell us who is responsible for the local government fund?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#E02500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518685200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Who is responsible for the collection of motor tax since the realignment of Government Departments?

This layer of government is the most important in people's every day lives.  We deal with headline figures here.  It is this level of government that we rely on for implementation of policy relating to housing, roads - which we discussed this week - or a new strand of social policy that local government is involved in.  I agree with my colleagues that we should have clarity of thought before these witnesses came in.  The worst thing would be to get bogged down in a quagmire that would suit the witnesses down to the ground, to run down the clock all day.  I know Deputy Murphy has said that it is a complicated layer of funding to work out and she is right but at the same time there is a Houdini act going on as was mentioned with regard to the local government fund, which no longer exists.<\/p><p>More Houdini tricks were pulled with the introduction of the local property tax whereby aspects that had previously been funded by the Department would become self-funded, as it were, by the councils.<\/p><p> The Chairman and Deputy Murphy mentioned progression, but I will tell them what that progression has been.  The Chairman stated that he wanted the principal funders to appear before us and make themselves answerable.  If so, we had better invite IBEC or some business representative to attend on the same day as well, given that 36% of all local government funding comes from the business people and SMEs of this country.  The past ten years have seen a 10% increase in the income derived from rates because local government has been starved of central funding like a mangy dog.  Income from rates has increased from a percentage in the mid-20s to 36% and now amounts to &euro;1.5 billion.  The Valuation Office appeared before us a couple of weeks ago, but we might as well have had my children in answering questions, seeing as how no one would take responsibility.  The Valuation Office told us it was the Department's responsibility.  When we asked the departmental official who was sitting here at the time, we were told that it was the Minister's responsibility.  I am not spending a day doing that in a couple of weeks' time with no one taking responsibility for the questions we ask.<\/p><p> I agree with the Chairman.  Let us bring everyone in, but some of the chief funders of local government are businesses.  IBEC and others emailed us about the pressures they were under on the day the Valuation Office appeared before us, although it was a pity they did so a bit late.  I would like to see representatives of business owners appear before us to discuss the imposition upon them.  When one considers that rates account for 36% of overall income, the local property tax pales into insignificance.<\/p><p> When we put it to Mr. Paul Lemass on the day that local government structures were underfunded, I was worried when he said - members can check the record - that there would be a reappraisal of the property tax, providing an opportunity to bring in more funding.  We are entering a dangerous sphere.<\/p><p> This is a big day for our committee.  The Department has the most impact, not just on ordinary people's lives but on business people and employers as well.  Business representatives should be present on the day, given that they are one of the chief income suppliers of local government.  In that way, we could have a debate in the round as to how local government is funded, where the money is going and what we are doing.<\/p><p> Deputy Cullinane mentioned the quagmire in funding for housing.  In my county a few weeks ago, &euro;11.2 million was supplied in a grant by the Department.  There was a big announcement.  Only 40 houses are being built, though.  That works out at nearly &euro;300,000 per house for social housing.  Something is wrong, and it is that site acquisition was built into the cost of each house.  When the council applied for the site acquisition cost, it was told the amount would be given to it, but only as part of the delivery of the 40 houses.  We will have many questions for these people on the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018021500002#F02000","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518685200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Grand.

The sector accounts for 37% of the overall contribution, having increased by 10% in the past decade, but the Department has starved one side.

Populations are getting bigger and more is being demanded of councillors and officials, who are now under some pressure.  The only place they can get a bit of extra income is to increase rates.  I accept what Deputies Cullinane, Murphy and Connolly said about our remit and what can be examined, but they are getting off the hook by putting it onto this sector.  Over the past ten years it has grown from under &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion and it is only going to get worse.  We are discussing central government funding to a sector and there is scope to examine it on the day.

We propose to bring in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, because it sets the policy, the Department of Education and Skills, which is one of the biggest users of PPPs, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the principal user, and the National Development Finance Agency.  I want a letter to go from this committee to each of those organisations because I know what will happen otherwise.  They will talk about commercial sensitivity so that we can discuss nothing.  I do not know how far we will get but we can certainly get farther than a response such as that.  I propose we write to each of them asking them to provide as much financial information as they can by way of a briefing note a fortnight in advance of the meeting.  In particular, we will ask them to justify their inability to give us full commercial details of any contract more than five years old.  Commercial sensitivity might be valid at a certain point in time but not for ever.  This will give us the opportunity to consider the information before we have the public meeting.<\/p> <p>  We are holding over 29 March for the third level sector.  There are three or four different topics but we will not come to them today.  On 19 April, it will be the Department of Finance to discuss Government debt and the Exchequer outturn for the year, which is a key ingredient of our work.  On 26 April, we have the Department of Justice and Equality on the development of its IT system, on which there is a special chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will deal with the Garda internal audit report on its IT contracts on that day too.<\/p> <p>  On 3 May, we have Vote 29 - Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, particularly in relation to RT&Eacute;, which is substantially funded.  Deputy Cullinane is keen on this but on the day the Department was here it said it was obliged to have a service level agreement in place with RT&Eacute; and that it received &euro;170 million each year, the majority of its funding.  The Department has failed in its duty to do its work so the Committee of Public Accounts will do the job.  There is widespread agreement because the majority of its funding is from public funds and it is appropriate to bring the organisation in on that basis.  We will not get into anything about its editorial content as it is not in our remit.

It is important to be aware of that backdrop and what was agreed in 2015 before we launched the procurement process because that set the stage for our current position.  The fundamental objective then and now is to deliver high-speed broadband to every premises in Ireland, regardless of how remote or rural they are.  That is in keeping with the mission statement of the overall 2012 national broadband plan.<\/p> <p>  One of the key tenets of the national broadband plan is to stimulate and extract as much commercial investment from the market as possible without the need for market intervention by the State, which is an essential requirement of State aid guidelines and must be followed by every member state.  Broadband is nationally available from a number of operators.  There are probably up to 100 operators selling broadband across the country and, therefore, the key prerogative for us is to ensure we only intervene in areas where we will deliver high-speed broadband.  A key area on which we had to decide in 2015 is what we meant by high-speed broadband.  In that context, in December 2015 we concluded that we would only intervene in areas where we would deliver at least 30 MB download speed and 6 MB upload speed and published seven expert documents that set out what that meant.  Analysys Mason, our technical adviser, set out in great detail what is meant by 30 MB down and 6 MB up.  It does not mean service providing up to those speeds, rather minimum speeds of 30 MB down and 6 MB up, along with several other technical characteristics.  That will ensure that the network is resilient, of high quality and will stand the test of time.  In addition to criteria on the 30 MB and 6 MB speeds set out in 2015, a key requirement is that the network would be future proofed over the 25 years of the contract.  It is not a question of whether a download speed of 30 MB will be sufficient in 2030 or 2040 because it will not.  The network to be built will stand the test of time, which is true to the 2015 statement and our current position.  That gives an assurance to commercial operators offering low-speed or basic broadband that we will not intervene in areas where they are delivering 10 or 15 MB but will only do so if there is a need to deliver step change to consumers.  That is a key tenet of the State aid guidelines.<\/p> <p>   Another key tenet of the 2015 strategy and the State aid guidelines that every member state must follow is that one must maximise the reuse of existing infrastructure.  As all members know, there are many networks across the country that deliver telecoms, involving poles, ducts, towers, masts and, with the advent of the legislation, the electricity network.  There are many demands in this area.  There is the rail and many other networks.  Coillte is in the telecom space.  Those networks must be leveraged to minimise the cost to the State and commercial operators of building this rural network.  That is being worked on with any company that is willing to offer up its network.  In terms of any regulated company, the regulator is part of the process to ensure the relevant access obligations are in place and appropriate prices are set.  In the telecom space, the Eircom poles and ducts are regulated and ComReg has a very clear role in that regard.  The ultimate objective of the strategy is to stimulate growth and jobs and to ensure that any Government strategy such as e-education, ehealth and etourism is facilitated through the nationwide availability of high-speed broadband.  That was our starting point in December 2015.<\/p> <p>  Another key prerogative is that it is an open access wholesale network.  We are not subsidising a retail network or retail service providers but, rather, are subsidising and the commercial sector is investing in a wholesale network.  The metropolitan area networks are currently being sold by Enet on a wholesale basis and Open Eir, the wholesale arm of Eir group, offers wholesale services.  The entity to which we are referring in notional terms as the NBPCo until it has formally been named will only sell open access wholesale services, probably to 50, 60 or 80 retailers.  Ultimately, consumers will have absolute choice in terms of broadband and other services the network will allow to be delivered, such as television, voice telecommunications, high-speed lease line services for businesses and so on, which is typical in the market.  It is an open access wholesale network and will deliver consumer choice and competition at the retail level. <\/p> <p>  In July 2015, we began work on our draft strategy, a process informed by experts from economists across Europe.  PricewaterhouseCoopers was our main adviser on strategy and KPMG also advised on ownership, funding and so on.   Analysys Mason was the technical expert.  These experts came together and we concluded in December 2015 on a number of facets to which I have referred.  It was decided that we would tender for three lots.  In July, it was intended to tender for four lots but, following consultation, over 60 responses to our July 2015 consultation were received, one of which included approximately 50 operators.  We engaged with more than 150 stakeholders in 2015 to arrive at our strategy in December 2015.<\/p><p>We landed on having three lots.  Essentially, that was the north and the south of the country and there was the option to win lot C, which was both lots together.  That is what all the five consortiums that came forward in March 2016 said they would be willing to bid for.  Three of those consortiums qualified in July or June 2016.  The three remaining bidders in September and the remaining bidder today all had subscribed to bidding for all three lots, therefore, none of them had ever opted for any one particular lot.  As to the reason one would opt for the lots, up to now it was seen as a key driver of competition and possibly allowing smaller networks an opportunity to bid.  In France, for example, where one area of the country might have 500,000 premises, they would have 40 or 50 equivalent lots, because it is done by municipality.  In Germany, there would be many different lots because it is done on the basis of geographic area.  In the UK, Broadband Delivery UK would have split the UK, Scotland and Wales into many different areas and in that way different companies would have the opportunity to bid.  That is the way it is done in every member state.  One divides it up rather than having one big procurement process and one big lot.  That is the history of the lots.<\/p><p> In terms of state aid, since 2014 we have had many visits to Brussels to meet the DG COMM unit, which is responsible for overseeing our process and, ultimately, it will be responsible for delivering a state aid approval letter before we issue a final tender.  It is responsible, as set out in the state aid guidelines, to ensure that each member state only intervenes where it absolutely has to and that no taxpayer moneys go into geographic areas, cities, towns or counties where commercial operators have already delivered, or have concrete plans to deliver.<\/p><p> Mr. Patrick Neary will go through the mapping process with the members shortly, which involves how one decides or confirms if there is a concrete plan from a commercial operator or whether plans that were promised three years ago are happening on the ground.  That is an intricate, complicated and detailed process because we are talking about every road, street, house and business in the country that we must analyse and examine.  We started that process in 2013 when we issued many questionnaires to every single commercial operator in the country asking them to outline their plans, if they will deliver high speed broadband and, if they will, to submit their plans in order that we could examine them.  Mr. Patrick Neary will go through all that detail shortly.  Under the state aid guidelines, that is a key tenet, namely, to identify the areas of market failure and decide on what way to intervene, which is what is in our strategy.  We did all that in 2015.  The map is dynamic and it must remain so as any commercial operator can at any time decide it will invest money in this particular area.  Over the course of 2015, we engaged with the European Commission and consulted it on the map we published in 2015, along with our strategy and the procurement launch in December 2015, and it was very satisfied with our mapping process.  To date, it has not raised any issues.  We have gone through the whole pre-notification process.  We issued the first one in 2015.  We reissued an updated pre-notification in August 2016 just to bring it up to date.  We intend to move to the final notification process in the coming weeks.  At that stage the European Commission will engage in reviewing the overall process in a little more detail and give us a final letter of approval before we would have a preferred bidder or a contract awarded.  From a state aid perspective, we have gone through a great deal of detail with the European Commission, ComReg has been consulted and we believe we are in a very good place in that regard.

It was useful for us to get the correspondence today on the communications between Eir and the Department.  Regarding the 300,000 additional rural homes to which Eir is delivering broadband directly, I understand Eir had originally approached the Department in 2014 or 2015 - Mr. Neary might be able to confirm the year -  for those to be excluded from any national broadband plan and that the then Minister, Alex White, ruled that out.  I was interested in the correspondence between Eir and the current Minister, Deputy Naughten, to find out when that changed.  It is not clear from the correspondence.  The only meeting it seems where it could have been discussed was in the summer of 2016.  What is difficult to understand, in the context of Eir's presentation at a later meeting, is that it started that programme in the first quarter of 2017 - in other words, it already had 10,000 houses done in the first quarter.  Therefore, it must have started in January or February 2017.  In the context of the commitment assigned in 2017, that must have been agreed with the Minister the previous summer.  When was it decided to change the approach whereby the Department and the previous Minister said that we would not do that, when was it changed?  When was it signalled to Eir that the Department would allow this different approach?  That is not insignificant.  It only became apparent obviously in April 2017 but the bidding process must have been proceeding for at least six, eight, nine or ten months during which time the other parties would not have known that the whole terms of the process were changing.  When was it decided to switch tack in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#C01000","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518688800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>If I could take that question, it is a very complex area and I absolutely understand the Deputy's question.

I will start at the beginning and members will note as the map has developed, the way in which operators have come forward with their plans.  Our first engagement with the industry started in 2013 when we wrote to all the operators and asked them for submissions relating to high-speed broadband and their intent to roll out it out.  That resulted in us publishing a first iteration of the map in November 2014.  That was sent out for public consultation, following that extensive engagement with the industry in 2013 and 2014.<\/p> <p>  We received 27 responses representing more than 60 stakeholders in that consultation, therefore, we got quite a healthy response particularly from the industry.  That resulted in us republishing the map in February 2014.  We then issued a supplementary information request to the industry inviting operators to come forward with any detail of any further high-speed broadband plans they had out to 2020.  It was very much a future-looking request for information.  In that year, June 2015, Eir came forward with, and announced publicly, a 300,000 roll-out.  At that point it would have submitted its submissions to the Department.  Along with that, in response to that information request, six operator plans were submitted to us.  Therefore, Eir had made a submission, along with five others.  At the end of 2015 we concluded that no operator had met the technical deployment or financial criteria or was willing to sign a commitment agreement at that point.  On that basis, we republished the map in December 2015 and at that point we launched the procurement.  In 2016 Eir re-engaged with the Department.  It had updated its 300,000 plan, come forward with more robust and committed finance for the project and revised its deployment profile, which had started or was planned to start during 2016.  In fact, it started towards the end of 2016.<\/p><p>Throughout 2016 we reassessed that updated plan from Eir.  During that year we also continued to monitor and assess the anticipated commercial developments in what, at that time, was the blue area on the map.<\/p><p> To complete the picture, through our analysis of the blue area we identified a further 84,500 premises which we had anticipated would get high-speed broadband but the plans were not forthcoming as anticipated.  We decided at the time that those 84,500 premises should revert to the intervention area.  We continued engagement with Eir, and in April 2017 we signed a commitment agreement which underpinned its plan to deliver high-speed broadband to 300,000 premises.  Eir had started the roll-out at the end of 2016 and had already completed the first quarter of roll-outs during 2017, so it was well down the road of actually implementing the deployment.  This supported the credibility of its plan, along with the fact it underpinned the commitment through an agreement with the Minister and the Department.  In April 2017, this resulted in us updating the map, which now included the further 84,500 premises we had identified through analysing the blue areas.  The intervention area was reduced by 300,000 premises as a result of the commitment agreement with Eir.  This gave us an intervention area of approximately 540,000 premises.  As has been pointed out, April 2017 was during the ongoing procurement process and I will come back to this.<\/p><p> We continually analyse issues regarding accuracy of the map and issues in the blue areas.  As recently as January we asked for further observations on the map through a public consultation, which concluded last week.  We received nine responses directly on the mapping and we are reviewing and assessing those respondents.  The point I want to make is the mapping process is extremely complex.  We are attempting to map high-speed broadband nationally to every house in every eircode in the country.  In many cases, this information is based on the legacy copper network and the information is quite old.  We have had to do a lot of analysis and work with various operators to try to improve the accuracy of what is there.  There are many difficulties in identifying the performance of high-speed broadband at individual premises level.  At the point a premises orders and connects to the service it becomes more measurable.  We have had cases where one would expect that houses built close to a cabinet would receive high performance high-speed broadband direct from that cabinet, but when they connect it is identified they are not connected to that cabinet but to an exchange several kilometres away.  As a result, they do not receive the expected performance levels.  There are difficulties such as these.<\/p><p> Various technology is involved and there are different ways of measuring the performance dependent on the technology.  It is a very complex process.  We have developed the map to be dynamic and to respond to our analysis as we develop it over a period of time.  We have been doing it for quite a long time and it is getting better and better.  As people connect to it, we get better insight into the performance they receive.  We are continually updating and reassessing the accuracy of the map.  We have allowed for this within the procurement process, and from the outset we very much flagged the dynamic nature of the map.  When we updated the map in April 2017, it was not something unflagged to bidders at the start of the procurement process.  It was catered for in the procurement process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#C01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Was I inaccurate in stating the previous Minister and, I presume, the Department had not agreed to a similar proposal which came from Eir in the early stages?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#D00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518688800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>In June 2015, Eir's initial 300,000 premises proposal was assessed and did not meet the criteria.

That is the ultimate aim here.  We will deliver by the end of September.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the other more detailed questions on procurement, without going into the procurement process and what the bidder is or is not doing - because there is a lot of confidential and commercially sensitive information in all of that so we could not disclose it - in the context of whether we have a detailed price, we must go back to the process here and what we got in September.  In any procurement process with competitive dialogue, bidders give us what they call a dummy bid.  We got that in September.  It included more than 3,000 pages of stuff with huge models and everything else and our experts have spent October, November and December going through that.  The bid included technical, financial and all the network information Mr. Neary and his engineers have been looking at for three months.  The way the process works is that we have now given them substantial reports, although not as much in paper, from financial, technical and legal advisers in terms of what we would like to see them do better, where we think they could be more efficient and all those sorts of things one goes through in competitive dialogue in order to ensure the State gets the best outcome.  They have only got that in the past couple of weeks.  They now need to go and recalibrate those models, recalibrate their solutions and then come back into us.<br\/><br\/>There will not be a final price until we are happy that we have the right solution, namely, the right solution for the State, and that it will be done as fast as possible, which brings me back to the timeline and whether it has a timeline.  We might have been given a timeline and we might have gone back and said we are not happy with it and that we want it done faster and we want it to look at that.  That is what one does in competitive dialogue.  For example, we ask how one<b><\/b>can get a faster provision in County Clare or County Wicklow or what else could be done more quickly, even if it costs a bit more money.  We are going through all that with the consortium to see how we can get the job done as quickly as possible between 2019 and whatever end date.  Our time plus is time plus minus because we want to get the work done as quickly as possible.  That is product we are dealing with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulligan for the clarification.

Their  prerogative is to make a rate return and to get bums on seats, as I said.  They need to get people to buying the ICP broadband service from them.  They are not here just to get State aid because then they lose their money.  Their prerogative is that they are still in an environment where every part of Ireland has broadband and there is the Eircom provision to 300,000 homes, and there are other operators out there that are spending their own money on certain networks.  This company is going into a highly competitive and highly changeable environment in terms of technology and it needs to hit the ground running.  We are giving any international shareholders that are coming into our process to talk to us and get an investment from the State - because that is what a gap-funded model involves - a grant and they then need to absolutely build this as quick as they can to get people buying the service so that they can get revenue in.  Their revenue model is completely dependent on getting people on board and, as we know, the demand is out there.  They know they will be hit the minute this has started and launched by thousands of orders.  Their prerogative is to get people on board because they need happy customers.  They need people to spend money on the bundles they will set up.  I think there is fundamental pressure on the consortium to deliver for its shareholders, as well as us, and the State is a key shareholder in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  I will follow on from Deputy Dooley's questions.  Mr. Mulligan referred to value for money.  Deputy Dooley was correct in saying that there is only one bidder in the process now so what are the actual risks to the State in respect, first, of value for money and, second, for the entire project if it goes belly-up?  In terms of the intervention areas, if this plan, which we will call plan B, fails, in my area of Cork alone there will be more than 74,000 premises, which could possibly involve 200,000 individuals, that might not get any broadband.  That is very worrying.<\/p> <p>  Has a public ownership model, based on existing State infrastructure, such as that owned by the ESB, been considered?  I recently met the Chamber of Commerce in Cork and a number of stakeholders to discuss the Celtic interconnector.  They spoke about utilising existing State infrastructure.  We are talking about very complex operations and bids.<\/p> <p>  I looked at the metropolitan area networks, MANs, in my area in Cork and in Midleton, Cobh, Cork city, Ballincollig and as far away as Youghal and the points seemed to be there.  If deflectors were used, could we not utilise them and tap into the national network?  Surely 99% of people have electricity in their homes?  Reference was also made to data and tracking in terms of Eircodes and addresses.  If 99% of people have an electricity connection and each person gets a bill, we already have the data and the mapping done.  I am a bit lost in that regard and would welcome some clarification from the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#F00400","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518688800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I will start.  As I said at the outset, every piece of infrastructure that can be used will be used.  Going back to the consortium and the State, as shareholders, we need to minimise the cost.  The MANs are in Cork and in approximately 80 places across the country and where they represent the most efficient way to utilise the networks, they will be used.  In some cases, it might be more efficient to use the electricity or Eircom network.  All of those networks are in front of the consortium as options at the moment.  What is being considered is what is the most cost-efficient way of doing it.  The reason areas of the country have not served to date is because while those networks are there, it still costs a lot of money to bring them to the door of the house.  While the electricity or any other network might be there, one still needs to get fibre on poles and through ducts and back to a point of presence in Cork, Wicklow, Dublin or wherever else.  That is why an area has been designated as amber because it is not commercially feasible for anybody to spend their capital to get it from the house back to those points of presence.  That is why we are doing this.  That will happen as part of this process.  We are reducing the amount of any overbuild here where possible but if something needs to be built, it will be built.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a public ownership model, the Government decided in July 2016 that we would use the commercial gap-funded model, which is a typical model used across member states whereby we offer a grant to the winning consortium.  The fact that an Eircom network, the ESB network or a MANs network might be used as a subcontractor or rented will not make any difference to that ownership model because those networks are owned by the semi-State company, be it, for example, the ESB, or by Eircom or the MANs are owned by the county councils.  Those ownership models are there across the board with the actual infrastructure already, some of which is in State ownership, for example, the ESB, public ownership for the MANs or private ownership such as Eircom and towers and masts are owned by Coillte, for example, a semi-State organisation which may be part of the solution.  A multitude of infrastructure is involved in terms of the solution to deliver in the most cost-efficient way, whether it is predominantly fibre to the home or even fixed wireless or whatever other solution and those will all be leveraged to minimise the cost.<\/p><p>In Cork, there are potentially 74,000 unconnected premises.  Every county in Ireland has that problem and that is why it is amber.  Our target for Cork and other counties is that we address the problem as soon as possible through 2019 and onwards.  The target now is to turn all of those areas blue.  That is the ultimate objective here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>If this fails, is there a risk to the whole project?

They are areas which should be served by commercial operators.  It should not be the case that the State has to intervene to support a commercial operator in a densely populated area.  We are continuing to monitor the plans that have been presented to us that are reaching fruition in the blue areas.  There have been particular barriers or issues that operators encounter, primarily local issues, that, if unlocked, would allow the commercial operators to deploy to those areas.<\/p> <p>  One of the major initiatives launched to alleviate that has been the mobile phone and broadband task force and 40 actions have been identified through that task force.  It was updated this year with further initiatives, including the appointment of a broadband officer to look at alleviating local issues and updating the planning exemptions for the deployment of telecoms infrastructure.  We have come across premises in the centre of Dublin - one-off premises which are quite close to the building we are in at the moment - where the operator is willing to deploy but has found it cannot get through the planning process.  By bringing people together we found a solution for those premises where they can locate a new cabinet or address an existing cabinet.  <\/p> <p>  These issues arise as the operator tries to deploy.  On the example I gave, where there is a premises that is very close to a cabinet - this is based on very old legacy data - the operator expects that the premises will receive high-speed broadband but it does not because it is connected to an exchange many kilometres away.  We want to see if we can alleviate problems such as that.  It is not the case that these are suitable for intervention because they are in such densely populated areas.  In saying that, the contract and the initial strategy which was published provide that in the event that there are premises left behind, they could be added to the intervention area in due course.  We have the ability, after the contract is awarded, to increase the number of premises.  Our main tool, however, is to try to address the issues.  We provided an email address at which the Deputies, or indeed the public, can highlight issues to us and we will continue to investigate them.  We then engage with the industry and see how the issue might be alleviated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>It is a huge issue, and many Deputies and Senators are in contact about it.

I was unavoidably late for this meeting because of another commitment and therefore have not heard all of the questions.  Despite that, I am going to ask questions to which the people I meet seek answers.<\/p> <p>  There are three specific allegations in the letter from Eir to the Minister of 30 January 2018.  The first concerns the regulatory and governance issues that have been repeatedly highlighted over the past 18 months.  Implicit in that is the suggestion that Eir had flagged its difficulties and that in some way those problems were not adequately responded to.  Can the witnesses comment on that?  The second problem mentioned in the letter is that Eir had grave and growing concerns about the current regulatory environment.  Can the witnesses comment on that?  Is the regulatory environment too oppressive?  If so, will this also be a difficulty for Enet?  If Eir had legitimate difficulties, will Enet face them as well?  <\/p> <p>  The third issue in the letter from Eir is that there were well-communicated, red-line issues over the period.  Implicit in that is that Eir was very clear about what it wanted and that there was not an adequate response to that and that there was too much tardiness in dealing with the issues.  The people watching and listening to us today or those who will read the Official Report of the meeting would want assurances and a response on those three implicit suggestions in the letter from Eir, namely, a certain tardiness, a failure to deal with red-line issues and an oppressive regulatory environment, as well as the fact that each of those issues had been flagged.  Was enough done?  Was there inflexibility in the witnesses' dealing with Eir during the process?  Was there an unused flexibility in the system?  <\/p> <p>  There are a few simple basic questions about Enet to which people would like answers.  Can the witnesses explain why Enet will not cost more than it would have cost?  In other words, how will we avoid a situation where it exploits its position as the only bidder?  An assurance around the cost issue would be appreciated, as well an explanation as to why the witnesses are confident about that issue.  There will be some doubting Thomases on this issue; apt terminology given the season we are in at the moment.  <\/p> <p>  How will the process with Enet work?  How will the process be managed to ensure the kind of objectives the witnesses have are met?  People are wondering about the capacity of Enet to do the job - I acknowledge we have had assurances - but can the witnesses pad that out a little?  The big issue is the timeframe.  Will deadlines be met and when will shovels be in the ground?  When do the witnesses see the whole process completing?  <\/p> <p>  When the Minister was in the House on the last occasion, I mentioned there are three simple questions that people on the streets are asking.  Will they get the broadband, and when?  Will it be cost-effective?  Will it be efficient?  In essence that is what the questions amount to.  I would appreciate if the witnesses could address the specifics I raised.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#G00700","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518688800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I might first deal with the questions around the regulatory environment, red-line issues, flexibility and the process.<\/p><p>I will then ask Mr. Mulligan to address again some of the points he discussed earlier on value for money, process and timelines.<\/p><p> In terms of the Eir letter, which is in the public domain, the matter was discussed with the Minister at a meeting of the joint committee last week.  It is not unusual for an operator to be critical of the regulatory environment in the market in which it is operating, as will, I am sure, other operators from time to time.  In saying that, I do not wish to reflect in any way, by way of commentary, on the regulatory environment, which is very much a matter for the independent regulator, ComReg.  The Minister made that point clearly last week when he also suggested the joint committee may wish to consider having a meeting with the regulator to discuss the wider issues.<\/p><p> We have made clear we will not go into the specifics of the procurement process.  We showed members a timeline.  I will not and cannot discuss red line issues and it would be wrong to do so.  However, I point to the timeline in this regard.  It is a matter of record that in this process the detailed solutions stage was about to complete at the point at which Eir withdrew.  By the end of January 2018, bidders had to provide the Department with their final red line issues.  The Department would consider these and the aim was that over the coming weeks, the final contract would be settled on for the tender stage.  It was clear the engagement with bidders in the process around their views on the contract had not concluded at that point and there was still space for that. <\/p><p> All I can say on the issue of flexibility is that I am confident, having been there and seen it, that the team is acting in an appropriate manner in approaching this project on the basis that there is a strategy to be delivered and the team is acting on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland in delivering that strategy.  The bidders will act on behalf of their stakeholders.  While a certain amount of tension is to be anticipated in the process, it was being managed effectively.  Mr. Mulligan will respond to the remaining questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018021500002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518688800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>To answer the question on whether people will obtain a broadband service, approximately 500,000 premises had broadband in 2013.

That is our prerogative.  There is no question that we will get 100% of the country covered.  In terms of timelines, the question is when this will be achieved.  By the end of this year, we will have a detailed timeline from the consortium for when it will be able to achieve this.  We will not know what the timeline will be until then because we are working through the detail.  As I indicated, part of the detail is that the Department will apply as much pressure as possible to ensure the process is concluded as quickly as possible.  With the competitive dialogue process we are running, we can engage with the consortium to identify what can be done to have the process completed quicker before we get a final tender.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the ability of Enet to do this, one fundamental point is that one must qualify to be included in a tender process.

The two areas I wish to talk about are flood risk management and estate management, including our heritage estate.<\/p> <p>  Members are aware that flooding is a natural event that can cause widespread damage and have a devastating effect on communities, property and infrastructure.  It is well known that I have a keen interest in ensuring that the correct actions are taken to prevent and decrease flood risk.  Where flooding is likely to occur, the State must provide protection and a speedy response to assist communities and properties.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, I welcome the additional &euro;25 million in funding made available in the Revised Estimates to continue to address this challenging issue.  Effective flood risk management is a long-term commitment that involves adopting capital infrastructural and non-infrastructural measures.  I am pleased to say how my office has produced detailed analysis of flood risk in 300 identified communities, including 19 coastal areas throughout the OPW catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  This programme has proposed a number of measures to be undertaken as outlined within the 29 flood risk management plans across the State and it also established the prioritisation of our resources in order to deliver maximum benefit to the State.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the flood defence schemes already completed, eight major schemes are now under construction and 2018 will see the substantial completion of another four schemes in Dublin, Galway, Louth and Clare.  Subject to planning approval I expect that eight further schemes will commence in the coming year, including five within the Cork region.  I have also worked with my office to develop a range of other measures to tackle flood risk, which include the OPW minor flood mitigation and coastal protection schemes in partnership with local authorities, a pilot scheme in County Mayo of individual property protection measures, flood forecasting in conjunction with the Met &Eacute;ireann and a number of community resilience initiatives.<\/p> <p>  The second main area of funding in the OPW Vote relates to estate management.  The estate managed by the OPW is made up of more than 2,000 properties and is a\u00a0critical part of the State's economic, operational and cultural infrastructure.  Being very conscious of the current improved economic outlook and anticipating an increase in Ireland's population over the next 20 years, I am planning for the future with the OPW for a similar increase in required public services.  As such, my office is continually reviewing the accommodation needs to deliver current and future effective public services which is a key priority within A Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p> <p>  From 2008 to 2016, the OPW restructured State office accommodation with the surrender of more than 2 million sq. ft and a reduction in the annual State rent bill of &euro;43 million per annum.  Given the evidence in 2017 of an increase requirement for Civil Service accommodation and upward trends in the rental market, this will be difficult to sustain into the future.  My office will, however, continue to seek value for money within the State rental portfolio and focus especially on continued effective use of State-owned property.  The funding provided in the Revised Estimate supports a continuation of this efficiency drive by providing &euro;3.5 million to buy sites and properties where they are considered to provide the greatest value for money.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the heritage estate.  The good news is the significant increase in visitor numbers and the revenue received by the Exchequer in 2017 is expected to be sustained in 2018.  The not so good news is that the condition of a number of these properties is poor and worsening with the additional pressure created by these increased visitor numbers.  It has been demonstrated in recent years at sites such as Kilmainham Gaol that there is a link between revenue and reinvestment.  It is now critical for us to consider reinvesting some of the income received in the heritage estate in order to sustain and develop a highly important and crucial economic asset.<\/p> <p>  My office is currently working in tandem with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and others to develop and improve these areas with many projects scheduled to start on visitor sites in 2018.  Overall, my office works extremely hard at a time of budgetary pressures to ensure appropriate works are prioritised and measures undertaken to complement those already in place.  The office is now well positioned to invest any additional resources to be allocated by the Government in the coming years in these two very important areas of State investment; flood risk management and estate management.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the time allotted to my opening address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#A00300","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The idea of the model at City Hall is one I have used.  I have seen, in a number of areas, that people have observations on the heights of walls.  I do the ordinary thing, which is to cut an election poster to the height of the wall, paint it grey and put lines on it.  That shows the height of the wall.  People then say that is not what they are being told and that they are being told quite the opposite.  That is similar to what has been going on in Cork.

On the process that the Office of Public Works uses, we have approximately 2,200 properties that we manage, own or lease.  Of those, approximately 90 to 100 would be considered vacant and would be available, whether for community use or any other use.  Over 50% of those properties are Garda stations that were closed under the 2012 to 2013 Government plan.  They are being held subject to a review being conducted by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority so they are not available for ourselves or anybody else until the outcome of that review is known.  That is right and proper.<\/p> <p>  Under certain circumstances we will consider community use if a viable business plan is presented and if the community in question can sustain the building under a licence arrangement.   As the Deputy can imagine, over the years we would have had a number of inquiries about the use of properties, although not a huge amount of them.  It tends to fall down when the community groups start doing their business plans and realise that if the roof gets blown off in a storm tomorrow, if the property gets flooded or if it would have to take out insurance, they often could not afford to deal with it.  If a property is licensed to a group, it must look after it.  It must sustain it and it must pay for the electricity and all the utilities that would go with the property.  Often when groups confront themselves with that reality the idea becomes problematic for them.  <\/p> <p>  I have been involved with property for a year and a half or two years and in that time we have had the keys of properties handed back to us on a number of occasions.  People tell us that they had a very good concept and very good intentions but that the person who was involved has moved on.  Things dissipate as they go on.  The intention is often very good but we have to be careful that a property which is being used is being protected and cared for.  Other than that, often the only logical thing to do with these properties is to sell them.

While this review is going on an awful lot of State properties are lying idle that might be put to good use.  Based on what Mr. Bourke has said, we need to give comfort to the communities that do get these properties that money will be given from a different Departments to help them in terms of infrastructure, or the development or protection of those buildings and to make them livable or occupiable for the use in question.  I am looking at that personally and I have met with the two Ministers in that regard.  It is something we are working on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#C00700","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Will the witnesses address the issue of the number of properties that are sold by private treaty rather than by public auction?

At present, the majority of action taking place on the disposal of properties is actually with regard to other State agencies, particularly local authorities.  Before any property is disposed of, either through private treaty or at auction, a protocol is in place and there is a circular from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that requires the property would first be offered to State bodies, such as local authorities, the Department of Education and Skills or the HSE, to see whether they require the property.  This was part of the OPW's reform agenda on property and we now do this as a matter of course.  As a result of this, particularly in the context of the housing and homelessness issue, there has been an amount of interest in vacant properties.  Some local authorities have taken an interest, particularly Dublin City Council, and we have worked with it to transfer those properties under the protocol.  We also have similar arrangements in Limerick, Cork and Tipperary.  It is a fluid situation and we are trying to make sure the properties are used to their optimum.  As a general rule, if they have to be disposed of we advertise them.  We get an auctioneer and advertise them so everyone would have a fair chance to get them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Bourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I do not have the 2017 figures, but if we look at 2014, 15 properties were sold by public auction and none by private treaty.

It was to do with works that are required at Tinnahinch in Carlow and Graiguenamanagh in Kilkenny.  I received a reply from the Minister of State, and I appreciate it, but I wanted to raise as a Topical Issue rather than a parliamentary question.  I want to explain to the Minister of State the reason for this is that a considerable amount of work must be done on both sides of the river at that point.  This work will involve a number of agencies, including Kilkenny County Council, Carlow County Council, Waterways Ireland, Irish Water and, I presume, the OPW, because there is still a flooding issue at one point along that section of river.  There is also the issue of the removal of sandbags that were put there to prevent flooding.  Those sandbags cannot be removed because of the fact the flooding continues, and there is a fear that a house or two would be flooded.  I am using this opportunity to ask the Minister of State again whether he will look at the possibility of the OPW taking a lead role in bringing these agencies together so that an overall plan can be put in place to deliver all of the work required under supervision.

That was in the context of a preliminary assessment looking at both these areas which concluded there was no viable major flood scheme for either area.  On a pilot basis, we looked at whether individual property protection would work.  The conclusion was it could work but the downside of the scheme is it would give protection for a one in 15 year event.  The Chairman will be familiar with the level of damage from the 2015 floods, which was extensive.  They were one in 100 year floods so individual property protection would give no defence against the consequences of a flooding event of that magnitude.  We have subsequently looked at both areas again and concluded there are viable CFRAM schemes for both areas.  Technically, they are doable.  Our colleagues had an engagement with the local authority to go through these issues.  What has been identified, given the nature of the adjoining rivers, is that the fixed defences, the embankments and the walls would be very high.  In Thomastown, we could be looking at in excess of 2 m so visually there is a potential impact which we have discussed with the local authority.  There may be an option to put Perspex inserts into them to lessen the visual impact.  If we go that route, the cost of the scheme will start to increase rapidly and then it will have to be assessed against the benefit.  We are in the process of working our way through what the optimum approach is.  The important thing is we have now identified technically viable schemes for both those areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Sydenham"},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Sydenham provide a note on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#F01200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518688800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Sydenham"},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>What about Inistioge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#F01400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518688800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I have no updated information on Inistioge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#F01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Sydenham"},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Mr. Sydenham might provide an update on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#F01600","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518688800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>We will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018021500002#F01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Sydenham"},{"type":"speech","time":1518688800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>In terms of human resources and qualifications in human resource management, what is the structure in the OPW?

In 2016, the then Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, wrote to me on the Arts for Peace Foundation and Durrow Abbey.  He welcomed the fact that he had written and proposed a meeting and that both parties were going to focus to mutually resolve the current impasse, recognising the issue faced by all and agreeing a way forward.<\/p> <p>  I met the then Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and some of the officials on two if not three occasions and I felt the issue was being moved forward in a positive way and that a resolution would be found.  I am deeply disappointed that effort was not brought over the line.  My feeling is that while there was reluctance on both sides to find a resolution, the greater reluctance was on the side of the OPW.<\/p> <p>  In spite of the papers being served, both the Minister of State and his officials know, that papers can be served and deals can be done even after that.  Papers can be served at times, and I believe this is one of them, when the client on the other side is pushed to the point where if they do not serve the papers before a particular date, they lose.  To protect their position, they serve the papers.<\/p> <p>  I believe that the  Arts for Peace Foundation as a project is an excellent project.  I have visited Durrow Abbey and looked at the building.  It is in good shape and I think it should be in the ownership of the State as it was.  I firmly believe that with an effort, with both sides sitting down without being tied by legal process and without prejudice, they could reach a resolution, rather than spend unnecessary funds and scarce resources on a case when in my opinion the Arts for Peace Foundation has a good case.

I will try to indicate those amendments I will be opposing and those I will be supporting as I go on.<\/p><p>In respect of amendment Nos. 157 and 160, which are related, these are amendments proposed by Dr. Patrick O'Brien, who was referred to in previous sessions.  We have had a debate recently about the Government requiring, or at least the perception that it requires, discretion in relation to appointments.  I refer to the conflict between that and the desire to have a fully transparent process with the judicial appointments commission making as much of the decision as possible.<\/p><p>Where the person appointed to judicial office is not a person who was recommended by the judicial appointments commission, amendment No. 157 requires that a reasoned written decision would be published in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il <\/i>explaining the reason for that person's appointment outside of the judicial appointments commission process.  Similarly, amendment No. 160 relates to the placing of a statement before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 30 days of that appointment giving a written decision as to why a person was appointed who was not nominated by the commission.  There is clear and obvious sense to it.  Whatever the arguments about constitutionality, if the committee accepts the case that the Government must have a greater degree of discretion than the judicial appointment commission provides to it, then in the exceptionally rare circumstances that people would be appointed outside this process the Oireachtas and the public deserve to have an understanding as to why this was the case.  This provides for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#D05300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Before returning to the Minister, does anyone else wish to make a contribution on that or will I go to the Minister first?

Amendment No. 157 would require a proposed new subsection (2), the publication in <i>Iris Oifig&uacute;il <\/i>of a reasoned written explanation of any decision.  In addition, under the proposed new subsection (3), the persons who are recommended by the commission must not be identified in such publication.  My difficulty is that the amendment would require the Government to explain in writing the hows and wherefores of why, in any particular instance, the advice given to the President in regard to an appointment may concern a candidate other than the one actually recommended by the commission.  It, therefore, puts a clear onus and responsibility on the Government to justify actions taken on foot of the exercise of what is a constitutional provision.  There is that problem but aside from that, I am not sure what the value or benefit of such an amendment might be, and what its practical impact might be in terms of fairness to all those involved in the process, be they a recommended candidate or a candidate that did not make the cut.  I note what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said, that it is a desire on his part for increased transparency around the process of how, in what circumstances and in what way the Government would advise the President as to the appointment.  I have said this before and rather than delaying the committee's proceedings, I reiterate that my position is the same.  As a fundamental position, I cannot support any amendment that might give the impression or be perceived to undermine what is a clear constitutional prerogative on the part of the Government in the matter of judicial appointments.<\/p><p>Similarly, on amendment No. 160, I see it as compromising, interfering or even undermining the manner in which the constitutional position, where the Government is free to reject the recommendation of the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#E00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Deputy Jack Chambers and I will support amendments Nos. 157 and 160, partly because there is a similar provision in our own legislation which has passed Second Stage.  I note the Minister says he is opposed to it because he thinks that it is constitutionally frail and could impinge on the prerogative of the Government to nominate individuals for appointment.  That point is valid in regard to amendments Nos. 150 and 151, tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace, which we voted down.  I am not sure that their suggestions were unconstitutional but I had concerns if the Government was told that it must select, and could only select, a person from the three names given to the Government by the commission.  That is on the borderline of constitutionality.  However, what is proposed in amendments Nos. 157 and 160 is different.  What is proposed there is that the commission gives the three names to the Government.  Under the Minister's proposal in the legislation, as drafted, all that is required is that if the Government does not select one of those three names, it must publish that fact in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;l<\/i>.  That is exactly the same as the current position, so there is no substantive change in the law.  It is appropriate that if the Government makes a decision that it is not going to appoint one of the three people nominated, that it should provide a reasoned explanation as to why it is not doing so.  It does not involve referring to the individuals who have not been appointed.  If, say, Jack Chambers was appointed but he was not one of the three on the list, the Minister or the Government should say that Mr. Justice Chambers was appointed, although he was not nominated by the commission, and it should explain the reason it selected him.  Maybe he has particular expertise in medical legal law and the Government needed an expert in that area to hear many cases or perhaps he has an expertise in the Irish language and there was a vacancy in the area and we needed more expertise in the Irish language.  It is not something that is difficult to do.  If we do not have that, we will have gone through all this process of putting in a new structure when, ultimately, there will be no change from the current situation.  For those reasons, we will support the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#E00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>If no other members wish to contribute, I will return to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#E00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Callaghan put it well.

What this does is clearly quite different.  It tries to ensure that there is an incentive for the Government not to ride roughshod over the process, and to ensure that it is not too easy for Government to constantly go outside the process.  The process is very clear.  If the Government sees a compelling reason for appointing someone to a particular position, a person who was not considered by the judicial appointments commission, it is at liberty to do so but it is absolutely reasonable that it be required to justify that and give a reason in the process that is outlined in the amendment.

I thank members for their contributions.  We have had a very in-depth discussion over a number of meetings, and it is clear that members have highlighted differing views on a number of important aspects of the Bill.  The committee has amended certain components, sections and parts of the Bill in a significant way.<\/p> <p>  Arising from our deliberations, and I am sure this will come as no surprise to the Chairman, we still have much work to do on a number of elements of the Bill in the context of looking at approaches, acknowledging amendments we have made and taking stock as to how best we might approach matters prior to and on Report Stage.  During the course of the debate, I made a number of commitments that I would, on behalf of the Government, come back with some amendments, which I will do.  Of course, I am very keen to give adequate notice, in the circumstances of the Bill, unlike in the normal course of events, having been altered quite significantly.<\/p> <p>  Given the fact that what may likely transpire to be an additional complement of membership on the board of the commission, we need to do some more work on the matter of the specifications for membership, in light of the changes which have been approved by the committee and on how the lay members of the commission are recruited.  I acknowledge on my part and that of my officials, that further consideration must be given to the reformulation of aspects of the Bill to determine the best approach.  On whether, on the matter of recruitment, it will be entirely a matter for the Public Appointments Service or whether we can have a nomination arrangement to the satisfaction of the Deputies as debated, I need to see how that might be designed to meet the disposition and clear wishes of the committee.  I must consider whether we have a mix of people, some chosen by the Public Appointments Service and some nominated to the commission by specified nominating bodies.  Against the background in which the committee structure has been removed, I want to examine the balance between having a manageable number of persons on the commission and ensuring there is an appropriate contribution of all court presidents, having regard to the various strands of appointment.<\/p> <p>  I invite members of the committee to agree with me on the following point.<\/p><p>Our objective must be to have a structure with a balance between having a commission that is not so large as to be unworkable or unwieldy while holding fast to the initial design of the Bill.  Specifically, the central principles of the Bill are a lay majority on the commission and an independent chairperson.  Those must be reconciled with the importance of ensuring that we have the appropriate inputs of all court precedents, including the presence of the District Court and of the Circuit Court.  That is not quite clear now under the Bill as has passed Committee Stage.  I want to give the Chairman notice of my intention to table an amendment to address a technical issue concerning advances of funds to the commission.  I am sure that will be welcome.  Likewise, depending on what the Parliamentary Counsel has to say, we may need to look at tabling further drafting amendments consequential to those that have already been made, particularly in Part 4 regarding the removal of relevant committees as was originally intended, to ensure that there is no unintended impact on other aspects of the Bill.  Even looking at the Long Title, although we have agreed it, we all consequently agreed that it would not be the final word on that.<\/p><p> In light of the fact that we have made a large number of amendments, I am mindful of the need to proof where we are going to ensure that the contents are legally and constitutionally acceptable and that the drafting is fully in order.  There will not be an imminent or sudden tabling of Report Stage amendments.  I have acknowledged that some work needs to be done and that will take some time.  I would be happy to keep the Chairman fully informed of developments.  If any members of the committee wish to engage with me or my officials bilaterally, I would not only be open to that but would be keen to engage in such a discussion but we will have to take our time.  Ultimately, the Bill can only benefit from the opportunity that it now presents, which is a form of breathing space between now and Report Stage.  I also thank the Chairman for the efficient way in which he managed to steer us through almost 200 amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#J03000","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I will cherish those words of commendation from the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#K00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I would not take it too seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018021500002#K00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1518703200,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I will hold those words tight.
