I am the entrepreneurship manager in Bord Bia, and I am joined today by my colleagues Mr. Declan Fennell and Mr. Mark Zieg from the Bord Bia meat and livestock division.  Over the course of the next ten minutes we will share with the committee Bord Bia&rsquo;s activity within the organic sector on the Irish and export markets, with a specific focus on the meat sector.<\/p> <p>  Bord Bia&rsquo;s role is to drive, through market insight and in partnership with industry, the commercial success of a world class Irish food, drink and horticulture industry.  In the organic sector our focus is to establish markets for organic produce rather than the recruitment of new producers into the supply base.  This role is undertaken through the creation and execution of the annual organic marketing plan which is overseen and funded by the organic unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  In addition, there are over 40 active organic companies on Bord Bia&rsquo;s client database, all of which can benefit from the many marketing and business development support services that are provided by Bord Bia on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>  I will give the committee a brief overview of current market performance of organic products.  The value of the Irish organic retail market is just over &euro;110 million.  The organic market is approximately 1% of the overall food and drink market in Ireland and, like all aspects of the market, has had significant challenges at retail level in the years of the economic recession.  However, in 2014 and 2015 the organic market has returned to growth and although not yet back at pre-recession value, year to date growth in 2015 is plus 9%.  According to Kantar&rsquo;s Worldpanel data, this growth is being driven by more shoppers buying more products more often.<\/p> <p>  With regard to market share, the three categories of vegetables, yoghurt and fruit make up over half of the market for organic sales at retail level in Ireland.  It is always interesting to understand who is purchasing organic products and, again through Kantar data, we can see the key segments are the pre-family group, the over 45s with family and households with older dependants.  Appeal is greatest in households with highest level of disposable incomes.  The majority of retail sales for organic are through the established multiple retailers.  Super Valu has performed strongest for organic sales in 2015 but Tesco is the most important retailer in volume.  Interestingly, the biggest share growth for organic in 2015 was in Aldi, an indication of the importance of the discounters to the future growth of the sector in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Internationally, the market for organic food and drink is valued at &pound;40 billion according to recent figures from the Soil Association. There was a slow-down and in some markets a decline in organic growth over recent years but, similar to the market here at home, there has been renewed growth in the 2014-2015 period.<\/p><p>The United States accounts for almost half of this &pound;40 billion and is by far the leading organic market in the world.  Germany, France, UK, Italy and Switzerland are the top five markets for organic sales in Europe with a combined value of approximately &euro;17 billion euro.<\/p><p> I will now turn to how Bord Bia supports the organic sector on the domestic and international markets.  I remind members that in both cases Bord Bia&rsquo;s remit is to act as the link between suppliers and potential new customers, providing market and consumer insight, route to market, brand communication and one to one support.  In addition to the Origin Green programme, these are the strategic pillars under which Bord Bia operates.<\/p><p> On the domestic market, in addition to a market development role, our role is also to increase the awareness and understanding of organic products with the Irish consumer.  Through research, we can get under the bonnet of organic with consumers and use this information to help us target messages and advertorials across the right media to the right audience.  Importantly, this research is also a powerful tool in our meetings with buyers and retailers as we showcase the potential of the sector and the value of an organic offer to their customers.<\/p><p> The bi-annual National Organic Awards are another powerful means by which to showcase the sector to consumers and retailers alike and are used by the winning producers to raise their own profile and generate new business.   The annual Bloom festival is the ultimate shop window for organic producers to meet more than 100,000 current and prospective consumers and over the last number of years, the sector has been well represented within the Bord Bia food village at Bloom while also educating the next generation of consumers via the organic schools garden initiative.<\/p><p> A programme of retail mentoring support specifically for organic producers large and small was introduced by Bord Bia in 2014 and feedback to date from participating companies has been overwhelmingly positive as they look to gain a stronger foothold in the retail market.  Not surprisingly, with a size of prize of over &pound;40 billion pounds, making inroads into export markets is the ambition for many organic suppliers.  Bord Bia supports the identification of potential new markets and customers for the organic sector through a joined up process of market study visits and the research and publication of organic market reports.     In 2014, the focus was Germany, in 2015 it was France and next year it will be the UK market.  This year&rsquo;s French market activity included research of the organic consumer in France and their awareness and expectations of organic products and brands from Ireland.  This is critical information for companies intending to export to that market and gives them a headstart versus international competitors in the development of market specific products and communications.  From a trade fair perspective, the annual Biofach fair in Nuremberg, Germany is the key event for organics on the European market.  Each year approximately eight to ten Irish producers participate on the Ireland stand across a range of categories.  The estimated value of new business to participants on this stand in 2015 was &euro;2.5 million.<\/p><p> Looking at two export focused sectors in particular, I will now ask my colleague Mr. Mark Zieg to share a brief insight into how Bord Bia supports the development of the organic beef sector internationally.  He will be followed by Mr. Declan Fennell who will focus on the opportunity and supports for the organic sheepmeat sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Bentley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448978400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Irish beef exports in 2014 totalled 524,000 tonnes carcase weight equivalent.  It is estimated that organic beef accounted for approximately 2,800 tonnes in total production.  This was marketed both on the home market which is dominated by retail sales, as well as exports to retail and value added customers in markets such as Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.<\/p> <p>  Bord Bia's promotional strategy for Irish beef is centred around finding differentiated and premium markets and promoting Irish beef with higher value customers in those markets.  Organic beef is very much part of this strategy representing a high value, differentiated, niche offering.  Consumer perceptions of organic are very well aligned with the natural and sustainable image of Irish beef.  In recent research in some of our key markets such as Germany, Holland and Italy we have found high correlations in positive opinions of Irish beef among consumers with a higher propensity to purchase organic beef.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year, Irish organic beef secured a listing with one of our largest retail customers in Germany.  Bord Bia supported the successful brand development and listing of this product.  In Britain we are currently undertaking a consumer insight and branding project for an Irish organic beef range with a leading online retailer.  This represents an important opportunity for Irish beef.<\/p><p>According to Kantar Worldpanel's research, organic and branded retail have been identified as two of the most promising growth trends in the UK beef retail category.<\/p><p> In the context of the future outlook, it is estimated that organic beef production in Ireland could grow by as much as 40% over the next five years, as a result of the high uptake in organic conversion among beef farmers.  Feedback from the contact our overseas offices have had with existing and potential customers and from their discussions with exporters suggests this additional volume will be well received in meeting the growing international demand for organic beef.  Specifically we see opportunities in the retail and food service sectors in Northern Europe, the USA and Asia.  That said, full access to the US market for Irish manufacturing beef and certification of Irish beef plants to export to China will be a prerequisite to unlocking this potential.  On the production side, seasonality of supply remains an issue as most customers require a year-round supply capability.  This is a challenge that the entire sector will need to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Zieg","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448978400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Irish sheep sector has delivered a solid performance over recent years, with the value of exports growing at a faster rate than volume.  Since 2009, total sheepmeat exports increased by 25% to reach &euro;218 million, while volumes have reached 43,000 tonnes, equivalent to a 4% increase.<\/p> <p>  The UK and France continue to be the core markets for Irish sheepmeat, accounting for 60% of total export volumes.  The success of Irish sheepmeat exports can be attributed to the shift away from trading in carcases towards developing prime cuts.  Our ability to deliver a product according to an exact market specification has enabled us to optimise our product and market mix.  This has ultimately delivered a better price return back to the farmer.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Irish sheep sector and, indeed, the broader European industry are faced with a universal challenge, which is how we attract younger, lighter buyer consumers to the lamb category.  According to Kantar Worldpanel data, 65% of Irish lamb shoppers are over 45 years of age.  This trend is not unique to the Irish market.  Younger consumers lack exposure to lamb and knowledge on how to prepare and cook this meat.  In an initiative to address this challenge, Bord Bia, in partnership with our counterparts in France and the UK, launched a three year campaign to promote lamb across six EU markets earlier this year.  The Lamb - Tasty, Easy, Fun campaign targets consumers in the 25 to 45 year age group in the six EU markets involved and aims to highlight the importance of European lamb production and its versatility as an everyday meal.<\/p> <p>  From a consumer perspective, we need to recognise that lamb is relatively more expensive when compared to other offerings in the fresh meat category and thereby commands a smaller share of retail shelf space.  While organic beef is relatively successful, organic lamb faces more challenges, as I have outlined.  In general, conventional lamb sales are down in the UK and throughout the rest of the EU.  Nevertheless, it is important to stress there are some niche opportunities for Irish organic lamb in mainstream retailers and specialist organic stores in our main export markets.  However, listings of organic lamb in these outlets are often of small volume with a limited range of one or two types of cut, such as leg or rack of lamb. <\/p> <p>  Recognising that the number of organic sheep in Ireland is set to increase as a result of the GLAS scheme, Bord Bia has put in place a programme of activities to seek to identify and develop market opportunities for organic lamb.  In partnership with the Irish processing industry, and through the network of our overseas offices, Bord Bia is engaging in a number of initiatives in trade research, brand development and market prioritisation to further the development of the organic sheepmeat market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Fennell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448978400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Our presentation this morning has focused on the bespoke set of supports for organic producers that are delivered under the organic marketing plan.  In the interests of time, I have not outlined all of the other supports that are available to organic and conventional producers alike as part of Bord Bia&rsquo;s annual activity.  These supports include supplier development programmes, such as our food academy and Tesco Taste Bud, and export programmes in retail and food service in the UK and continental markets.  Many organic companies have undertaken extensive consumer and brand development work through Bord Bia&rsquo;s SuperBrands and foresight for food services, and others are exploring new routes to market via our digital food hub with Google.<\/p><p>Last March, approximately 20 organic companies participated at Marketplace International in the National Convention Centre, the largest buyer-supplier showcase for the food sector staged in Ireland, with over 180 participating companies and more than 500 buyers that will generate more than &euro;30 million of new sales for participants this year.<\/p><p> It is the view of Bord Bia that the potential for continued growth of organic exists and that organic plays an important role for consumers at home and abroad.  Through the collective efforts of all elements of the organic sector to overcome the challenges of supply, we hope Irish organic producers can make the most of this potential.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Bentley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.  According to the presentation, the Irish market for organic produce is &euro;110 million.  How much of it is supplied by Irish, as opposed to imported?  How much organic production is marketed, branded and sold as organic?  Farmers produce beef organically and receive the top-ups and grants for doing so.  However, when it goes to a factory, the factory sells it on as ordinary meat, not as a premium product.  There is a major mismatch in both directions.  The witnesses said three categories, vegetables, yoghurt and fruit, made up half the retail organic sales in Ireland.  It is fascinating the beef and lamb are not included, and it shows there is a major challenge.  I would love to see the composition of what organic farmers are producing.  Is it mainly beef, vegetables, fruit or dairy products that can be made into yogurt?  How do the producers and retailers match up?  It is very important.<\/p> <p>  Is there a significant variation in our organic exports?  Many of the organic products sold in Ireland would be vegetables, potatoes and fruit, whereas our exports are less likely to be in this market.  Some domestic organic produce would be sold in farmers' markets.  I imagine our organic exports are more in the lamb and beef sectors.  There is no point in telling me the organic market is worth &pound;40 billion if we do not know what we are likely to get on the market and what there is demand for.<\/p> <p>  I take it that everything sold as organic here under the Bord Bia label is accredited.  For some reason, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine requires organic farmers to get accreditation from private companies at a phenomenal annual cost of approximately &euro;3,000, which is a hell of a lot of money for a farmer.  Given that Bord Bia is doing accreditation for these farmers, why do they have to get a duplicate accreditation at such a cost?  Could Bord Bia do the accreditation for them?  Presumably, Bord Bia sends its inspectors to check that everything is done correctly so products can be sold as organic.  I do not understand why they have to hand over so much of their hard-earned cash for accreditation, given that Bord Bia is already doing it.  As is often the case in Ireland, it seems we have to do everything twice rather than in a simple way.<\/p><p> It always seemed a strange paradox that none of the farmers who probably operate in the most natural way, by whom I mean hill farmers, are, to my knowledge, organic farmers.  Of these, hill sheep farmers particularly are not.  I understand the reason is that they dose the sheep, particularly for worms and fluke.  On the other hand, it is fair to say that, compared to intensively fed animals, the blackface mountain lamb is one of our most unique and most natural products.  Perhaps they would consider this, maybe not under an organic label but under some label.  I might be straying a little out of court but, please God, the Chairman will indulge me on this one.  I was involved, as a co-op manager many years ago, in trying to market hill lamb.  It is not the easiest thing in the world to do.  We started flying them live by jet to Italy.  Then Halal companies came in and started slaughtering them.  It cost &pound;4,000 in 1976 to charter an aeroplane from Martinair to fly them from Shannon to Milan.  As I said, there was a market then in Italy, Portugal and Spain, but it always has been a very variable market.  One of the thought processes I have had over the years is, rather than selling Connemara hill lamb and Kerry hill lamb, why not have a Wild Atlantic Way hill lamb?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#O00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Why not have Wicklow hill lamb?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#P00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Do not mind that; those are all Cheviot crosses.

We had a debate here on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, part of which would be to do with genetically modified, GM, produce and cross-contamination.  Are GM foods in use having any effect in Ireland?  Is Irish produce completely free of that?

I keep thinking of the wild blackface lamb and the Wild Atlantic Way and I thought, why not have the \"Comeragh sunny south-east whiteface organic wild lamb\"?<\/p> <p>  Moving on to serious business, it is interesting that Aldi and Lidl have entered the organic market.  Organic was big before the recession but it is coming back.  I should know the answer to the following question, and it must be a good one, but what percentage added value do meat or vegetables gain for a producer selling to the market if they are organic?<\/p> <p>  We had an interesting chat here.  We have had so many meetings recently but it was a defining moment for me.  I am interested in Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point.  If a farmer is grazing sheep on the hills and dipping his sheep, and therefore they are non-organic, there could be organic sheep grazing alongside them.  The light-bulb moment for me was that all our commonages and hills are organic and if the farmers knew that and we could help them become organic, they could get a much greater return on their lambs.  These are farmers who need this money and who are suffering great hardship.<\/p> <p>  The three witnesses will be able to tell me better than anyone else what they are doing right in Austria.  Is it something to do with European grants and have we got the grants wrong here?  Austria is only a little bigger than Ireland and its population is much larger, but it has 20,000 organic farmers and we have 1,700.  Obviously, theirs is a much wealthier nation.  They are getting a much bigger price but our sector is doing the same amount of work.  There is a bit of hassle in organic but once one gets into it, it is pretty much the same.  I am sorry to say this, but we have much more low-hanging fruit in terms of image than Austria.  When one goes to Biofach in Germany, as I have done, they see our Origin Green and the Minister, Deputy Coveney's sustainability programme straightaway.  It is a real piece of low-hanging fruit.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, asked last year if Irish farmers are slightly afraid of converting to organic.  Is there something we are not doing in this regard?  He stated that there are very significant opportunities for the sector, and that we have a great name right across the world in terms of cleanliness, the beautiful food and the environment.  Are we missing something there?  Some 14% of all Austrian farmers are organic.  I note the words they used: \"premium\", \"differential\" and \"Irish\".  There is a lot more money to be got for our farmers here but somehow or other, although Bord Bia is doing a lot of work, the Government is not doing something and we are not joining the dots.  I would appreciate the representatives' straight-up hard views on this subject.  The position of hill farmers is a piece of low-hanging fruit for us because neither I nor, I think, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knew that we could help many farmers convert to organic where they could get perhaps 80% more for their lambs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#Q00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  Most of the points have been covered but I wish to raise a topic I have been talking about for many years.  In my previous job I represented hill farmers, most of whom were from the west, within the IFA and I covered the western seaboard.  I am interested in Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point about the Wild Atlantic Way brand and in branding lamb from along the coastline as wild Atlantic lamb.  The volume would be there.  There is an area in west Sligo where people sell organic lamb, as do people in Connemara and Kerry.  There is significant potential if everybody came together.  Now is the time to encourage people to graze these hills some more.  The hills were overgrazed but then left undergrazed for eight to ten years.  We would like to encourage young people in particular to get their sheep stock back on the hills.  To do that they must be assured of a good price for their product.  Irish lamb is an excellent product and there is significant potential with organic lamb and smaller carcases in beef, such as Angus beef which is more easily finished.  Grain can now be sourced within Ireland rather than it having to be imported.  This was a problem if one wanted to finish animals as the organic grain was expensive and people had to pay high prices.  More of that grain can be home-grown so while there is potential, much work remains to be done.  The number of farmers is quite small, as Senator O'Brien has said.  With 1,700 organic farmers, we should certainly try to encourage more farmers to get into this type of business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#R00100","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448978400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question first.  He correctly pointed out that within the &euro;110 million, vegetables, fruit and yoghurt represent the majority of sales in my estimates.  At least 50% to 60% of the &euro;110 million comes from the Irish market purely based on the strength of horticulture and dairy sector products represented in those categories.  Fruit is much more seasonal and a category which relies more heavily on imports from overseas.<\/p> <p>  The second question was how much product is organic but is sold as conventional.  I do not have a figure for that but I acknowledge there is an awareness and understanding at farmer level that this is perceived as something that needs to be looked at, especially how the farmers have their animals slaughtered and whether it could be more convenient and nearer to where they farm the land.  This issue is looked at regularly by my colleagues on the organic focus steering group.<\/p> <p>  Horticulture, beef, dairy and seafood are the main sectors represented overall at farm level.  The importance of seafood must not be forgotten.  It is one of the key components of the organic sector.  This relates to the next topic of exports.  The main exports, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, do not necessarily follow the horticulture sector.  Seafood is a very important sector, especially organic salmon.  Ireland is the number one producer in Europe of farmed organic salmon.  At events such as Biofach, at least three or four out of the eight producers we have there annually represent the seafood sector.  Whether it is salmon or mussels, seafood is very important for organic exports.  Beef is becoming more important and the committee can see these data as presented by my colleague, Mr. Mark Zieg.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the prepared foods sector, we see increasing exports to a variety of European markets and some world markets.<\/p><p>I wish to correct any potential misunderstanding around the issue of double certification.  Organic produce in Ireland is not sold under any Bord Bia label.  It would only be sold under labels of the Irish organic certification bodies, such as the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, IOFGA, the Organic Trust, the Soil Association or Demeter.  Bord Bia would not double certify producers.  Our Bord Bia quality scheme covers meat, some horticulture and poultry but it is very separate from the organic schemes.   The way the system is operated in Ireland with the private certification bodies is quite similar to some other European markets.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made reference to hill lamb.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Bentley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448978400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The historical background of the sector is that hill lambs and light lambs were exported to markets such as Portugal, Spain and Italy.  The lighter lamb was approximately 11 kg to 13 kg, where conventional lamb is around 22 kg.  Those lambs were exported until 2008 when those markets hit a recession and the trade evaporated almost overnight which was more than a disappointment.  With regard to opportunities for hill lamb producers, we work with these producers particularly in the west of Ireland, Kerry or Waterford and there is no doubt it is a fantastic product.  However, one of the hallmarks of the success of the Irish sheep industry is in delivering a product to a customer specification.  One of our challenges, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to it, is to introduce a discipline of best practice in getting to sufficient weight and bringing these lighter carcasses up to a heavier carcass suitable for a market, whether it is exported as a full carcass or preferably sent out as a primal individual such as leg, loin or rack.  That is where the real opportunities lie.  Bord Bia has worked with a number of groups around the country, small groups of producers whether it is in Mayo, Kerry, and obviously our role is about informing them about opportunities in the market while delivering to a market specification.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy suggested using the Wild Atlantic Way branding.  This has been discussed in terms of a unified story when promoting a branded proposition from the western parts of Ireland.  Bord Bia is focused on working with individual producer groups and assisting them in the disciplines of market needs, consistency in product weight, year round availability, the marketing and promotion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Fennell"},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>What are the weights to which Mr. Fennell refers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#S00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448978400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Teagasc has conducted research in Athenry and has demonstrated that it can be done and it does involve meal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Fennell"},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>A lot of meal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#S00500","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448978400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>There is a combination of two factors when one talks about the ideal, namely, weight and fat cover.

The more we can export - we are exporting - the less there is.  We are not just going for the premium cuts as we now take a lot of forequarter beef from the organic stream and it is exported to some of the large producers of baby food throughout Europe.  We have much better carcass distribution between various customers in various markets.  We have other customers for round cuts in markets such as Holland.  The level of leakage is very low.  It is higher than that that in the mainstream sector, but there is pretty good coverage and it is getting better all the time.  We have the drive to get organic products into more export markets such as China and the United States because we can improve on this figure.<\/p><p> On beef and lamb not being part of the leading sales, the figure is from this country and as a result of Irish consumers having high trust in the mainstream product produced here.

The Deputy is correct to state direct sales are not included.  It is very difficult to quantify exactly how much is sold independently through food markets and one-to-one farm gate sales.  The overall figure is higher than &euro;110 million, but, having said that, almost 90% of the total is sold through retailers; therefore, the figure captures a very good proportion of it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the economic profile of consumers, price is the number one barrier to buying organic produce.  From as far back as 2006 our research has consistently shown that it is always raised as the number one issue for consumers.  It is why they will not buy organic products or do not buy more of them.  There are communication issues which we are working to overcome.  This concerns education on the benefits of organic products and how best to convey the perceived consumer benefits in terms of health, nutrition, flavour and taste.  Through the campaign of advertorials we have run in recent years, we have tried to communicate to consumers directly the benefits of organic products and how to identify and find organic products on shelves.  A total of 50% of consumers do not buy organic products and have no intention of buying them; therefore, our focus is very much on the 50% who are engaged to try to convince them to increase their spend and purchase more.<\/p> <p>  To answer Senator Darragh O'Brien, the consensus between my colleagues and I is that the percentage gain for producers selling to retailers is somewhere between 10% and 20% in some categories.  It very much depends on the category involved.  The situation in Austria could be due to a combination of factors in terms of what is done differently there.  We have had discussions on this issue among ourselves.<\/p><p>As it is a more mountainous country, the pasture open for organic grazing is higher than here and more farms naturally fall into it.  We chose to follow one set of organic certification standards and the Austrians chose another.  Perhaps the net of farmers who are considered to be organic is wider in Austria because it applies different organic standards.  It could also be a market-driven approach in terms of public procurement opportunities.  I am not sure, but is there a level in public procurement contracts at which a certain amount of purchases must be organic?  That would help to stimulate and drive demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Bentley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for the presentation.

As Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned, the lamb produced on the hills of counties Mayo, Wicklow, Dublin and Kerry is organic.  It has been traded to other countries, but according to some farmers, some of this trade is gone.

This is a heavy-handed way to deal with the matter.  With the best will in the world, every one of us makes mistakes.

No one can try to tell me that organic fish farmers do not use chemicals to control for various diseases or lice.  Fish produced on such farms can be labelled as organic but I would take the hill lamb over such a fish any day, in terms of it being a natural product.

Let us say a farmer has left something out at the back of a book.  In such cases, the attitude seems to be that if there is one thing missing, then the whole lot falls.  A biro is put through the whole lot and the farmer is out of action for six months.  Why do we not introduce a system whereby we work with farmers?  This is bread and butter for a lot of farmers.  Why do we not introduce a system where, if something is done incorrectly, there is one mark against the farmer and it is only if the farmer accumulates four marks that he or she is gone for six months?  We need to bring people with us.  If we want farmers to continue to operate under the Bord Bia scheme and the various organic schemes, we must work with them rather than behaving like Hitler and making them afraid.  We must make sure there is a good working relationship so that farmers are not afraid when they see a car pulling into their yard.  Bord Bia should look at this issue carefully.  Farmers should not be penalised straight away if they make a mistake, particularly if the mistake is minor.  I have no problem with them being penalised for six months if they are guilty of three or four offences.  In that context they would have had several warnings, but they should not be penalised for a first offence.  Some of the people that Bord Bia deals with did not go to Trinity College.

I know from personal experience that trying to get them up to the required weight is nearly impossible.  A farmer could put a lot of meal into a sheep and it would not really be the same animal at all by the time it was finished.  Over the years it has been a major challenge that some farmers in places like the Chairman comes from buy sheep, put them into a green field and think these lovely mountain sheep are going to fatten.  There are two problems.  They are very slow to fatten on grass and they end up in every dris and every hedge they can find for five miles around and will not stay in the middle of the lush green field.

That would allow them two summers on the hills.  What many other people would define as a hogget would be described as a lamb, because lowland lambs are born in February and have a much longer season.  There is a need for the people who are trying to produce the article, because in many cases they will not be able to produce economically what Bord Bia is talking about.

I would know Connemara a bit better than I know Mayo.  If I go to Tourmakeady, which is in south Mayo on the border, they have always been able to produce them.

If I go to Joyce country, to places like Glantrague and to the Maam Valley, they begin to get smaller but when I go up to Recess, they get even smaller still.  The same would be the case for the Twelve Bens.  If I go to Roundstone or Oughterard, I am back into good-size lambs again.  It is the many lambs in the middle that are causing the problem, not the ones around the edge.  I would say the same thing happens in Donegal in that on what we call the kinder hills and where there is a better proportion of lowland.

I have a number of slides I would like to present to the committee in advance of the presentation to it by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the fishing opportunities for 2016 and the sustainability impact assessment he will conduct on them.<\/p><p> BirdWatch Ireland is the country's largest environmental charity.  We have been involved in fisheries for a number of years on the basis that when we have healthy seas, we can provide for the wide range of uses that our marine environment is put to by people and fisheries is a major part of that.  Getting our fisheries management right is one part of getting the management of our seas right in order that we can deliver for nature and all the benefits that healthy, natural resources can bring to people.  That is why we are involved in marine policy.<\/p><p> We are engaged in the fishing opportunities process.  It starts much earlier in the year when the European Commission launches its consultation on fishing opportunities and the scientific advice comes out over the course of the year from ICES, which underpins the decisions made about fishing limits.  When it comes to the setting of fishing opportunities or total allowable catches, TACs, it is an opportunity to bring about an end to overfishing, which has done a great deal of damage.  When it comes to the December Council, our Ministers need to kick this habit.  It is the ambition of the new Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, to end the practice of overfishing.  It is documented that overfishing has a profound impact not just on our natural resources but also economically and socially.  The process involves national consultation as well as consultation at European level.  The Minister closed our consultation at the end of last week and the joint committee is part of the process as well, as it will hear from the Minister.  It will culminate in a decision of 28 Ministers at a Council meeting later this month.  It is important from our perspective to influence that process to get the best outcome for our natural resources.<\/p><p> I will outline the current position regarding our fish stocks and discuss the implications of not following the scientific advice.  There are serious economic, social and environmental implications.  I will refer to how to bring about change and make a number of recommendations in advance of hearing from the Minister on 8 December.  The situation now is different from 100 years.  The table on screen describes the biomass of our fish stocks 100 years ago.  This exercise was done by the Seas Around Us Project and it examines the biomass of predatory fish.  Members can see the unique position Ireland was in with its rich waters 100 years ago.  The picture now shows a dramatic change with eight to ten times fewer fish.<\/p><p> With regard to the current status of our stocks, there have been dramatic levels of overfishing.  Between 2001 and 2015, Ministers set TACs above the scientific advice by an average of 20% a year.  We not only have concerns about the past 100 years but more particularly about recent times.  Last year, the December Council of Ministers decided not to follow the scientific advice for 60% of our TACs.  That happened in the context of a new CFP, which has a clearly stated ambition to end this practice, yet last year we had this alarming statistic.  More dramatic change is needed.  It is not happening under the new regime and that is wrong.<\/p><p>We also know from the Commission's agency, the STECF, that there is a persistent overfishing trend and that there are stocks outside of safe biological limits.  A total of 60% of stocks are still outside safe biological limits and so are highly vulnerable.  The delay in implementing the new regime and framework shows a level of complacency.  It is also not at all in keeping with the ambition expressed in the Common Fisheries Policy and expressed elsewhere in Irish policy too.<\/p><p> The question is what will happen for the 2015 stocks, which will be decided in December.  It is alarming to note that even in October last, the same Ministers made decisions for the Baltic Sea in which the total allowable catches, TACs, decided on exceeded the scientific advice for six out of ten stocks, which included cod, sprat and herring.<\/p><p> The consequences of ignoring the scientific advice include economic and social consequences, not just consequences for natural resources and the health of the seas.  Those consequences are well documented.  I refer to a couple of reports.  The following information is from the New Economics Foundation.  It identified that overfishing led to a reduction in the profitability of the sector with a rate of employment loss of 4% to 5% at European level.  The report also identified that were we to restore 43 stocks, then we would deliver more fish - in this case 3.5 million tonnes more fish would be landed - and there would be more revenue and more jobs.  We are in a lose-lose scenario now.  We have been losing.  We see the decline in employment and we are losing out on what the potential gains would be.  It is a tragic situation to be in.<\/p><p> A second report, the Sunken Billions, referring to this country, identified that the economic losses from poor management are very significant.  Again, there is a tragedy here because the report also identifies that there is a missed opportunity.  It identifies that it is not too late, which is a positive thing.  There is an additional report to which I do not make reference in the presentation but I have provided copies of it to all members.  It is called Turning the Tide and it gives a really nice summary of the situation, not just the economic, job and social losses that have occurred over the years but also the link to heritage in Ireland and the link to fisheries through our heritage as well.<\/p><p> As well as the loss to natural resources and the link to our heritage, having healthy seas more generally contributes to our ability to regulate the climate, engage in nutrient recycling and in the production of food.  The decisions Ministers are making by not following the science is contrary to a lot of ambition.  That ambition is stated in national policy such as Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth and in the ambition that we see reflected from industry as well, such as in Food Wise 2025.  The ambition is there to have sustainable food sources but what we are lacking is action in terms of looking at the detail and making decisions about that.  There is a policy conflict there that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> The decisions that are made result in short-term gains.  Those short-term gains come at a price to our natural systems which are put under pressure and our stocks are put under pressure.  That is in direct conflict with the Common Fisheries Policy, which was negotiated by the Minister during the EU Presidency.  We see a clear reluctance to delay implementing it, despite it being the same Minister who declared the ambition and then negotiated the specifics.  Those short-term wins are in fact a loss.<\/p><p>Short-term gains put the sector under pressure.  We have seen recent allegations of illegal fishing activities and abuse of migrants, which is a result of the sector being under pressure.  There is a real cost in terms of our natural systems.<\/p><p> The diagram I show is representative of a phenomenon known as fishing down the food web.  First, in a given bit of the ocean, one starts off with a lot of big fish that are of diverse and very mixed species.  When the big fish are fished out, one starts to take in smaller and less diverse fish over time, and eventually one is fishing invertebrates.  We have some classic examples of that.  In the Irish Sea that has resulted in the loss of whitefish, particularly sole, and there are other examples too.  What might be announced as a good result if we have a prawn fishery or a nephrops fishery that would bring in tens of millions is a big loss when it comes to our whitefish in the Irish Sea.  That really does raise the question of what it is we want for our seas.  If we are making a policy decision that we only want to fish prawns in a certain sea area and we are sacrificing our whitefish, let us weigh up the cost of that to the diversity of fisheries on the east coast, for example.  That is a cost that has not been weighed up in the decision-making process.<\/p><p> By way of example, I show a table which is one of a number produced by the Marine Institute showing the stock book.  I do not intend to look at the data, as the print is far too small.  It gives an idea about the science that is compiled to inform the decision making process.  I mentioned the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, but we also have our national agency, the Marine Institute, which collates all the information available.  This is the type of information that informs the decision making process.  Although one can barely make it out, the first block of lines show the Irish Sea, and some red dots are visible, which in that example are for cod.  It is signalling that its population is not in a healthy state, and the recommendation from ICES is not to have a quota for cod in the Irish Sea.  The advice is to have a catch of zero.  That is the scientific advice, yet for every year since 2004 we have had a quota for cod in the Irish Sea.<\/p><p> Some other red dots are shown in the Celtic Sea, which again refer to cod and also sole and plaice.  Many of the species are either data-limited, so there is not a lot of information on the stock, or, where red blobs are shown, the science is showing that the stocks are not in a healthy state.  I want to emphasise that because it is very real and it is reflected in the science, and it has social and economic implications for decisions.<\/p><p> This is what is prepared in advance of the December Council.  The table now on view comes from the New Economics Foundation, which did an analysis of the numbers to see which member states were overfishing and to what extent.  Ireland is identified in the table as overfishing.  The graphic now on view was also produced more recently and it shows that in the Celtic Sea, for example, the excess TAC which was given between 2001 and 2015 is in the region of 22%.  That means we have been excessively fishing in the Celtic Sea over that period by 22%.  There are many reports coming out now analysing the data over a number of years.<\/p><p> A key question that needs to be considered in assessing the sustainability of the fisheries decisions Ministers are taking is who is winning.  Where is the national allocation going?  That is not something one hears enough discussion about.<\/p><p>Of the fixed quota allocation for Northern Ireland, 58% is going to one vessel.  Cobbling this information together for the Irish national quota and establishing how it is distributed is a little more difficult.  We know, for example, that 87% of the mackerel or pelagic fish quota goes to 23 boats, but cobbling together information on the ownership of vessels along with the tax that is distributed is quite a tricky exercise, which we are in the process of doing.  Making sure that the information is available and demonstrating where the quota is going nationally should be a really important part of the sustainability impact assessment.  That is within the Minister's gift. <br\/><br\/>The Common Fisheries Policy refers to fair access to fishing resources.  I do not want the committee to read all the text here, but I will point out that it is made very clear in the new Common Fisheries Policy that preferential access should be given to small-scale coastal fishermen.  There is an ambition to promote responsible fishing and to incentivise those who fish using the least environmentally damaging methods and those who provide most benefit to society.  That is made explicit in Article 17.  Referenced in this area is an ambition to use selective fishing gear with reduced environmental impacts.  It is our view that Ministers are not paying enough attention to this both at EU level, when Ministers discuss things amongst themselves, and at national level.  This part of it should be demonstrated in the Minister's sustainability impact assessment.  <br\/><br\/>The presence of the <i>Margiris<\/i>super-trawler off the coast of Donegal demonstrates quite clearly that Ministers need to justify how they allocate resources.  In this case, the trawler may be fishing legally but it is important to consider whether its Government has allocated a portion of its quota to a vessel or sector that is fishing in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.  That is the type of question our Minister should be asking of other Ministers around the table.  Equally, our Minister should justify how the resource is being allocated nationally.  It is also important that the criteria used to allocate the resource are made clear and transparent and are available so everyone can see how a decision is made. <br\/><br\/>I will address the question of how to bring about change.  The Common Fisheries Policy is now in place.  It is a new, reformed policy which provides the framework to bring about change and it exists now.  The ambition of the Common Fisheries Policy is to restore or maintain populations of fish stocks above a biomass capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield.  We want the maximum yield from our fish stocks.  This should have been done by 2015 where it was possible to do so.  There should not be a delay if it is possible to do it sooner.  This is a basic need that was agreed between the European Parliament, European Ministers and the Commission.  It is not an overreach by any means; it is an agreed, basic requirement.  <br\/><br\/>We see this committee playing a significant role in this process.  The Minister's presentation to EU Ministers later in the month is an opportunity for him to shape the Irish position.  It is important to identify if Ireland's position is one of over-fishing.  What is the justification for that?  If we are delaying the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, what is the justification for the delay?  The Minister should make those justifications clear.<\/p><p>If we are choosing to overfish, how informed is that policy decision?  Have we taken into account that we might lose out in the medium to long term?  What will the cost be of deciding to delay the implementation of the CFP?  We should be realistic about the cost of delaying it because there is a lot of information that says the sector and the natural resource will suffer in that case.<\/p><p> The socioeconomic analysis that the Minister presents needs to show what are the implications for more than just one year.  It is one thing to come along and say that our tax and quota will equate to whatever many millions of euro this year and so are of value but the socioeconomic analysis needs to take into consideration much more than that.  What will the implications of the decisions we are making now be for the next five or ten years?   What are the economic and social implications of choosing to overfish our white fish in the Celtic or Irish Sea?  Have they been taken into account in the socioeconomic analysis?  What will the longer-term losses in revenue be and what is at stake if we delay implementing the change?  Why are we not using management tools that the sector knows works, such as the use of protected areas and more selective fishing methods?  The fishery sector is aware of what works and these tools have traditionally been available to us.  We should use more of them.  Will the Minister make transparent how he makes the decisions on how to allocate the resource nationally?<\/p><p> We have made a submission to the national consultation on the December Fisheries Council and this is the content of that submission.  The tax must follow the scientific advice.  We must listen to the science.  This will allow stocks to recover and more revenue to be gained in the longer term.  If there are delays, there should be evidence to show why.  What is the justification for such delays?  Most importantly, if there is a fear that it will impact on the sector, we should have socioeconomic information showing the losses or gains in the short and medium term in order to make a decision.  So far we have not had that and it is a crucial part of what needs to happen.  This year we are looking at landing obligation and uplifts.  It is all very new and people do not yet know how it will work out.  The bottom line is to make sure that the total outtake does not jeopardise the recovery of stock.  That would defeat the whole purpose and ambition of the new Common Fisheries Policy.  When we do not know something, we should be more careful.  If there are existing tools that work, we should use them more to benefit the resource.<\/p><p> We welcome the opportunity to come in and talk to the committee and we hope that some of the presentation will be useful during the discussion the committee will have with the Minister on 8 December 2015.  We will be watching both that and the process later in December 2015 when he presents Ireland's position and negotiates with the other ministers at the December Fisheries Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Egan for her presentation.  There would be huge potential in the industry if it was properly regulated and if resources were more equitably distributed, not only nationally but within the European Union.  The way that some of the quotas have been allocated nationally has not been equitable.  It is very difficult for people who are on the edge trying to survive, which is probably 80% of our fishing fleets, struggling to make ends meet while trying to comply with restrictions and regulations.<\/p><p>However, when they look a small distance to the west of them, they see large vessels under Lithuanian or Dutch flags and so on that are able to fish without real restrictions on them or without any insight as to what they might have on board.  There are two motions before members this morning regarding the second largest fishing factory ship in the world, the<i>Margiris<\/i>.  I believe she is one of 12 factory ships that are fishing off the coast of County Donegal at present.  It is not a question of what they are taking but of what they are discarding.  The information I have, which I have received from reliable sources and which is supported by a Dutch television station which conducted an interview on board one of these vessels, is that up to 70% of what they are taking is discarded to maximise the potential for the prime fish for the market.  This is taking place in the pelagic sector off the north-west coast.  In the case of someone who is trying to survive and eke out a living with a very limited quota and who is being hounded day and night by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, which is supposed to do its job, it is difficult to have the necessary commitment to bring about the conservation that is necessary in the long term for the future.  In itself, that creates a problem.<br\/><br\/>If one looks at how a national quota is distributed, I note Ms Egan's presentation made reference to one vessel controlling 58.5% of a quota allowance in the Six Counties in the North.  I believe 87% of a quota is in the ownership of 23 vessels down here, which is a national quota practically.  As for the distribution of other quotas, it is quite evident to all of us who have real concerns for the coastal communities and their survival, as well as the survival of what has been a traditional way of life for many people over many decades and centuries, that when one has political interference to distribute or attribute quota to certain areas, it leaves a terrible taste in one's system.<br\/><br\/>Ms Egan mentioned how the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, refers to fair access to fishing resources, that is, &quot;the CFP should contribute to increased productivity, to a fair standard of living for the fisheries sector including small-scale fisheries&quot;.  That is being totally and absolutely disregarded, both internationally and nationally.  It is the powerful who have the political influence and the necessary support to accumulate massive quotas, thereby discriminating against the smaller person who is trying to make a living out of it.  I come from an area, with which I believe Ms Egan is familiar, and was involved with the establishment of the Tralee Bay protection and Conservation Association in the 1980s, which then evolved into the Tralee Bay Oyster Fishery Co-operative Society .  It probably is one of the best managed facilities of which I am aware in Ireland and the reason for this is because the people who manage it also manage its conservation.  It includes fishing representatives, buyer representatives and local government representatives and is an accumulation of representatives.  It is not science; they do their own science.  It is not science but they do it because they are out fishing and are able to determine what can be taken from the bed to maintain a sustainable yield for future years and that is working a treat.  In the case of lobster fishing and crayfish fishing, there are pot men all along the west coast of Ireland and in those areas where one has a well-managed notching mechanism in operation, it again has managed to preserve it.  In other areas, however, this is not in place and one might have rogue fishermen who take what they can out of it and do not give a goddamn about what will happen in the future for the genuine person.  It is a question of how that can be managed and I would argue, Ms Egan, that one of the biggest problems we face in respect of the depletion of stocks is discard, that is, the discarding of juvenile fish and of food to get the prime fish and a prime price.<\/p><p>This is driven by greed and by people who do not give a goddamn about the next generation; it is only about themselves.  Members must try to figure out a way of managing discards.<\/p><p> I take exception to some scientific analysis because it is based precisely or specifically on science but for real analysis, one must have people who are at the coalface of the industry, that is, those who are themselves involved in the fishing sector.   I understand this now is taking place in many areas, where one has a co-ordinated effort by people on the front line, as well as the scientific analysis.  There is an obligation on everyone, as elected representatives, members of society or of fishing communities to ensure the survival of such communities.  However, there is a huge political onus on the Government - as there was on successive Governments in the past - to ensure the inclusion of a living for small-scale fisheries as set out in the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  While this is in the CFP in black and white, it is not being implemented.  Members must find some way to ensure that when the Minister goes to meetings, he does everything in his power to ensure this or that he takes a mandate from members of the committee and from the people of Ireland to prosecute that part of the policy, namely, fair distribution and not 23 boats owning 87% of a quota.  That was wrong on the day it was set up and still is wrong.  Moreover, the position is not getting better but remains the same.  I seek the creation of a level playing pitch and equal opportunity for people who are trying to survive.  My concern is for the 80% of the small boats in the whitefish fishery and inshore fishing.  They must survive because every cent they have goes into their own economy whereas in the case of factory ships, which have taken hundreds of thousands of tonnes out of our waters, not a single cent comes into our economy.  Consequently, a way must be found to achieve this objective and if one is obliged to have fewer catches and better conservation methods to increase yields in the future, I have no problem with that.  However, one must create the will to do this and that cannot exist when one is competing with an unequal distribution of resources, which I perceive to be the main problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#EE00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Egan for her presentation and will refer to a few points from it.  One issue that must be discussed is the activities of the factory ships off the west coast at present.  As for what is happening out there, much of it comes down to the difficulty or lack of will in respect of enforcement on the part of Irish authorities.  In addition, over the past year or so difficulties have arisen in getting other member states to carry out and to recognise such enforcement activity.  An incident occurred last summer in the Irish Sea in which a Danish vessel was boarded by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Naval Service and was judged to be fishing illegally or engaging in illegal activity and was allocated penalty points under the penalty point regime.  However, the Danish Government refused to add those penalty points to the licence of the vessel.  Moreover, it then secured quota for that vessel a number of days after the penalty points had been allocated and stated there was no problem.  I believe the vessel in question now has been re-flagged and is operating under the flag of another state.  There is a problem in respect of how enforcement can be carried out.  Over the years, it always has been the case that 85% of the vessels boarded at sea by the Irish Naval Service and the SFPA are Irish, because the authorities know at what they can catch them whereas they do not bother with the rest of them.  As Ms Egan is aware, the Spanish Government will not tell one what is the quota position in respect of Spanish vessels and the French Government will not divulge such information in respect of French vessels.  Consequently, the authorities here simply do not bother looking at them because they do not have the information to be able to catch them.  This is a real problem for Ireland in terms of how we implement the European Union rules and regulations because most fishermen would agree we always have been the most vigorous and accurate in implementing rules but only against our own vessels, while not getting support from or achieving results against the vessels of other member states.  This issue must be addressed to have effective management of fisheries stocks.  I refer to the fishing in which the <i>Margiris<\/i>is engaged off the west coast.<\/p><p>According to the SFPA, the <i>Margiris<\/i>only had quota for horse mackerel but it is very difficult to catch clean horse mackerel at this time of the year.  They had to catch something else along with the horse mackerel so they discarded it, which is breaking the law, or they processed it on board and froze it, which is also breaking the law.  There is a lack of will when it comes to enforcing the law and investigating these practices.  The SFPA said the weather conditions off the west coast were too dangerous to consider boarding the vessel and inspecting it.  That may be true but we could have a system where those vessels would be instructed to come closer to the shore or to a safe harbour where they could be inspected.  Perhaps BirdWatch Ireland has a view on this.<br\/><br\/>This is a serious problem in the attempts to get fishermen to buy into the conservation of stocks.  I am from Killybegs and our fleet, even the 23 boats which have most of the quota, will be tied up while Dutch factory vessels will be fishing away happily along our west coast.  We have a bigger quota than the Dutch so how do they manage it?  On paper, the <i>Margiris<\/i>is a Lithuanian vessel but it is actually owned by a Dutch company.  The Dutch have bought up German companies and now have the German quota as well as the Lithuanian, English and Dutch quotas.  How can other fleets continue fishing when they have less quota than we have but our fleets are tied up?  It does not make sense.<br\/><br\/>I have a couple of questions on the slideshow presentation.  It showed how achieving MSY would lead to larger landings and more income for fishermen.  I know the calculation cannot be done for all stocks but does the report have any detail of how quickly this could be achieved?  It would have a huge economic impact on the fishing fleet that set out to do it in the first place and the report must have looked at how long it would take.  If we adopted a policy of only achieving MSY, what impact would that have at European level?  Are we just relying on the moral right of Ireland adopting this approach to persuade the Dutch and everybody else it is the way to go?<br\/><br\/>On the upcoming negotiations on stocks and TACs, do the witnesses have any information as to what the likely uplift will be in terms of landing obligation or is this also up for negotiation at the end of December?  It will have a significant bearing on how whitefish fishermen, in particular, will be able to buy into the process of managing stocks sustainably.  There are proposals within the CFP for small-scale fisheries but I understand it is up to member states to implement them rather than it being done at European level.  It will be up to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to look at small-scale fisheries in Ireland and decide whether to give them a quota to allow them to fish.  There is no doubt that smaller-scale fisheries have less impact environmentally and less capacity to catch large amounts of fish.  They also have a large economic impact on the small communities that depend on them.  If it is up to member states to devise policies and put them in place, what are the barriers to it happening here at this level?<br\/><br\/>BirdWatch Ireland is part of a wider European lobbying network.  What responses are its fellow organisations getting in the different member states around Europe?  Is it an uphill battle for everybody?  Will any real change take place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#GG00200","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Ireland is like a tadpole in terms of what it fishes.  Does BirdWatch Ireland have counterparts in the Netherlands or other countries which are trying to explain to the latter the impact of what they are doing?<\/p><p>When the quota was distributed, we got the worst length of the piece of straw.  Four ships in Donegal almost caught more in an hour than we would catch in a year with our gear.  We need to look at curtailing the big guys from coming in and mopping up everything.  There is an opportunity and we should be able to put more Irish trawlers out with Irish people working on them.  This would get rid of the big things while still not catching as much.  <\/p><p> On what are the figures for employment at 4% or 5% based?  Have the figures allowed for trawlers getting bigger and fishing becoming more efficient over the years?  The witnesses will go over and look for a hit in respect of this issue but they are hitting a lot of Irish people who have damn all quota.  Other countries are coming into our waters, swiping our fish and making a living out of it.  I am sure our Minister is well aware of the problem but we need to make Europe aware that we should not be hitting the small dinghy, which the Irish guy has compared to the big trawler someone else has registered in some other country.  When common fisheries are being discussed by the different countries of the EU we need to protect the Irish fishing fleet and we need to make sure the foreign fleets mopping up our fish are curtailed.  We should be able to put this argument in Europe and I think our Minister would back such an approach rather than agreeing to 20% across the board.  It is like the mouse and the elephant.

We try to talk to each other as much as we can and to share information as access to the people who do the number crunching on stocks is very useful for us.  There is a joint effort and people are working in the UK and other countries to influence their Minister with similar messages.  The point of the sections which were written into the CFP, as shown on the slide, was to protect small-scale fisheries and those fisheries which have the least environmental impacts and can benefit society more.  Just because it is written into the legislation, however, does not mean it automatically happens and that is why we are still involved in fisheries policy.  It would be nice to think that once something is written down it happens but implementing the policy is proving to be a battle.  It should not be as big a battle as it is and it needs the concerted effort, not just of NGOs but also of small-scale fisheries and others to be part of the movement to make sure that Ministers do what they ought to do and what they have committed to do.<\/p> <p>  A lot of the implementation is at national level and allocating resources at national level is in the Minister's gift.  There is only so much that can happen at EU level.<\/p><p>However, he can put pressure on other Ministers to show the socioeconomic justification for their positions.  They can do the same for him.  As such, two things need to happen.  At national level, he needs to show how he is allocating the resource and his justification for that.  What is the sustainability impact assessment?  When he comes to present that impact assessment, where is the rest of it?  If I was looking at last year's one, I would be looking for the rest of it.  It cannot just be what this year's or next year's revenue will be for particular stocks.  It should be a question of the consequences for local communities and the rationale for allocating the resource to these smaller communities.  Where is the justification and how has he come to that decision?  I would be looking for that information when he comes to present the sustainability impact to the committee.  That is at national level.  He needs to make the decisions around that available.<\/p><p> At EU level, when the Minister is negotiating in December, he can ask the Dutch and others their sustainability criteria for allowing this vessel to catch its quota in Irish waters or waters that are also of interest to Ireland.  When we have raised this with the European Commission, it has said there is a need for better guidance for member states to make it clear what the Commission might expect when it comes to making socioeconomic arguments.  That is as far as we have managed to get with the Commission.  To me, it is not a very firm commitment about what the Commission is going to look for from member states, but it is clearly acknowledging that there is a weakness there which member states are not addressing adequately.  We will certainly be pushing for clearer guidance as to what might be expected by way of a justification to delay addressing overfishing and also for any allocation of resources.  We can push the Commission to make guidance available and we are looking for that, but it is more important to push the Minister to ask questions of his ministerial colleagues and to ensure he is also providing his justification for national allocations.<\/p><p> The point of that text being written into the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, was to protect the small guy or rather the fisher who fishes in the most sustainable way.  The key is what we make of that and how we capitalise on the text now.  It will take effort.  It was stated that Ireland is just a tadpole.  We are quite an influential tadpole.  I do not know if the Minister is listening today, but he is very well known in fisheries circles and is well respected among fisheries Ministers.  During the Irish Presidency of the EU, he chaired the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  While we may think we are a tadpole, the Minister is an influential person.  We must ensure he has a position for Ireland that makes the most sense.  He is, of course, under pressure.  Our fish stocks are under pressure, the sector is under pressure and the Minister is also under pressure from parts of the sector.  We know that, but he still must represent Irish interests more widely.  It is written into the legislation and we should ask him how he is doing it.<\/p><p> On the specifics of the report where I showed the 4% to 5% loss in employment, it is from the New Economics Foundation.  I will find the information for the committee.  As far as I know, it looked at the number of people directly employed in fisheries.  I cannot say which member states were considered or how good the information was, but I am sure it is available and I will get it for the committee.<\/p><p> I was asked about the uplifts and what they will look like.  I do not know what they will look like.  Some information became available as recently as last week, but it was very little information.  I am not a fisheries expert and it was not clear to me how the numbers were calculated.  It was not a complete table.  As such, I do not know what they will look like.  Having spoken to the Marine Institute and the Minister in the space of the past two weeks, it is not clear how it will operate.  As it is the first year, it could take a while for it to be sorted out.<\/p><p> I was asked about maximum sustainable yield, MSY, getting more income, how quickly and for which stocks, but I am afraid I will have to come back to the committee.  I do not know off-hand.  The exercise has been done for a number of stocks and the reports I referred to were at EU level.  There is more work being done in the Marine Institute to model what stocks would look like, the implications of the landing obligations and what can be extrapolated from that in terms of what the revenue would be.  As such, work is happening closer to home but the reports I quoted are at EU level.<\/p><p> One of the things that came out that would be worth exploring in greater detail is the local knowledge and the expertise that exists within local communities from different types of fishers, the risks of it not being used and the extent to which it is not being used and is being lost.  That is something that has come up with us before.  When we are looking for the Marine Institute to ensure funding is available for what we call \"citizen science\", it is about a way for different sectors or parts of the community to contribute information that can add to decision-making processes.  We hope that there is money available through things like the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, for citizen science initiatives.  That is something it would be worthwhile for the committee to explore in more detail with the Marine Institute.  Certainly, it is an area we are interested in.<\/p><p> If I have missed any specifics, I ask members to flag them with me.  The key thing here and in the space of the next couple of weeks is to change old habits.  We are in a new framework.  Our Ministers across Europe last year were meant to have raised their game to bring an end to overfishing.  There is an opportunity to do it this year through the sustainability impact assessment.  I would be looking for more clarity and information about what our Minister is bringing to the table by way of sustainability in respect of fishing opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Egan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#LL00200","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I ask about enforcement and the difficulties of enforcement at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#LL00300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448978400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Certainly, when we have brought up control and enforcement before, it is clear that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Agency needs more capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#LL00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1448978400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I doubt that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120100002#LL00500","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448978400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I understand that the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be able to provide for more capacity there, but an element of willpower is needed too.

I will just explain the three elements that are before the committee.<\/p> <p>  The first is additional provision of &euro;21 million for IDA Ireland.  The second is a total of &euro;5.5 million for the science and technology programme - &euro;5 million for Science Foundation Ireland and &euro;500,000 for the Tyndall National Institute in Cork.  All of that is to support strategically important research infrastructure in higher education institutions across the country to enable Ireland to maintain and further grow its innovative capacity and its collaborations with industry, and to provide our top class scientists with the required equipment.  The third is the provision of &euro;23.5 million for the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI.  This is effectively paying out on matured liabilities under the PRTLI, which is infrastructural provision for the science and research area.  It is more cost effective if the State pays out now and it creates some new business head-room capacity for capital expenditure in our Votes in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to state that since the previous occasion on which I appeared before the committee, IDA Ireland has had a strong flow of job announcements.  A further 2,500 jobs among IDA Ireland clients have been announced since the beginning of October, with some very significant announcements among them.  SAGE, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Apple were just some examples.  This year has been another very strong year for investment wins by IDA Ireland and the agency is well on track to meet and surpass its jobs targets for the year.  Halfway through the year it was 10% ahead on its jobs performance.  Obviously, we will not have definitive year end figures until after the survey is completed.  That will be available in the new year.  It is a detailed survey of the actual number of people in place, as opposed to projects being announced, and the flow through that IDA Ireland has sight of through its daily work.<\/p> <p>  One element of the Supplementary Estimate relates to an additional &euro;9 million in IDA Ireland grants drawdown, which is required under the Supplementary Estimate.  This means that IDA Ireland clients are hitting their jobs targets earlier than envisaged, so there is an earlier drawdown.<\/p><p>We also have a stronger flow than previously, meaning that the run on IDA Ireland grants is stronger than anticipated.  While it is an extra demand on the Exchequer, it is welcome that more people are in employment.  It needs to be borne in mind for context that the IDA Ireland client cohort typically contributes &euro;22 billion in spending to the economy each year.  The State is growing significant tax revenues from the increased employment and the increased allocation that we are making.<br\/><br\/>The other &euro;12 million is to focus on IDA Ireland's regional property programme, which has been a significant part of our new approach to regional development.  IDA Ireland has set ambitious targets for winning additional projects, including a more ambitious property programme.  Specifically, the &euro;12 million will see the construction of three advance technology buildings in Sligo, Castlebar and Tralee.  There will also be large site infrastructure upgrades in Dundalk and Sligo and some strategic site acquisitions in the mid-west and north west.  This work will help to strengthen the magnets within the regions for attracting new investment and assist IDA Ireland in achieving its targets.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, the additional &euro;25 million will help to pay off the State's commitment under the PRTLI's cycle 5.  It will also benefit the Exchequer in various ways, including by assisting quicker European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, claim submissions by Ireland, as the PRTLI is co-funded under the 2007-13 ERDF programme, which is still administratively live.  This will create new business head room capacity for future capital provisions by our Department by effectively paying off the PRTLI mortgage sooner.  It will also help the cashflow capacity of some colleges, enabling them to complete projects and move on to new ones.  This is pertinent for the institutes of technology in Dublin and Cork.<br\/><br\/>Regarding performance indicators, which do not specifically relate to this Supplementary Estimate <i>per se<\/i>, I am aware that the committee is seeking to improve and smarten the quality of indicators.  My Department is working with the committee's officials to try to secure better performance indicators that will provide more meaningful material for members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120100002#B00400","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448976600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.

Essentially, 12 locations in total were selected by IDA Ireland.  There are one or two proposals for each of the regions.  All of the regions outside Dublin have locations, which were selected on the basis of their effectiveness in the context of attracting IDA Ireland investors.  This is the first venture in IDA Ireland's return to providing advance construction.  The infrastructure is being located in areas with sectoral strengths, a labour pool that can be marketed as an effective magnet, access to education network and so on.  IDA Ireland has a matrix against which it sought to select locations.  While it has outlined a certain number of locations, it has not closed off the possibility of additional ones.  As I recall it, approximately 30% of the total amount of money is being assigned to these other locations.  The distinction between upgrading and securing sites is as the Deputy outlined, upgrading is strengthening the existing base of property to make it more accessible to market whereas the other could be looking at new assets for the continuing regional programme.  This programme is part of the regional strategy.  Overall success in this area will depend on a number of elements.  We will be seeking to work with local authorities to create better support.  We will also be seeking to work with the institutes of technology to have a regional skills strategies which will be part of the marketing tool that will be used by IDA Ireland to win investment.  A good deal of the other material in the regional plans is designed to bolster the capacity of the regions to win business.  This is not a stand-alone instrument with regard to pursuing the 30% to 40% increase.  The repayment by clients typically runs to the order of &euro;2 million per year.  I do not think we have a specific figure for the year to date but we will see if such data are available.<\/p> <p>  The issue in regard to Pfizer-Allergan essentially relates to US tax law and instances where companies have decided to make certain decisions about their strategic location.  Both companies have a substantial presence in Ireland.  IDA Ireland does not encourage inversions in any form and it does not expect that this announcement will have an adverse impact on its capacity to win projects for Ireland.  This has been a feature of the landscape for quite some time.  Obviously, attention is heightened in the present electoral phase in the US.  Clearly, there are issues in American tax law, which, as the Deputy knows, have caused concern.  There has not been much change in US tax law in spite of the acknowledgement that there is a problem.<\/p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, has done considerable work in dealing with the letter from the research community of SFI.  To some degree it was based on some misunderstanding of what they were seeking to do.  Today, an additional &euro;5.5 million is being provided in the Supplementary Estimates, specifically to support the research community in building the required infrastructural capacity and to accomplish high quality STEM workers.  The Government is developing an innovation strategy which will be published, which is being steered through by the Minister of State.  The Supplementary Estimate is definitively a help in term of creating the new business friendly capacity into the future for the research funding.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the new science strategy funding capacity out to 2020.  Today's announcement is a significant help in that regard.  <\/p><p> I am very interested in performance indicators.  We publish wider indicators than can fit into the Revised Estimates Volume, REV.  The REV is a fairly constrained document in which we only have little boxes to fill.  We provide much more detailed information in Ireland Stat.  Perhaps when we progress the dialogue we can use the wider indicators.  We have sought to take on board the view of the committee in September in the ones we are submitting to the REV, which is currently under development.  Obviously the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a key role in deciding what goes into the REV.  We work within a framework which they have created more widely, but I am very happy to share with the committee the sort of dashboard of indicators that we publish and track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120100002#D00200","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448976600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>We obviously need to talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120100002#E00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1448976600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I compliment IDA Ireland on its success in 2015 and indeed in the past number of years in job creation and also the plans for the regional facilities which are certainly very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a number of questions on the table in the briefing note on the percentage of investment projects to be outside Dublin and Cork.  There were targets for 50% in 2013 and 2014, which were not quite reached, but there was no target set for 2015.  Will the Minister explain the basis of that?<\/p> <p>  IDA Ireland has received requests for a large number of large grant payments from companies that have completed investment projects.  Does the Minister consider this as evidence of expansion and job creation?  Does he have any concerns in relation to the Estimates for 2016?  Will this be replicated in 2016 as well?<\/p> <p>  I addressed a question to Enterprise Ireland on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta when it came before the committee.  I know that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is not under the Minister's remit, but does IDA Ireland have a supportive relationship with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s?  I know that Enterprise Ireland said it had a relationship in respect of research.  I wonder if IDA Ireland has a role as well?  I am concerned about it.  I fully support the increases in the budget for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, but &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is being left behind to a degree.  I know it is not the Minister's brief, but it needs to be raised at Cabinet.  There needs to be extra capital funding to ensure we secure jobs in the Gaeltacht area which is also important to the Irish language.<\/p><p>Is there any evidence the IDA is being hampered by planning laws compared to other European countries?  Are we more liable to challenges and delays in planning compared to other European countries, and could it have an impact on job creation?  Have the IDA or Enterprise Ireland raised it with the Minister regarding major projects?<\/p><p> On subhead B5, I welcome the projects listed, including two in NUI Galway, namely Advancing Medicine Through Discovery and a new research building for arts, humanities and social sciences, to cost over &euro;2.4 million.  How are the projects evaluated regarding jobs potential and their impact on job creation?  Is there very stringent oversight of the programmes by the Minister&rsquo;s Department?  There are several programmes, totalling some &euro;23.5 million, which I welcome.  What is the Department&rsquo;s role in evaluating them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120100002#E00300","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448976600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>The 50% target applied to the previous five year plan and it was very clear it had not been realised.  To be fair to the IDA, there had been a progressive improvement in the proportion of projects that were won outside Dublin and Cork, as shown in the table.  From 30% in 2013, it increased to 37% in 2014.  I recall that it was lower than 30% in 2012.  In the new approach, the IDA took a different view and said it would strengthen each individual region in terms of the regional management structure and the flow of information between the regions and their IDA offices overseas, which it has strengthened with additional staff and liaison, and that it would set a new target of a 30% to 40% increase in the projects won.  It developed a different strategy with more tools in the locker.  To complement this, we devised the regional enterprise strategy, to try to get more of the local players involved and make a more coherent offer in terms of winning additional FDI.<\/p> <p>  The target going through will be the projects won in the years ahead rather than the 50% target outside Cork.  Each of the regions will be individually examined.  This is a more stretched target in many ways and is also more relevant, in that each region can assess how it is doing.  There is a monitoring committee within each region, with both private and public sector participation, which will seek to review how we are doing.<\/p> <p>  The earlier call-down is an indicator of the health of projects, the quicker ramp-up of project and, perhaps, the sectoral mix whereby we will get a different profile of projects that will have a quicker drawdown on cash.  Overall, there is a higher percentage drawdown than anticipated.  The provision we make in 2015 is a weighted average of approvals over a number of years with a certain assumed drawdown.  The profile has scrunched up, and this is the cause.  To some degree, bringing it forward may ease pressures later.  With the healthy pipeline, we are considering an increase in the provision for 2016 and are continuing to talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about the possibilities of pressure arising there.<\/p> <p>  Regarding &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, we have very good relations among the family of agencies.  One of my goals in the regional enterprise strategy is to break down the silos that exist between Departments and agencies, and get a catalyst going at regional level to see projects that are of value being progressed by joint effort.  While we do not have a capital allocation goal for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, we would support projects it is developing, where possible, and the IDA sometimes assists with specific project grants.<\/p><p>The IDA has not given any particular signal that planning laws, challenges or delays, as the Deputy said, are a problem.  I think he knows there are concerns in his constituency about the provision of a particular road.  IDA and local authority officials are working on that.  Overall, one of the areas where Ireland has been weak in terms of competitiveness evaluations has been the speed of planning permits and construction permissions.  It is an area that deserves attention as we move on.  It is one of the areas that comes up each year when we examine where we stand against our competitors.  It is certainly something I will seek to address through this closer alliance with local authorities to work towards shared objectives.  It is to be hoped that will help to negotiate some of these planning delays more quickly.  That is part of the purpose.<\/p><p> The PRTLI is essentially about capital equipment and beefing up the capital capacity of the institutes of education.  The HEA administers that on our behalf.  In terms of evaluation, it is difficult to turn investment in a particular piece of equipment into a job profile, but we work hard on that.  Within Enterprise Ireland, we have a group called Knowledge Transfer Ireland which is working to establish how our assets, including our intellectual property and licences, can be more quickly transferred into business and on into employment.  They are doing an evaluation of how well we do it.  They will provide a framework within which we can look at the performance of different institutes of education and one hopes that will provide us with policy insight into how we can sweat the assets more effectively.  As the committee knows, Science Foundation Ireland has become more discerning in its allocation of science money where it must not only have excellent science but come through a second gateway which is potential impact on areas where we have a competitive advantage and the ability to win joint funding from the private sector.  We have more intermediate steps as to the effectiveness of these institutions rather than being able to say how much we put in and the job impact at the other end of the funnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120100002#F00200","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448976600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>It is very welcome to see the required increases and where the funding is going.

As I mentioned, &euro;198 million is required for the payment of the Christmas bonus, &euro;127 million is required to advance payments due to pensioners on 1 January 2016 to 2015, with the remaining &euro;190 million due to higher expenditure on a number of schemes, as detailed in the Supplementary Estimate briefing template supplied to the committee secretariat.<\/p> <p>  Income from PRSI receipts during 2015 will result in Social Insurance Fund income in 2015 of an estimated &euro;8,439 million.  This will be over &euro;200 million or 2.5% ahead of profile and will be &euro;548 million or 6.9% ahead of the position in 2014.<\/p> <p>  Before making provision for the Christmas bonus and advance payments to recipients of Social Insurance Fund schemes, the net position of expenditure on the fund is on target when compared to the 2015 Revised Estimate.  Approximately &euro;200 million of the Department&rsquo;s additional spending requirement in 2015 will be required to fund the Christmas bonus and advance pay day to Social Insurance Fund scheme recipients.  This additional expenditure will be funded directly or indirectly from the higher PRSI receipts we are now receiving as a result of more people at work.<\/p> <p>  In this regard, it is worth noting that income from the Social Insurance Fund has increased from &euro;6.7 billion in 2010 to more than &euro;8.4 billion in 2015, an increase of &euro;1.7 billion or 25.8%.<\/p> <p>  The current account deficit of the Social Insurance Fund peaked at &euro;2.75 billion in 2010 and will have fallen to &euro;180 million in 2015.    The 2016 budget Estimate has provided for a surplus of &euro;215 million in 2016, the first such surplus since 2007.<\/p><p>The live register is expected to average around 345,000 in 2015.  This is a reduction of 40,000 on the average for 2014 or 100,000 better than the average for 2011.  An additional &euro;120.1 million is being sought for jobseeker's allowance in the Supplementary Estimate.  However, &euro;15.9 million of this will be offset by an expected underspend on jobseeker's benefit.  Some &euro;32.3 million is needed to pay the Christmas bonus and &euro;11.6 million is required to advance the payments due to jobseeker's on 1 January 2016 to an earlier date in December 2015.  The remaining additional funding is required for higher recipients due to a higher average live register outturn of 345,000 in 2015 than the average of 337,000 in the 2015 Rev financial allocation. <\/p><p> The 2015 Supplementary Estimate referred by the D&aacute;il and the briefing provided to committee members lists the schemes for which additional sums have been sought as well as some underspends.  We can go through the position of the individual schemes as required during this hearing.<\/p><p> To conclude, I hope my opening statement has given members a good overview of the Department's expenditure in 2015 and the reasons underlying the necessity to seek a Supplementary Estimate.  The schemes and services operated by the Department benefit everybody in society, either directly or indirectly.  The Christmas bonus will be a boost for low income welfare recipients, pensioners, retired people and carers in particular as well as people with a disability but it will also provide a boost to the domestic economy.<\/p><p> I look forward to discussing the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;299 million with the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#C00400","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Members have also received briefing material from the secretariat.

I understand the reasons for it and I do not oppose it.  I have a number of general questions.<\/p> <p>  There is a large under-estimate in respect of the jobseeker's figures, nearly 7,500 people.  Was that a surprise?  <\/p> <p>  There is significant under-estimate for the overall figure for the number of people in receipt of lone parent's allowance, almost 3,400 more than anticipated at a cost of &euro;55.32 million.  Does that mean that the movement from welfare to work, which is supposed to occur among lone parents is not actually happening?  <\/p> <p>  The second part of the Estimate deals with the underspend.  There is an underspend of &euro;7.350 million on the family dividend.  If memory serves me correctly, the projected expenditure for the family dividend was of the order of &euro;22 million or thereabouts, that would mean that one in three people who should be entitled to take up the family dividend has not taken it up.  Is there some reason for that?<\/p> <p>  I noted over the weekend a number of statements, one in particular by the Taoiseach, in which he referred to an extra payment, which the Government is planning to make to low income people to encourage them away from welfare and into work.  Members will be aware of the family income supplement.  The family dividend also falls into that category.  Is the Taoiseach referring to the family dividend or is a new third payment envisaged?  Would the Minister know about that?<\/p> <p>  My final question is a general one which might be more relevant for other Departments, which immediately spring to mind.  As the Minister will know the rules have been changed and this is the last year for Supplementary Estimates, so should there be an over-spend next year, over and above what is anticipated what will happen?  Will there be a substitute for this process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#D00300","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I can only assume the absence of the rest of the Opposition is because by and large they are happy enough with the very positive changes in social welfare and they have left it in the good hands of Deputy O'Dea to speak for all of them.  Many of the changes we made are positive for many people.<\/p> <p>  The additional money that is being sought for the jobseeker's allowance is &euro;120.11 million but this is offset by an expected underspend of &euro;15.9 million on jobseeker's benefit.  The net figure is &euro;104.2 million.  Some &euro;32 million of the &euro;104 million is the payment of the Christmas bonus for people on jobseeker's payments.  Some &euro;11.6 million is for advance payments due to some of the recipients of jobseeker's allowance and benefit who would be paid on Friday, 1 January but the payment has been brought forward a day earlier to Thursday, 31 December.  The balance of &euro;60.3 million is due to higher numbers of jobseekers getting a payment and other factors such as higher average payment values.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy probably knows it from his own constituency that people who emigrated have been returning home, for example people who have been in Australia for two or three years.  In many cases they were involved in construction.  I know that in rural areas people might not get work immediately, they may have recourse for some period provided they satisfy the habitual residence condition, HRC, to jobseeker's and they may well qualify on income grounds.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 Revised Estimates Volume, REV, made a financial provision for an average live register of 337,000 but the outturn is expected to be somewhat higher because of returning emigrants.  The figure will be approximately 6,700 higher than the provision in the 2015 REV, but I think there is a positive element because from my experience of going around the country, it encompasses a number of people coming home.  Members may be aware of the Australian system of visas, where people will have exhausted their period at the end of two years.<\/p> <p>  There are 40,000 fewer people than the outturn in 2014 and 100,000 fewer than 2011, when the live register averaged 445,000.  In fact today we have the CSO estimated figures for unemployment at the end of November, which is 191,000.  Given where we started in these discussions some years ago, when everybody was forecasting that the Irish economy could hit an unemployment figure of 500,000, it is really positive news. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure on jobseeker's will have fallen from just over &euro;3.9 billion in 2011 to just over &euro;3.1 billion in 2015.  That is a reduction of &euro;783 million or 20.1%.  On the one-parent family payment, the extra &euro;63.3 million, some &euro;7 million is required to pay the Christmas bonus, &euro;8.3 million is due to the freezing of the earnings disregard for one-family payments at the 2014 level of &euro;90 from January 2015 - members may remember I introduced that in legislation earlier in the year.  Some &euro;14.5 million is due to the extension of the special provision for carers to those caring for another adult.  It was always extended to people caring for children, but in discussion at committee meetings, we extended it to people caring for adults.<\/p><p>Those recipients remain on the one-parent family payment, while continuing to receive the carer's allowance at half rate.  This provision applies until the youngest child is 16 years of age.  Some &euro;29 million is due to approximately 5,000 fewer people than expected having transferred to the jobseeker's transitional payment on 2 July 2015.  In other words, the Estimate provided for 19,000 but only 14,000 people transferred.  The &euro;9.2 million is due to higher average payment values for those remaining on the one-parent family payment after July 2015.  This is because recipients whose youngest children are younger than seven years of age are less likely to be working or they work less than those with older children.  The remaining recipients are, therefore, likely to have less means.  This is offset by &euro;4.7 million arising from various offsetting factors.  <\/p><p> The number of one-parent family recipients that transitioned from the scheme in July, at 25,500, was less than the estimated 29,400.  In addition to the extension of the carer's special provision, this is due to a number of factors, including cases where lone parents had a child under the age threshold but had not made this known to their local offices, customers who are mid-way through a full-time course of education who are eligible to remain on one-parent family payment until such time as they complete their courses and special provision for customers in receipt of a blind pension which allows them to remain on one-parent family payment until their youngest child is 16 years of age.  As noted by the Deputy, there has been a significant increase in family income supplement, FIS, arising from the reforms introduced in July.  This has resulted in additional expenditure on FIS of approximately &euro;630,000 per week to end July and approximately &euro;760,000 per week up to end October.  The impact on FIS could be approximately &euro;40 million in a full year but I always anticipated that many people, once they transitioned through the reforms, would benefit from a significant increase in income.  <\/p><p> The increase in the number of lone parents availing of FIS is a positive outcome of the reforms as this indicates that the people involved have increased their working hours or found employment.  As of end November, approximately 7,200 former lone parent recipients are in receipt of the back-to-work family dividend, out of a total back-to-work family claim load of approximately 10,200.  There were 10,760 qualified child beneficiaries associated with these recipients.  The majority of former lone parent payment recipients are now in receipt of the back-to-work dividend and family income supplement.  Members who are familiar with individual cases in this area will know that these people have received a significant boost to their incomes.  I introduced this reform because I want the emphasis to be on people, once their children reach a certain age, being able to take up education and employment and boost their incomes.  I think this is a view shared across Government, including by the Taoiseach.<\/p><p> On 1 January next the minimum wage will increase.  Changes have also been made to the step-effects of PRSI such that all the benefits will be to the income earner.  We have also increased the FIS allowance by &euro;5 in respect of a first child and &euro;10 in respect of a second and subsequent children.  From January, the earnings of the families about which we are now speaking, many of whom are on low wages, should increase significantly.   I think that is good.  Provision of &euro;30 million is also made for the back-to-work family dividend, which has proven very popular.  There are now over 10,000 in receipt of this payment which we introduced in May.  I am satisfied that people and employers are aware of this scheme and that many people are now taking it up.  It is very beneficial.  This cohort of people will also benefit from the increases in child benefit and, more than likely, from some of the changes to the USC, in particular the raising of the threshold in the case of those who work part-time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#D00400","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":173,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste has made significant progress in the restoration of a whole range of payments in a very short timeframe, which the people on the street welcome.

On carer's benefits and restoration of the respite care grant, which I am pleased to have been able to provide for, expenditure on carers in 2012 was &euro;772 million.  Expenditure in this regard for this year was &euro;866 million.  It is estimated that expenditure in this area will be approximately &euro;911 million, which is close to &euro;1 billion.  This was an issue of much debate during the early lifetime of this Government.  In 2011, there were 50,600 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance.  This year there were 60,000 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance, which is a 20% increase in the number of carers in Ireland during the term of office of this Government.<\/p> <p>  Members will recall that when I took up my position as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, many problems were being experienced in relation to the IT platforms through which applications and payments for people such as carers are processed.  Following a streamlining of these measures the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance has been increasing steadily every year and is now, as I said, 20% higher.  In regard to domiciliary care allowance, while previously there were 23,900 people in receipt of this payment in respect of children this year the number of recipients increased to 27,990, which is an increase of approximately 4,000.  There was much commentary at that time, although not by anybody present here today, to the effect that people were, somehow or other, being prevented from accessing the domiciliary care or carer's allowances.  As I have just indicated, the number of recipients in respect of both payments has increased. <\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that the respite care grant is also being restored, which I welcome, and will now be called the carer support grant, the reason for which is based on the fact that many of the recipients are caring for people with whom they are living and are spending the grant on those people.  In other cases, it is spent, without a doubt, on respite for either the person being cared for or the carer.<\/p><p>We are just going to call it the carer's support grant from now on.  The number of people receiving this payment has increased from 76,700 to 90,550.  There was a very significant increase in the numbers between 2011 and 2015.  I assure those who know of cases involving people who should apply for carer's allowance or domiciliary care allowance that the new systems have worked very well.

Obviously, people associate it most with pensioners and retired people, but it is also paid to carers, lone parents, people on disability and people who are long-term unemployed.  There is no restriction on the age at which people can receive the bonus, but they have to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for more than 15 months.

This will also apply to paternity leave in the future.  They are the principal payments out of the Social Insurance Fund.  It is extremely important for the future stability of the fund, which is going to be there for people, that we bring it back into balance and eliminate the deficit.  I have given some figures in respect of carers.  Every year, we put aside an additional amount of approximately &euro;200 million to cater for the increase in the number of people qualifying for payments like retirement payments, in particular, and the payments made to widows.  This means we can say to such people with assurance that the deficit in the fund, which was just under &euro;2.8 billion, has now been reduced to some &euro;180 million.  I anticipate on the basis of current expectations that when we get the final figure for December, it will be much lower than that.  Obviously, as I said earlier, some of that is being used for the Christmas bonus.  The social insurance forecast for next year is extremely good.  There are challenges ahead as the number of people of pension age increases and those who come into retirement happily live a lot longer.  Obviously, that is something we will need to address over the years ahead.

I would like to be fair to the Department of Social Protection by giving it credit as one of the Departments to have achieved the greatest transformation over the period of this Government.  Unfortunately, the Minister does not need me to tell her that neither her nor her Department gets sufficient credit in the national media.  I think the Department has made incredible steps.  If one looks at the Pathways to Work document, one will see a huge list of significant, tangible and real achievements that have been made and steps that are being taken.  I was talking to a young man of about 21 years of age the other day.  I told him that as he is not on any payment, he would be entitled to jobseeker's allowance.  When I advised him to make such an application, he said \"do not talk to me, it would not be worth my while, I could not be doing with it at all\".  I asked him why not and reminded him that he was entitled to it.  I suggested to him that he might as well get on the allowance so that we could get him on a scheme, but he said \"no, they would wreck your head\".  He said that some of his friends who are on unemployment benefit are having their heads wrecked with schemes and activation measures.  I said that what he saw as a challenge was really an opportunity to get off the live register.  The figures speak for themselves.  The steps introduced by the Government under the Pathways to Work scheme have shifted over 61,000 people from the long-term live register.  I congratulate the Minister on that figure, which speaks for itself.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask the Minister about some of the schemes that have been mentioned, including the community employment scheme, T&uacute;s and Gateway.  The biggest issue regarding these schemes that I have to deal with as a politician on the ground relates to people wanting to extend their stays on these schemes.  There is not a week that goes by without my sending a letter to the Minister or someone else looking for people's schemes to be extended.  Of course it is not possible to extend them and I understand why that is the case.  I think there is an overarching issue here.  The Gateway scheme, which was very much derided when it was introduced by those who suggested it was akin to slave labour, is hugely popular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#F00600","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Yes, absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#F00700","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The point I try to make all the time is that it is identical to the community employment scheme, which is greatly lauded by the same people on the Opposition benches who knock the Gateway scheme.  The only difference is that the Gateway scheme is managed by the councils and the community employment scheme is managed by private companies.  There is a cohort of people who were victims of the downturn in the economy and lost their jobs on building sites, etc., when they were their late 40s or early 50s.  Five, six or seven years on, there is no realistic prospect of them getting back into the workplace.  As they are finding it hard to find work, they really appreciate the existence of these schemes.  They are happy to contribute to and be part of something.  There is a real scarcity of places on these schemes.  Does the Department of Social Protection have any plans to extend the capacity of the existing schemes or develop new schemes to cater for people in their 50s and early 60s?

We will set out our aims and ambitions when we are launching the next Pathways to Work programme within the next week or two.  I appreciate that the composition of the schemes has changed to take account of two groups that need to be focused on - younger people under the age of 25 and older people who lost their jobs at the height of the difficulties, as mentioned by Deputy Daly, and are finding it difficult to get other jobs.  We have some proposals on how to give better opportunities to such people.<\/p> <p>  I wish to stress another aspect of the community employment scheme and the other schemes.  Sometimes economists do not understand that such schemes provide significant levels of service to people in certain rural and urban communities, particularly in areas that might be less economically well off.  I refer, for example, to the impact of various schemes, such as the rural social scheme, on areas like Ballyhoura.  The use of such schemes by strong community management teams has had a positive effect.  I notice that in my own constituency, for example.  I must give credit to Limerick, as I have done previously, because it was really the pioneer of the Gateway schemes in the aftermath of the awful floods a couple of years ago.  I compliment the foresight of the management in Limerick County Council on giving many young men, in particular, including many in the area around King's Island who had not been working, an opportunity to take part in community employment and similar schemes.  That was where Gateway was launched.  It has proven extremely popular ever since.  Now that a number of local authorities are beginning to recruit - I understand this includes the council in Limerick - I am glad to note that some of those who are being taken on as general operatives have worked on the Gateway scheme.<\/p><p>Essentially, they have the 12 or 22 months of experience that they can cite as their best reference working with the council.  I thank also the people at council level throughout the country who have been involved in the scheme.  I was out with my own people in Fingal County Council recently and some of the people working on the Gateway scheme.  Much of the work is on historic parks and gardens.  A huge number of skills are being learned and developed.  The scheme is positively received by the local community and people are happy to be involved in something that is benefitting their local community.  While we are reviewing all the schemes, I am conscious of older people.  We did not have the resources up to now because the focus was to get people who were unemployed some experience that would get them back into work, but we have revamped the whole child care and care element of community employment to include a training module.  I would like to see more of that on more of the schemes.  T&uacute;s has also been very popular.  The transition of people on T&uacute;s, which is a one-year scheme, to work has been surprisingly positive, given that some of the people have been out of work for a while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#F00900","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Funds that are to be reallocated from the subhead arising from the saving or underspend-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#G00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":187,"content":"<p>On what page is that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#G00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I am referring to the tables on page six of the document.

This is because the Department was unable to source staff to fill critical posts that became vacant, primarily due to retirements.  It is anticipated that about 170 staff will have retired by the end of this year and due to the moratorium on recruitment there were no panels from which to source staff.  However, I am happy to say that following a number of Public Appointments Service competitions earlier this year, staff are now becoming available.  We got the go-ahead from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in April.  Filling the posts from the external panels was not easy.  As one will appreciate, even last April a lot of graduates were applying for some of the jobs but by the time the panel came to be appointed many of those people had already found work.  It is an issue in public service recruitment that the panel process, while it is very fair, it can be very lengthy.  Obviously, if people are waiting for a long time and something else comes up, they may well take it.  It is an issue generally across public service recruitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#G00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Are there many competitions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#G00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Yes.

The original Estimate for JobPath for 2015 was &euro;12 million.  At the time it was thought that JobPath would commence earlier in 2015 than turned out to be the case.  There were many complications around contracts, tendering and so on.  Provision was made for a more aggressive roll-out schedule, with multiple locations going live over a shorter period.  The contracts were signed on 5 June and the roll-out of services commenced on a soft launch basis in mid-July because that coincided with the holiday period.  The soft launch approach was agreed in consultation with JobPath companies to allow more time to secure properties, recruit their staff and develop systems and procedures.  The later start date and the soft launch roll-out has resulted in fewer fees falling due for payment in 2015.  Currently, JobPath services are being provided to jobseekers from 32 departmental locations across the country, and some 5,000 jobseekers have been referred to JobPath so far, a significant number given that it meant setting up office points at 32 locations.  We expect that will continue in 2016 and will be completed then.  Obviously, the actual cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of jobseekers who are referred and the number who gain sustained employment.

The review was carried out not long after I came into office, so it was at the height of the employment difficulties.  Much of it was based on the then unemployment figures.  The deficit in the fund had grown alarmingly at the beginning of our term, up to nearly &euro;2.8 billion.  We started the process of getting people back to work.  After a period, if not immediately, anyone who gets back to work begins to pay PRSI, as does his or her employer, and people who go into self-employment pay their self-employment contribution.  Once the balance is changed between people on the live register and people going back to work, which is what we are doing now, it has an enormous tonic effect on the Social Insurance Fund.  Members will recall that when the troika presented its forecast of the position for this year it did not forecast anything as good as the outturn we have had.  It still anticipated cuts, if I remember correctly, of about &euro;1 billion this year.  It anticipated interest costs of &euro;11 billion this year, but we have got that down to less than &euro;7 billion.  Its forecast for unemployment was far worse than what we have actually achieved.  The people doing the actuarial review would have been influenced, obviously, by those forecasts.  The actuarial review will commence next year, as required by legislation.  As we are coming into an improving period, it will show those improvements but it will also reference the fact that we are spending &euro;200 million a year - that is, &euro;1 billion every five years - for the extra retired people who have a retirement pension.<\/p><p>That is &euro;1 billion every five years for the extra retired people who have a retirement pension.  That will not change.  In fact, if anything the cost of that will increase.  We also have to factor in what I hope will be rate increases for pensioners.  We were able to provide a rate increase this year of &euro;3 per week which is the first rate increase since 2009.  We were also able to bring back the Christmas bonus, again the first time since 2009.  Also pensioners of a certain age or of limited income who receive the fuel allowance will also get an additional &euro;2.50 per week from 1 January.  It is quite a significant onward cost.  Obviously, quite a few pensioners are carers.  Carers will also receive the respite care grant which will be reinstated at &euro;1,700.  I anticipate that as economic progress continues we will continue to provide - that is my ambition - for rate increases for pensioners so that will be a charge on the fund.  We must remember that money is spent largely in Ireland in the domestic economy.  This is good in terms of retail businesses and services businesses in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015120100002#G01300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448979300,"counter":199,"content":"<p>In the absence of any further questions, that concludes our consideration of the matter.

I do not know whether I will get through my speech before I have to leave.  I presume there will be a short suspension of this sitting while the joint committee waits for me to return.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for inviting me to speak in advance of the next ECOFIN Council of Ministers meeting, which will take place in Brussels on Tuesday, 8 December.  This is the last ECOFIN Council under the Luxembourg Presidency, with the Netherlands taking over the Presidency from 1 January 2016.  While there are indications that the proposed agenda will change, this is a useful opportunity to discuss the issues that will be considered by the finance Ministers at the ECOFIN Council.  When the committee invited me to make these remarks, it asked me to provide a brief overview of the proceedings of the ECOFIN Council that took place in Brussels on 10 November last.  The November ECOFIN agenda included discussions relating to the Commission action plan on building a capital markets union, the implementation of the banking union, the Single Resolution Mechanism in the context of the rules for bridge financing, economic governance, the follow-up to the five presidents' report, climate finance and the follow-up to the G20 and IMF meetings in Lima in October.<\/p><p> With regard to the Commission action plan on building a capital markets union, CMU, the Council adopted conclusions on the action plan at the meeting.  The action plan aims to establish a fully functioning CMU in the EU by the end of 2019.  The union will include all 28 member states.  One of its main aims is to improve access to finance for European SMEs and start-ups.  Stronger capital markets should make the financial system more resilient to shocks as it would broaden the range of available funding sources.  Ireland is an enthusiastic supporter of the union and we accept that the EU focus must move beyond crisis management and increasingly turn to how financial markets can best serve the broader policy objectives of jobs and growth, like we are doing in our own economy.<\/p><p> On the implementation of banking union, the focus remains on instruments to deal with the recovery and resolution of failing banks.  Participants in the banking union are the 19 countries of the euro area, whilst seven other member states have indicated their intention to join.  The primary elements are the transposition of a directive on bank recovery and resolution, BRRD, ratification of an intergovernmental agreement, IGA, on the Single Resolution Fund, SRF, and transposition of a directive on deposit guarantee schemes.  Ireland transposed the BRRD last July and the directive on the deposit guarantee schemes in November. As you know, we also ratified the intergovernmental agreement last week in advance of the 30 November deadline.<\/p><p> The other item on the agenda related to banking union, was the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM, and rules for bridge financing.  The SRF is part of the SRM aimed at ensuring the orderly resolution of failing banks.  While this will be financed by banks, bridge financing will be needed for the SRF during an initial phase, when the fund's resources have not been fully built up to the estimated &euro;55 billion it will have in eight years.  Ministers agreed on an approach to be followed to finalise the bridge financing arrangements, which will consist of national credit lines from the member states and the details of this will be endorsed at the December ECOFIN.  Any money will be recovered from the banking sector at a later stage by means of ex-post contributions.<\/p><p> Moving on to the topic of economic governance and the follow-up to the five Presidents&rsquo; report, entitled Completing Europe&rsquo;s Economic and Monetary Union.  Ministers participated in a first exchange of views on the Commission&rsquo;s package of measures, which were published on 21 October, to take forward a number of the short-term measures set out in stage 1 of the report.  The package includes proposals for external representation of the euro area at the IMF and the creation of national competitiveness councils.  The Commission also announced as part of its package that it had established the advisory European Fiscal Board by Commission decision.  Other suggestions include a revamp of the European semester economic and fiscal policy monitoring process, better use of the EU's economic imbalances procedure and a renewed convergence process.<\/p><p> On climate finance, the Council adopted conclusions in advance of the international climate conference, the COP 21, which is currently taking place in Paris.  These conclusions focused on the EU&rsquo;s climate finance contributions towards the $100 billion per year pledged by developed countries by 2020.<\/p><p> Finally, the Council was debriefed by the Commission and the Presidency on the G20 and IMF meetings which took place in Lima between  8 October and 11  October.  Ireland is represented at these fora through EU membership and our Canadian constituency at the IMF.  The G20 meeting focused on growth strategies, taxation, financial regulation and priorities for 2016, when China will have the G20 presidency.  At the IMF meetings, the EU Presidency submitted to the international monetary and financial committee an agreed statement on the world economy, outlook and challenges, and IMF policy issues.<\/p><p> I will turn to the draft agenda for next week&rsquo;s ECOFIN and provide an outline of the key issues that are likely to arise.  As this will be the last Council under the Luxembourg Presidency, I would like to acknowledge the success of the Luxembourg Presidency to date and the progress it is making.  The Netherlands will take over the Presidency role on 1 January, and I wish those involved every success in moving the agenda on.  Let me also remind the committee at this stage that this is still a draft agenda - there may well be changes between now and the meeting, in terms of content and the order of the discussion.  Ambassadors are meeting tomorrow to consider the draft agenda.<\/p><p> The agenda is busy in content as it stands, but some items will change and I will draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to these as I work through them.  The Council will begin by considering legislative deliberations, and this takes place in public session.  Based on the draft of the agenda before us, six items are scheduled for discussion: the approval of the list of A items, which are items to be taken without discussion; securitisation; completion of banking union; financial transaction tax, FTT; and the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.<\/p><p> Securitisation is marked as a possible agenda item.  The initiative on harmonising securitisation in the EU is part of the CMU action plan adopted by the CION on 30 September.  The context is that the traditional dominance of EU banks in financing the economy is seen as imbalanced in contrast to the US.  This leads to an EU policy focus on the potential to source additional financing for the economy from capital markets.  The proposal for an EU framework of EU securitisation aims at two main objectives: first, to remove the regulatory disadvantages for simple and transparent securitisation products, and, second, to reduce or eliminate unduly high operational costs for issuers and investors.  This framework should provide confidence to investors and a high standard for the EU, and also help parties evaluate the risks relating to securitisation both within and across products.  On completion of banking union, the discussion is expected to focus on two items: the proposed European deposit insurance scheme, EDIS, and backstop to the SRM.  The EDIS, which was published recently, will seek to allow a gradual move between now and 2024 to a fully mutualised EU deposit guarantee arrangement.  This is the final pillar of banking union and is necessary to ensure savings are equally protected in all member states and to further weaken the link between banks and the sovereign.  The backstop to the SRM is necessary to provide certainty on the issue of where money would come from in the event that the SRF had insufficient resources or that it exhausts its resources.  In those circumstances, it is important that there is an alternative source of financing available to it. Every effort will be made to have this backstop in place well in advance of the completion of the transition period to full mutualisation of the SRM by 2024.<\/p><p> The next item on the agenda involves a state-of-play discussion on the FTT.  Ireland is not be among the participating countries but we will not stand in the way of those who want to introduce such a tax.  We will continue to monitor discussions on the FTT to ensure the compatibility of any proposed measure with the internal market and with existing taxes on financial transactions, including our stamp duty and with a view to protecting our existing financial services business.<\/p><p> On the common consolidated corporate tax base, Ministers will be provided with an update by the Luxembourg Presidency on the current state of play of this dossier.  We have yet to see the exact details of the re-launched CCCTB proposal.  During the Luxembourg Presidency, the EU working party meetings focussed on identifying outcomes of the OECD&rsquo;s work base erosion and profit shifting where there could be overlap with some of the international aspects of the proposed CCCTB.<\/p><p>Ireland is engaging constructively in these matters while holding a firm line that matters of direct taxation remain a member state competence and that unanimity in tax matters is maintained.<\/p><p> The second part of the agenda deals with non-legislative activities.  Based on the draft agenda, there are 12 items scheduled for discussion.  These comprise the approval of the list of A items, items to be taken without discussion; the ECOFIN report to the European Council on tax issues; the report by finance Ministers on tax issues in the framework of the Euro Plus Pact; the code of conduct; the future of the code of conduct; base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS; implementation of the banking union; the European semester; flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact; statistics; annual report of the European Court of Auditors on the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014; and the fight against terrorist financing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120100002#C00300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448990100,"counter":211,"content":"<p>We will have to suspend the meeting to allow the Minister deal with business in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120100002#E00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1448990100,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.05 p.m. and resumed at 6.20 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1448990100,"counter":213,"content":"<p>We are now back in public session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120100002#H00100","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1448990100,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I will continue with my introductory remarks.  The first three items, namely, the ECOFIN report to the European Council on tax issues, the report by Finance Ministers on tax issues in the framework of the Euro Plus Pact and the code of conduct, are expected to be taken as &ldquo;A&rdquo; items, that is, items agreed without debate.  The ECOFIN report to the European Council on tax issues and the Euro Plus Pact provide an update on discussions of legislative proposals on tax issues at Council at the end of every Presidency.  The code of conduct group on business taxation also issued a report outlining its work during the Luxembourg Presidency.<\/p> <p>  Ireland supports the work on the future of the code of conduct, which has been effective in eliminating harmful tax practices in member states since it was established in 1999.  It is an important forum for member states to discuss, review and monitor preferential and harmful tax regimes across the European Union.  It is appropriate to review the role of the code in the light of the changed international landscape on tax and the conclusion of the OECD's work on BEPS.  Some member states want to extend the mandate of the code but Ireland believes that much has been achieved using the existing mandate and that the work of the code should continue to focus on preferential regimes.  There has also been some discussion about introducing minimum effective tax rates as a way of addressing concerns about base erosion and profit shifting.  However, Ireland believes these issues are best addressed through the implementation of the OECD BEPS reports, which contain internationally agreed standards to reform the global taxation environment.  These discussions will continue under the Dutch Presidency of the EU next year.<\/p> <p>  The draft Council conclusions address the international tax environment in which the EU operates in light of the OECD&rsquo;s publication of the BEPS reports.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of BEPS since the action plan was published in July 2013 and we believe it is the best approach for dealing with aggressive tax planning and to better align the right to tax with real economic substance and activity.  The aim of the measures contained in the final reports is to give countries the tools they need to ensure that profits are taxed where economic activities are performed and where value is created, while giving business greater certainty by reducing disputes over the application of international tax rules.  Ireland will play an active part in the work to implement the BEPS recommendations domestically, at EU level and globally.<\/p> <p>  The discussion on the implementation of the banking union will inform Ministers where member states stand in terms of the implementation of the banking union, particularly in the context of the transposition of the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, the deposit guarantee scheme directive and the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement to the Single Resolution Mechanism and I have already updated the committee on these in my remarks about the November ECOFIN.  The European Commission has confirmed that sufficient member states have ratified the intergovernmental agreement to enable the Single Resolution Mechanism commence from 1 January 2016.  It is also likely that a statement on the bridge financing arrangements to the Single Resolution Fund will be adopted at the meeting.  The background to this is the political commitment made by ECOFIN Ministers that participating member states should put in place a system by which bridge financing would be available as a last resort to ensure that the Single Resolution Fund has adequate funding during the transition period to full mutualisation.  It has been agreed that each member state will enter into a loan facility agreement with the Single Resolution Board to provide it with a credit line in circumstances where one of its banks got into financial trouble and there were still losses to be absorbed after the bail-in and resolution fund processes have been exhausted.  Ireland&rsquo;s credit line will be an amount up to &euro;1.815 billion and represents 3.3% of the overall credit lines of participating member states.  Obviously, enabling legislation will have to be brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  The next main item is the European semester discussion which will focus on three different elements, namely, the annual growth survey for 2016, the alert mechanism report for 2016 and the broad economic policy guidelines for member states whose currency is the euro, all of which were published on 26 November.  The three reform pillars identified by the Juncker Commission in the 2015 annual growth survey have been largely restated.  These are relaunching investment, a renewed commitment to structural reforms and pursuing fiscal responsibility.  Given the moderate pace of recovery across the euro area, these remain appropriate.   The alert mechanism report identifies the member states for which further analysis in the form of an in-depth review is necessary in order to decide whether an imbalance in need of policy action exists.  Based on indicator readings in the scoreboard that accompanies the review, the Commission has decided that in-depth reviews are warranted for 18 member states, including Ireland.  In general, the readings for Ireland reflect imbalances accumulated during the boom which are in the process of unwinding.  As a result, the in-depth review to be undertaken in the new year is unlikely to be problematic.<\/p> <p>  The broad economic policy guidelines call on member states to pursue policies which support the recovery and facilitate the correction of macroeconomic imbalances, implement labour reforms where required, maintain the broadly neutral fiscal stance and to facilitate the gradual reduction of non-performing loans.  We welcome the proposals and the opportunity to focus on common challenges.<\/p> <p>  There will be a state-of-play discussion on flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact and it is expected that a commonly agreed position will be endorsed at the ECOFIN meeting, following the agreement reached at technical level.  This will provide guidance on optimising the flexibility already built into the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.  It will not change or replace the existing rules or legislation.  This newly clarified common position is intended to serve as the basis for codification in an updated code of conduct.  The code of conduct is the harmonised framework formalising how the Stability and Growth Pact is applied.  This commonly agreed position will clarify how three specific policy dimensions will be taken into account when applying the rules.<\/p><p>These relate to cyclical economic conditions, structural reforms, and government investments aiming at, ancillary to and economically equivalent to structural reforms. <\/p><p> The ECOFIN conclusions on EU statistics and the annual report of the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board, EGSAB, on the implementation of a code of practice are expected to be taken without discussion.  The Council has reviewed and welcomed the progress made by the European statistical system in the areas of quality assurance of key statistical output, the 2015 Economic and Financial Committee, EFC, Status Report on Information Requirements in EMU, statistics for the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, and the modernisation of the European statistical system.  The Council will also welcome the seventh annual report on the implementation of a code of practice and notes the recommendations as regards the preparedness of the European statistical system to respond to the challenges stemming from data revolution and regionalisation.<\/p><p> The annual report of the European Court of Auditors, ECA, on the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2014 was published on 10 November and will be presented to ECOFIN.  The ECA's opinion is that the 2014 annual accounts present a \"true and fair view\" of the financial position of the European Union.  There are several relatively minor references to Ireland in the report.  We will implement the action plan developed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to rectify weaknesses that exist. <\/p><p> Finally, under any other business, the fight against terrorist financing will be raised.  The recent terrorist attacks in Paris were heinous and deplorable and my sympathies go to the French people.  In the wake of those attacks, the European Commission is due to bring forward a number of proposals at ECOFIN regarding terrorist financing.  This follows an extraordinary Justice and Home Affairs Council which took place on 20 November.  The conclusions of that meeting indicate the Commission may outline initiatives to strengthen the way member states' financial intelligence units, FIUs, work with each other to exchange information on suspected terrorist financing, to strengthen controls over non-banking payment mechanisms which may favour anonymity, and to find ways for the EU to curb illicit trade in cultural goods which could be used by terrorist groupings selling such goods for funding.  I look forward to receiving the details of the proposals from the Commission.  Ireland is ready to play its part in supporting practical measures to further counter the financing of terrorism.<\/p><p> I hope the committee has found my summary of last month's ECOFIN meeting and the outline of this month's agenda informative.

One of the problems identified in the recent past was that contrarian views were not entertained and were sometimes mocked and derided.  I think it is very important that we preserve the independence of the Fiscal Council and we support its right to comment, but that does not mean we have to agree with it all the time.  That is my position.  In terms of the application of the rules, we have to deal with the Commission.

I am not criticising the right of the council to have an independent view and to express it strongly.  All I am saying is that I as Minister for Finance, and Deputy Howlin as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, also have the right to go to the Government and get decisions that do not accord with the council's advice, because we think it is socially and economically necessary to do so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120100002#K01100","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448990100,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Does the Minister still think that?

From the start of 2014 until the end of 2016, the increase in expenditure is forecast to be 4%, the increase in taxation receipts to be 15% and the increase in GDP to be 18%.  Therefore, when we run the comparative figures, the Government is extraordinarily prudent in how it manages the finances of the State.  In its recent report, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said budget 2016 was prudent.  Also, earlier in the year it endorsed the forecasts we have made for 2016.<\/p> <p>  There was a problem in the past and as the Deputy said, the Fianna F&aacute;il led Government was criticised for it.  It was criticised for relying on just one sector of the economy, building and development, and for driving that through tax breaks.  That became the engine of growth and also the engine of funding the Exchequer, because the argument was that it was building and development that generated the transactional taxes, whether stamp duty, income tax from workers or whatever.  However, on this occasion we are growing the economy across all the sectors and job creation figures will show that over the past two years, all sectors have added quite a number of jobs.  Therefore, the growth is broadly based.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also echoed something that has been repeated elsewhere, that the very strong inflows of corporation tax in 2015 are windfall taxes and that they will not be repeated in future years.  I received a letter from the Chairman of the Revenue Commission, which I published, and the letter states that the flow of corporation tax is not cyclical and that it will continue.  He said there was a question in regard to approximately &euro;300 million of it, but said that the vast bulk of it would be repeated next year because it comes from increased business activity across the sectors.

The focus is on that imbalance when we look at some of the figures coming through.  I believe the Exchequer figures to be published tomorrow will be very much ahead of expectations, yet employment figures for this year and last month are flat.  While unemployment has reduced, it has reduced quite slowly in comparison to the level of Exchequer increases.  This leads one to believe that most of the Exchequer increases are coming from the FDI sector, which has a huge capacity to increase exports without bringing on much extra employment.

This report asks the European Commission to table measures to improve corporate tax transparency, co-ordination and EU-wide policy convergence.  The recommendations contained in the report build on the work of the Parliament's special committee on tax rulings, set up in the wake of the LuxLeaks revelations, whose recommendations were approved at the 26 November plenary session.  The report covers recommendations on a wide range of measures, including country by country reporting, CCCTB, improving cross-border taxation dispute resolution mechanisms and reform of the code of conduct group.<\/p> <p>  In the area of taxation, the European Parliament is not a co-legislator.  As such, there will be no immediate legislative impact from the report.  However, the Commission may take the report into account in preparing the January corporate tax package on the implementation of the BEPS measures in the European Union.  The European Parliament does not have a taxation function and while its reports are usually very interesting and thorough, they are advisory in nature.  Therefore, I do not see them as a threat, but as good research work which is always worth reading.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the previous issue raised which I did not answer, the Deputy spoke about the tax trends for November.  We are approximately &euro;470 million ahead of profile for November.  This brings the position, after 11 months of the year, to a shade under &euro;3 billion of taxes above the forecast.  If we go back to the budget, it mentioned a sum of &euro;2.2 billion, which was to give us the wherewithal to give us the extra expenditure measures to which I referred in the Supplementary Estimates.<\/p><p>It also gave us enough to bring the deficit down from 2.7% to 2.1% of GDP.  With the extra tax coming in and on the assumption that December will be in line with forecasts, it is safe to say the end of year deficit will be below 2% and probably around 1.7% or 1.8% or even down to 1.6%.  That advances the base for the budget for 2016.  We said that for 2016 we were pitching for 1.2% but we will be so close to the end position for 2016 once the year starts that it would be safe to assume we can take 0.4% off that as well.  That would be 0.8% or 0.7%.  As we are getting signals that the rules may change again in Europe and that a balanced budget may be redefined as 0.5% rather than 0%, one can see how close we are.  That is why I referred earlier to the possibility of balancing the budget ahead of our 2018 deadline.  However, that is in nominal terms.

The organisation has been in existence since 1987 and was formerly known as Dublin AIDS Alliance.  I thank the joint committee for giving me this opportunity to discuss with it the topics of HIV in Ireland and HIV related stigma.  Over 7,000 people have been newly diagnosed with HIV in Ireland since the 1990s.  We estimate that approximately 3,500 people are knowingly living with HIV in Ireland today.  While there has been a significant and welcome improvement in treatment for HIV, concern remains about the rising numbers of those newly diagnosed in Ireland.  In 2013 there were 344 people in Ireland newly diagnosed with HIV.  This figure increased to 377 in 2014, an increase of 33 on the figure for 2013.  The 2014 figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre show that HIV continues to disproportionately impact on men who have sex with men.  However, there is also a sizeable number of heterosexuals contracting HIV.  According to official figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, in the first two quarters of 2015 there were 203 new HIV diagnoses in Ireland.  A similar number of diagnoses were made in 2014.  The statistics for routes of transmission were: men who have sex with men, 95; heterosexuals, 38; people who inject drugs, 26; mother to child transmission, one; and unknown, 44.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that the 2015 figure for people who inject drugs for six months is only one behind the figure for the 12 months of 2014.  We need to keep a close eye on why that is the case.  Current thinking attributes it to more frequent use by intravenous drug users of a drug combination called snow blow.  There is close monitoring of this issue across the country by us and the public health authorities.<\/p> <p>  Provisional data for the period January to November 2015 indicate that there have been 427 new HIV diagnoses to date, a worrying increase of 85 of the figure this time last year.  While some of the new diagnoses can be put down to increased testing, it is likely that we are only now beginning to see the true picture of HIV levels in Ireland.  We must continually remind ourselves that as HIV diagnoses continue to increase, the World Health Organization estimates that 30% of people who are living with HIV are not aware that they have it, such that the true HIV figures are likely to be higher.  There can be many reasons for this, including lack of access to testing, lack of awareness of HIV and the ongoing stigma attached to living with HIV.  <\/p> <p>  As I said, HIV Ireland has been in operation since the 1980s.  With the onset of improved treatment in the late 1990s, there was much hope the stigma attached to HIV would begin to dissipate.  People using our services and others across the country began negotiating on the possibility of new relationships and careers and further education and travel, while some began thinking of buying apartments and houses.  Members will be aware that for a person diagnosed with HIV in the late 1980s and early 1990s, that was not on the cards because they would have been given only one or two years to live.  On the surface, these are incredibly reasonable objectives for any person.  Unfortunately, the change presented far more complex issues for them and us as an organisation.  People began to experience the negative consequences of disclosure of their HIV status in these new situations and witnessed the chaos that disclosure could cause in their workplaces, colleges, community employment courses and, more worryingly, many health care settings.  They were now fit enough to travel but were barred from entering many countries to see their families and friends.  That remains the case today.  There are now more than 50 countries to which people living with HIV cannot travel.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, the support and advocacy work we do today is not that different from what it was all those years ago.  We still work to navigate people through their diagnoses, disclosure and its repercussions.  Unlike in the early days, we now have the arm of the Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office and the Garda ombudsman&rsquo;s office to investigate situations where someone living with HIV is treated differently from someone whose HIV status is negative or unknown. <\/p> <p>  The stigma attached to HIV is as insidious as the virus.  Like many other stigmas, it is complex.  Who stigmatises, how they stigmatise and why are research questions often asked of people living with HIV.  They are seldom, if ever, asked of the classmates, employers, health professionals, police, media and faith communities our service users cite as having stigmatised or treated them differently because of their HIV positive status.  The word \"stigma\" is thrown around a lot, but I will try to give it some practical context.  <\/p> <p>  As part of our work last year, we provided support for a man who had found a job as a fitness instructor on a cruise ship but was fired two days later when he disclosed his positive status and for a woman who had been told by a leading national disability agency that she could not avail of its services.  We spent some time trying to convince a cr&egrave;che manager that she did not have to inform all parents of a child&rsquo;s HIV status.  There was no requirement for her to do this, but she thought she should do it.  We also provided support for a woman who had been informed by an holistic therapy college that she could not practise reflexology and dealt with several dentists who had refused to treat our service users, referring them instead to the Dublin Dental Hospital, even for minor procedures, for which they were given the last appointments each day because of concerns about cross-infection, which concerns are not sustainable.  The list goes on. Self-stigma also impacts, at times profoundly, on people&rsquo;s lives.  Feelings of self-shame and worthlessness require a level of personal support that is increasingly being left behind by our quantitative based, outcomes oriented, value for money approach to health. <\/p> <p>  Worryingly, HIV stigma is institutionalised in Ireland.<\/p><p>When a judge orders compensation of &euro;100,000 to a garda who was spat on by a man whose HIV status was not even known or when a social protection worker has to take six months leave because she too was spat on, they held, to cite Ms Justice Mary Irvine, a significantly inflated view of potential risk.  There was indeed no risk, even if the individuals were HIV positive.<\/p><p> Despite the advances in medication, our work is far from over as these examples testify.  All of us working within the area of HIV and AIDS seek to challenge HIV-related stigma.  We aim to make HIV a health issue rather than a question of morality, culture or lifestyle.  There are many practical responses to challenging stigma and these are encapsulated within the current national World AIDS Day campaign of providing solidarity and support for people living with HIV, increasing our knowledge of HIV and the visibility of HIV within society and challenging HIV stigma and discrimination as and when we encounter it.  Fundamental to this is accepting people living with HIV as equal human beings who are not simply defined by their illness.  Like everyone else, the people with whom we work have a right to education, to make informed decisions about their own lives and to be respected.  Stigma takes these rights away and can result in dehumanising people living with HIV.  The responsibility lies with all of us to break it down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448985600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulligan.

I am the CEO of the Sexual Health Centre in Cork and have been there for 25 years, which some might say is a long time.  I will discuss the changes that have taken place in terms of HIV in that time.  It is nice to see some Deputies and Senators from Cork.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Mulligan stated, there were 203 new cases of HIV diagnosed in the first half of 2015, which is more than one person per day.  So far this year, there have been 427 new infections, an increase of 85 on 2014.  HIV is preventable.  We need to reflect on how we can improve our HIV prevention.  Why is the incidence of HIV increasing and what can we do about it?  We do not have concrete data on why it is increasing.  It lacks visibility and we know about the context of stigma.<\/p> <p>  Regarding visibility, before the current treatments were available and when HIV led to AIDS and, ultimately, death, there was no escaping its reality.  People were \"outed\" when they developed AIDS.  They had no choice in the matter - the virus did it.  Families and friends had to embrace the news of the diagnosis, often within a short timeframe between knowing the status of the person with HIV and his or her death.  Frequently, this was accompanied by the realisation that people not only had a terminal illness, but they were gay and-or men having sex with men.  Or maybe they were injecting drugs or it was down to heterosexual transmission.  There was a lot with which to cope.  People with HIV feared rejection and isolation at their time of greatest need.  Families kept things secret, locking themselves away from their own support systems and often blaming themselves, for example, parents wondering whether it was their fault that a son was gay or whether they were good role models.<\/p> <p>  Today, there are effective treatments for HIV and those on treatment are unlikely to develop AIDS.  People living with HIV are no longer \"outed\" by their condition.  They have choices about who and when they tell and even whether they tell.  This is a cause of celebration and a basic human right of anyone living with any illness.  However, has the lack of visibility made us complacent?  Is it a case of someone not knowing anyone with HIV and, therefore, it does not exist?  I hear this all of the time.  HIV is no longer a death sentence, no longer visible, so can we take risks?<\/p> <p>  Undeniably, an increase in risky sexual behaviours is increasing the risk of HIV and STIs.  To combat complacency, we need to raise the visibility of HIV continually.  This year, there is a national campaign around World AIDS Day.  We need integrated, joined-up thinking and actions.  Awareness raising needs to be sustained and of sufficient scale so that HIV remains visible.<\/p> <p>  Community-based Rapid HIV testing is also a welcome response.  Gender, Orientation, Sexual Health, HIV, or GOSHH, in Limerick and the Sexual Health Centre in Cork undertook one-minute HIV testing at gay venues last week during European HIV testing week.  The willingness of people to test shows that we can develop this approach further.  Mr. Brady will discuss our joint new initiative further.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mulligan has mentioned stigma, so I would like to discuss self-stigma.  There is social stigma and self-stigma.  With social stigma, people may be judged negatively by the people around them.  Mr. Mulligan has given concrete examples of social stigma that our agencies around the country have experienced in our advocacy work.  However, there is also self-stigma, where people fear the judgment of others and consequently close themselves off from the possibility of negative judgments.  Self-stigma stops people from accessing services and supports.  They may even be afraid to enter our buildings in case they are seen, discovered, exposed.  This is the reality with which we are dealing.<\/p> <p>  People may internalise how they believe others perceive them.  For one person who spoke about this, it felt like being a human time bomb waiting to go off.  It made another feel worthless.  Some newly diagnosed people can feel suicidal at first.  We have seen people change completely when they receive counselling and support.  Their lives can turn around and they can live healthy and fulfilling lives, where HIV is a diagnosis, not their total identities.<\/p> <p>  We can show solidarity to people living with HIV by challenging stigma and discrimination.  This is within our control.  We can provide support to individuals so that stigma is not just something that society does to people with HIV.  Stigma loses its power over people who have self-confidence and positive self-esteem, people who know that a HIV diagnosis is just that.  It is not their whole person.  They can lead satisfying lives, including sex lives.  Counselling and support helps this process.  We provide these.  Not only do we need to provide good support services, but we also have to reflect continually upon how to make these services safer and more accessible to people when they feel at their most vulnerable.  That requires joined-up thinking and multisectoral partnership between policy makers, implementers and HIV services.<\/p> <p>  In addition to counselling support, there are effective treatments.  These treatments have revolutionised the response to HIV.  They not only protect the health of people with HIV, but they decrease the possibility of passing HIV to others because they reduce the amount of the virus - the viral load - in people's systems.  Treatment is expensive to the State but, thankfully, extensive and free to individuals.<\/p> <p>  Before someone can access treatment, though, he or she needs to know his or her HIV status.  The greatest challenge now is to increase the level of testing.  We are promoting testing with such vigour because it is important that people know their HIV status.  Testing has also been revolutionised.  Some HIV tests require a wait of one or two weeks for results.  However, outreach testing can offer a HIV test that gives the result in one minute.  This is indeed Rapid.  When the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, launched the national sexual health strategy recently, he announced that funding was being made available for free testing in community settings using targeted outreach.  Prior to this, GOSHH and we had to charge for that service.  The UK is making free home tests available so that people can send their home tests to a lab and get their results in three days.  Scaling up HIV testing is an important step in improving HIV prevention.  As they say, we have the technology.<\/p> <p>  The trials for pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, where drugs are provided that help prevent HIV transmission, were shown to be so successful that they were stopped early.  We need to know more about how PrEP can be best applied in the Irish situation to maximum effect.  We have a clinical lead for the national sexual health strategy in place to steer this process.  We are getting there.<\/p> <p>  Condoms are old-fashioned, but they are still the most effective way of preventing STIs.  They are cost effective.  If condom use declines, STIs may increase.  As such, we still need to promote condom use.  However, we also need to make regular STI screening accessible in community outlets.  Hospitals cannot cope with broadening out STI screening to a large extent, but there are increasingly new testing kits being produced that make testing in non-medical settings possible and cost effective.  They just need to be more affordable.  I have one such kit with me.  It is small, easy to use and tests for 12 STIs.<\/p><p>At the moment it is expensive.  We hope to be able to use these kits in our agencies to detect sexually transmitted infections, STIs, and therefore reduce onward transmission.<\/p><p> With regard to targeted HIV prevention, surely after the success of the Yes Equality campaign it is okay to be gay.  For the majority of Irish people it is okay, especially for younger gay people.  There are still many men who have sex with men who do not identify as gay, who may be married, living secret double lives.  They are difficult to access.  In our community outreach testing, we particularly target men who have sex with men and those hidden populations.  I have not yet mentioned talking about sex.  How can we negotiate safer sex without being able to talk about sex?  Good quality sex education has been shown to be effective and it is imperative to our future HIV and STI prevention programmes.  I mean sex education and not just information on reproduction.  We are competing with pornography, which is the biggest educator of young people today.  It has a major impact on misinformation to people and what is regarded as normal sexual behaviour.  We need excellent and proactive sex education.<\/p><p> New and younger generations of people are becoming HIV positive who would not have been exposed to the old safer sex and safer drug use campaigns, so we need to keep those up.  What can we do?  We are increasing testing that is rapid, community-based and free.  We need to continue to promote condom use and safer sex and we need to assess the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, for those most at risk.  We have free counselling, support and advocacy, and we must continually challenge stigma in order that people can feel safe in accessing these services.  We need targeted outreach to those most at risk of HIV.  As service providers, we must continually reflect and improve.  We need to work in partnership with all the key actors.  We provide great services but it is not enough, however, to do the right things.  We need to do the right things right.  We have not won the HIV prevention battle yet and we need the committee's continued support to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Seery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448985600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Seery and her staff for the work they do in Cork.

Before we say anything, it is always worth saying that one of the great things about the committee simply having these meetings is that it raises an issue that finds it very difficult to get airtime.  The figures demonstrate that diagnosis rates are getting higher in younger people, especially with gay and bisexual men.  These generations have grown up in the absence of the type of national awareness campaigns in the 1980s and 1990s that we would have seen right across the world.  Having committee meetings like this, which are broadcast and get coverage, is incredibly important and beneficial.  I thank the members and the Chair in particular for doing this.<\/p> <p>  There are two issues I wish to discuss.  I want to try not to say anything that everybody else has already said.  The two key areas are the trends emerging and continuing among gay and bisexual men for HIV in Ireland, which are worrying, and one of the key responses we hope to put together, starting in 2016, as part of tackling that.  There are a couple of key recommendations about how we might move forward.  Mr. Mulligan has highlighted the overall figures, but within those figures, unfortunately, the picture for gay and bisexual men is not good.  If we take a ten-year view on this from 2005 to 2014, there has been a more than 200% increase in the gay and bisexual diagnosis rates.  There were 60 cases in 2005 and 183 in 2014.  That will increase this year as we are already well past last year's figures and, unfortunately, we still have another month to go this year.  These are the highest diagnosis rates on record for gay and bisexual men and the highest percentage of the total diagnosis that gay and bisexual men have represented.  Of the total diagnoses, 48.5% are gay and bisexual men this year, which is a record high.<\/p> <p>  Within this figure there is another incredibly worrying trend that is exacerbated especially among the gay and bisexual population.  The median age of a diagnosed person in 2005, to take a ten-year span, was 37 but the median age last year was 31.  Younger people are contracting HIV and this new generation of people are being exposed to risk.  Cases of people under 35 now represent six from ten of the new cases.  Between 2005 and 2014 - the ten-year span - there has been a 500% increase in new diagnoses in those aged between 25 and 34.  There is a large key target group emerging from these figures.  This is not just gay and bisexual men but within that are, very clearly, young gay and bisexual men.<\/p> <p>  One of the key parts of our response to this, as highlighted by both Mr. Mulligan and Ms Seery, is the importance of people knowing their status.  There are two clear reasons for this.  From the person's perspective, the sooner somebody knows his or her status, the better.  If it is negative, it provides great peace of mind, and if it is positive, the earlier one is diagnosed, the better the long-term health outcomes.  The second element flowing from this is that most HIV is passed on by people who do not know they have HIV.  Getting people to know their status radically reduces onward transmission rates of HIV.  The challenge around this is how to provide services and get people to engage with such services when we know it is a difficult area for engagement with people.  Simply providing the service, opening the door and saying, \"Here we are, this is HIV testing,\" is not an answer by itself because nobody looks forward to getting a HIV test.  Nobody wakes up in the morning and asks, \"Guess what I am doing today,\" before heading to the STI clinic or the general practitioner to talk about sexual history and get tested with a smile.  We must accept and recognise that this a service that has significant barriers to people accessing it.  Many of those barriers are socially constructed so how do we identify and dismantle them?<\/p> <p>  One of the pilots we are introducing in 2016 will address many of these barriers.  We hear from those engaged in prevention research that many people do not like clinical settings or having to wait a long time to get a test result.  Many people find cost a barrier.  If one goes to the private sector, one can get a rapid test result but it will cost &euro;150 or &euro;200.  We put together a proposal that I am thankful the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has agreed to fund for 2016 to provide community-based, free and rapid HIV testing.  The technology has moved on and our approach to how we get people to test needs to move on with that.  We have technology that now means somebody may walk into a community setting, such as the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network office, a bar when it is not open or a community centre, for example, and get tested, with a result in 60 seconds, before going back out and getting on with life.  It is about trying to make this service as accessible, convenient and non-judgmental as possible, because we understand this is not a service which most people ever look forward to.<\/p> <p>  The rapid pilot will start in 2016 and run for 12 months.  We are making it clear that this is a pilot.  It is a piece of research and we want to shape policy with it.  We want to see how well this works and whether it increases testing rates.  We want to see what places work more effectively in engaging people to test.  Judging from research across Europe, I am pretty convinced it will be successful but we cannot prejudge such issues.  We must be able to take in the data and see, at the end of the 12 months, if it can shape better policy and get more people to engage for the reasons we discussed.  The more people who know their HIV status, the better it is for them and for cutting HIV rates in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, we have a couple of other key recommendations to look at.  This has been a good year, to many degrees, with respect to sexual health.  The first national sexual health strategy has been launched and the pilot programme was initiated for HIV testing as part of that.<\/p><p>That means that for the first time we are, I hope, going to have clear, strategic implementation of a unified approach to sexual health targeted at and tailored to meet the needs of those who need it most.  That is something with which we are incredibly happy, especially from the perspective of gay and bisexual men.  Of course, like all strategies, what matters is what will happen to implement it.  There are plenty of lovely strategies that sit on shelves all over the world, but we must ensure this one becomes a reality in the next three years in order it can have the impact everybody genuinely wants it to have.<\/p><p> Another recommendation is that testing be carried out in conjunction with the GOSHH in Limerick and the sexual health centre in Cork in order to gather data from outside Dublin because there are gay people and others who live outside the capital.  We need to ensure we engage with people nationally, not just in the capital city.<\/p><p> Our final recommendation is that we remind ourselves all the time that the level of knowledge and awareness of HIV is not what it was.  Those of us who are of an age that we have a conscious memory of the 1980s, even if we were only three years old at the time, will have embedded in that memory massive national public advertising campaigns about HIV and AIDS which carried the words, \"Don't die of ignorance\".  They were campaigns based on fear and featured icebergs and tombstones which are etched in our memories.   If we want to be effective about how we create the right level of awareness, we must realise we will not have that kind of national campaign anymore, but we do need to marshal our resources and target campaigns at those groups which are most at risk in order that we raise their level of awareness.  Ultimately, HIV is preventable.  If we can build people's capacity, they will be the instruments of creating their own best sexual health outcomes as they become aware of and confident in the decisions they make, thus reducing their exposure to harm.  As we roll out the national sexual health strategy, that targeted approach will I hope be at its centre.<\/p><p> I thank committee members for their time and look forward to answering questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tiernan Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448985600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tierney.

At the risk of being repetitive in talking about the national sexual health strategy, it is important to promote awareness among the general public, as well as the target groups.  Mr. Brady said people who were born in the 1960s and 1970s would remember the 1980s quite well.  Clearly, it was a difficult time to be gay in this country and many other parts of the world, given the stigma attached to the gay community in the context of HIV and AIDS.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Seery pointed to the diminishing impact of public awareness.  I suppose people lose sight of the risk factors.  In promoting the sexual health strategy it is equally important that we do not reinvigorate attitudes in terms of the stigma that can be attached to people.  The dilemma is that if one actively promotes awareness by advertising and one is not careful, one can also enhance the stigma and make life more difficult for individuals.  I hope, therefore, that the we will be conscious of this in implementing the national sexual health strategy. <\/p> <p>  Our obligation at this committee is to promote a healthy sexual lifestyle and healthy lifestyle in general.  In doing so these figures are disturbing, to say the least, especially when one looks at the age profile published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  There was a time when a lot of people from sub-Saharan Africa would have featured in the increased HIV figures, but those figures have dropped off dramatically.  We now have an issue with people born in this country contracting HIV.  It is evident, therefore, that our message is not getting through as much as we would like it to.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Brady asks what we can do.  I am concerned about this, as I said last night in the context of mental health services.  We all have great confidence in the local family GP.  However, I sometimes think the family doctor may be the last person a young person with a mental health issue or who may feel he or she is at risk of contracting HIV would want to go to.  That is because the GP is also his or her mother's and father's doctor.  In close knit communities this can be a barrier and some people will not cross that threshold.  I have experience of dealing with people who believe they cannot go to their family doctor about such matters.  In that context, clinics and outreach centres are critically important.  Equally, most people are unaware that they can have these tests done quickly.  Most still believe they are costly, that they have to go through a GP and wait an inordinate length of time.  We need to promote the fact that this is not the case.  I would encourage anybody to go to his or her GP, but it is a stumbling block, particularly for younger people who will not go to their family doctor for this purpose.  If we could do anything to promote awareness of the fact that such tests can be done quickly, easily and efficiently, it would be welcome.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Brady has said the national sexual health strategy will be resourced and funded, but who will come up with the campaign?  That is often the critical part.  Will it be undertaken by a professional company that can assess what is the best way to get the message across, or will it be conducted through the Department of Health with its typical campaign which, while getting the message across, can sometimes have other implications, as I alluded to?  Let us be honest and say there are certain barriers to sex education in the education system.  We must, therefore, be conscious of how we try to get the message across to the peer groups most at risk.  There is an obligation on everybody to provide resources for schools and third level colleges for that purpose.  We should not always depend on NGOs and advocacy groups such as the ones represented to do it.  We should be doing it in conjunction with them and supporting them, rather than expecting them to do it alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#E00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1448985600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in welcoming the delegates whom I thank for preparing and making their presentations to us on World Aids Day.  I will have to leave the meeting and may not be able to await their responses.  However, Deputy Sandra McLellan will brief me afterwards.  I have another engagement, but I wanted to be here for the presentations especially.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mulligan talked about the figures for people who injected drugs.  He has said current thinking attributes it to the more frequent use of a drug combination.  Is this evidence-based?  Will he expand a little on what he means by \"current thinking\"?  If that is the case, what efforts are being made to properly inform the potential cohort of users of the serious risks posed by injecting this drug combination?<\/p> <p>  The increase in the first two quarters of the year was mentioned.  It becomes more shocking when we see the figures up to November.  We are already exceeding the figures for 2014 for new diagnoses.  This is a worrying development, yet Mr. Mulligan is absolutely on the button when he says we are perhaps only starting to see the full picture.<\/p><p>Considering the World Health Organization's suggestion that perhaps 30% of people living with HIV do not know they have it, there should be some way of encouraging those who may be HIV-positive to get tested.  It is only through testing that one can definitively establish whether one is HIV-positive.  That has to be matched by a societal effort to ensure the very recognisable consequences of disclosure, as referred to by the delegates, are addressed by each and every one of us.  That the consequences of disclosure are as outlined in the workplace, colleges, CE courses and, as rightly stated by the delegates, \"in a variety of health care settings\" is absolutely unacceptable and most worrying.  I do not believe the problem is confined to dental practices, as referred to.  Quite clearly, it is much more widespread in the health services.  Perhaps the delegates would like to expand on it.<\/p><p> As a shadow health spokesperson on a health committee, I want to make it absolutely clear to the Health Service Executive, if it is taking note of this engagement today, that it has a duty to confront this problem within the health system.  It needs to be confronted.  No amount of trite words will suffice; action needs to be taken.  We need to be quite specific in pointing out exactly where the fault lines are.  They should be addressed properly.  The stigmatisation should be raised in practice and nobody should ever be subjected to it again.<\/p><p> The stigma surrounding HIV is as insidious as the virus itself.  I absolutely agree on this.  I see that same stigma in a number of other areas.  The delegation will excuse me not for making an analogy but for stating that the reaction to the disclosure of a mental health problem almost mirrors the reaction to the disclosure of HIV.  It is imperative that all these issues be addressed.<\/p><p> I give credit to the members of this committee of all political views for being absolutely correct in their strong, assertive position on the unacceptability of stigmatisation in any of these circumstances.  The committee can be justly proud of that.  It is likely that there are other voices who take a different view, but I am happy to say I am a member of a committee that is quite united in expressing its disgust for the stigmatisation of people who have the courage to indicate, rightly and openly, what they are coping with and dealing with.  Irrespective of what challenge a person faces, the best way to deal with it is in the open.<\/p><p> Let me address the view that HIV is no longer visible.  We have said this to Mr. Brady on a previous occasion.  I have not had the opportunity today to peruse the national newspapers.  Yesterday, as shadow spokesperson on health, I issued a statement to the national press saying that we must challenge the stigmatisation of HIV and AIDS.  I warrant that it did not see the light of day in any print organ.  We are looking for answers here.  There is now a degree of invisibility, and people are almost taking the view that this is one of yesterday's challenges that no longer has currency.  Let me outline what I am doing about this today.  We are all representatives of local constituencies.  If the national media no longer feel the challenge has currency, the local print and broadcast media will most certainly pick it up.  As Oireachtas Members, we could reach a much greater audience through the local media collectively than through any of our national broadcasters or outlets.  I encourage colleagues to do what I am doing.  I rewrote my statement of yesterday as I was sitting here earlier and will issue it for publication in my local media this week.  I really feel the only way to address the problem is by continuing to shine a light on it.  It has gone off the boil in terms of attention from the bigger players.<\/p><p> I have a number of other points I would have liked to mention, but the Chairman is very forceful at this committee.  Therefore, I must conclude by saying \"Well done\" to the delegates.  We will continue with our work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#E00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448985600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I welcome our visitors and thank them for their presentations, which were very informative.

A related point, on which I may be previous, concerns the pilot programme Mr. Brady spoke about.  I take it he has not yet considered how and when it might be rolled out nationally.  Is it a possibility, or will the programme operate in but a small number of areas?  I believe it should be rolled out nationally and as soon as possible.

I missed a little bit of the earlier presentation, and I apologise for that.<\/p> <p>  It is very welcome that the delegates have appeared today to present the facts and figures on the increase in the incidence of HIV infection over recent years and the further increase this year, for which we do not have the final figures.  This is mirrored by an increase generally in sexually transmitted diseases throughout the country.  It seems this is as a result of a decrease in awareness of the problems associated with sexually transmitted disease, concomitant with an increase in the effectiveness of medication.  The problem has gone off the radar to a degree.<\/p><p>It is very welcome that there have been improvements in medical expertise and the quality of the drugs available, but if the result is that people are less concerned with protection, that could be a major contributor to the situation.<\/p><p> It is certainly true that there is not the stigma there was in the past, but there is still a stigma.  In the late 1980s HIV and AIDS were associated with homosexuals and prisoners because of intravenous drug use.  In one terrible situation the prison authorities asked the prison population of Mountjoy to volunteer for testing and those who were found to be HIV-positive were very quickly told to pack their bags.  Everything was put into black bin bags, the prison officers donned space suits and they were carted off in trucks to the Curragh prison.  At that stage the stigma was such that being HIV-positive was seen as a death sentence and they had to be immediately separated from everybody else.  That form of panic and stigma is gone but nevertheless there is still a serious community stigma.  Perhaps, as one of the witnesses suggested, community-based testing could take place rapidly, with results given immediately, and it would not be specific to any group in society.  That would lift the stigma, and with proper awareness and highlighting of the issue we could make progress, particularly, as the witnesses have pointed out, when so much sexual transmission is through people who are unaware of being HIV-positive.  They may not belong to any of the categories we have talked about. <\/p><p> The Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has recently raised the question of providing medically supervised injecting centres.  That would stop the covert street injecting in telephone kiosks and dark laneways and sharing of needles, which is very dangerous from every point of view and causes anti-social problems.  There seems to be a lot of intravenous drug activity with amphetamines and snow blow, a party drug, without concern and care.  This is extending to the vulnerable, such as the homeless population, and needs to be considered.  It is a new dimension to the problem.  It is fantastic that the witnesses are highlighting the issues.  They are the people to do it.  They have brought it to our attention and it is very important that we find forums to do that, because unless there are platforms for highlighting the issues too little attention will be paid to them.<\/p><p> I have always thought that we need a special task force to respond to the changing nature of drug abuse.  We still have not come to terms with prescription drugs.  There are constantly changing chemical compounds and we do not have the mechanism, means, supports or resources to deal with them.  We need a special task force of experts in the medical scene and elsewhere that will be able to respond as they come on the scene, before they get a firm foothold, rather than a couple of years later trying to get to grips with a problem that could have been dealt with earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#F00300","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448985600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I welcome the presentations.  One of the biggest challenges has been highlighting the stigma.  That is the most difficult thing to change, as we have seen in the area of mental ill-health.  It can even be subtle: where people know that someone is HIV-positive and say they do not have a problem with that, why would they have to say so if they really did not have a problem?  It is ingrained once it is established because of the history.<\/p> <p>  Has any research been done on the level of stigma in society?  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital did research in the past two years on mental illness, and the results were quite frightening.  Stigma allows the political system to pay less attention to the area.  Society does not demand that something be done about HIV because the people who are HIV-positive do not raise it with politicians because of the stigma.  The whole area is extremely challenging.  The press has an enormous role to play in this respect too.  Does it recognise what the witnesses have presented today in respect of HIV?  Is it informed or does it have any interest in being informed about the situation?  In some sections of the press, sensationalism is more important than information.  Over the decades, around the area of HIV and AIDS there was certainly sensationalism.  There is an element of that present in the debate on HIV.  The challenge is to inform the press.  I am not painting all of the press in that light.  Some have made fantastic positive contributions in this area, especially radio.  The attitude is hopefully moving away from sensationalism, but we have a long way to go in society in terms of the way people discuss it or avoid discussion of the area, which is nearly more important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#G00200","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1448985600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and the work they are doing in this area.

A person who is not out to his or her GP cannot engage with the GP regarding his or her sexual health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tiernan Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1448985600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Is there a particular reason for it, or is it just pure culture?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#H00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448985600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>A couple of reasons feed into it.  Strong Irish research was carried out, the second phase of which is to be published next year, which identified a collection of perceptions.  People perceive that their local doctors will not be familiar with LGBT issues.  People perceive that they have had negative reactions in the past when they have engaged with others regarding their sexual orientation.  People fear a negative reaction and judgement.  One of the great challenges for all health services, and services in general, is that LGBT people have grown up with the expectation that, more often than not, they will encounter a negative reaction.  The way they access services is terribly damaged as a result of it, especially sexual health and other health services.  Unfortunately, people presume that somewhere along the line they will be rejected or judged negatively by people.  Rather than go through this experience, they decline to engage with services.<\/p> <p>  How do we address those barriers within primary care services?  Most of it is by building the capacity and knowledge of health care providers.  To get most people to test, we must provide a full range of services.  No one service is right.  Most people go to primary care services.  There are STI clinics, NGO services and community settings.  Rather than identifying one best model, we must understand that, due to the nature of sexual health and the fact that most people do not look forward to testing, we need to provide a full range of services.  We must ensure there is a service that suits each person, no matter what their previous experiences have been.  It will not always be primary care.  GLEN does much training with primary care nurses and doctors about it.  So much of it is just about awareness building.  There are great courses, and the primary health care providers get a lot from them.  We have created guidelines with the Irish College of General Practitioners about how to engage, but this will always be only one pathway.<\/p> <p>  Given that sexual health is so stigmatised and taboo in general, we must always be thinking about innovative, imaginative, new pathways in order to make it as easy as possible for people to do something they are not looking forward to doing.  This lies at the heart of the challenge.  Next year&rsquo;s project will be an innovative part of it.  We will be happy to keep the committee fully updated as the pilot rolls on.  As Deputy Healy mentioned, I would love it to be a national project.  I am convinced it will work, as evidenced by all the research from Europe, the European Centre for Disease Control guidelines and the number of countries that are already doing it.  We are very late to the table.  This is the first national rapid testing project.  It has been happening in many countries for years.<\/p> <p>  A few years ago, Ms Seery and I visited Denmark, where they do these tests upstairs in a shop on their equivalent of Grafton Street.  It is a lovely little place, where people can pop upstairs, have their test, and off they go.  It is the entire test, and all the medical equipment needed is a chair.  It is a nice comfortable place where people can do it.  The more we keep up with the technology and the more accessible and convenient we can make the test, the more successful it will be.  Nobody wants to wait seven days.  When we design services, we should think about what we would like if we were attending the service rather than providing a service, opening the door and awaiting the customers.  Sexual health services will never work this way.  I hope the pilot will be a success and will shape national policy.  There is no reason this cannot be provided in every corner of the country and every conceivable setting possible.  The more it is, the more we combat the stigma around sexual health and HIV.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Costello was correct to highlight how interwoven sexuality and bisexuality was with AIDS at the beginning.  When it was first noticed and named, it was called gay-related immune deficiency, GRID.  While we have managed to move past the stigma for lesbian and gay people to become one of the best countries in the world, we have not done the same for HIV stigma.  Given the journey of gay and lesbian people in Ireland, we know it is possible.  It is about committing to building awareness and investing in the type of anti-stigma programmes that can deliver the change that has taken place in other areas of Irish society.  It is not impossible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tiernan Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1448985600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I will suspend the meeting until after the D&aacute;il vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#H00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1448985600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.35 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448985600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Senator Colm Burke asked about the reduction in the average age of diagnosis.  Unfortunately, there is no one simple answer, but there are several trends.  There is a lack of knowledge compared to 20 years ago, when there were huge national public awareness campaigns.  The words &ldquo;AIDS&rdquo; and &ldquo;HIV&rdquo; were pretty much unavoidable as they were very much in the public broadcast space or on billboards.  That has gone, however.  Within the challenge, there is the problem of our success with science.  Science has moved HIV from being an incurable condition that will kill somebody acutely to still being an incurable condition but one that is chronic and can be treated.  That makes messaging much more complicated because there is not that fear-based message of the 1980s and 1990s, which was so stark and pierced the consciousness so much.  Coming back to Deputy Neville&rsquo;s point, it is a fine line where the stigma kicks in then.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues which feed into this.  There is the process called othering, which exposes people to great risk.  People get the idea that HIV happens to somebody else; they \"other\" it away.  They think it only happens to people from sub-Saharan Africa, heterosexuals or gay people; it does not happen to one's own group.  As a result, people do not think there is a risk that is close to them and then they increase their exposure to risk.<\/p> <p>  Part of the challenge around HIV is that a person who has HIV but does not know he or she has it looks like everybody else.  Do people understand that?  What is people&rsquo;s knowledge of what HIV is?  People are sometimes exposed to greater risk due to a lack of knowledge and lack of awareness of the proximity to risk.  One of the key areas around that is lack of education.  Sexual health education is critical in changing people's attitudes and actions.  As was said earlier, HIV is such an easily preventable condition.  Building people's awareness and capacity is actually quite straightforward, but it involves education so that people can make decisions that will ensure they have really strong, positive sexual health lives and good health outcomes.  This is phenomenally achievable, but it is about making sure we have an education system that provides sexual health education in a uniform and inclusive way, especially when we are talking about gay and bisexual people.  It must be about involving everybody in the classroom, and they can see it is about everybody.  In doing so, we will build the capacity of people to make the best decisions for themselves.  Ultimately, how we radically change this is through group sexual health promotion - when people are able to take decisions into their own hands that will radically reduce their exposure to risk.  Education lies utterly at the heart of that.<\/p><p>Do the figures presented to us today show that we have all missed that bus on one level?  I applaud everything GLEN is doing.  I have a text from a guy who is getting tested and is critical of the availability of times in Dublin.  How do we get to a point at which Mr. Brady does not have to come in here?  I mean this with the best will in the world, and I know GLEN is doing phenomenal work.  I like Mr. Brady's phrase about positive sexual health lives.  There is a generation of young people who feel they are immune to HIV and that it is not the death sentence it was before.  How do we ingrain a different attitude into people's minds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tiernan Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448985600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Education is always at the heart of it.

One of the great stories of the change in attitudes towards gay and bisexual people in Ireland was about visibility.  People from all over the world are now coming to Ireland to talk to organisations such as GLEN about what happened.  I could have been a criminal in 1993, while I was in college, and now I can be a full and equal citizen under the Constitution.  That changed in 22 years, which, in terms of social progress, is radical.  Lots of people come to ask us why, and I have always been convinced there is one answer, which is tied to HIV stigma.  Visibility of people humanises the story, so that it is no longer about a thing but about people.  It is not about \"gay\", as would have been the case in the 1980s.  It is not about HIV but about a person living with HIV.  The more visibility we can create through people who are brave enough to be out there in the public domain, those in the media who want to write stories about it or those who want to put it into \"Emmerdale\", the better.  I would never underestimate the importance of putting the issue into a soap opera like \"Emmerdale\" to really get into the public consciousness.  People can see the human face.  The Irish story of the gay and lesbian experience can mirror the HIV stigma experience.  As we create visibility, people see the person.

The Cork Sexual Health Centre has been doing sex education in partnership with teachers and schools since we changed from pure HIV education to sex education in 1997.  We did that on foot of research which we carried out in Berlin and the Netherlands to see what they were doing there.  To get evidence from our own schoolchildren in Cork, we also had a questionnaire for 800 young people.  In the Netherlands at that time, they were planning to mainstream it so that teachers would be providing all the sex education.  We thought that was fair enough.  However, according to people in Germany and the Netherlands, they realised that a partnership approach to sex education is where it is at now.  That is largely because young people in school are so influenced by what they see on the internet and in the porn industry via the internet.  Sexual practice norms have been influenced by people accessing misinformation.  I will not talk here about the kind of information that young people are getting from porn sites which they regard as normal, but it is scary.  They need people like us - not me in particular, but those from our organisation - to be able to address these issues and free the teacher up to talk about the other core values around good sexual practices, such as respect, listening, talking - all of those kinds of things - without having to deal with the actual sexual practices that have become norms.

In turn, young people come to us for further information.  The programme is definitely a good partnership.<\/p> <p>  In terms of stigma, one of the things that we have not talked about is disclosure to partners with whom one might be having sex when one is not in a regular relationship.  Such disclosure is one of the really hard things for people to do.  When one starts a new relationship, it is difficult to know at what stage one should tell somebody that one has HIV.  That is one of the issues that comes up for us.  If one does not tell the person straight away then, at some stage, if a relationship develops, one has to say: \"Well, actually, I didn't tell you this all along.  You weren't at risk.\"  The other person will respond by saying: \"You kept a secret from me.\"  Yet if one tells the other person too soon and the relationship does not develop then the information is public knowledge and of course the person is stigmatised.  That is another element.  That is why we have a campaign called Be Sexy Stay Healthy - to try to get to the forefront of everybody's mind that one can be sexy and protect one's self.  It is important that we put pleasure at the forefront of our work.  People have sex because it is pleasurable and we cannot deny that is pleasurable.  Therefore, we must be able to say, \"Yes, have fun, have sex but it is also fun to have healthy sex\".  That is part of our way of dealing with the stigma around disclosure.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of visibility in the national press, I agree with the remarks made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.

No campaign should be developed without them.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about snow blow and what has been the response to drug users.  The figure for drug users has been going down for a number of years, which can be related to a harm reduction response to drug use and the introduction of methadone and needle-exchange programmes.  Hopefully, as Deputy Costello has pointed out, medically supervised injecting centres will be part of the landscape in the not too distant future.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, figures for drug use started to increase and we were not too sure whether it was a spike in numbers or a trend.  Unfortunately, the trend has continued into 2015.  The response was quick from a public health perspective.  Therefore, public health organisations and many NGOs within the sector, particularly within the addiction sector, met earlier this year and developed a quick response.  It was a targeted response to the issue, as there was no point in conducting a general campaign because it was a particular cohort of drug users - injecting drug users.  In response we had the usual posters from community drug teams and community projects.<\/p><p>More specifically, they worked with the outreach workers who already had relationships with those drug users and tried to get two messages across, namely, the message that has always been there from a needle syringe programme about not sharing needles or paraphernalia and the message about safer sex.  What we have been told by the various community drug teams around Dublin is that this is down to a mixture of sharing paraphernalia and more sexual activity rather than heroin use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#M02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448985600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>It is a stimulant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Seery"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448985600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>It has a different impact.

This will bring my overall capital envelope this year to more than &euro;1.07 billion.  This additional funding will further support our public transport system, allow for much needed maintenance of our road network and facilitate the speedier roll-out of a number of key projects.<\/p><p>The &euro;100 million breaks down as follows: &euro;60 million<b><\/b>is being allocated to the public transport investment programme.  Of this &euro;29 million is being allocated for rail fleet maintenance, &euro;9 million for safety works, maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network nationwide, &euro;20 million for the provision of public service obligation, PSO, buses for the Dublin Bus fleet, and close to &euro;2 million for cycle measures in the greater Dublin area.  Some &euro;34 million<b><\/b>is being allocated to the roads programme.  This will target critical remedial works, maintenance and strengthening of the road network at national, regional and local level, where funding has been severely constrained since the crisis began. <\/p><p>This spend has a wide geographic spread and will have positive economic impact.  Of this, &euro;10 million has been allocated to pavement works on our national road network, and &euro;24 million will go towards regional and local roads, which will allow the upgrading of 350 km of sub-standard road pavement to be brought up to a high standard.  Some &euro;3 million<b><\/b>will be allocated to complete the Mullingar&ndash;Athlone greenway, &euro;1 million to tourism related projects, &euro;800,000<b><\/b>will be allocated to the national indoor arena and &euro;260,000<b><\/b>to procure drug testing devices and progress work on the third payment option for fixed charge notices.<\/p><p>As this committee is only too aware, the level of funding for roads and public transport has fallen well below comparable international standards.  From a peak of &euro;3 billion or 1.6% of national income in 2008 to a historic low of &euro;850 million, 0.5% of national income in 2014, it is evident to all who travel across the country that investment in road maintenance and strengthening is an urgent priority.  This additional investment will bring the overall capital investment programme in roads to &euro;610 million this year.  We need this to make the road network safer and to support economic development.  Funds are also being provided for road safety measures.<\/p><p>As we build on the progress we have been making in recent years, more people are returning to work.  This is, indeed, great news.  However, it is also resulting in a rise in congestion levels in certain areas.  This threatens to slow economic activity and has a negative impact on people's living standards.  Today&rsquo;s funding will support the renewal and expansion of our bus fleet, which will improve reliability; enhance rail journey times and expand the bike share scheme, all of which will combat congestion and help facilitate further growth.  It will bring total capital investment in public transport this year to almost &euro;340 million.<\/p><p>From 2016 onwards, we have agreed a capital plan which provides close to &euro;10 billion in funding over seven years for land transport investment, moving us from an annual investment figure of around &euro;1 billion this year to &euro;1.93 billion in 2022.  This is a clear signal that we are addressing the funding needs which I outlined earlier.  We must continue to make choices.  We must have priorities.  These include a return to the necessary levels of investment, a major transport project for north Dublin and a schedule of investment to expand and improve the road network around Ireland.  It is predicated on three priorities of maintaining and upgrading our existing transport network, targeting urban congestion and improving connectivity around the country, particularly to key seaports and airports. <\/p><p>In respect of tourism, I am delighted that the additional &euro;3 million investment in the Mullingar to Athlone greenway will complete this phase of a more ambitious Dublin to Galway greenway to a high standard.  The Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland&rsquo;s ancient east initiatives are key platforms to build and enhance the visitor experience and &euro;1 million of investment will be made in signage to enhance both of these experiences.  Investment will also be made in development of other tourism capital development priorities such as the &quot;Ulysses Centre&quot; - University College Dublin&rsquo;s development of an international literary centre in Newman House on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, Dublin, the Dublin discovery trail in Dublin and the Connemara cultural centre in Rosmuc.  It will also fund feasibility studies on the development of facilities at a number of discovery points on the Wild Atlantic Way. <\/p><p>Some additional funding for the national indoor arena will enable us to accelerate the completion of this project.  Once complete, the arena will comprise a national indoor athletics training centre, a national indoor training centre, and a national gymnastics training centre.  Work on the project commenced in February 2015, with completion scheduled for November 2016. <\/p><p>The Supplementary Estimate also includes a technical amendment which allows the Department to receive approximately &euro;14 million in development levies from the Rail Procurement Agency and channel it back out through the National Transport Authority for Luas network related costs.  The effect of this is to increase the expenditure under the B8 Public Transport subhead without increasing the Exchequer contribution. <\/p><p>I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee for its consideration and approval.  I am happy to answer any queries Members may have on the components of the Supplementary Estimate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015120100002#B00400","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1448993700,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I told it one of the jobs I wanted it to do was to determine how it could increase the awareness and profile of everything that is there because it is a fantastic national facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015120100002#D01900","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1448993700,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Excellent.

We had a recent discussion on this matter in the tourism leadership group which looks at how we support the development of tourism in Ireland.  One of the things we will consider, and the next Government should do, is to re-engage with the communities located alongside the Wild Atlantic Way as we did when the concept was initially launched to see what further ideas and actions can take the concept onto the next stage.  Part of all of that is the development of loops.  These are routes off the Wild Atlantic Way to take tourists to new parts of the relevant counties or regions.  Perhaps that can be used to address the point Deputy Fleming made.  I must note that these things will always be predicated on the availability of funding because all of these developments cost money.  The Wild Atlantic Way is not static or fixed in terms of how we will execute it.  While the region itself will not change, anything we can do with loops, blue ways and green ways is the way to keep the concept growing in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015120100002#E00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1448993700,"counter":443,"content":"<p>We will move to subhead F7, appropriations-in-aid, miscellaneous land transport receipts.
