This placement is short term in nature and is usually organised by colleges as part of the training on childcare courses. The colleges conduct Garda vetting of the persons on the course, and the work experience providers can then rely on the fact that the person has already been vetted by the colllege. <\/p><p>  I understand that in the course of audits of childcare providers, the HSE  has sought a certified copy of the Garda Vetting Disclosure to be provided to the relevant childcare provider. It is the view of the Data Protection Commissioner that this is not necessary. In September 2013 the Data Protection Commissioners wrote to the colleges in question and to the HSE, suggesting that a written confirmation that a college has vetted a person is sufficient confirmation that the Garda Vetting process has been complied with. <\/p><p>  Elements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 relating to the disclosure of convictions are under review at present having regard to a recent judgment of the UK Court of Appeal. I intend bringing proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act. Given the close relationship between this Act and the Spent Convictions Bill, which is before the Oireachtas at the moment, any changes to the Vetting Act will have to be reflected in the Spent Convictions Bill. The amendment of the Vetting Act will also be done via the Spent Convictions Bill.<\/p><p>  I also intend to bring an amendment to the 2012 Act to provide that where two or more organisations are jointly responsible for the employment of a person, whether the person is paid or unpaid, the organisations can agree in writing that one of them will be responsible for conduction of the Garda vetting, and the other organisation may rely on that fact. I believe that this will fully address the issue raised by the Deputy.

Subsidiary protection is protection to be granted to a person in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if returned to his or her country of origin, would face a real risk of suffering serious harm and who is unable or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country, and who is not excluded from being eligible for subsidiary protection.  As the Deputy may be aware I made new Regulations last year governing the investigation and determination of applications for subsidiary protection in the State. The  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which came into effect on 14 November 2013, were made to address certain matters which arose from the judgment of the High Court in January 2013 in the MM case.<\/p><p>  Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals respectively. As I have said previously, by its very nature, the processing of applications for international protection is a solemn and complex task which does not always lend itself to achieving speedy outcomes.  However, now that processing has recommenced and once the new arrangements have bedded down, my aim is for subsidiary protection applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.  In those circumstances I would anticipate very significant inroads to be made on the caseload by the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  I fully concur with the Deputy's view that it is important that early legal advice is made available to subsidiary protection applicants. For that reason, I have ensured that the necessary resources have been made available to the Refugee Legal Service (RLS) to provide legal advice and  support. Applicants have been advised that they can avail of the services of the RLS. The RLS is an independent body under the aegis of the Legal Aid Board which was established to provide a confidential legal service to persons applying for protection in the State.  I would urge subsidiary protection applicants, who do not have access to legal advice to contact the RLS. Alternatively, applicants may seek the services of a private solicitor at their own expense. <\/p><p>  Following the commencement of the Regulations, some 3,300 applicants for subsidiary protection were sent a registered letter by INIS to explain the new arrangements and to request them to indicate, by completing the relevant enclosed form, whether they wished to proceed with their application, withdraw their application or make further submissions. Applicants were also requested to confirm the details of their family members and their legal representatives.  A comprehensive Information Note explaining the new arrangements and the availability of legal assistance was enclosed with the letter setting out all that was required of applicants. An information note has also been placed on the ORAC website in some 16 languages as well as English. In addition non-governmental organisations involved in this area were also notified of the new arrangements. <\/p><p>  The letters issued by INIS informed applicants that, in accordance with the new Regulations, their application could be deemed to be withdrawn if they fail to co-operate with the Commissioner or furnish information relevant to their application.  I would recommend that applicants who require further information on the new process should contact the Refugee Applications Commissioner's Office as soon as possible where further information or clarifications can be provided.  The Refugee Applications Commissioner has advised that some 1400 of the applicants written to have indicated a wish to continue with their applications, with some 300 applicants indicating their wish to withdraw their applications. The remainder of the registered letters issued have either been returned undelivered or have not been replied to.<\/p><p>  I understand that initially, the Refugee Applications Commissioner intends to prioritise applications on the basis of the date of application and, accordingly, applicants have been informed that their personal interview may not be scheduled for a number of months due to the large number of applications to be processed.  A panel of legally qualified persons has been established to assist the ORAC with the processing of these cases. Comprehensive training has been provided to the panel by ORAC training experts in close co-operation with protection experts from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to report that interviewing of subsidiary protection applicants commenced in ORAC on 12 December 2013 and that recommendations have begun to issue to applicants.  Finally, I should emphasise that all subsidiary protection applicants have permission to remain in the State until a final decision has been made in relation to their application and they have been issued with a status letter by INIS to that effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500068#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sexual Offences","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500068#WRA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[5320\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500068#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps he has taken to ensure that solicitors protect the interests of their clients particularly in relation to child victims of sexual abuse.","asker":"1084","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[5352\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500068#WRA02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on whether there are sufficient protections in place for children who are the victims of sexual abuse when a solicitor suppresses information in his or her possession in relation to that abuse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 29 together.<\/p><p>  The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 makes it an offence for any person to deliberately withhold information regarding sexual and other serious offences committed against a child or other vulnerable person.  Under section 2 of the Act, a person who knows or believes that an offence has been committed against a child and has information which he or she believes would be of material assistance in the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of that perpetrator and who fails to disclose that information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is guilty of an offence.  That offence, however, is without prejudice to any right or privilege that may arise in criminal proceedings entitling a person to refuse to disclose information.  The extent to which such right or privilege may arise would be a matter for a court to determine.<\/p><p>  It is my understanding that the Law Society has also taken steps to try to address this question in the updated and third edition of 'A Guide to Good Professional Conduct for Solicitors' which it published in October 2013.  In dealing with issues of privilege and confidentiality, guidance is provided in the new Guide for solicitors in relation to cases involving abuse or neglect of children as follows - <i>&quot;Similarly, there may be situations where an adult discloses abuse or neglect either by himself or by another adult against a child but refuses to allow any disclosure to third parties. If the situation indicates continuing sexual or other physical abuse, or ongoing neglect of a child, and there is a serious threat to the child&rsquo;s life or health, whether mental or physical, but there is a refusal on the part of the client to allow disclosure of such information, if the situation is sufficiently serious, a breach of the overriding duty of confidentiality may be justified and a confidential referral to a medical practitioner can be made. The solicitor should consider whether the situation is sufficiently serious to justify such a breach.&quot; <\/i>  (A Guide to Good Professional Conduct for Solicitors, 3rd Ed., p.33-34).<\/p><p>  In relation to the course of action open to a client of a solicitor who feels aggrieved by the actions of that solicitor in relation to the protection of the client's interests concerned, it should be noted that the Law Society is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of solicitors under the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2011 to which complaints about such a grievance should be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500068#WRA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":32,"content":"<p>Question No. 18 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Magdalen Laundries","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500069#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[5272\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500069#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide an update on the implementation of the Magdalen laundry redress scheme.

The position as to whether or not a credit union is deemed to be a \"secured creditor\" will depend on the nature of the policy in place and ultimately, it will be a matter for the personal insolvency practitioner acting on behalf of the debtor to determine. <\/p><p>  In order for a life insurance policy to comprise security under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 two criteria need to be met, i.e. (i) the security must be &quot;in or over property of the debtor&quot;, meaning that the policy must be in the borrower's name and not part of a block policy of the credit union; and (ii) an assignment of the life insurance policy from the borrower to the credit union has to have taken place.  If a policy is not in the borrower's name, the policy is not property of the debtor, and therefore the debtor is not capable of giving security over it to the credit union.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland has advised that it understands that in the majority of cases, life insurance policies linked to credit union loans are provided through block policies and therefore would not meet the definition of secured debt in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that in any cases where a credit union loan might be deemed to be a &quot;secured&quot; debt, it would be possible for the debtor to pursue a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) which is specifically designed to deal with secured debts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500069#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500069#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[5292\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500069#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his priorities for the disability sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Programme for Government contains a number of commitments in that regard, including the publication of a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy.  That Implementation Plan was published in July 2013 and is the first such implementation plan to be put in place since the National Disability Strategy itself was launched in 2004.<\/p><p>  The Plan was prepared by the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group, which I established in 2011 and continue to chair in undertaking its current role in overseeing the implementation of the Strategy.  The Implementation Group brings together not only representatives of the relevant Government departments and representative organisations but also, recognising the need for the end users of public services to be involved, a number of people with disabilities.  This is in order that their concerns and priorities are heard.<\/p><p>  The Implementation Plan was developed with the identification by Departments of actions, timelines and key performance indicators.  Significant discussion was undertaken between the disability stakeholders and Government departments to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan.  The Plan sets out the practical measures across all Government departments that will be taken to advance the Strategy and ensure that available resources are used to best effect and that the needs of those we consider a priority continue to be addressed.<\/p><p>  Progress on the Plan is kept under review by the Implementation Group and thematic meetings, at which all relevant bodies are present to ensure cross-sectoral input and review, are convened.  Two such thematic meetings were held in 2013 and focused on the themes of Housing and Irish Sign Language.<\/p><p>  In addition to the ongoing implementation of the actions generally, two initiatives are being progressed in particular.  These are the drafting of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities and a review of the Implementation Plan to examine how it could be used to more fully address the needs of people with autism.<\/p><p>  I believe in hearing the voices of those who live with a disability, to understand their concerns and priorities.  In addition to appointing a number of people with disabilities to the Implementation Group, I also established a Disability Forum, under the stewardship of the National Disability Authority, to open up discussion to a wider audience and to get a broader representation from those with experience of living with a disability.  This makes clear that people with disabilities are a priority and do have my full understanding and respect.<\/p><p>  Needless to say, the Government accords no less importance to the needs of people with disabilities as those of children and young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500069#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stardust Fire","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500069#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[5341\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500069#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will now initiate the establishment of a brief commission of investigation to examine outstanding issues that have not been conclusively resolved regarding the Stardust tragedy of 1981 in view of ongoing aspects of new evidence regarding the tragedy coming to public attention in the past number of years.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 seeks to achieve those objectives by specifying the functions of the Garda Commissioner and the Force, on the one hand, and the Minister for Justice, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas on the other.  The Act provides that the Commissioner has the function of directing and controlling the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that he is accountable to the Minister for the performance of that function.  The Commissioner is responsible for recruitment, training, discipline, the distribution of members and for all other aspects of the management and administration of the Force.  The Act also made the Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Force, and liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in that capacity.<\/p><p>  In addition, the 2005 Act established the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which is empowered to carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct, and also the Garda Inspectorate, which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Force.  The accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has, through these measures, been significantly strengthened.  <\/p><p>  There are those who advocate a police authority, but the onus is very much on them to explain how this would improve accountability.  Up until recently, England and Wales would have been one of the main examples of a comparable jurisdiction with police authorities.  But police authorities there were abolished in 2012 and replaced by directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners, precisely on the ground that police authorities were not sufficiently democratically accountable. It is true that Northern Ireland retains a police authority - the Policing Board - and it does a good job, but most people understand that the need for the Policing Board arises from the unique requirements associated with the need for confidence building in a cross-community environment. <\/p><p>  Another important point often overlooked by those who advocate a separate authority is that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not only the police service in this jurisdiction, but is also the security and intelligence service of the State.  This makes it even more appropriate that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be accountable to the Government and ultimately to the Oireachtas. I am willing to listen to all legislative proposals on accountability, but they must deal with the issues involved in a comprehensive and complete way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500070#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[5296\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500070#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his planned reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Garda Ombudsman Commission has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded, and has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the case for additional powers, I have already said that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission  has extensive powers, including full police powers of investigation.  These include powers relating to, for example, entry and search of any place pursuant to a warrant, arrest with or without a warrant, search of a person, detention and questioning, taking fingerprints, issuing a summons and the bringing of a charge against a person. <\/p><p>  I am, however, currently reviewing the relevant provisions of the 2005 Act and examining suggestions by the Ombudsman Commission for changes to it aimed at enhancing the process of investigating complaints.

The new protocols will support the Ombudsman Commission in carrying out investigations in the most effective and timely manner possible, to the benefit of both complainants and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alike.

The objective of the Diversion Programme is to divert any child who accepts responsibility for his or her criminal or anti social behaviour from committing further offences or engaging in further anti social behaviour. This is done by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The Programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and the programme also pays regard to the needs of the victims of youth offending.<\/p><p>  The Programme is supported by 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs).  These projects are nationwide, community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives. The projects are  run in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and funded\/overseen by my Department&lsquo;s unit within the Irish Youth Justice Service. These projects seek to divert young people from involvement in anti-social and\/or criminal behaviour. <b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>Annual Reports of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme under Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, are published each year and are available on the website of the Irish Youth Justice Service (www.iyjs.ie). The reports include detailed statistics in relation to the operation of the Programme including details of the resources deployed by the Commissioner in relation to the Programme.<\/p><p>  The 2012 Report, which was published recently, shows that 12,246 children were referred to the Programme in that year, down from 12,809 in 2011. Fifteen percent of the children (1,822) were deemed unsuitable for the Programme and their files were returned to the local Garda&iacute;  for possible prosecution. The report also shows that there were 123 Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO) posts  comprising of 115 Garda&iacute; and 8 JLO Sergeants.<\/p><p>  The Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer engages with the child offender in a variety of ways. The majority of children who are admitted to the Diversion Programme receive an informal caution. The informal caution generally does not involve a period of supervision by the JLO. Thus the interaction between the JLO and that child and family in this situation may be limited to one or two meetings. Children who receive a formal caution are placed under the supervision of  a JLO. This will involve a series of meetings with the child and his or her family over a period of time up to 12 months.<\/p><p>  With regard to development of the Programme, you may be aware that earlier this week, I along with my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, launched &quot;Tackling Youth Crime - Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018&quot;. This Plan is also available on the Youth Justice website - www.iyjs.ie. The Plan sets out specific objectives addressing the development and use of diversion in the community.

This is also reflected in the budget of the Community Programmes area of my Department which I have protected from cuts over the past few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500070#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[5248\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500071#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide an update on the youth diversion projects and progress made on reducing anti-social behaviour and criminal behaviour in young people, links with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and any new initiatives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"977","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>There are 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) nationwide. These projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives run by community based organisations in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they are funded\/overseen by my Department&lsquo;s unit within the Irish Youth Justice Service.<\/p><p>  The projects receive their participants mainly between the ages of 12 and 17 through a referral system operated by the local Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer. These projects primarily seek to divert young people who have been involved in anti-social and\/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.  The projects undertake a series of programmes and activities which are aimed at changing behaviours, attitudes and lifestyles of project participants to bring about positive change and learning outcomes.  Essentially the projects provide a resource to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to Juvenile Liaison Officers in particular, in the implementation of the Diversion Programme as set out in Part 4 of the Children Act 2001.  Most projects are located within areas of high social disadvantage.<\/p><p>  Over the last number of years the Community Programmes Unit of the Irish Youth Justice Service in cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been working to improve the quality and effectiveness of the services provided by the GYDPs.  As part of this process, joint training sessions for youth justice workers, Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers and Community Garda&iacute; were delivered over the past number of years on a variety of topics, including motivational interviewing, pro-social modelling, dealing with parents who are ambivalent to young person&rsquo;s offending and risk assessment. Significant work has also been undertaken by IYJS in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to improve the governance of the projects.  This includes annual business planning which is informed by local youth crime data. This enables projects to develop a youth crime profile of the catchment area so that services can be deployed effectively. This process is complemented by the use of a risk assessment tool with each participant designed to identify the needs of the individual participant and to enable the project to design interventions that provide the best possible outcome for the participant. The focus is on the continued development of targeted evidence based intervention and planning, leading to improved outcomes for young people coming to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  In recent months a trial site initiative involving 15 projects has commenced  which is designed to test some new measures and enhance skills across these projects. There is also a pilot underway with the projects located in Kerry in cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Kerry Diocesan Youth Service. The pilot seeks to deliver the Garda Youth Diversion Project service across the whole of the county as opposed to the localised catchment areas the projects were located in. This pilot will be evaluated towards the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs fund the  provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country through a number of schemes. These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drug Task Force projects and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector. In addition three specialist staff, who were formerly part of the Irish Youth Justice Service, provide part-time support to the IYJS Community Programmes Unit for the operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects.<\/p><p>  You will no doubt be aware that earlier this week, I along with my colleague The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, published <i>&quot;Tackling Youth Crime -  a Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018&quot;.<\/i> The Action Plan will form part of the <i>National Anti-Crime Strategy<\/i> being developed as part of the White Paper on Crime process, with its focus on crime reduction and safer communities.  It will also form part of the <i>Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework<\/i> being developed in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, with its focus on better outcomes for children and families. This Plan is available on the Youth Justice website - www.iyjs.ie. The Plan sets out specific objectives addressing the development and use of diversion in the community. The range of initiatives being pursued include:<\/p><p>  - improving the analysis of youth crime through the Garda Analysis Service,<\/p><p>  - utilising our resources in areas of greatest need and to establish effective crime prevention supports in cooperation with other youth service providers nationwide.<\/p><p>  - improving the effectiveness of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects by further development of focussed interventions which challenge and divert young people from offending behaviour;<\/p><p>  - the alignment of Garda Youth Diversion Projects with youth offending hot spots and the maximising of links between the Diversion Programme and these projects.<\/p><p>  Tackling youth crime continues to be a key priority for this Government as set out in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500071#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500071#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[5297\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500071#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has reviewed Garda resources in view of the spate of violent crimes committed in January 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the detailed distribution of resources and the allocation of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts, the various Garda national units and of course Garda Headquarters.

The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. <\/p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much welcomed the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.   <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government undertakes to &ldquo;<i>legislate to establish a Judicial Council, with lay representation, to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges&quot; <\/i> and  this commitment is being pursued in the proposed Judicial Council Bill. As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation. An Interim Judicial Council has been established by the judiciary pending enactment of the Bill.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  The NCSE has published details of all of their allocations for resource  teaching and SNA support for the 2013\/2014 school year on their website www.ncse.ie, which detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis. At present, five SNAs have been approved for the school referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  I wish to clarify that the NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.

In cooperation with the owner, protective fencing has been erected and public access to the Fort has been prohibited in view of the current situation, where the structure remains highly unstable and unsafe.   <\/p><p>  Investigations are continuing currently, as weather permits, to assess whether it will be possible to restore limited public access to a portion of the site in the future.

During 2013 MFI attend the Ploughing Championships, the National Franchise expo, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia events, business training, breakfast briefings and one to one client events. <\/p><p>  In addition to this there has been continuous promotional activity undertaken to raise overall general awareness of the scheme including national and local radio advertising, distribution of promotional leaflets at all events and the MFI website has been updated to improve customer service.  MFI also engages closely with the Banks and the Credit Review Office to promote the Loan Fund to bank declined applicants and to cross refer suitable applicants to MFI.<\/p><p>  In 2014, this marketing and communication activity will be built upon and extended out to other agencies and business representative groups who engage with smaller businesses including Local Development Companies, local Chamber groups and Accountancy groups.  Social Media activity will also be built upon and local press will also be used to highlight successful MFI customer stories.  MFI will also look to open up new channels for sector specific audiences that have particular challenges in accessing bank credit facilities and seek to tailor solutions for their particular needs in relation to borrowing funds for new and existing small businesses. Like with any new business with a national reach the communication strategy is a continuous process that is constantly reviewed to ensure best value for money, best fit with the relevant audiences and optimal use of both limited staff resources and promotional budgets and ongoing review of the product, process and customer target audience to ensure appropriate optimal fit for the product and the service. The environment in terms of SME demand for credit facilities continues to be challenging but where businesses have been declined bank credit facilities, MFI is committed to ensuring that all applicants with a viable business are given a full and fair assessment under their risk criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500077#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Companies Law","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500077#WRK01150"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[5857\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500077#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the penalties that apply to a person trading under the name of a company that has been dissolved for over four years, having never filed accounts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>The power of the Registrar of Companies to strike a company off the Register is found in Section 12 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1982, as amended and Section 311 of the Companies Act 1963, as amended.

When a death occurs it is registered on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner.

These are the only circumstances under which a death can be registered. <\/p><p>  Section 28 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 provides for the registration of stillbirths. A still born child is defined under the Act as &ldquo;a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life and &lsquo;&lsquo;stillbirth&rsquo;&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;. Section 28 (7) of the Act provides that, if a coroner ascertains that a body is that of a stillborn child, he or she shall notify a registrar in the functional area of the authority in which the body is located of the stillbirth and shall give to the registrar, in as far as he or she can ascertain them, the required particulars in relation to the stillbirth, and the registrar shall register the stillbirth in such manner as an tArd-Chlaraitheoir may direct. <\/p><p>  While understanding that the loss this family suffered is a tragic one it would not be workable to establish and maintain a separate register of deaths in such cases.

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 14 January 2014 and the case will be referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>  The average time taken to process Jobseeker's Allowance (payments) appeals in 2013 was 26.7 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing and 20.5 weeks for a summary decision.  The average time taken to process Jobseeker's Allowance (means) appeals in 2013 was 29.7 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing and 21.2 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation. They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one. <\/p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office. Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013. In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals. <\/p><p>  In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013. An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012. Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 14,884 at 27 January 2014. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500079#WRM01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500079#WRM01250"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[5839\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500079#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an application for carer's allowance will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.

As I indicated in my previous response, this was one of the many options considered during the deliberation phase which preceded the publication of the Social Welfare and Pension (No. 2) Bill 2013.

The accrued pension of the first member is 30\/60th of &euro;30,000, which is &euro;15,000.  The accrued pension of the second member is half this amount, which is &euro;7,500.  <\/p><p>  Overlaying a service related scale could be regarded as overweighting the priority order in favour of service and in this regard may be considered inequitable.  A further potential drawback identified in relation to a service related scale was it may suffer from practical implementation difficulties due to data issues in respect of former employees, especially those who left many years ago.

BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012. They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m plus &euro;30m contingency and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources. The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives.

This is a policy which is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to take advantage of proven technological developments to tackle crime and to meet the needs of an effective police force.  In particular, the National Digital Radio Service is being operated nationwide by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In that context it has significantly improved the safety of Garda personnel and the coordination of policing operations throughout the country.

The provision of civil legal aid in the State is the responsibility of the Legal Aid Board. Criminal legal aid is provided by the Courts, through the Judiciary. Details in respect of each category are as follows:<\/p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy.  While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.  Demand in 2013 was similar to what it was in 2012.  The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2014 as it was in the previous three years<\/p><p>  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised.  I know that waiting times are a matter of constant concern to the Board and that it keeps them under very active review.  I am also aware that the Board is constantly keeping the delivery of its services under review with a view to getting legal services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery.  The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board last year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.<\/p><p>  In September 2013 I signed into law by way of Regulations, a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid.  The Regulations include a reduction in the capital eligibility threshold for legal services and they also include increases in the contributions payable by most persons seeking legal services.  These provisions should have some impact, albeit relatively marginal, on the resources available to the Board.<\/p><p>  In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services.  Those steps include the following:<blockquote>- The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage.  The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times.  The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes).  If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;.  There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. Where the triage approach is operative there is a waiting time for the triage appointment and a waiting time for the second consultation.  A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative.  This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.<br \/><br \/>- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres.  This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services.  It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise.<br \/><br \/>- In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board.  A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law).  Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common.  Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also.  Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated.  I know that the Board is working particularly hard on promoting mediation as a meaningful option.<br \/><br \/>- While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;.  With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased.<br \/><br \/>- I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court. Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy.<br \/><br \/>- I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice \/ legal area such as the Courts Service and the Health Service Executive (now the Child and Family Agency), with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.<\/blockquote>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to and I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible.<\/p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that I consider that the Criminal Legal Aid system currently operates efficiently within its current legislation.  There is no waiting period associated with the granting of criminal legal aid as under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the Courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid upon the applicant's appearance in Court.  However, a new Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill is currently being drafted which will update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.<\/p><p>  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500084#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Prosecutions Data","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500084#WRR01150"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[5710\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500084#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prisoners remanded on bail on foot of charges relating to serious criminal activity in each of the past 12 months to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Presidents monitor waiting times across all courts lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum. <\/p><p>  I am informed that waiting times in the Circuit and District Courts vary from venue to venue based on the number and complexity of cases.  In the District Court there were in excess of 500 additional sitting days and in excess of 700 out of hours court sittings held in 2013.  Scheduled sittings of the District Court continued during the months of August and September last year and the President continues to target judicial resources at the areas experiencing longest waiting.  In the Circuit Court there were over 80 weeks additional sittings held in 2013. It should be noted that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of sittings in Circuit court venues outside Dublin. This increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and to at least 880 weeks in 2013 &ndash; an increase of over 30%.The additional weeks were provided across crime, family law and civil matters.The additional sittings have ensured that waiting times in the Circuit Court have been reduced. In addition, six specialist judges of the Circuit Court were appointed in July 2013 to deal with the new work arising as a result of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. <\/p><p>  I am informed that High Court waiting times also continue to improve.  The President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous review and has introduced a number of initiatives including the reorganisation of sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses.  The delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has also yielded significant savings in judicial time resulting in increased judicial availability for trial work.  More than 10,000 matters have been dealt with in this way in 2013.   These case management initiatives continue to be reviewed and expanded.  During September 2013, the President of the High Court scheduled additional sittings with a view to maintaining and reducing waiting times or facilitating urgent hearings.  There were 20 additional weeks sittings overall involving a total of 32 Judges and 1,016 orders were made. <\/p><p>  In respect of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Chief Justice, in consultation with the President of the High Court, convened 9 additional sittings during September and the first week of October 2013 to deal with sentence appeals\/undue leniency applications. In the Supreme Court there were 3 weeks additional sittings at the end of the summer recess with judges sitting in two panels and following the appointment of two additional Supreme Court Judges in October 2013 the Supreme Court has continued to sit in two panels. While some immediate improvement is anticipated over the coming year, the backlog that has accumulated in the Supreme Court over the past number of years is such that it will take a longer period to reduce the waiting time for the hearing of appeals to a more appropriate level.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b> While considerable efforts are being made to manage the waiting times, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the introduction of the Court of Appeal, which is due to be established later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500085#WRS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Levels","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500086#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[5719\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500086#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which the statistics show fluctuation in the levels of various crimes reported in County Kildare in each of the past five years to date; if any particular action is planned to address any issues arising; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[5721\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500086#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which he and his Department have monitored the levels of break-ins to private households and\/or commercial premises in County Kildare; the degree to which the number of such crimes has fluctuated in each of the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 139 together.<\/p><p>  I am advised that all crime trends are monitored on an ongoing basis by the Garda authorities and relevant policing strategies are designed and implemented as required.

At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources, an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.<\/p><p>  There has been a very significant increase in demand for civil legal aid in the last number of years and while I have sought to protect the Board's budget, waiting times for the Board's non-prioritised services have increased due to a major increase in demand for services. I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. Moreover, in approving the fee increase I decided to introduce a provision that abolished the contribution where a parent is seeking legal services from the Legal Aid Board to defend proceedings instituted by the Health Service Executive is relation to the welfare of the child.  This reduction would not be possible in the absence of the fee increase.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions, many of which require ongoing payments for certain legal aid matters. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases. I know that the Board has in place a process for considering applications for waivers or reductions in the contribution and that it does so where not to do so would create undue hardship.<\/p><p>  Finally, I also wish to advise the Deputy that I have no plans at present to review my decision to implement Statutory Instrument No. 346 of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500087#WRU00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Reports","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500087#WRU00350"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[5770\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014020500087#WRU00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 92 of 10 December 2013, if the report referred to in the reply is now to hand.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Ombudsman Commission that the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and the generation and collation of that information would place an inordinate burden on the organisation in terms of time and resources.<\/p><p>  The information sought was in respect of complaints received by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission from family members of those killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions.

Stamp 3 is granted to persons who have demonstrated to the immigration officer that they have sufficient funds to support themselves, will not work or operate a business in the State and will not become a burden on the State. The persons referred to applied for a change of immigration permission to a Stamp 4 in September 2012 in order that they could work in the State without a work permit.  The General Immigration Section of INIS wrote to the persons concerned in January 2013 and again in July 2013 seeking information in order to progress the application.  The requested information was received in August 2013 and the application for a change of status was refused on 27 August 2013.  On 18 September 2013, a request for a review was submitted to the General Immigration Section of INIS which also requested that the Stamp 3 permission be reinstated. On review, this was refused on 16 October 2013 as the evidence of finances provided was deemed not sufficient to support a family of two adults and three children without potential recourse to public funds.  They were requested to leave the State as no further permission would be granted.  The persons left the State on 1 November 2013 and their application was deemed concluded.<\/p><p>  The persons referred to by the Deputy subsequently re entered the State as visitors on 6 November 2013 and were given visitor's permission for one month - up to 6 December 2013.  Despite entering the State as visitors, the General Immigration Section of INIS received an application on 5 December 2013 for 'leave to remain' in respect of the persons referred to by the Deputy.  As this application had already been assessed, it was not accepted and was returned to the persons referred to by the Deputy.  On 6 January 2014, a further request for a review of this decision was received in the General Immigration Section of INIS.  The basis of the review request was that the persons referred to by the Deputy were in fact applying for Business Permission to remain in the State. Over the course of the last two months, many representations have been made by many public representatives, including the Deputy, on behalf of the persons referred to by the Deputy.  The persons referred to by the Deputy and the public representatives have been informed of the details and requirements of the Business Permission Scheme; one of which is that the applicants must apply from outside the State. The persons referred to by the Deputy can be in no doubt as to what is required of them in relation to this and indeed in relation to their immigration permission or lack thereof.<\/p><p>  The persons referred to by the Deputy have exhausted the application and review processes and have no permission to be in the State since 6 December 2013.  If the persons referred to by the Deputy do not leave the State, it is the intention of the General Immigration Section of INIS to issue a 'notification of a proposal to deport' letter under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.

In situations where training colleges process Garda vetting for their students and subsequently secure placement of these students in childcare settings, they are not permitted under current Data Protection regulations to release the vetting documents or copies to the childcare service.

","asker":"1012","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>Medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, are in the opinion of the HSE unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and reasonable expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  <\/p><p>  The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons to receive treatment in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland under EU Regulation 1408\/71, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations 574\/72, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines. Within these governing EU Regulations and the Department of Health Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of Form E112 (IE).  A decision is made on each application in accordance with this legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts. The cost of the treatment is not a deciding factor when approving an application. The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.<\/p><p>  The TAS allows for an Irish based medical consultant to refer a patient that is normally resident in Ireland for treatment, in a public hospital, in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets the following criteria: (a) The application to refer a patient abroad has been assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad; (b) Following clinical assessment, the referring Consultant certifies the following: they recommend the patient be treated in another EU\/EEA country or Switzerland; the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs; the treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment; the treatment is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner; the hospital outside the state will accept EU\/EEA form E112 (IE).<\/p><p>  The HSE TAS processes applications based on the treatment that the patient is being referred for, which is not available in Ireland. The presence of a rare illness, such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, is not of itself criteria for availing of treatment abroad: most cases of rare diseases are treated without the need for recourse to services in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  Patients, in conjunction with their Irish based public referring hospital consultant, have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the state through model form E112. Applications to TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment. Approved applicants\/patients' hospital treatment costs are covered through the issue of form E112 (IE) for the specific identified episode of care. Once a patient is discharged from a specific episode of care abroad, their care immediately reverts to their Irish based consultant.<\/p><p>  Each application to the HSE TAS is reviewed individually on its own merits and there are no restrictions, regarding age or otherwise, on a person making an application to the HSE TAS for review and decision. Previous approvals or declines are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications. Each application is for an individual episode of care unless otherwise specified by the consultant on the application form. Each application to TAS is processed and given a formal written decision.

The estimated figure for 2013 is &euro;13,881 million.  <\/p><p>  Estimates of private health expenditure are compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and are principally based on data derived from the Household Budget Survey (HBS).  The HBS is carried out every 5 years with the last survey having taken place in 2010.  Estimated annual expenditure is based on grossing up the survey data for the full year and the total population.  The attached table presents estimated results across a range of categories of out of pocket health expenditure, including medical consultations, for 2010.  Out of pocket expenditure on prescribed medicines is also included in the table.  It should be noted that it is not possible to exclude prescription payments which may subsequently have been refunded under the drug payments scheme (DPS).  Where a person has a DPS card and fills prescriptions in a specified pharmacy, there is no payment once the monthly limit has been exceeded.  However, if the prescription is filled in a different pharmacy then payment must be made prior to a refund being claimed.
