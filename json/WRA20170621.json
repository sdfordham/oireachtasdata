It applies across the public service as a whole.  It contains a specific commitment with regard to recruitment and retention in certain parts of the public sector.  Under this commitment, the Agreement sets out a process for a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in certain sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident.  This would include the health sector.  There will be opportunities for submissions to be made to the Public Service Pay Commission and the exercise is due to be completed by the end of 2018.  Any proposals will be subject to discussion between the parties.  Also, the agreement provides for a series of salary increases over the coming years and a number of health-related allowances will be restored, provided the relevant staff representative bodies accept the Agreement.  These measures should assist in recruitment and retention of staff in the public sector generally. <\/p>  <p>  In the broader context, there has been a significant improvement in the staffing of the public health services in the past three years as the economic position has improved and additional funding has been made available to support service delivery. Total numbers employed have increased from end April 2014 to end April 2017 by over 10,000 whole time equivalents to 111,979.<\/p>  <p>  The number of consultants has increased significantly. At the end of April 2017 there were 2,884 whole time equivalents. This constitutes an increase of 298 whole time equivalents since April 2014. The number of NCHDs has increased very significantly, from 4,982 at the end of April 2014 to 6,092 at the end of April 2017, an increase of 1,109.  These additional posts are supporting increased service delivery and improved compliance with the European Working Time Directive.  <\/p>  <p>  Nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of April 2017 stood at 36,549 whole time equivalents, having increased by 625 whole time equivalents in the 12 months from end April 2016 and by 1,870 in the three years from end April 2014 to end April 2017.  Overall nursing numbers are at the highest level since 2011 with numbers increasing consistently since early in 2014.   It is acknowledged, however, that vacancies remain in the system and there was a significant fall in numbers between 2007 and 2014 due to the economic downturn. <\/p>  <p>  I can also advise that, under proposals formulated at the Workplace Relations Commission between my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the INMO and SIPTU in February and March this year, it was agreed that management would increase the nursing and midwifery workforce in 2017, through a broad range of initiatives that provide for 1,208 additional permanent posts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100073#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100073#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[29070\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100073#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action his Department is taking to counter anti-vaccination campaigns.

It is a recognised simple and safe way of protecting people against harmful diseases such as meningitis, measles, mumps and rubella and influenza.  The importance of vaccination is acknowledged by all the major international health organisations, particularly the World Health Organisation.  While no medicine is entirely without risk, the safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, is carefully monitored.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority assesses the safety of medicines in Ireland and as Minister I can assure you and the public that the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the known side effects. <\/p>  <p>  I am very disappointed that the uptake of certain vaccines, which have been the subject of recent campaigns, has dropped. Most notably HPV vaccine uptake rates have fallen from 87% in 2014\/15 to 72%  in 2015\/16. This is a very serious development as a large number of girls are now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.  My Department and the HSE are working to counter the misinformation concerning vaccines that are undermining our national vaccination programmes.  We must ensure that the public and healthcare providers have full information regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaccination programmes.  The HSE is implementing a strategy aimed at increasing vaccine uptake.  An example of this was seen at the recent National HPV Vaccine Conference where the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and the work to increase uptake by girls as part of the Schools Immunisation programme was outlined.  I attended this Conference to not only demonstrate my support but also to clearly outline the priority my Department is placing on vaccine uptake in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I regularly speak publically and use social media to highlight this issue. You will also be interested to note that the forthcoming National Healthcare Quality Reporting System has a key focus on childhood vaccines.

However, Dr Herity recommended additional investment to increase capacity at the hospital.

This entails an additional eight hours provision per week or a 20% expansion in operating hours.  The cath lab will now be funded to provide 12 sessions i.e. 48 hours activity per week.

The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. <\/p>  <p>  All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups such as the CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) or BIA for a number of reasons:<\/p>  <p>  I.\tThere is not enough scientific evidence that they are suitable tests to diagnose Lyme disease; <\/p>  <p>  II.\tThere is no standard method to perform and interpret these kind of tests; and <\/p>  <p>  III.\tPositive results in these kinds of tests may be due to other illnesses or conditions and not just Borrelia infection.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.

Overall nursing numbers (WTEs) are at the highest level since 2011 with numbers increasing consistently since early in 2014. However, given that numbers fell by 5,000 between 2007 and 2013 and that we face increasing service demands due to a growing and ageing population there is an ongoing need to increase numbers.<\/p>  <p>  Under proposals formulated at the WRC between this Department, DPER, the HSE, the INMO and SIPTU in February and March this year it was agreed that management would increase the nursing and midwifery workforce in 2017, through a broad range of initiatives that provide for 1,208 additional permanent posts. Delivery of these posts is possible through a combination of new development posts, for which additional funding is being provided in the current year, and the local conversion of agency employed staff into direct employees. Key measures include the conversion of agency employed staff into HSE direct employees and offering all graduating nurses and midwives full time contracts. Other important elements include enhanced maternity leave cover; a career break scheme; 130 additional undergraduate places in 2017; and offering nurses and midwives improved educational opportunities and career pathways. Recruitment measures include careers days, HSE attendance at national and international recruitment fairs, and a communication from the National Director for HR to all Nursing and Midwifery Graduates. <\/p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have already been taken in relation to nurses pay. These include additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale. In the last quarter of 2016 the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for 2011 to 2015 graduate nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by 4th year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates. All nurses and midwives are now eligible for incremental credit for the 36 week placement. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the pay restoration that is provided for in the Public Service Agreements, and which commenced on 1st April, the recently concluded Draft Public Service Stability Agreement provides for pay increases from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation. It will see those earning up to &euro;30,000 receiving a 7.25% increase with the remainder receiving 5.75% over the lifetime of the agreement.

During 2016, the Department of Health convened a cross-sectoral Steering Group to begin work on the development of this Framework. <\/p>  <p>  Work on the draft framework is well advanced and a stakeholder consultation process on the draft will commence during June. It is anticipated that the finalised framework, and an associated high-level implementation plan, will be submitted to the Minister for Health in September 2017. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, under proposals formulated at the WRC between this Department, DPER, the HSE, the INMO and SIPTU in February and March this year it was agreed that management would increase the HSE&rsquo;s National Workforce Plan for nurses and midwives in 2017. Management have committed to continuing to increase the nursing and midwifery workforce in 2017, through a broad range of initiatives that will result in the delivery of 1,208 additional permanent posts; including the conversion of agency employed staff into HSE direct employees, and offering all graduating nurses and midwives full time contracts. Other key measures include maternity leave cover; a career break scheme; 130 additional undergraduate places in 2017; and offering nurses and midwives improved educational opportunities and career pathways. Recruitment measures include careers days, HSE attendance at national and international recruitment fairs, and a communication from the National Director for HR to all Nursing and Midwifery Graduates.<\/p>  <p>  Although not limited to the health sector, the recent draft Public Service Stability Agreement also sets out a process for a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in certain sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident.  There will be opportunities for submissions to be made to the Public Service Pay Commission and the exercise is due to be completed by end- 2018.  Any proposals will be subject to discussion between the parties. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100075#WRC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":163,"content":"<p>Question No. 107 answered with Question No. 49.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100075#WRC02250"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[27662\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100075#WRC02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional staff that will be employed to ensure the full functioning of the new primary care centre in Balbriggan.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100075#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[29095\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100075#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which University Hospital Limerick will be supported in reducing the number of outpatients enduring long waiting times in the hospital.

The decision to develop a single hospice rather than two smaller units is based on the most efficient use of public money. The absence of a hospice and associated day services and specialist supports in the Midlands results in higher numbers of palliative care patients dying in the region&rsquo;s three acute hospitals when they could be more appropriately cared for in a hospice setting. <\/p><p>It is usual for local fundraising groups to fund the capital cost of new hospice builds. However, despite ongoing efforts by the HSE and the Irish Hospice Foundation over a protracted period it has not been possible to reach consensus on this matter and only one of the five local hospice groups has given any commitment towards capital funding for the proposed hospice.  The HSE will provide the revenue funding once the hospice is built.<\/p><p>To advance the Midlands hospice project, the HSE is reviewing planning work to date and will develop plans for submission to the HSE National Director for Primary Care and the HSE Capital Estates Steering Group in September. Key deliverables include a revised schedule of accommodation, a revised brief, indicative capital costings, the precise location of the hospice on the Tullamore Hospital campus, staffing requirements and indicative costings, and a communication and engagement plan. The HSE will continue to engage with local hospice groups as this preparatory work progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100076#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100076#WRD02750"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[27853\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100076#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which deficiencies in services have been identified as a contributory factor at various levels throughout the public general hospital system in the context of hospital waiting lists, overcrowding at accident and emergency and bed shortages; the degree to which the adequacy of numbers in respect of beds, consultants, hospital doctors, general practitioners and nurses has been identified as the primary or secondary cause of backlogs and waiting lists; the extent to which provision can be made to address these issues in line with best practice throughout the European Union and globally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>I am very aware of the interrelated nature of the challenges our health service faces.

The National Competitiveness Council recently published its\u00a0annual Costs of Doing Business 2017 report which examines a range of enterprise costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, transport, energy, water, waste, communications, credit, and business services. The Council concluded that while Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years - making Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in - Ireland remains a relatively high cost location for a number of key business inputs. In the Council's report, Ireland&rsquo;s current price profile is described as &lsquo;high cost, rising slowly&rsquo;. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The report from Eurostat referenced also concludes\u00a0that Ireland is\u00a0a higher cost location. Ireland, in 2016, was the second most expensive country in Europe for goods and services behind only Denmark and slightly more expensive than both Luxembourg and Sweden. Prices on average here were some 25.6 per cent higher than the EU28 average. \u00a0For key business inputs, including telecommunications and transport Ireland were 33.6 and 4.3 per cent more expensive than the EU28 average. For education, Irish prices were almost 5 per cent lower than the comparable average. <\/p>  <p>  Recent inflation data, however, reaffirms the NCC&rsquo;s price profile as high cost yet rising slowly. Annual inflation for 2016 was 0 per cent according to the Central Statistics Office. The overall Consumer Prices Index (CPI) shows that prices on average rose by 0.2% in the year to May 2017. Conversely, on a monthly basis, price actually fell by 0.2% between April and May 2017. Prices, as measured by Eurostat&rsquo;s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) &ndash; decreased slightly in 2016. \u00a0Irish inflation rates are forecast at 0.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.2 per cent in 2018.The projected path for inflation over the medium term reflects the impact of higher import prices following the depreciation of Sterling over the past year as a result of Britain&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU. <\/p>  <p>  The aforementioned report of the National Competitiveness Council is a timely reminder of the risks of complacency regarding our cost competitiveness. To protect the gains achieved to date, to sustain economic growth, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our cost competitiveness. The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business report and the associated reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be brought to Government and published later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100077#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100077#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":274,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[29154\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100077#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the appointments made to State boards under her auspices in the period 1 May 2017 to 15 June 2017 by appointee name, position and the relevant State board, in tabular form; and the appointment process for each such appointment and the State boards under her auspices in which vacancies remain unfilled to date in 2017.","asker":"1221","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":275,"content":"<p>The State Board information requested by Deputy Collins is listed on the following table.<table><tr><th>Agency<\/th><th>No of Appointments 01\/05\/2017-15\/06\/2017<\/th><th>Name <\/th><th>Position<\/th><th>Process<\/th><th>Vacancies<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland<\/td><td>None<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>1 vacancy since 29\/05\/2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Health and Safety Authority<\/td><td>None<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>No vacancies<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority<\/td><td>2 on 30th May 2017<\/td><td>Ms Etain Doyle <br \/><br \/>Mr  David Devlin<\/td><td>Members<\/td><td>Reappointments Both were nominees\u00a0of the prescribed accountancy bodies and appointed by Minister Mitchell O'Connor<\/td><td>1 vacancy for Ministerial Nomination   <br \/><br \/>Process is underway<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IDA Ireland<\/td><td>None<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>1 vacancy (PAS Shortlist has\u00a0been submitted)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Standards Authority of Ireland<\/td><td>None<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>1 vacancy\u00a0 since May 2017- PAS has been notified<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Personal injuries Assessment   Board<\/td><td>None<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>No vacancies<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Science Foundation Ireland<\/td><td>2 on 8th June 2017<\/td><td>Professor Liam Madden and Mr Aidan Donnelly<\/td><td>Members<\/td><td>Reappointments   with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in consultation   with the Minister for Education, were made by Minister Mitchell O'Connor.<\/td><td>No vacancies<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100077#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Data","counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100077#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[29178\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100077#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of IDA sites that are vacant and or not occupied or not in use; the length of time that they have been not been in use; if some of the not in use sites have been rented to local authorities for uses other than their original purpose; if so, the location of each, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":278,"content":"<p>The following table\u00a0sets out IDA properties\u00a0that are currently available to prospective investors. <\/p><p>To date, IDA Ireland\u00a0has not rented\u00a0properties\u00a0to local authorities for uses other than their original purpose.<\/p><p>The IDA does not release details regarding the length of time that particular\u00a0sites have remained vacant as such\u00a0information is commercially sensitive.\u00a0 <table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Town<\/th><th>Property Location<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>County Roscommon<\/td><td>Roscommon\u00a0<\/td><td>Roscommon B&amp;amp;T Park<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>County Longford<\/td><td>Longford<\/td><td>Aghafad<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>County Longford<\/td><td>Longford<\/td><td>Longford Industrial Estate<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>County Westmeath<\/td><td>Mullingar<\/td><td>Clonmore Ind.

Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with the parents, teachers, staff and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring medication, that appropriate treatment is available.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) and the organisations representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. <\/p>  <p>  The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it they should indemnify the school. <\/p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to administer medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of pupil\/pupils for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. <\/p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. <\/p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to administer the type of medicine which may be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100077#WRE05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100077#WRE05500"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[29131\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100077#WRE05600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a starting date for work to complete the next stage of a school (details supplied) will begin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy referrs was authorised to proceed to tender in October 2016.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. \u00a0The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed\u00a0pay measures\u00a0under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher (2012 entrant) from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.\u00a0The comparable starting salary for a pre-2011 entrant post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020\u00a0(i.e. if full equalisation to pre-2011 pay rates for teachers was achieved)\u00a0would\u00a0be &euro;43,879\u00a0and for a primary teacher would\u00a0be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  Further to the this newly recruited teachers\u00a0benefit from\u00a0the terms of the Ward circular\u00a0which reduced the\u00a0qualifying period for a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs.\u00a0 In addition to earlier permanency, other\u00a0measures\u00a0of benefit to newly recruited teachers\u00a0include a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before.<\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.\u00a0 It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100078#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"English Language Training Organisations","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100078#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[29179\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100078#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied);

That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to targeted police operations. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. Revisiting the decisions made to close Garda stations is also part of that commitment. <\/p><p>In this context, the Government on 24 June 2016 authorised the then Minister to request the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. The pilot will feed into the wider review being undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities. <\/p><p>The Commissioner submitted a first Interim Report on 6 March 2017, which set out a timeline for completion of the exercise, including the delivery of a final report in May\/June 2017.  On 9 June 2017 a second Interim Report was submitted, in which the Commissioner indicated that she will be submitting her Final Report at the end of this month.  In the most recent Interim  Report, the Commissioner, having analysed population and crime trends, and taking account of the availability of stations for reuse, recommends that Stepaside Station in Co. Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis subject to the necessary consultation with the Office of Public Works. On the same basis, the Commissioner makes a number of other recommendations including that if the Government decides to reopen two Stations in Dublin, that Rush Station in north Co. Dublin be reopened. However, the Commissioner requests that a decision on Rush be deferred until her final report is received to allow time for further analysis to be carried out. The Commissioner has also indicated that she is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend the reopening of Leighlinbridge Station in Co. Carlow and Donard Station in Co. Wicklow, in her final report. The Commissioner has also highlighted the need to develop new stations to meet identified policing requirements at Dublin Airport and at Dublin Port. <\/p><p>  At its meeting on 13 June, the Government agreed to note the key recommendations in the Commissioner&rsquo;s report and to agree, in principle, to the reopening of Stepaside Garda Station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed and that the decision to reopen Rush, Leighlinbridge and Donard Stations will be taken when the final report is received from the Commissioner at the end of June. <\/p><p>The Policing Authority has commissioned the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, on foot of a request from the former Minister, to review the dispersement of Garda Stations in the State and the boundaries of Garda Districts.

The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.<\/p>  <p>  All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics. Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups such as the CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) or BIA for a number of reasons:<\/p>  <p>  1.

In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology,  Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involved a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland.

The Action Plan outlines the actions needed to enhance breastfeeding rates and provide skilled supports to mothers, through our maternity services, hospitals, primary care services and in partnership with voluntary breastfeeding organisations and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>These actions include the implementation of policies at hospital and community level; investment in breastfeeding training and skills development for healthcare staff; and partnership working to promote a culture that accepts and supports breastfeeding.  The Action Plan is available at .<\/p><p>I am also pleased to advise the deputy that breastfeeding initiatives are also reflected in the Creating a Better Future Together: National Maternity Strategy 2016-2026.  This national strategy emphasised the importance of dedicated staff, such as the HSE National Breastfeeding Coordinator and statutory and voluntary supports, in promoting and supporting breastfeeding in Ireland.  It referred to the National Breastfeeding Coordinator that works with a national committee to oversee the implementation of breastfeeding action plans and monitors progress in relation to breastfeeding targets; liaising with local breastfeeding committees, maternity hospitals, community health services and voluntary breastfeeding organisations.<\/p><p>Initiatives referred to in the national strategy included an annual National Breastfeeding Week, the HSE website , and an on-line Ask the Expert support service provided by International Board Certi\ufb01ed Lactation Consultants.  Other initiatives mentioned included breastfeeding support groups, the development of a breastfeeding competencies framework, and a breastfeeding policy for primary care teams and community healthcare settings.<\/p><p>Moreover, the National Maternity Strategy reiterated that along with practical supports that can be provided to mothers, such as supports to continue breastfeeding on return to the workplace, a broader societal change is required in order to promote a more positive culture around breastfeeding.  This should support women to feel con\ufb01dent about their choice to breastfeed.  The Maternity Strategy emphasised that this includes engaging extended family members and childminders who, perhaps due to not being aware of the importance of breastfeeding, may not be best informed to support a family&rsquo;s choice to feed their baby expressed breast milk while in their care.  It referred to breastfeeding promotion campaigns that should be tailored and targeted to help the wider community, including family members, childminders and employers, to play their role in improving Ireland&rsquo;s breastfeeding initiation and duration rates.<\/p><p>I want to also assure the deputy that the recently published Dept. of Justice and Equality National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017 - 2020: creating a better society for all, contains two actions on increasing the proportion of mothers who breastfeed.<\/p><p>There are some resources available to healthcare professionals in relation the use of medicinal products by breastfeeding mothers. In the first instance the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) should be consulted whenever a practitioner is considering prescribing a medicine to a breast-feeding mother or where the healthcare professional requires information on the suitability of a medicine for breast feeding.<\/p><p>Under EU legislation, product information associated with a medicine consists of the SmPC and the package leaflet. The SmPC is a legal document approved as part of the marketing authorisation of each medicine and forms the basis of information for healthcare professionals on how to use the medicine.  This information is presented according to a predefined structure and includes the situations where the medicine must not be used, defining patient populations who must not take the medicines, and special warnings and precautions on the use of the medicine.  This includes qualitative and quantitative information on the benefits and the risks posed by the medicine.  Section 4.6 of the SmPC provides available information regarding the use of the drug during pregnancy and recommendations on the use or not of the medicine during pregnancy.  Recommendation on the need to stop or continue breastfeeding while on the medicine is also provided.<\/p><p>The information contained within the SmPC is updated throughout the lifecycle of the medicine as new data emerge.<\/p><p>The decision on whether to use a medicine during breastfeeding should be reached following a discussion between a prescriber and their patient about the potential risks and benefits of that  medicine.  In accordance with the Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics, medical practitioners must ensure as far as possible that any treatment, medication or therapy prescribed for a patient is safe, evidence-based and in the patient&rsquo;s best interests.<\/p><p>Patients with queries about the suitability of using a medicine during breast feeding are encouraged to speak to their pharmacist or general practitioner.<\/p><p>Finally, as the questions from the deputy relate mainly to service issues, I have arranged for them to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply on some of the specifics referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100079#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services Provision","counter":415,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100079#WRG05100"},{"type":"question","counter":416,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[29170\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100079#WRG05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the hospitals that supply baby boxes for newborn babies;

It is intended that this pilot scheme will further increase our knowledge of the stock, aid in its recovery and help ensure its long-term sustainability on the basis of firm scientific evidence.<\/p>  <p>  If the assessment by STECF is positive, the by catch avoidance programme will then be brought to the Quota Management Advisory Committee \u00a0(involving fishing industry representatives from the catching and processing sectors)\u00a0for further development, and subsequently go to public consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100081#WRJ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":522,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100081#WRJ05000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Functions","counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100081#WRJ04900"},{"type":"question","counter":522,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[29150\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100081#WRJ05000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide a copy of the official diary of his predecessor (details supplied) for the period August to December 2015.","asker":"1259","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":523,"content":"<p>I have set out below\u00a0an extract from the diary of\u00a0 then Minister, Alex White for the period August 2015 \u00a0to December 2015.\u00a0This calendar was previously released following a request under the\u00a0FOI Act.\u00a0\u00a0<table><tr><th><b>Subject<\/b><\/th><th><b>StartDate<\/b><\/th><th><b>EndDate<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Paul - A\/L<\/td><td>4\/8\/2015<\/td><td>9\/8\/2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Annual Leave<\/td><td>4\/8\/2015<\/td><td>13\/8\/2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ACTONS HOTEL<\/td><td>6\/8\/2015<\/td><td>7\/8\/2015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midleton&rsquo;

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed an\u00a0agreement with me committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0 A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Quarterly updates will be published on the Departments website.I am pleased to announce that the eir rollout\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.<\/p><p>The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken purely on commercial grounds. Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. <\/p><p>I also published in April an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .The Map\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.<\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>There are approximately 2.3m premises covering Ireland&rsquo;s 26 counties, of which approximately 542,000 (23%) premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map.\u00a0 These premises will require State intervention and are the focus for the State Intervention procurement process.\u00a0 The remaining 1.8m \u00a0premises are located in the BLUE areas and will be\/are\u00a0served by commercial operators. Of the 1.8m premises, 300,000 premises\u00a0fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and\u00a0end\u00a02018 (Light BLUE on map).\u00a0 Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at\u00a0<font color=\"#1F497D\">.<\/font><\/p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at .<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can\u00a0progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.The \u00a0three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0<\/p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place. <\/p><p>The procurement is progressing to the next stage.\u00a0This week, the Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; by 26 September 2017. This is a significant\u00a0milestone as the NBP procurement process moves to the next stage. <\/p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>However, I am aware that the rate of demand for data services has increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force. In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys,\u00a0established an Implementation Group. This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery. This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website\u00a0 at and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. <\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas. The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty. Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100081#WRJ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Mitigation Plan","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100081#WRJ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[29198\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100081#WRJ05600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the publication deadline for the national mitigation strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>The objective of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Mitigation Plan is to set out what Ireland is doing, and is planning to do, to further the national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015.

Since the launch of the recent campaign on 18 April last, 4,859 reports have been received from members of the public.  This compares with some 3,322 reports which were received over the same period in 2016.  The reports are now being examined and will be referred for follow-up action by the Department, where this is warranted based on the information provided.  This work will be carried out over the coming weeks and months. <\/p>  <p>  A determination of fraud can only be made after a detailed investigation by a social welfare inspector (SWI) and the making of a revised decision under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 by one of the Department&rsquo;s deciding officers.  The person concerned has a right to appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeal Office where the facts are disputed.  The outcome of an investigation may determine that the claim is correct, that the customer was in error or fraud is present.  The payment to the person concerned may be either terminated or reduced in value based on the outcome of the investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that all reports received do not lead to an investigation.  A preliminary examination of each report is undertaken for relevance and to identify the person reported.  Once a person can be identified, the next step is to establish if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment.  Where a person can be identified, is receiving a payment and sufficient information is provided to warrant further examination, the report is referred to the relevant scheme area in the Department or to a SWI for further investigation.  A payment will not be suspended or stopped on the basis of the report received from a member of the public.  The Department can only take this action as a result of an investigation and the making of a statutory decision.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100082#WRK02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Benefit Applications","counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100082#WRK03200"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[29139\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100082#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made regarding a carer's benefit application by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":566,"content":"<p>I confirm that my department received an application for carer&rsquo;s benefit from the person concerned on 22 May 2017.

However, the provisions of this legislation are generally taken as applicable in dwellings within multi-unit developments or mixed-use buildings. <\/p><p>Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Building Control Act 1990 and the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, all of which may be relevant in relation to fire safety arrangements in residential buildings, other than those specifically excluded. Details in relation to inspections and notices issued by fire services up to 2015 are available on my Department's website at the link below; 2016 information should be available shortly. <\/p><p>.<\/p><p>There is no limitation on who can make a call for assistance to 999\/112 from any of the Emergency Services, should it be required. The caller should provide as much information as possible, listening and carefully following the advice being given by the call takers, who are trained for that purpose. In some cases a monitored Automatic Fire Alarm system may be in place, however this is not a mandatory requirement.<\/p><p>In response to the recent tragedy at Grenfell Tower in London, I have requested that each local authority be asked, as a matter of urgency, to review their multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems and means of escape including corridors, stairways and emergency exits are in place and fully functional. Life safety must be our first concern.  <\/p><p>In terms of raising awareness across landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports and rental assistance, I have requested that the Residential Tenancies Board be asked to notify all landlords of their responsibilities and obligations as landlords in terms of ensuring that their properties fully comply with fire safety requirements.  <\/p><p>In order to remind builders, assigned certifiers, designers and owners of their obligations in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations, I have also requested that a notification be issued to all registered users (approx. 52,000) through the Building Control Management System (BCMS).<\/p><p>Although there are no apartment blocks in Ireland comparable to Grenfell Tower, all householders, regardless of the type of accommodation they live in, are urged to take the basic but most effective fire safety precaution of ensuring that their family&rsquo;s home is protected with working smoke alarms. I have also emphasised the fire safety responsibilities of management companies more generally in control of multi-occupancy buildings and urged them to satisfy themselves that the arrangements in place are appropriate and safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100083#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100083#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[29230\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062100083#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount spent by his Department and State agencies under his aegis on outside contract and or third party public relations advice and training in past three years to date in 2017, by year and company engaged, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>My Department did not incur any public relations advice or training related expenditure in the past three years to date in 2017.\u00a0 My Department&rsquo;s Press and Communications Office provide this\u00a0service on behalf of the Department and will up-skill themselves as necessary to carry out their roles.<\/p><p>The details requested in relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department are a matter for the individual bodies concerned.
