<\/p>  <p>  - transparent and sustainable mortgage lending; <\/p>  <p>  - the application of the tax code to the construction and property sectors; and <\/p>  <p>  addressing legacy issues associated with the property bubble. <\/p>  <p>  This includes facilitating the sustainable and professional development of the private rented sector.\u00a0 Historically the private rented sector in Ireland has been characterised by small-scale landlords. Attracting large scale investment in professionally managed residential property, for example using Real Estate Investment Trusts and other options for long-term investment, can have an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard sector that tenants deserve. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have introduced a number of targeted initiatives in various budgets since 2011 to aid in revitalising the property and construction sectors and to help increase the supply of suitable residential housing stock in certain urban areas where supply limitations are most pronounced, including the introduction of the REIT tax framework in Budget 2013. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The acquisition and management of properties by professional REITs is part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and property tenants. \u00a0 While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.\u00a0 For example, since its launch in April 2014, Irish Residential Properties REIT, the first Irish REIT with a primarily residential property investment focus, has built up a portfolio of high quality Dublin residential properties.\u00a0 It recently reported that as of September 2014 it had acquired 1,204 residential units which it was professionally operating with an occupancy rate of c. 99%.<\/p>  <p>  We must remember that the REIT regime is in its relative infancy in Ireland.\u00a0 We expect the sector to continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400069#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Repossession","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400069#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[4655\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400069#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures he will bring forward to prevent banks moving to repossess family home before all other solutions have been exhausted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>This Government is tackling the issue of mortgage arrears head on.\u00a0 We overhauled the structures to support customers in arrears to find solutions.The Deputy will be aware that the Government's Strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears was formulated in response to the recommendations of the Keane Report (2011) and the main elements of it are:<br\/><br\/>- Engagement with the banks to develop appropriate measures for their customers in mortgage arrears;<br\/><br\/>- Personal insolvency law reform and implementation;<br\/><br\/>- Mortgage to rent; and <br\/><br\/>- A Mortgage Advisory function\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort and that every effort should be made to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.\u00a0 Even after the commencement of the legal process, it will be possible for lenders and borrowers to re-engage and it will be in the best interest of all parties if that happens.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware\u00a0of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.\u00a0 This\u00a0Code\u00a0\u00a0provides that a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the lender has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his\/her nominated representative and the specific timeframes set out in the Code have adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.In the case of not co-operating borrowers,\u00a0before classifying a borrower as such, a lender must write to the borrower to notify them that they may be classified as not co-operating and explain the steps for the borrower to take to avoid that classification. <br\/><br\/>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Central Bank commenced a themed inspection of compliance with the CCMA in Quarter 4 of 2014.

In this regard Permanent TSB prepared a Restructuring Plan, which was submitted to the European Commission (\"the Commission\") in June 2012. As requested by the Commission, an updated version of the plan was submitted in August 2013 which incorporated improvements in performance over the intervening period.<\/p>  <p>  The Permanent\u00a0TSB\u00a0restructuring\u00a0plan submitted in autumn 2013 is now\u00a0outdated and has been\u00a0updated for both recent positive financial and operational performance in 2014\u00a0and the\u00a0results of the Comprehensive Assessment.\u00a0My officials\u00a0have been in detailed discussions with the Commission over recent\u00a0months in relation to the plan, details of which are confidential between the parties and commercially sensitive at the present time.\u00a0However, I expect the restructuring plan to be agreed in advance of the capital raise.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware Permanent TSB is an important bank in a highly concentrated Irish market. While no restructuring\u00a0plan has been approved, it has not prevented Permanent TSB from making significant progress in delivering key elements of the Restructuring Plan submitted over the last year and the business is being managed structurally in the way envisaged in the plan. Permanent TSB has made steady progress on returning to operating profitability, has significantly de-risked its balance sheet through a sale of a tranche of its UK mortgage portfolio and the sale of Springboard Mortgages and has made positive progress on arrears reductions, with 90 day + arrears in Homeloans c. 33% below peak levels at end 2014. I expect that the bank's full year 2014 annual results, which will be issued on the 11th   March 2015 will confirm this. <\/p>  <p>  With regards to the Capital Raise, the Comprehensive Assessment Adverse Stress Test result identified a shortfall of &euro;855 million. As a consequence the bank has submitted a Capital Plan to the SSM, which outlines how the bank intends to meet the capital shortfall.\u00a0 Much of the shortfall has been met through performance in 2014 and deleverage of assets in 2014. The remaining shortfall will require the bank to raise capital, including equity capital, from private sources in 2015, diluting the State's shareholding.\u00a0 Details of the capital raise will be finalised shortly.\u00a0 While there are no current plans to sell shares held by the State during the process I will keep this under review as it could be required to ensure a successful capital raise process for the State and other shareholders.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am of the view that the best way to protect the value of the State's shareholding is to ensure Permanent TSB is well prepared, that it conducts a comprehensive and competitive exercise to raise the capital with appropriate legal and financial advice, and that the State has meaningful oversight and involvement in the process.

Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol to defraud motorists and the State. Revenue has received 134 complaints to date, the majority of which originated from the counties covered by Revenue's Border Midland West Region. <\/p>  <p>  Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue enforcement officers and fuel samples taken from them were sent for analysis by the State Laboratory. To date, samples have been taken from over 50 filling stations nationwide and 300 samples, from them and from other sources,\u00a0have been referred to the State Laboratory.<\/p>  <p>  The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming and the State Laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests on the samples.\u00a0\u00a0 Despite this extensive testing, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been \u00a0found in only two samples from one location. The conclusive results received from those two samples have resulted in the seizure of the product and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution. <\/p>  <p>  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to deliberately mix normal road diesel with petrol. If the problems that have come to light were caused by an unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed into petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. However, the Deputy can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take speedy and determined action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue have been working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this investigation, sharing information and intelligence, and will continue to do so.\u00a0I am also advised by Revenue that they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud. This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data. In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documentation and take samples of fuel for analysis.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible actions to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud, including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400069#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400069#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[4610\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400069#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review the tax code which provides for the singling out of the self-employed for payment of a higher rate of universal social charge and its potential to adversely affect business investment, growth and potentially job creation and retention in small and medium enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>First of all, I would point out to the Deputy that\u00a0the USC surcharge only impacts on a small proportion of the high earning self-employed. In 2012, the latest year for which definitive figures are available, just over 11,000 taxpayers paid the 3% USC surcharge. This represents approximately 6% of taxpayers whose primary\u00a0income\u00a0is not subject to PAYE, or half of one per cent of all income earners.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of USC in 2011 was accompanied by a series of other reform measures designed to simplify the tax system and widen the tax base. As part of these the PRSI ceiling on income over &euro;75,000 was removed for all\u00a0employees. This meant that those employees on incomes\u00a0in excess of\u00a0&euro;75,000 would now be liable to an additional 4% charge on that portion of their income. At the same time the PRSI rates for self-assessed income earners was increased\u00a0from 3% to 4%.<\/p>  <p>  At that time,\u00a0a 3% USC surcharge, in addition to the 7% rate on that portion of self-assessed income over &euro;100,000, was introduced. The alternative would have seen self-assessed high income earners\u00a0benefit when compared\u00a0to their PAYE counterparts from the tax package introduced in 2011. On the basis of fairness, this could not have been countenanced at the time.<\/p>  <p>  It was necessary to\u00a0maintain the 3%\u00a0in Budget 2015 in order to ensure that the self-assessed on high incomes did not benefit disproportionately from the Income Tax package and that the maximum benefit is capped for all taxpayers at\u00a0&euro;14 per week.<\/p>  <p>  To allow large increases for the self-assessed on high incomes would be difficult to justify, or indeed would not be fiscally prudent, at a time when the country is only beginning to emerge from a prolonged economic downturn.<\/p>  <p>  Far from being anti-enterprise, a fair, efficient and competitive income tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation. The Statement of Priorities issued by the Government in July 2014 included a commitment for an income tax reform plan\u00a0 to be delivered over a number of budgets, to reduce the 52% marginal tax rate on low and middle-income earners, including the self-employed, in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the self-assesed were subject to a marginal tax rate of 55% on incomes in excess of &euro;100,000 in 2014, and they will continue to face the same rate\u00a0on such income\u00a0in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400069#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Rate","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400069#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[4694\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400069#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the level of mortgage arrears and on the increased rate of repossessions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>This Government tackled the issue of mortgage arrears head on.\u00a0 We overhauled the systems and structures to support customers in arrears to find solutions.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that the Government's Strategy to address the problem of mortgage was formulated in response to the recommendations of the Keane Report (2011) and the main elements of it are:<br\/><br\/>- Engagement with the banks to develop appropriate measures for their customers in mortgage arrears;<br\/><br\/>- Personal insolvency law reform and implementation;<br\/><br\/>- Mortgage to rent; and <br\/><br\/>- A Mortgage Advisory function\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The\u00a0Strategy is working, as evidenced by the monthly improvements in the mortgage restructures data collected by my Department officials.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.

The levy was introduced in 2011 to fund the Jobs Initiative and has applied at a rate of 0.6% for the years 2011 to 2013, at an aggregate rate of 0.75% for 2014 and will apply at a reduced rate of 0.15% for this year. In accordance with the provisions in section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 (SDCA), the stamp duty levy on pension fund assets will end after 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) responsible for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.<\/p>  <p>  While I would expect that, in carrying out their responsibilities in this matter, pension scheme trustees would examine all the options open to them regarding how to deal with the impact of the levy, including an approach to the employer sponsors of the scheme, neither I or the Government made any statement to the effect that employers would be required to meet the cost of the levy.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I have no detailed information on the decisions made by pension fund trustees or others in relation to the passing on of the full or a partial impact of the levy to the current, deferred or former (retired) members of pension schemes. I am aware, however, that in certain cases where trustees have made the decision to pass on the impact or part of the impact of the levy to pensioners, that a smaller reduction in pension payments over the lifetime of the pension have been made in preference to a larger reduction over a shorter period.<\/p>  <p>  The pension fund legislation includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed the relevant percentage (0.6%, 0.75% or 0.15%, as appropriate) of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme's liabilities to that member. <\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners are afforded oversight authority to review, where they consider it appropriate, instances where benefits are adjusted as a result of the payment of the levy to ensure that any such adjustment is in keeping with the requirements of the levy legislation.\u00a0 In undertaking any such review Revenue may consult with appropriate experts as they see fit.\u00a0 However, before Revenue could act in that regard, instances of concern on foot of actual adjustments would first have to be brought formally to its attention.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, while I am very conscious of the sacrifices that Irish taxpayers, generally, have been required to make over the past number of years, the fact is that without the pension fund levy there would not have been the Job Initiative measures such as the reduced VAT rate of 9% and other measures which have been very successful in helping to create employment and protect employment in this economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400070#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400070#WRB04350"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[5057\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400070#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views regarding whether it is appropriate that the Revenue Commissioners would deduct the tax credits of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin because the person did not pay enough tax in 1998, despite the fact that they had got balancing statements for all of the subsequent years.","asker":"1192","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that following direct engagement from the person concerned and having regard to all of the circumstances, an amended certificate of tax credits issued to him on 30 January 2015 reflecting the full tax credits to which he is entitled. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400070#WRB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Levy Yield","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400070#WRB04550"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[5059\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400070#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the final yield from the 0.75% pension fund levy in 2014; the way this compared to the projected yield at budget time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that final receipts in 2014 from the Stamp Duty levy on pension fund assets, introduced in the Finance (No.2) Act 2011, are &euro;743 million.

Competitiveness has been achieved through wage moderation as compared with our trading partners as well as productivity improvements.<\/p>  <p>  Relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to our euro area peers.  For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2009.  HICP inflation turned negative in December, largely due to a fall in oil prices, nonetheless core inflation (which excludes energy and unprocessed food) was also weak.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the ECB's recent quantitative easing announcement is to be welcomed.  The Irish economy should benefit through a number of channels.  For example, the economy should benefit directly through improved financing conditions for households and firms.

The latest available data for 2014 show that GDP growth for the first three quarters of the year is broadly in line with my Department's forecast at Budget time.<\/p>  <p>  According to recent figures published by the European Commission, it expects Ireland to be the fastest growing economy in Europe in 2014 and 2015.  Importantly, domestic demand is making a positive contribution to growth for the first time since the crisis began.  Consumer spending has been strong in 2014 with retail sales up over 6 per cent compared with 2013.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up close to 4 per cent in 2014.  Investment in building and construction as well as in machinery and equipment spending are on a rising path. <\/p>  <p>  Exports rose by 15.5 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 2014.  This was the fastest rate of expansion since 2001.  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with employment having increased in each of the last eight quarters to the third quarter 2014, representing an increase of over 80,000 jobs since the low-point in mid-2012.  In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 10.6 per cent in December, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012. <\/p>  <p>  Macroeconomic forecasts for the years 2014 to 2018 were presented by my Department on Budget Day, last October.  These forecasts see GDP growth of 4.7 per cent in 2014 and 3.9 per cent this year.  This growth is driven by a positive contribution from net exports on the back of growth in Ireland's trading partners. Domestic demand is set to contribute to growth as well, with growing employment and rising household incomes resulting in an increase in private consumption over the period.  Over the medium term, GDP growth of about 3&frac12; per cent a year is anticipated.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current improvement, risks to the outlook remain.  These relate to the low inflation observed in many advanced economies, geo-political tensions as well as the underperformance of the euro area economy.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the public finances, policy measures implemented by the Government have resulted in a decline in the deficit in recent years.  This decline has been in a phased manner, consistent with the dual needs of supporting domestic activity as well as repairing the public finances.  All of the interim deficit ceilings under the Excessive Deficit Procedure have been met and Ireland is firmly on track to achieve a deficit of below 3 per cent this year.  This has been important in restoring Ireland's credibility in the international markets, and bond yields have fallen substantially since the highs of mid-2011.  The debt ratio has peaked and is now on a downward path.  After 2015, fiscal policy will be set in line with the requirement to move towards Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective, which is for a balanced budget in structural terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400070#WRB06300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"House Prices","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400071#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[5171\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400071#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which his Department monitors house property prices with particular reference to the need to ensure that such prices do not become a major governing economic influence as in the past; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>As is the case with other economic indicators, my Department monitors trends in house prices on an ongoing basis.

Almost 80,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.  Indigenous exports and foreign direct investment are at all-time record levels.

The Review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by an external service provider on specific issues which required specialised expertise.<br\/><br\/>A call for written submissions to inform the review was made on the 16th June 2012. In total 61 submissions were received from a broad range of individuals, nursing homes, statutory bodies, groups representing the interest of older people, private\/commercial bodies and organisations in the community and voluntary sector. A summary report of the submissions was published on the Department's website in December 2012. <br\/><br\/>The Terms of Reference for the Review are:<br\/><br\/>Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation:<br\/><br\/>1. To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme;<br\/><br\/>2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices;<br\/><br\/>3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services;<br\/><br\/>4. To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health); and<br\/><br\/>5. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.<br\/><br\/>The elements of the Review that relate to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme itself are well-defined, but an effective assessment of the Scheme for the future requires consideration of where it fits within the spectrum of services and supports for older people, and of how the make-up of and balances within this spectrum may change over time. This exercise is much broader than was first envisaged and the time needed was therefore also somewhat longer. However work is well  advanced and it is  expected that the Review will be completed by the end of this quarter .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400073#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400073#WRE03550"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[5150\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400073#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the number of persons currently on the waiting list to see a consultant cardiologist at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9; the average waiting time to see the consultant; and the steps being taken to reduce the waiting time.","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Due to conflicting reports of posts being lost in these schools, my Department produced a report on the impact of the withdrawal of these legacy posts from DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 Schools. Following the Government's decision of 21 February 2012 in the matter, a number of schools continued to retain disadvantaged legacy posts from previous disadvantage schemes on a year to year basis and only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September. The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to primary schools is published annually on the website of the Department of Education and Skills. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements for the 2014\/15 school year (Circular 0007\/2014) were published in January 2014.<br\/><br\/>A range of factors contribute to determining the staffing requirement for individual schools including changes to enrolment and the reforms to the teacher allocation process introduced in 2012. As the teaching allocation to schools, including disadvantage legacy posts, are enrolment based, this determines whether schools gain or lose posts from year to year. <br\/><br\/>As the school referred to by the Deputy saw an increase in enrolment on 30th September 2013, the post was subsumed into the mainstream staffing of the school for the 2014\/15 school year.  <br\/><br\/>The school submitted a staffing appeal to the February 2014 meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.

Individualised student information is already collected centrally at pre-primary, post-primary and third level education. The development of an individualised primary online database has been widely recognised for many years as being a key requirement to provide vital information on the educational welfare and progress of our primary school children. The current system of record keeping and data collection means that information provided to the Department from primary schools is quite out of date by the time it is eventually processed and passed to areas that need it such as the Inspectorate, School Governance, Forward Planning and various grant payment and teacher allocations areas. POD will allow the Department to have access to timely and relevant information about the stocks and flows of pupils in our primary schools, which will aid us tremendously in carrying out our functions and providing the best possible service to schools and pupils.  Moving to an electronic system will also help to streamline administration at school level and reduce form filling, red tape, and the duplication of information requests, allowing school staff to focus more on their primary objective of educating our children. <br\/><br\/>From the point of view of retaining the data up to the age of 30, the Department understands that there are concerns from a data protection and privacy point of view. The Department is considering these concerns but also needs to consider the fact that in the future POD will serve as the official record of primary school enrolment for everybody, and as such it forms part of an individual's personal history. While some people might prefer for their record to be deleted as soon as possible, others may prefer to have their record accessible should they want or need to get it in the future. The Department will consider it's retention policy bearing in mind these issues, as well as all the legal obligations on us in the areas of data protection and records management. Individuals also have the right under data protection legislation to request in writing to any public body that their records held by that body be removed or amended and their reasons for the request, and the public body must consider and respond to such requests within 40 days. <br\/><br\/>The Department takes the protection of pupil's data very seriously. Pupil data is stored securely in the Department's Oracle database. This database is hosted on the Department's servers which are located in the Revenue Commissioners data-centre in St Johns' Road. Access to the servers is protected by both Revenue and Government firewalls. Staff of the Revenue Commissioners do not have access to the data in the database. POD application roles have been developed which limit school staff to viewing and maintaining their own pupil records. Access within the Department to POD data is limited to the POD team which is currently less than 15 people. No agency or other Government Department will have direct access to the Primary Online Database.<br\/><br\/>The &quot;Notes&quot; area is for schools' use only, it will only be accessible to the school where the child is currently enrolled, and will not be transferrable from one school to the next if the child is moving school.  <br\/><br\/>School's have the option to enter data directly into POD. In general Schools have found the system user friendly.The encryption process is in place for data security reasons. A facility is also currently being rolled out which will allow schools to securely upload the data directly to the Department, so schools will have the option to use that if they are finding the encryption process difficult. <br\/><br\/>The Department has repeatedly advised parents and schools who have contacted us that if a parent does not wish to put their child's details on POD that they should inform their school of this in writing. We have not in any way advised schools to transfer data against the parent's wishes. <br\/><br\/>While this is a new system coming into place at primary level, it is already very common practice in many other areas of the public sector and indeed elsewhere in the education system for somebody accessing a public service to be asked to provide a certain amount of information about themselves in order to receive the service, including their PPS number.  In the education system, for example, in order to access the ECCE scheme parents must give a certain amount of information on their children to the pre-school in order to validate their eligibility, or in order to apply for and receive a student grant students must give information about themselves to the Department.  POD will also allow the Department to ensure that it makes payments on the basis of each pupil only once, with the best will in the world duplicate enrolments can inadvertently occur in the system. <br\/><br\/>Apart from the need to ensure that going forward payments and allocations to schools are made on the basis of validated information, from an administrative point of view, it would be unworkable to operate any kind of grant payments, allocation system or even to compile vital statistics if we have a system where some pupils are on POD and then there needs to be some alternate method of collecting information on pupils who do not provide their details to POD.  It's difficult to see how any such system could function in practice, either from the school's or Department's point of view. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400074#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[5077\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020400074#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to withdraw capitation grants to schools for children whose parents object to their information being entered and stored on the primary online database; if so, the statutory basis for that action; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p>From the 2016\/2017 academic year, it is intended that teacher allocations and capitation grants will be made on the basis of POD data, and the previous basis for allocations, the National Annual School Census will cease operation from that point.
