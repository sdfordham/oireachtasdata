It is important we have this debate and that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, would explain why this is the case.<\/p><p>The legislation introducing the proposed statutory code of practice in respect of fair pricing for the horticultural and dairy sector has been on the A list for five different sessions.  As everybody knows, people in the horticultural and dairy sectors are being squeezed by the multiples and supermarkets.  In Britain, there is a statutory code of practice to ensure fair pricing as much as possible for this industry.  I wonder why the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, informed a group in north Dublin recently that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was preparing legislation in relation to a code of conduct for this area when the relevant legislation has been listed on the A list five times but has not yet come before either House.  I would welcome if the Deputy Leader could follow up on the matter and inform the Whip that we are ready to initiate the Bill here.<\/p><p>I would also welcome the Government's view on the sale of 13,000 mortgages by former Irish Nationwide which are held by the former IBRC and its view on the statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, that should these mortgages be sold to an entity outside this State, which is more than likely, they will be covered by the diluted code of conduct of mortgage arrears, even though it is insufficient following the changes made to it last year.  I have been contacted by a number of people who are very concerned about who will purchase this mortgage book and, if it is purchased outside this State, whether they will be covered by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The statement by the Minister that he would expect that such purchaser would follow due procedure is wholly insufficient.  I remind members that this loan book of former Irish Nationwide contains a high number of residential mortgages in arrears, the holders of which need the protection of what remains of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  I am particularly interested in hearing at what discount it is proposed to sell this loan book.  If it is proposed to sell it at a 50% discount, which I am hearing is about correct for those mortgages in arrears, why has IBRC or the entity that was IBRC not offered discounts and restructuring on these mortgages?<\/p> <p>The Government is going to sell these to a vulture fund at a 50% discount.  Would it not be preferable to offer the mortgagees, those who hold the mortgages, a discount to restructure those mortgages instead of the State selling off a loan book to try to make profit for the State?  The Government is leaving these people in hock and without any protection should it be sold to any entity outside the State.  I take it that AIB and Bank of Ireland will not buy this loan book.  Who will buy it?<\/p><p>Why has the Government not instructed IBRC to restructure these mortgages properly if they are to be sold at 50% of their value?  This is a really serious issue.  Some 13,000 mortgage holders will be sold down the river by the Government.  Has the Department of Finance looked at restructuring these mortgages and asked IBRC to give these people a discount of 40%?  Instead it will be sold off to venture capitalists and other mortgage companies.  This will result in a higher proportion of mortgage arrears not covered under the code of conduct for mortgage arrears.  An institution buying the loan book at a discount of 50% can repossess a house and if it gets 60% of the loan value, it will make a profit.<\/p><p>The issue deserves a specific debate in this House.

Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 outlaws sexual acts for people with an intellectual disability unless they are married.

The initiative comes from the gutter press.  I put it to anyone, either in the House or in public, that if they receive such a cynical petition, which uses the situation of Panti Bliss and the RTE broadcast as a framework, not to sign it.  We do not want the American defamation system here; it is simply a licence to lie.  I fought against a defamation Bill in the House already.  The first time around I managed to sink it.  I well remember when the editors of the Irish newspapers got themselves into the House when Donie Cassidy was Leader.  I was the only one who stood out against them.  Everyone else took the view that they had to do what they said because people are so gutless in politics and they are terrified of the media.  They will have a hell of a lot more to be terrified of if we loosen the situation even more.  This is because when the Defamation Bill eventually went through there was a grotesque re-balancing of rights in favour of corporate newspapers and against the individual.  This is simply a cynical attempt to use the Panti scandal and the question of free speech to give the gutter press licence to lie.

It is no excuse to say the matter is in the hands of the liquidator.  It should not have got there without some provision to protect people.  I do not glory in the work of NAMA or the IBRC or any of these things.

At that very time there was a hurricane-like storm raging through Kerry, whipping off roofs of schools, nursing homes and private homes and knocking trees in the national park, on golf courses and across every road in Kerry.

It is not fair on the principals.  When the Minister for Education and Science gets time, perhaps he can come in here for a debate.

Their main concern is that there is a real threat to the withdrawal of business from post offices, as a result of the Government's policy on e-commerce.  I appreciate that there are two sides to this story but it is incumbent on the Government to enter into discussions with An Post about the charges for the administration of the cashing of cheques in post offices, which I understand to be much higher than the simple electronic transfer of social welfare cheques into bank accounts.  As a result of these high charges - I do not have the figures to hand - it is incumbent on the Government to remove the threat that is now hanging over post offices, especially rural post offices, although I understand it is an urban problem as well.  Some 80% of social welfare clients hold bank accounts, which means that as the Government  is actively encouraging e-commerce as a policy, nearly all of those clients will collect their money through their bank accounts rather than from the post office, as is currently the situation.  If that trend continues, then the future viability of rural post offices will be questionable.<\/p><p>I ask for a debate on this issue, so that we can get clarity on it.

Around 1.5 million animals are to be slaughtered this year in Ireland, which is around 30,000 animals per week.  Factories are not able to cope with those numbers as we do not have the markets.  Unfortunately, over the next four years, we are going to see a rise of 300,000 cattle to be slaughtered, even though we do not have the markets.

The reality is that there is secrecy and that we do not have accountability and transparency.

I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate to take place in the near future on the document prepared by the Disability Federation of Ireland.  The document makes a lot of sense and acts as a reminder of the commitments the Government made.  It is also a reminder of whether we, or the Government, are keeping up with the commitments.  A debate would give us an opportunity to talk about disability and the disability promises that were made in so many other ways.<\/p><p>There is one other important topic.  Senator O'Neill referred to the beef trade and I wish to raise the issue of milk quality.  There is a concern among veterinarians in Ireland that what has happened in recent years has left a danger that our quality of milk will be less than it has been and less than what exists in other countries.  Until the year 2002, antibiotics were available across the counter.  Legislation was introduced in 2003 which meant that antibiotics for animals were no longer available across the counter unless a veterinarian had been on the premises or farm once during the previous 12 months.  There is a concern that 12 months is far too long because in Denmark the period is only 30 days and the reason for a shorter period is due to scheduling regarding the animal remedies regulation.  The matter is worthy of consideration.  I ask the Deputy Leader to bring the matter to the attention of the relevant Minister.  I assume that would be the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Perhaps the Minister for Health would consider the matter as well because we are talking about a concern that the quality of milk will deteriorate in the years ahead.  Milk is an important export for Ireland and nothing should prevent us from being at the top of the world league table for milk quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800009#H00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1392736200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Like Senator Mooney, I am deeply concerned about the proposal to hand over social welfare payments to banks, but not for the same reason as he stated.

It is particularly encouraging that some of cynicism that surrounded these announcements in the past has been somewhat diluted on this occasion.  With the modern means of communication, bad news travels as fast, if not faster, than good news so when we have a good news story like St. Patrick's Day and when many countries throughout the world wish to join in a celebration of our heritage, we should take that on board as something very positive which will, hopefully, act as an antidote for some of the bad news which has emanated from this country in the past.<\/p><p>I do not know how other Members feel but when I watched the news on television and saw that many important global sites will be lit up with green lights, one's first reaction could be to say &quot;So what&quot;, which is very symbolic in itself, but we know that would not happen if there was not respect for this country and for our heritage.  People want to embrace it along with us.  In the past, we availed of these trips to have dialogue with business people and others and many good stories came out of that and many jobs came to Ireland as a result of that.  Maybe it is a sign of increased maturity as a people that we are now working as a team when it comes to this exercise of Government representatives travelling abroad.<\/p><p>Our wish is that the message sent from Ireland is also good news.  There are aspects of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations which do not do us any good.  Let us be fair about it.  By saying that in the House, I am not providing a news story to spread throughout the world as it is already well known.  All of us who have an opportunity to communicate a message to the broader public on what happens on St. Patrick's Day should make the point that one can enjoy oneself but that one does not have to do so in an anti-social way and in a way that impacts negatively on other people, in particular on older people.  If we all send that same message abroad, there is a very good possibility that when we come back after St. Patrick's Day and assess what has come out of the celebrations, we will all feel the better for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800010#J00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1392736500,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I support Senator Brennan's call for a debate with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resource, Deputy Rabbitte.

If we expect that people will get the service they currently get in the post offices in the banks, I do not think that will happen.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the late Patrick Scott who passed away last Friday morning.  Scott was defining figure in Irish art for more than 70 years and the timing of his death could not have been more poignant as it was on the eve of his retrospective exhibition in the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  The exhibition is entitled Patrick Scott: Image Space Light and it is a testament to his extraordinary career, life and achievements as an artist.  He will be sorely missed by all in the arts community and beyond.  However, his legacy will live on with his wonderful work.  <\/p><p>I concur with the comments on St. Patrick's Day.<\/p> <p>It would be in a way negligent of the Government not to send representatives to countries from a tourism and trade point of view.

Following weeks of requests, the chief executive officer's remuneration package was disclosed.  While it was good to get details of the CEO's salary, it was disappointing that the group swiftly shut the door by declaring that the total remuneration of all its top executives would not be made available until 2016.  This is not only about the Rehab Group or the CRC.  As the T&aacute;naiste said earlier, all section 39 charitable organisations should be fully open and transparent and should divulge the salaries of all their executives.  Almost 95% of charitable organisations engage in fund-raising and everything they do is above board.  They declare all the salaries they pay and it is only fair that all of them should be open and transparent.<\/p><p>I commend RTE on screening the programme, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, last night.  It was heart rending and beautiful.  It was relevant in the context of what has happened over the past few weeks regarding equality and what we want for our society.  The programme portrayed how people with an intellectual disability feel about love and romance and how they want to be treated as equals.  It was fitting because in recent weeks we have had all the breaking news about homophobia and so on and how people express themselves.

He first sought a debate with the Minister for Finance on local property taxation.  The Leader has sought to have the Minister come to the House for a number of debates and I am informed that his office is in discussions with the Department of Finance to have him in the House next week.  The date has not been confirmed yet but we hope to have further word tomorrow.  We will let the House know exactly when the debate will take place.<\/p><p>Second, the Senator queried the status of proposed legislation to deal with fair pricing in the horticultural and dairy sectors.  I can check where that is on the A list and when it is likely to be brought forward.  I am not aware of the positioning of it.<\/p><p>Third, he raised the serious issue of the sale of the Irish Nationwide Building Society mortgage book currently held by IBRC and security for the 13,000 households concerned.  I agree with the Senator and others who raised this that it is a serious matter.  Special liquidators have been appointed to oversee the liquidation of IBRC for the benefit of all creditors of the institution.  They are conducting a valuation and sales process regarding all IBRC's assets, including the residential mortgage portfolio.  The key issue is whether mortgage holders who were in arrears with the bank will continue to enjoy the protection of the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The sales process is not due to be completed until next month.  A number of colleagues, including the Senator, speculated about vulture funds but we do not know who will be the purchaser.  It could be NAMA and the Minister has advised that should the portfolios be sold to the agency, it is likely to apply best practice and no borrower will be in a worse position.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Finance is aware of the concerns of borrowers and has instructed his Department to examine the issue in consultation with the Central Bank with a view to bringing forward a solution.  He has also informed the D&aacute;il that the Department is aware of another mortgage book that has been purchased by an asset management group not covered by the CCMA, code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That group has met with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and has indicated it intends to adopt the CCMA to manage the acquired loans.  It believes that following the code is in the best interests for it and its customers, as well as forming part of its core strategy.  We do not yet know whether the purchaser will be NAMA, the National Asset Management Agency, or a private sector purchaser.  It would be expected, however, that it would abide by the code as it would likely be in its best interests in dealing with customers.  I am sorry I cannot provide any more information but that is as full an answer as I can give.  I agree, however, it is a matter of real concern. <\/p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan raised the matter of IBRC, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, and noting the progress made by NAMA in the sale of the loan portfolio.  He, along with Senators Noone, Mullins and Cullinane, raised the issue of Rehab&rsquo;s salary disclosures and, more generally, the need for regulation of charities.  These issues are emerging as a result of a Health Service Executive, HSE, audit of section 38 agencies, hospitals and disability agencies.  The audit is ongoing but the majority have confirmed they will co-operate with the compliant statement process.  There is an ongoing process which has been well-reported in the newspapers.  The HSE is confident there will be compliance.<\/p><p>Senator Zappone raised the issue of the &ldquo;Somebody to Love&rdquo; documentary screened on RTE last night and, in that context, asked for a debate on the need to review the application of criminal legislation in respect of sexual relationships for persons with intellectual disabilities.  It would be a good debate to have in the House.  The Law Reform Commission has made proposals in this area which could be included in the debate.

All of us also join with her in paying tribute to the ESB, Eircom and local authority staff who have worked so hard to restore power and services to people.  All Members express sympathy to the family of Mr. Michael O'Riordan, the Eircom worker, who was tragically killed restoring telephone services to households in Glengarriff in west Cork.  Senator Moloney also raised the issue of schools closing during the bad weather and how information in this regard was passed on to parents.  She might wish to raise this as a matter on the Adjournment with the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p><p>  Senator Mooney sought a debate on the issue of postmasters and postmistresses with the hand-over of social welfare payments from post offices to banks and, more generally, the move to e-commerce.  This issue was also raised by Senators Noone and Brennan.  Debates have been sought on banking and the Leader is trying to facilitate this.  In that context, we could also debate this issue and online banking.  Like many others, we have all been frustrated by the absence of real banking staff when one goes to a bank now.  Online banking, however, when right, can be very convenient including for those with mobility issues.<\/p><p>  Senator O&rsquo;Neill called for a debate on the issue of the beef industry and a crisis for beef farmers with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Minister will attend the House tomorrow for a debate on the greyhound industry.  We might ask him for a debate on the beef industry too.<\/p><p>  Senator Barrett inquired about a Green Paper on private health insurance.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, wrote in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times<\/i> on the imminent publication of the White Paper on universal health insurance.  Senator Barrett raised a slightly different issue, so he might want to communicate directly with the Minister for Health about the idea of a Green Paper on private health insurance.<\/p> <p>Certainly, a Government White Paper is imminent on the move to universal health insurance and the stages that are being taken towards delivering the single-tier health service.  The Minister has set out in today's newspaper very clear steps by which progress will be made on universal health insurance.  With regard to the position of private health insurance in the meantime, the Government has clearly stated its commitment to keeping health insurance affordable for as many people as possible.  There has, as we all know, been a drop in the number of people with private health insurance but, in international terms, Ireland continues to retain a high level of voluntary private health insurance.  The issue is trying to keep that affordable while we move towards the universal health insurance system.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins called for a debate on the beef industry and supported Senator Paul Coghlan on the section 38 and section 39 agencies.  He also complimented the T&aacute;naiste and the Government on the launch of the St. Patrick's Day programme and welcomed the fact so many visits will be made by our Ministers.  I know there will be an emphasis on North America this year.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; also raised this issue, as did Senator Noone.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; put it very fairly when he said there is much less cynicism about the story of the visits by Ministers.  I believe we all now accept how important these visits are and the great economic and social benefit, and the benefit to the image of Ireland, these visits bring.  We would all very much support that.  There are somewhat fewer visits to Britain, with one to Britain and Scotland - or England and Scotland, I should say - by Ministers.

It is a national festival that is taking place in the capital city and, of course, there will be lots of parades and other events taking place around the country.<\/p><p>The answer to concerns people have raised about the way in which the parade and the other festivities are run is not to close down funfairs or family-friendly activities but to ensure that we control and regulate anti-social behaviour.  To my mind, it is largely the excessive consumption of alcohol which has been real cause of criticism in the past, and that is not the fault of the St. Patrick's Day festival organisers.  I believe we will see a really excellent programme launched this Thursday and I look forward to that, as I am sure others do.<\/p><p>Senator Noone raised the issue of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations and also paid tribute to the late Patrick Scott.

The number of fatalities on our roads up to yesterday was 21, which is an increase on the 15 fatalities in the same period in 2012 and a decrease on the 27 fatalities last year.  I am not sure how this year is shaping up in that regard but it is a year in which the Minister will have our full support in addressing this major problem, particularly in terms of the deaths of young men.  Anything we can do to assist the Minister and his officials in achieving their goal will be forthcoming from this side.  <\/p><p>  This amendment deals with penalties and seeks amendment of section 38(1) of the 1961 Act which states: &quot;A person shall not drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place unless he holds a driving licence for the time being&quot;.<\/p> <p>The kinds of penalties mentioned in the following page are a fine not exceeding &pound;100 in lieu of punishment mentioned in section 102 of the Act.  Section 102 refers to fines of &pound;20 and &pound;50, and a term of imprisonment.  On Committee Stage, I expressed concern that the penalty for driving without a driving licence seemed inadequate for dealing with the problems the Minister is confronting.  The value of a pound in 1961 is now down to a little more than 5% of the pound or the euro - the CSO presents it in both forms.<\/p><p>We discussed some numbers, which indicated there was a considerable amount of driving without driving licences.  The Minister clarified the point and it pertains to amendment No. 2.  If the value of money has declined by a factor of 20 and there are such fines on the Statute Book, they are not acting as a deterrent.  I presume we are just as anxious not to have dangerous driving and driving without a licence in this time as was the case back in 1961.<\/p><p>Regarding the stress on the fine, I have some qualms about disqualification.  If I go into somebody's shop and engage in a crime there, people do not regard being disqualified from visiting the shop as being an appropriate penalty - it is necessary to do something else.  Is disqualification sufficient and are these fines too low?  The fine we have proposed here is less in real terms than the Minister's predecessors set back in 1961.  While I know the Minister will revise this legislation later in the year, it raises a general question as to what we do when inflation, as in this case, dramatically erodes the fines set by the Parliament.  Even over such a relatively short period, that fine seems to have been seriously eroded.<\/p><p>Those were the points I put to the Minister.  While I can appreciate why disqualification happens in this case, it is not normally considered a deterrent in itself.  Should there be a fine attached?  Has the value of the fines not deteriorated by 19 units out of 20 as a result of inflation since those fines were written into the legislation in 1961?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800017#R00300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392739500,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.

I do not believe it represents a threat to have such a fine.  People who drive without a licence deserve a fine and probably deserve disqualification.  The objective is clearly safety on the roads and that objective will not be achieved if people continue to drive without a licence.  I believe this is necessary and I urge the Minister to consider it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800018#S00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1392739500,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I take it the amendment is a proposed change to the penalties for driving without a licence.  Section 38(1) of the principal Act makes it an offence to drive unlicensed.  Under the law as it stands, the penalty for unlicensed drivers is split into two categories as set out in section 38(2) of the principal Act.  If a person had a licence that expired in the previous 12 months, the maximum penalty is a fine of &euro;1,000 and in any other case the maximum penalty is a fine of &euro;2,000.  Section 38(5), into which the amendment proposes to add a new penalty, currently contains penalties for driving unlicensed in specific circumstances, such as where the driver has been disqualified from driving or penalties for the owner of a vehicle where the owner has hired an unlicensed person to drive.<\/p><p>The amendment, if introduced, would add a new penalty structure for driving without a licence, without apparently removing the existing penalty as set out in section 38(2).  It would ignore the split between the different categories of people unlicensed for less than and more than one year, and proposes a maximum penalty in all cases of &euro;1,000 or six months in prison.<\/p> <p>The maximum fine at the moment is &euro;2,000.<\/p><p>If we wanted to make the changes proposed, we would need to redraft this amendment.  The current penalties are set out in section 38(2) of the principal Act, with additional penalties for specific cases in section 38(5).  This amendment would add a new generic penalty for driving unlicensed without removing the existing penalty in section 38(2).  Such an amendment should, properly speaking, substitute a new section 38(2).  As it stands, the proposed amendment would leave two different sets of penalties in section 38.<\/p><p>However, that is a minor matter.  The issue raised by the Senators is important.  Driving without a licence is a serious offence, which makes a mockery of all the legislative changes designed to improve driver training and set higher standards for obtaining a licence in the first place.  It should, therefore, attract an appropriate penalty.<\/p><p>From a policy perspective, there are two points at issue with the amendment.  The first is whether we should retain the existing distinction between unlicensed drivers who have held a licence within the past year and other unlicensed drivers.  I am open to being convinced on this point.  If someone had been a licensed driver until recently, it means that he cannot have been driving unlicensed for long.  Where the person's licence is only a couple of weeks out of date it may even be that he forgot to renew it, an innocent mistake, perhaps.  Some allowance probably should be made for recent versus long-term unlicensed status.  Whether a year is too long a period is a question open to debate and discussion.<\/p><p>The other question relates to the appropriate level of penalties.  Senator Barrett has proposed halving the maximum fine available.  It is currently &euro;2,000 for people caught driving after being more than a year unlicensed.  At the same time, he proposes adding the option of up to six months imprisonment.  We should always be careful about providing for custodial sentences.  Section 38 currently provides for a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and up to six months in prison for people driving unlicensed while disqualified, when they should have a certificate of competency or a medical fitness certificate or where they hired an unlicensed driver.  Under the new proposal we would be associating a maximum fine of &euro;1,000 with a six month sentence, something which I believe would fail the proportionality test.<\/p><p>I accept that unlicensed driving is a serious matter and should be thoroughly discouraged.  We should remember, however, that the penalties already present in section 38, which include fines of up to &euro;5,000 and up to six months in prison in the presence of certain aggravating circumstances, are related to driving unlicensed alone.  We should bear in mind that many cases of unlicensed driving come to light following an incident of some kind.  In such cases, where the penalty for the incident is more severe than that under section 38, generally there will be prosecutions relating to the incident rather than the unlicensed driving itself.  In sum, the current graded penalty structure is appropriate and therefore I call on Senator Barrett to withdraw the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800018#S00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392739800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1392739800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote><br \/>In page 7, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:<br \/>&ldquo;<b>7.<\/b> The Minister shall require the Road Safety Authority to publish the breakdown of penalty points by licence type to show separately drivers with full licences, learner permits, no licence, licences from outside the jurisdiction, non-appearance in Court and unmatched penalty points from previous years.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>This arose from an analysis of penalty points by the Road Safety Authority which we discussed the last day.

In the course of the proceedings the last day the Minister put the correct numbers into the record.  The purpose of the amendment is that the data should inform to the degree that the Minister's statement did.  The category of people with no licences in the documents circulated to us comprises the category which I took from the Minister's speech to us on Committee Stage.  He said:<blockquote>That is something we must deal with because that number will increase every year as they continue to accumulate.<br \/><br \/>  The figures we have indicate that approximately 12.5% of events in any one year cannot be matched.

It would give us better data from which to inform policy, because what appeared in the RSA data, given to the Library and Research Service here, had people with no licence accounting for 40.1% of the penalty points, and the Minister broke it down into categories which I find much more useful and much more valuable to us when trying to frame policy to respond to these situations.

While I appreciate the importance of the kinds of figures to which the Senator refers, I do not believe that Acts of the Oireachtas are the appropriate place for such a level of detail.  We already have a provision in the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 &ndash; the Act which established the RSA &ndash; relating to statistics.  Section 8 of that Act empowers the Minister of the day to \"direct the Authority to collect, compile, prepare, publish or distribute to such persons (including the Minister) such information and statistics relating to road safety and the functions of the Authority, as the Minister considers appropriate\".  The same section also gives the RSA the power to \"require a person who holds records relating to road safety or matters relating to the functions of the Authority, to give to the Authority such information and statistics\" in order for the authority to carry out its functions.<\/p><p>I think it would out of line with the character of the legislation to require the RSA in primary legislation to publish one particular type of statistic out of all the data it might conceivably collect.  It would also imply that there was something exceptional about these particular statistics which set them apart from all other information published by the RSA, such as statistics on road deaths and serious injuries.  Besides, if we went down this road and moved from general RSA responsibilities for statistics to specifying what statistics to publish, I can fairly safely predict that it will become an open-ended matter of amending legislation to add the kind of detail which is really not appropriate to primary legislation.<\/p><p>The power already exists for a Minister to direct the RSA to do what the amendment asks.  I am willing to consider directing the RSA to do this.  The debate we had the last day in the House caused me to go and look for that information myself, and I welcome the fact it was brought up in the debate, but I would first like to consider it a little more.  In any case, I would prefer to do it on an administrative basis, by order of the Minister from time to time, because the kind of statistics we want published or collected will change quite a lot from time to time, and I think that would be a much better way to do it than putting it in primary legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800020#U00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1392740400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

Having the kind of information the Minister is considering would be of value to us.  As to whether this amendment is the way to do it, I accept his judgment as he is closer to the administrative system than Senator Quinn or I, but it would be a useful starting point to get beyond the statistic that they have no licence and get the means by which we can tackle this problem.

We have made various proposals in the amendment.  Since our discussion on Committee Stage, I have become more impressed by what the technology can do, and impressed by it as a low cost method of doing things.  We got evidence of more of this technology being put into cars although the price of cars was falling at the same time.  It appears that to implement this technology in vehicles would provide big bonuses on the safety side and does not involve the taxpayer in any cost, which would be good news to our friend and colleague, the Minister for Finance.  It can be incorporated within a system whereby the price of vehicles incorporating these technologies has been falling.  According to the CSO, there has been a slight decrease in car prices overall and the cars are incorporating more of these safety features.  <\/p><p>  We got in touch with Matthews bus company which installed the alcohol locks.  The estimated cost of installing a lock on a coach costing &euro;270,000 was about &euro;1,200 and the installers were fairly sure that if it was more widely used, the cost could be brought down to about &euro;800.  That seems to be a win-win.  Presumably if we had an astute insurance industry it would reward the companies which installed those alcohol locks, which involves an insignificant increase in the cost of the vehicle, with a reduction in their insurance costs.  When we got into this further we found pedestrian air bags had been added to cars for which prices are declining, as had lane-keeping aids to stop people drifting out of lanes - the Volvo researchers indicate that about a third of crashes are caused by people veering between lanes.  Other developments include pedestrian detection systems which will stop the vehicle, systems to enhance blind spot information, cross-traffic alerts, a city safety system where if the car in front stops the car coming behind will stop automatically, an auto detection system and an intelligence speed adaptation unit.<\/p><p>  Since discussing the issue on Committee Stage I do not know if I have been converted to it, but we have calculated that the alcohol lock added 0.44% to the cost of the vehicles concerned.  We think there is an avenue to be pursued here.  We admire what the Road Safety Authority has been doing in terms of trying to influence driver behaviour and improving the testing.  The testing of vehicles is the next stage.  It could take a leaf out of the policies of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, of Ireland promoting itself as a smart and a high-tech economy.  This technology exists so can we move towards having it implemented here?  We pushed out the dates somewhat from the previous day's discussion about when we would seek to have this technology adopted.<\/p> <p>It is low cost and has great possibilities.  It may be the next stage where we can get the kind of improvements that we all seek in this area.<\/p><p>To develop the subject further, we have described the various technologies and subsection (6), in addition to the ones that I have read out, states: &quot;The Minister shall convene a body expert in science and technology to report to the Oireachtas on contribution to road safety from the application of science and technology to the enhanced driver and vehicle performance&quot;.  Generally, we are impressed by the possibilities.  The intelligent vehicle may be the next step forward in dealing with problems such as lapses in concentration, people falling asleep and single vehicle accidents.  With regards to knocking down pedestrians, there seems to be technology to deal with the problem.  Perhaps one of the bodies that already advises the Government on technology would be able to assist in the matter.<\/p><p>Safety legislation can boost the process.  For example, the alcolock provision seems to cost remarkably little.  Again, based on the discussion that we had on the last occasion when mention was made of the one bus company that installs these safety features, I put the amendment before the House.  It seems that the next stage in terms of a big breakthrough in road safety that we all seek could be happening now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800021#V00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392741600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I again second Senator Barrett's amendment.

I am speaking of an era before the Minister's time so he would not know about such things.  It made me feel very old when I realised that so many people do not remember such a time.  When I spoke to my child we talked about how great an advance it was to have a flashing light to indicate which way one wanted to travel.  Indicators, in retrospect, were a minor technological development but what a good job they did and the technology greatly improved safety.<\/p><p>The most important point made by Senator Barrett was that the investment is likely to be accepted by insurance companies as an incentive.  If they can manage to encourage various developments in safety technology then it will pay them, the car owner and the manufacturer to install such technology.  The provision is worthwhile, will save lives and also has the ability to improve the situation, with encouragement by the Minister and the State.

Since we were here last year I have seen interlocking in operation.  It happened when I was on a Matthews bus to launch the CTCC roadshow or trade show that will take place later in the year.  I saw the device on that occasion and it is very simple and straightforward.  I was not asked to test it but I can assure Senators that I had not been drinking on that day and would have passed.<\/p><p>A few points were raised.  The amendment proposes to make alcohol interlocks compulsory on vehicles on a phased basis.  It was also proposed on Committee Stage so I do not propose to restate all of the points that I made then and shall confine myself to the key issues.<\/p><p>We all agree about the seriousness of intoxicated driving.  There have been many changes in the law in recent years that reflect this serious offence and strengthen the provisions available for dealing with same.  We have, thankfully, seen a significant culture change in attitudes to drink driving which has now become widely recognised for the danger it is and is no longer socially tolerated in the way that it was.  The Bill includes further measures in the area of intoxication impairment testing and testing of incapacitated drivers for intoxicants.<\/p><p>The use of alcohol interlocks tends to be considered internationally in terms of sentencing rather than as a universal prophylactic or preventative measure.  Both the Road Safety Authority and my Department have considered them in this context.  The installation and monitoring of alcolocks would be costly.  The RSA is planning to undertake a cost-benefit analysis on their use in sentencing during 2014 and I make a commitment to Senators that the analysis will be done.  I believe that the future of alcohol interlocks will be found in the area of sentencing rather than general application.<\/p> <p>For example, if somebody is barred from driving for being over the alcohol limit or gets penalty points for that purpose, it would be open to the courts to require that he or she has an interlock when he or she resumes driving.  It is also worth bearing in mind that there are many types of alcolocks on the market and we would have to be clear about the technical specifications before considering imposing their use either on offenders or all drivers.  We need a bit of time to get it right.  <\/p><p>In the next Bill - the autumn-winter Bill - I propose to give the power to the courts to require that somebody has an interlock installed in his or her vehicle under particular circumstances.  I will also consider the possibility of extending it to all buses, given that they carry a large number of passengers, and trucks, which can cause catastrophic road accidents.  I am sceptical as to whether it should be a general requirement for all vehicles.  I am really not sure if that is necessary or if the evidence stacks up to benefit that move.  <\/p><p>It is an evolving technology and it is still relatively new.  It is only being used by a small number of transport operators.  I am not aware of if being used in a single vehicle.  We do not really know what sort of issues might arise and I believe it is premature to prescribe it in legislation.  Pursuant to the debate here and the road strategy, which was adopted by the Government some months ago, the Road Safety Authority will do that cost-benefit analysis in 2014 with a view to taking the first steps to including it as a sentencing option in the next Bill.<\/p><p>I am with the Senators in the sense that I believe it may well be the next quantum shift in terms of technology and making our roads safer but I do not believe now is the time to impose it across the entire fleet.  We at least need the time to try it out in a few other instances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800022#W00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392742200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I suppose I have a difference of emphasis in that I would not see it as a punitive measure but rather as a preventative one and that people should embrace the technology enthusiastically in that regard.  I was trying to think of an analogy.  Only when one first falls off a bike does one buy a bike with safety features.  If this technology is available and it does not add to the cost of vehicles, it might change the way this House and society approaches this.  These are sensible things one does.  One does not wait to have a conviction to be told that part of one's penalty is to adopt new technology.  That is a point of emphasis.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister's openness to this as possibly the next great leap forward in terms of safety.  The purpose of the amendments was to open up that possibility and complement everything that has been accomplished in reducing the figure from 600 plus to the 190 figure last year.  The question is about what should be in the next strategy.<\/p><p>We praise the Ministers travelling abroad on 17 March and say Ireland is a hi-tech society and a great place for start-ups and so on, but let us bring that mentality into what we are doing here.

The NRA will publish annually an analysis of collisions in which the safety of road infrastructure was a contributory cause.&quot;.<\/blockquote>This also arises from a point made by the Minister on Committee Stage.  Up to 6% of accidents can be traced back to road factors and they have contributed to the deaths of 12 people in recent years.  This must be considered in this context.  As he said the last day, responsibility for that aspect of safety rests with the NRA.  Technology is available to take measurements regarding these factors.  One calculates the polished stone value, PSV, of roads, which relates to a car's liability to skid.  Design faults in roads can also be attributed to the 6% of accidents believed to be caused by roads.  The NRA annual report and accounts for 2012 says that as it took on these duties, it produced a document, Road Safety Management Procedures for National Roads in Ireland, which was submitted to the EU in May 2012.  The report reads: &quot;It is anticipated that the first round of road safety inspections, in compliance with the directive, will be completed by the end of 2013.&quot;  We would like to bring that report forward to tackle the cases where roads are judged to be the cause of an accident.<\/p><p>  The amendment reads:<blockquote>The Authority may issue a direction to a road authority, being a local authority, and shall make regulations for the carrying out of road safety impact assessments, road safety audits, safety rankings of the road network, safety inspections, repairs and the conduct of road works and the impact of local authority planning on national roads, and approach roads and their adjacent areas.

The reference in the NRA report covers approximately one page in a 51 page document.<\/p><p>  If roads are a contributory factor in 6% of accidents, that must be investigated.  I gather there is a fear among engineers that if they report on this, they will be sued by people claiming it was the road's fault and not theirs and so on.  However, we are trying to combat a major problem and we took a sample of the available information.  The first low cost remedial measures programme was carried out in 1994-95 and the publication date was 2001.  The second programme was carried out between 1996 and 1997 and the publication date was 2005 while programmes nine to 11, inclusive, were carried between 2004 and 2006 and they were published in August 2012.  The programme of safety measures implemented between 2002 and 2005 was published in June 2010.  I acknowledge measures were taken and the safety audit was completed at the end of 2013, as the annual report says, but we must bring this aspect of road safety up front in our discussion on how we address it.<\/p><p>  We mentioned technology when discussing the previous amendment.  Reporting on the condition of roads will become more important in the future and that was the purpose of that amendment.<\/p> <p>If the first round of road safety inspections was completed by the end of 2013, it should be published by now, so we will know where to put investment.  It would also allow road users to contribute to rectify problems they have noticed.

Given that the MCIB and the air accident investigation unit already exist in my Department, there is a fair amount of competence and skill in place as to how this unit might do its work.  I would envisage it would be a similar process to the MCIB and air accident investigations in that an investigation would be carried out, a report written up and interested parties, such as families of people killed in a collision, would see the report first.  It would then go to the Minister who would publish it.  It could take two or three years but, unfortunately, that is the nature of this process.<\/p> <p>As I told the D&aacute;il before coming here today, the air accident investigation unit of my Department has made 11 recommendations to different bodies, not just the Spanish authorities but also the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, the European Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA.  I believe there is a lot to be learned from the crash that occurred in Cork, given there were a lot of unusual circumstances around it, particularly this whole concept of a virtual airline that does not actually exist in the way that we understand an airline to exist but is a kind of ticket selling system with everything outsourced to somebody else.  There are other issues, of course, in terms of training, pilot experience, flight time and so on, so there is a lot to be learned from this investigation.<\/p><p>What is useful about it is that the law is behind us on this one in that it is required under the law that all of the agencies that have had recommendations made to them must respond within 90 days.  Therefore, it is not that these things end up on a shelf.  Eleven recommendations were made to four or five different bodies and they must, by law, respond within 90 days.  The air accident investigation unit will monitor the progress of the implementation of those recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800025#Z00500","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392743100,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1392743100,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<blockquote><br \/>In page 19, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:<br \/><b>&ldquo;23.<\/b> Section 10 of the Act of 2010 is amended by substituting for subsection (7)(a) the following:(7) (a) The Minister for Justice and Law Reform may by an agreement in writing entered into with any person, upon such terms and conditions as may be specified in the agreement, which shall include a condition to the effect that the determination of the locations where equipment is to be operated shall be a function of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not below the rank of Sergeant, provide for the authorisation of that or other persons for the purposes of subsection (2), and the performance by those authorised persons of any function, which shall be specified in the agreement, relating to the prima facie proof if a constituent of an offence including the provision, maintenance and operation of equipment and the development, production and viewing of records produced by that equipment and the production of measurements or other indications from which a constituent of an offence can be inferred.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>This amendment has been resubmitted because we put down the wrong section, as the Minister pointed out to us on the last occasion.  We had proposed to change section 87 whereas it should have been section 10.<\/p><p>  We are trying to extend the power to have alcohol testing stations set up from a very small number of garda&iacute; of the rank of inspector or above, which is about 2% of the Garda force, to include those of the rank of sergeant and above, which would be some 14% of the Garda force.  The view given by the Minister on Committee Stage was: &quot;Given the critical contribution that the evidence gathered at checkpoints would have in any consequent court hearings, it was considered the decision as to the location of checkpoints should be taken at a relatively senior level in the Garda.&quot;  My worry is that even if the Minister accepts our amendment and that power is extended to sergeants, it is still only some 14% of the force.  This leaves an awful lot of garda&iacute; outside the management of checkpoints, which seems strange.  Of course, with regard to evidence, it is the garda&iacute; who run the checkpoints who have to give the evidence, whereas, as I understand it, the inspector simply signs a form.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister for correcting the number of the section on the last occasion.  Given the purpose of this Garda force of 13,000, to add 1,900 sergeants to the under 500 people who have this power at present to mount checkpoints would achieve greater support within the Garda force to assist in what is a vital national task, namely, to clamp down on drink driving.  Giving people more responsibility to participate in this is, in general, a good idea.  I have to say I never regarded a sergeant as a minor member of the guards who should not be given this responsibility.  In any case, that was the point we wanted to make.  It is important that we involve all members of the highly esteemed police force as far as possible in assisting in setting up those alcohol testing points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800026#AA00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1392743100,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.

His statements on the issue have been very helpful to date.  Our debate today indicates that much more needs to be said and done so that in the first place, homophobia will some day be wiped out of Irish society.  I know there has been much debate on how we define homophobia.  I have the European Parliament's definition of homophobia and ask why would we not accept this definition, which is a wide continuum.  Colm O'Gorman first pointed it out to us recently.  Homophobia is defined as an irrational fear of and aversion to homosexuality manifesting itself in different forms such as hate speech to discrimination and violation of the principle of equality and unjustified and unreasonable limitation of rights.  Why would we not have that wide understanding and definition of homophobia?  More needs to be said and done to wipe that out of Irish culture and society.  <\/p><p>  In the second place, which is perhaps what we are here for today, political leadership can ensure that debate on marriage equality is conducted in a fair, open and impartial manner.  Impartial means without prejudice and that raises the bar very high.  Rory O'Neill has done a great service to our country and wider global LGBT and other human rights movements when exercising his absolute and unrestricted right to hold opinions without interference.  This is a right guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Ireland has committed itself to uphold.  When he further exercised his human right to freedom of expression, which is also in the covenant, both on &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; and on the stage of the Abbey Theatre, his fundamental noble call to all of us was to eradicate our prejudices and change oppressive social, legal, religious and cultural systems.  <\/p><p>  Silencing voices against homophobia violates human rights, as barrister Brian Barrington pointed out.  Why is this the case?  It boils down to two words - human dignity.  No doubt, all sides of this House agree with the first lines of the preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that &quot;recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world&quot;.  The genuine experience of dignity is a quintessential ingredient for the empowerment of every human to lead the life they wish to choose.  I paraphrase words of the great philosopher and economist Amartya Sen in his pioneering work <i>Development as Freedom<\/i>.  Professor Sen uses this concept of all humans living the life they wish to choose as not only integral to eradicating world poverty but also as being core to the rights of minorities.  A nation's development does not happen unless all of its people are free.  <\/p><p>  Martin Luther King Junior once said, &quot;Whenever men and women straighten their backs up, they are going somewhere, because a man can't ride your back unless it is bent&quot;.  As a young lesbian, I did not always carry a genuine experience of human dignity.  Indeed, I often felt shame - shame for my feelings, shame for my actions and shame for who I was discovering myself to be.  I wonder now whether that is a similar feeling of shame to those in this country who are out of work, those who have left school early, those in prison, those who beg on our streets or to our young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.  What I do know is that shame does bend your back and that shame is never generated from within.  It develops as others who are not like you or possess more resources or abilities than you suspect that your difference is deviant.  It also develops when you run up against laws and systems fashioned by religious and State leaders that keep you outside the mainstream of social, cultural and economic opportunities and institutions or human worth or worthiness.  Martha Nussbaum, who is one of the foremost philosopher-lawyers of our time, calls it the politics of disgust.  <\/p><p>  International human rights standards value free speech over being spoken of offensively.  International human rights law sets a high bar before speech can be considered to be of such a degree of offensiveness that the State must prohibit it.<\/p> <p>The more serious the issue in public debate, the higher the bar.<\/p><p>The UN Human Rights Committee states: &quot;The mere fact that forms of expression are considered to be insulting to a public figure is not sufficient to justify the imposition of penalties&quot;.  When reflecting on or interpreting another part of the covenant on civil and political rights that asserts we must respect the reputations of others, the committee states that this requirement should never be invoked as justification for the muzzling of any advocacy of human rights.<\/p><p>I feel a chill, as many do.  As such, we need a thaw.  I welcome the steps that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources outlined today and I look forward to what he will say in this debate.  I will identify a number of additional measures that the Government could enact to ensure that our Republic genuinely values freedom and tolerance.  This is not an exhaustive or sequential list.<\/p><p>RTE needs to appear before the communications committee to outline its approach to libel complaints.  Subsequently, it should issue and disseminate guidelines regarding freedom of expression and defamation to everyone appearing on our national airwaves.  This would be a prime way for the State broadcaster to fulfil its public service role.  The process of devising such guidelines would undoubtedly go a long way towards assessing whether our laws can adequately protect the human right to free speech.  It would also be useful for our politicians to engage with RTE on what is required in such guidelines.  I agree with the Minister's statement in the D&aacute;il, in that it is not desirable for the committee to become embroiled in the management of particular claims.<\/p><p>We also need a freedom of expression audit of the broadcasting and defamation Acts.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will consider making amendments to the Broadcasting Act.  This would be constructive.  Like other commentators, I am uncertain as to whether amending section 39 of that Act, which refers to broadcasting something that can reasonably be regarded as causing offence, to instead refer to something that avoids causing undue offence will make much difference.  The degree of harm that &quot;undue&quot; refers to is already part of the test of reasonableness in a later section of the Act.  Freedom of expression is the norm and any restriction on it should be the exception.  While the Defamation Act is not under the Minister's remit, it could be reviewed.  Although it includes a defence of honest opinion for the one accused, this defence may require too strong a factual threshold for opinions.<\/p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, though problematically not fully established, would be best placed to do this work.  If we had a designated human rights committee, it would be the best parliamentary place to receive such work.<\/p><p>We also need policies, laws and resources to ensure that our schools are homophobia-free zones.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has committed to this.  I, for one, stand up against homophobic bullying.  An important campaign is being run by BeLongTo, supported by other groups, for example, Marriage Equality, etc.  However, more needs to be done.  Getting rid of section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act would be a significant catalyst to usher in a new era of freedom in our schools.<\/p><p>I stand here as a woman married to another woman, Ms Ann Louise Gilligan.  I have travelled beyond the valley of shame and fear because her forever love beckoned.  This is what marriage equality means.  This is why we must get this right.  It is in our power to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800028#FF00200","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392744600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I am honoured to second the motion and follow Senator Zappone's powerful speech proposing it.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House.  I am delighted that he is present to respond to our contributions.  I also welcome members of the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, Marriage Equality and others in the Visitors Gallery.  In particular, I acknowledge Ms Gilligan, Senator Zappone's wife.<\/p><p>This motion covers a number of issues.  I commend Senator Zappone on framing it so carefully.  The motion recognises the importance of having a public debate on free speech, homophobia and the public service role of the State broadcaster and explores the issues in the context of the forthcoming referendum on marriage equality.  The motion has strong cross-party support arising from the recent events to which the Senator referred.  A number of us have already been active on this issue.  Senator Power raised the events concerning Rory O'Neill, his speech on the Abbey Theatre's stage and his earlier interview on Mr. Brendan O'Connor's &quot;Saturday Night Show&quot;.  Senator Power was the first to raise the matter in Leinster House.  She and I attended the LGBT Noise event some weeks ago in support of Rory O'Neill and at which Senator Norris spoke powerfully.  Before this motion, there has been a good deal of context.<\/p><p>As everyone is aware, Rory O'Neill appeared on the &quot;Saturday Night Show&quot; on Saturday, 11 January.  Subsequent to his appearance, his remarks about people - I have the transcript - being horrible and mean to gays and his description of his direct experience of people, RTE made a settlement to the Iona Institute and other individuals, the speed and scale of which shocked people.  This was one of those events that have a slow momentum.  What surprised people is the fact that legal advice to RTE had trumped the editorial judgment of the broadcaster and any consideration of its obligations as a public service broadcaster under the Broadcasting Act, particularly section 25.  It also seems as if there was inadequate consideration of running a defence of honest opinion, to which Senator Zappone referred, under section 20 of the Defamation Act.  Regardless of whether one agrees with Rory O'Neill's use of the term &quot;homophobia&quot;, he was clearly entitled to describe his own experience of homophobia.  In his speech at the Abbey Theatre on 1 February, he eloquently described his experience of homophobia, discrimination and prejudice.  In doing so, he has done the State a great service.<\/p><p>As Senator Zappone stated, the definition of &quot;homophobia&quot; has changed.  It certainly is not confined to the Oxford dictionary definition, as other dictionaries, such as the Marian dictionary, describe it in much broader terms as discrimination against persons on the basis of their sexuality.  The EU's definition has also broadened our understanding of the term &quot;homophobia&quot; to encompass a range of negative attitudes and discrimination towards gay people.  The barrister, Mr. Brian Barrington, has made that point powerfully.<\/p><p>In the D&aacute;il, our colleagues Deputies Lyons and Buttimer powerfully named their experiences of discrimination and prejudice following the outcry about RTE's decision.  Through the work undertaken by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, on tackling homophobic bullying in schools, we know that it remains a terrible experience for many young people.  BeLongTo and other groups have highlighted this issue.<\/p><p>A sequence of events has transpired since 11 January, the positive consequence of which is that society is generally much more aware of LGBT individuals' experience of discrimination, prejudice and homophobia.  On stage, Panty described the experience of checking one self in public spaces.  According to surveys, individuals in same-sex relationships are fearful of holding hands in public because of the discrimination or prejudice they may encounter.  It is positive that these experiences have been highlighted.  It would be negative if people were to believe that they could close down debates about marriage equality by lawyering up, particularly where people have used robust terms like &quot;Feminazis&quot; in debates.  I do not like that term.  It has been used against me, but I will certainly not sue anyone over it.<\/p><p>As the motion points out, it is important that the debate on marriage equality be conducted in a fair, open and impartial manner.  Not for one moment does anyone believe that everyone who opposes marriage equality is homophobic.<\/p> <p>However, campaigning against it, actively seeking to continue discrimination against gay people and seeking to prevent equal recognition of their relationship, that amounts to homophobia.<\/p><p> A number of things need to be done to ensure a debate is conducted in a fair, open and impartial manner.  It is important that RTE appears before the communications committee, and I understand that its representatives are doing so.  Senator Zappone has spoken about guidelines, and she is right to welcome the Minister's proposal to amend section 39(1)(<i>d<\/i>) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 to ensure that simply causing offence is not enough, and that it must be undue offence of some kind.  We need to look at the language there.  It would be useful to review an amendment to the Defamation Act 2009.  I am not sure whether the Act itself was the problem or the interpretation of the Act in this instance.  Finally, we need to bring forward legislation amending section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 to counter the real fear of prejudice and discrimination that gay teachers, in particular, continue to experience on a daily basis.  We have tried to do that in the Seanad.  Senator Power and I have introduced a Bill which passed Second Stage this time last year, and I am actively working with the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure that we can move that Bill forward and have legislation in place that will amend section 37.<\/p><p> We had a debate last night in my local Dublin Bay South Labour Party organisation with Brian Sheehan from GLEN, where we spoke about the real experience of homophobia that young people suffer every day at school.  That must be a key priority for any Government strategy on tackling homophobia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800029#GG00200","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392745200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate.  As Senator Bacik pointed out, in the aftermath of the revelations of RTE's settlement last month with John Waters, Breda O'Brien and members of the Iona Institute, I called for the Minister to come before the House to discuss this issue.  I did so for several reasons.  First, I was horrified by the way that Rory O'Neill's interview had been censored.  Second, I was outraged that licence fee money had been paid over with such haste, and in circumstances where many barristers had argued convincingly that RTE could have successfully defended any threatened legal action.  Third, I was deeply concerned about the precedent that RTE's response could set for future public debate not just on issues related to equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people, but also on wide range of issues of public importance.  I felt strongly that it was incumbent on the Minister to make sure that this decision does not set a dangerous precedent for public speech in this country.<\/p><p>  Freedom of speech is absolutely essential to democracy.  It is one of the key things that distinguishes us from oppressive states like Russia.  As a democrat, I defend the rights of others to express freely their views on every issue, even if I find their comments offensive.  Public debate should always be open and robust.  People should hear all views and then be free to make up their own minds on who they agree with.<\/p><p>  I have no doubt that the two individuals named on &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; were offended by the comments made about them, but both of these individuals are high profile journalists who frequently write things that others find offensive.  They jealously guard their own freedom of speech, and rightly so, yet as soon as someone criticised them and pointed out the impact, influence and power that their comments have had on public debate and on other people, they issue legal threats against the individual concerned and the State broadcaster.  In my view, it was particularly inappropriate for journalists to take such a course of action.  They were offered a right of reply by RTE and could have taken up the opportunity either to speak on &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; the following week, or to use their own newspaper columns to outline their views.  Instead, they opted for censorship and ensured that RTE paid &euro;85,000 worth of licence fee money from every person in this country to themselves and to people associated with the Iona Institute.<\/p><p>  In agreeing to settle, RTE betrayed its responsibility as a public service broadcaster to ensure that both sides of the debate are heard on issues of public importance.  Several barristers have argued convincingly that RTE could have won any threatened legal action on the grounds of the honest opinion defence to defamation.  That defence is set out in the 2009 Act and it applies to statements of opinion referring to matters of public interest, where the defendant can prove that the opinion was honestly held, and where facts on which the opinion is based are stated or otherwise widely known, or the facts on which it is based are true or covered by privilege.  Once these criteria are met, the opinion can be expressed in very unpleasant terms.  It is an opinion.  It was clear from the show that it was Rory O'Neill's honest opinion that the individuals to whom he referred were homophobic.  The Minister or I might disagree with that, and other people in the room might disagree with that, but it was his opinion and our laws defend the right of people to put forward their honest opinions.  Rory O'Neill made it clear on the show that the definition of the word &quot;homophobic&quot; that he was using included not just irrational fear and hatred of gay people, but also discrimination and prejudice based on sexual orientation.  While people might argue that the word &quot;homophobic&quot; conjures up impressions of extreme behaviour, as was pointed out by Rory O'Neill on the show, the actual definition that is increasingly accepted covers a spectrum of behaviour, from the subtle to the extreme.  Even taking the most restrictive interpretation of the word, I do not see how anyone could argue that the following comment by John Waters in a newspaper interview was not homophobic.<blockquote>This is really a kind of satire on marriage which is being conducted by the gay lobby.  It is not that they want to get married; they want to destroy the institution of marriage because they are envious of it.<\/blockquote>How anybody could argue that such a view is not based on irrational fear is beyond me.  It was right that it was called out as such.<\/p><p>  Everybody has a responsibility in public debate to conduct themselves in a responsible way, but this cannot mean that people are prohibited from giving their honest opinions on the hurt that they feel about arguments that other people have made in the public debate.  It is my view that RTE's response was inappropriate, but I think it is now time to move on from arguing over the meaning of the word &quot;homophobia&quot;, and focus instead on the discrimination that LGBT people still face in this country.  In spite of all the progress that has been made in recent years, many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people still face intimidation and discrimination on a daily basis.  Homophobic bullying is rife in our schools.  We still have laws on our books that allow teachers and doctors to be fired just because they are gay, no matter how great a job they are doing, and loving couples are still denied one of the most basic and important rights of all, the right to marry.<\/p><p>  It is important that we have a free discussion about these issues, that we are free to challenge these issues, and free to point out the hurt that they cause.  I also accept that the country is on a journey of improvement to reach full equality.  I hope that embracing full marriage equality will be the completion of that journey.  I do not believe that everybody who opposes marriage equality is homophobic.  I have never said that.  I do not believe that.  I just think there are many Irish people who just have not engaged with the issue.  Perhaps they do not know lesbian and gay couples who are affected by it, who might live on their street or who are in their families, so they do not understand the impact that it has.  However, I saw first hand at the Constitutional Convention that when people listen to those arguments and the personal stories about discrimination, it does change their opinions.  We are engaged in a journey of education and persuasion, and I think we need to listen to the real concerns and fears of people, why they do not support equality, and we need to persuade them.  That should be the focus of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800030#HH00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1392745200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The Senator is way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800030#HH00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1392745200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I just want to wrap up briefly.

I also commend Senator Power, who raised the issue on the Order of Business.  It is an issue which she regularly raises with great passion in the House.<\/p><p>I am delighted we are having this debate.  Some will say that it is current, timely and topical, but I believe it is both overdue and essential.  It is vital to have a debate on the issues of free speech, homophobia and the public service role of the State broadcaster in these debates.  While these debates are all interconnected - free speech in modern Ireland, homophobia in modern Ireland and the public service role of the State broadcaster in modern Ireland - are each worthy of their own parallel debates.  I use the term &quot;modern Ireland&quot; for each debate, yet in the last few weeks I feel as though I have travelled through time from modern Ireland to Catholic, dogmatic Ireland and then back to modern Ireland again with a jolt.<\/p> <p>Three months ago I though we had a modern State, that Ireland was cosmopolitan, friendly and outward looking, with people in the city friendly to all regardless of skin colour, sexual orientation or background and in which, by and large, nobody would experience prejudice.  Senators have alluded to a sequence of events, which I am still struggling to reconcile and which makes we wonder whether we live in a modern country that accepts everybody or whether we simply put on that face.<\/p><p> A speech about homophobia opened a can of worms.  There were arguments back and forth with the State broadcasting service paying taxpayers' money to the tune of &euro;85,000.  What has happened since then has been heartening.  People of all faiths and from all backgrounds have stood up to speak out in favour of equality.  We have heard stories about homophobia from throughout the country.  Prejudices have been simmering beneath the surface waiting to be exposed, having gone unchecked for far too long.  During the weekend, a person on an Irish radio station sports programme in a reference to gay people said:<blockquote>What are their interests?  I mean, if you have ever sat down with one, you know, homosexual people, and asked them what their interests are, very often they have no interest in any kind of sport.  That is my experience of sitting down with them.  I have done it on a regular basis.<\/blockquote>Is this an example of homophobia, being misinformed, or plain ignorance?  Many would not be entirely sure, but I know it should not go unchecked.  It is a use of language that needs to be identified for what it is - discriminatory, biased nonsense. <\/p><p> The forthcoming referendum on same-sex marriage will take place in 2015.  This is probably the start of a long-ranging debate on marriage, society, homosexuality and a great many other things.  However, this debate is a very useful exercise in defining the parameters of the debate and ensuring that what we have witnessed and a journalist being paid by RTE does not happen again.  We must ensure the debate is conducted in a reasoned, civilised and decent manner.  I was looking through the archives recently and discovered a quotation from Senator Norris in 2003: &quot;The level of homophobia is appalling and it should be addressed in our schools and elsewhere.&quot;  It is sad to think that now, more than a decade later, we still face an appalling level of homophobia in our society.  While things evolve and change, they perhaps do so just a little too slowly at times.<\/p><p> I commend the great work being done by LGBT charity ShoutOut, which was just formed last year.  ShoutOut visited more than 45 schools throughout the country, delivering anti-bullying workshops.  It did so on a voluntary basis, being funded through Internet donations.  When it comes to the State broadcaster, it is working on tighter budgets than ever before while at the same time, to be fair, ensuring more output.  In short, like many other public sector institutions, it has to do more with less.  While it should be commended on doing so, none the less RTE, with the threat of legal action, in my opinion seemed to have reached for the panic button and decided that a smaller payout on the taxpayer tab today was better than the risk of a larger payout down the line.  Perhaps it was right.  I certainly know as a practising litigation lawyer that defamation cases are extremely expensive and often these matters are decided on an economic basis.<\/p><p> I am looking forward to the referendum on same-sex marriage and to a national debate of substance on the issue.  It would also be a worthwhile exercise for RTE to establish the sequence of events which led it to award such a payout.  I commend once again Senator Zappone and the Senators in the Independent group for providing this opportunity to debate the issue.  I look forward to the Minister's responses, especially his comment on the RTE issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800030#HH00600","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392745800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I commend my colleagues, in particular Dr. Zappone, and let me say how thrilled I am to see in the Gallery her partner and spouse, Dr. Ann Louse Gilligan, who is restored to health.

A petition to be sent to the Taoiseach from the gutter press has been doing the rounds, seeking support for the introduction of the American system in Ireland.  We do not want the American system, as it is highly dangerous.  The business of honest opinion is quite dangerous and needs to be looked at very carefully.  One does not need to rely on it because what those people have said consistently, which I have said in this House and on RTE, and if they want to sue me I would be delighted, is plainly homophobic.  I can comment on that because when we were suing the Irish State, I brought over Dr. John Spiegel, who was head of the American Psychiatric Association when they changed the classification of homosexuality and decided that it was not an illness.  The word &quot;homophobia&quot; emerged from discussion at that time.  &quot;Homophobia&quot; means an irrational fear of gay people.<\/p><p>  In regard to what the piece of bimbo beefcake who was on the radio the other day, who played rugby or whatever, said, that I laugh like a drain, while I know people must be protected against this because not everybody can laugh, I would not like to be him the next time he goes into a barber because he also said he never knew there were any heterosexual barbers.  That fellow is going in for a crew-cut, if ever I heard one.<\/p><p>  I commend and congratulate the vision of Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, in having Panti on the stage of the Abbey Theatre, which was one of the great moments of theatre in this country since the time of W. B. Yeats.  I thank Senator Mac Conghail for doing that.<\/p><p>  I am delighted that this has been an all-party motion.  It was proposed by Senator Zappone and seconded by Senator Bacik from the Labour Party.  I do not believe there will be a division and it is absolutely wonderful that we are united in this way, as we should be.  I pay a special tribute to Senator Averil Power.  I was unwell at the time, but my goodness we had a champion there and what she did was absolutely fantastic.  All kinds of people have joined in.  Mr. Noel Whelan, a barrister, gave his opinion in print in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>before he had seen the programme.  I wonder if he ever heard of hearsay evidence, the poor thing, God bless him.  Then Archbishop Martin made up for it.  We all know the expression that if one wants to know if the boot pinches, do not ask the boot, ask the foot.  Archbishop Martin said the person who is offended defines what being offended is.  Bravo to Archbishop Martin.  He is 100% right in that.  It was a good and brave thing to do.<\/p><p>  Then there is the issue of RTE.  The Minister has a role in RTE.  I have tried to get the issue taken up by both the Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  It is an absolute disgrace.  I am quite a litigious person and I know one will never get an opinion from senior counsel that does not say there is always a risk.  I want to see the opinion provided to RTE, and the Minister must demand it from RTE because I know bloody well it did not say what the director general or whatever he was said at the beginning.  RTE was equivocal and kept changing it.  Of course RTE was told at the beginning that there might be a risk, but it was certainly told that it was eminently defensible and no barrister worth his or her salt would have said anything else.  By giving in so gutlessly to the bullies, RTE let down free speech.  I do not want to pay my television licence after that.  I despise them for what they did.<\/p><p>  Who are their opponents in this case?

Having free speech and homophobia in the same sentence is as though it is an extension of the other or without one you cannot have the other.  It is my opinion that there is no such thing as free speech because all speech is connected, rooted or intertwined with and through our culture, our mores, our perceptions, our histories, our words, what is said, how it is said, who is saying it and who it is being spoken to.  The Innuit Eskimos have 240 words or explanations for the colour white because they live in a white world.  Language is always about community.  It is a community where we agree on the rules because my private language is my private madness.  The idea of free speech does not really exist because there are limits to free speech - if one thinks of inciting riot - and we cannot pretend that there are not.  <\/p><p>It was C. S.

He said, when speaking about his bank and the bank's Celtic tiger banking, Las Vegas-type behaviour: &quot;At a wild party, even good girls can get into trouble&quot;.  What about that comment in terms of free speech?  Where do we go from there?  I do not know where to start or end with the perceptions, the language, the mores, the words, the culture and, behind all of that, profanity and illiteracy.  However, we want a country in which this banker can say what he said, in which he has the freedom to say it because he will - certainly by me - be destroyed by his own speech, his own prejudice and his own lack of thought.  My answer would be to take my money out of his bank.  He will destroy himself in the process.  By his own beauty and his own grace he will be destroyed. <\/p><p>In the same way one cannot say that because I do not agree with the marriage of same-sex couples that I am homophobic.  I am entitled to say it, believe it or feel it and it is beyond reason - or a reasoned argument - to suggest that I am homophobic because I do.  Senators, I am not fond of marriage but I am very fond of civil partnership and tenancy in common.  I would not recommend single parenthood to anybody.  I am a single parent but it does not make me prejudiced against it.<\/p><p>The motion also calls on the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to debate these issues and to outline steps that he and the Government will take to ensure that the debate on marriage equality is conducted in a fair, open and impartial manner.  Are we not doing that?  Is that not what the Seanad is supposed to be about?  Do I not sit here on a daily basis and listen to opinions, thoughts and view that I consider to be from middle earth or, indeed, from stratospheres that are miles away from how I feel or how I would like things to be?  They are fair, they are open and can never be impartial so I disagree with Senator Zappone.  It is very difficult to be impartial when there is an agenda.  If there was an argument about impartiability or impartiality I would suggest that many of us - including myself - should leave most of our agenda in the attic and we might get further. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800032#KK01200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1392746400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>The Senator has one minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800032#KK01300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1392746400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>This part of the motion is a benign and functionless request because it suggests that an elected Minister would do otherwise and get away with it.

Does the Minister know whether RTE carried out the most basic of research before paying out a considerable sum of taxpayers' money?  I shall close my remarks by quoting a speech that some of our more conservative commentators should listen to: <blockquote>We sometimes have to listen, much to our regret, to voices of persons who, though burning with zeal, are not endowed with too much sense of discretion or measure.  In these modern times they can see nothing but prevarication and ruin.  They say that our era, in comparison with past eras, is getting worse. They behave as though at the time of former councils everything was a full triumph for the Christian idea and life and for proper religious liberty.  We feel we must disagree with those prophets of gloom, who are always forecasting disaster, as though the end of the world was at hand.<\/blockquote>That is a speech that Pope John XXIII made just prior to his election to the papacy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800032#KK01700","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1392746400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirleach.  I am delighted to have this debate and I welcome the Minister here this evening as well.  It is good to see so many Senators debating the motion.  We have an enviable record in the House for showing respect for free speech and I think that we would all admit that.  We should feel very proud that we have staunch advocates in this House for diverse causes and issues.  Long may it continue.  That is one of the biggest arguments in favour of retaining Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>The question of free speech seems to be the substantial, but not necessarily the substantive issue, contained in the motion.  I do not think that any democrat can argue against free speech.  I believe that it is one of the strongest planks in democracy.  We should guard it jealously and we have always guarded it jealously.<\/p><p>Another plank in democracy is the right to vindicate one's good name and I hope that will also continue.<\/p> <p>The challenge we have, as democrats, is to find a balance between those two points.  I believe the motion could have been enhanced greatly if both those planks were brought into it but, unfortunately, the question of vindicating one's name is absent from the motion.  In a way, that takes from the debate and dilutes the potential for working together on any given issue, particularly on the forthcoming referendum.<\/p><p> We are focusing on a single issue which arises from the controversy coming out of &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot;, but that is not the only time RTE has given apologies.  Therefore, if we are looking for change, let us see how it impacts on people.  For instance, a senior trade unionist looked for an apology because he was mentioned by a caller to the Joe Duffy show, and he got the apology.  In the last two weeks, an Independent Deputy got a vindication of her name by way of a statement on the Vincent Browne programme.  We have also had the case of Fr. Reynolds, which most people would agree was not right.  These cases all fall into different categories.  Therefore, in debating this, we need to look at the broader debate, particularly if we are asking for a change in legislation.<\/p><p> Interestingly enough, and I am sure most Members have been following this in the media, I discovered, when the initial frenzy related to the controversy tended to abate somewhat, that several journalists came out and put down markers as to why we should have caution in regard to the manner of this debate, including Martina Devlin, Eilis O'Hanlon, Emer O'Kelly and Pat Leahy.  If one reads their columns, they all raised very significant questions when that frenzy was raging, and there are many more examples of this.<\/p><p> I have heard Members of the House say, during the abortion debate and other debates, and rightly so, &quot;Let us be calm&quot; and that, if we have a point of view, we should put the point of view, and if somebody else disagrees with that point of view, is that not what debate is all about?  However, I believe this debate has gone off the rails.  I feel terrible hurt for the people who have spoken here, such as Senators Zappone and Norris.  I say this genuinely.  I feel an awful hurt that they feel the hurt, and it is evident that they do feel the hurt, as do so many other people.  That debate can take place in a much quieter way.<\/p><p> The substantive issue here is precisely what they are seeking in the referendum, that is, a change in the Constitution.  However, what has become the substantive issue is a word and the meaning of that word, and so much more has been lost in the course of that debate.  We are here as Senators.  We enjoy huge privilege in this House, and apart from directing some suggestions towards the Minister, we are largely speaking to ourselves.  There will be very few people who stand up here and even make the type of points I am making, because most of the points will come from those who have supported the motion as it is.<\/p><p> I was fiercely impressed this morning by Senator Norris, when he was able to break loose from a single issue and talk about the manner of how certain sections of the media are endeavouring to manipulate this issue to get for themselves <i>carte blanche<\/i>to say what they want to say.  Senator Norris himself found it necessary to take out writs against various media outlets because of what was said in what was, as some people would put it, a robust presidential election campaign.  Was he not right to do what he thought was right to vindicate his name?  That is why I am so sad that the vindication of one's good name, which to me is so important, and which we, as democrats, should be arguing for, is missing from the motion and that, therefore, there is a lack of balance in that motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800032#KK01800","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392747000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

She articulated so succinctly the impact of subtle discrimination and homophobia on a person's psychic and mental well-being, causing them, in her words, to check themselves at the pedestrian crossing.  The number of views, and the number of languages in which that video has gone around the world, shows the power that words can have.<\/p><p>It is very important, however, that we do not have debates about important social issues in isolation from each other.

That report found that 50% of LGBT youths have thought about suicide and 20% attempted suicide.  LGBT young people are seven times more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to experience mental health distress.  It has also been established that young people identify their sexuality at age 12, on average, and the average age of coming out is 17.  This five year period in which young people come to terms with their sexuality is vital.  Living in a society where anti-gay bias exists can lead to many difficulties in this critical adolescent period.<\/p><p>All this demonstrates the extent to which homophobia presents in society and impacts on the individual.  The survey found that 80% of LGBT people have been verbally abused because of their identity.  This is simply unacceptable.  LGBT people must be treated as equal citizens and we must actively work to eradicate homophobia and any type of discrimination from our society.  I believe we live in a society that is obsessed by labels.  We need to celebrate difference, and this can only be done through robust, open and constructive debate.  I was involved in a campaign a few years ago for which the slogan was: &quot;We need to keep labels for jars, not people&quot;.<\/p><p>I, like many of my colleagues, am concerned by the speed and, indeed, indecent haste with which RTE responded to Rory O'Neill's comments on &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot;.  The decision to issue compensation, an apology and a right to reply to some of those perceived to have been injured may well have been disproportionate in the absence of a legal finding of harm done, especially given that compensation was paid out of taxpayers' money.  I am also uncomfortable about the absence of commentary around the fact the presenter of the show in question prompted Rory O'Neill to identify individuals by name.  I think RTE's decision is worrying on a number of levels.  I feel it has negative implications for freedom of expression and also the manner in which debates around marriage equality will be conducted in the future.  We all need to accept that robust and sometimes volatile discussion will take place around sensitive issues, and we should embrace this, not censor it.<\/p><p>It is evident, in the aftermath of the comments debacle, that people on panels were tripping over themselves trying not to say the wrong thing.  That does not bode well for healthy and open debate.  The upcoming referendum on marriage equality will see many different views.  We need to ensure freedom of expression remains intact at all times.  We need to send a message to young people that discrimination will not be tolerated.  Homophobia does exist.  There are real consequences for the targets of this abuse.<\/p> <p>It is of the utmost importance that our national broadcaster ensures open and fair debate where both sides can communicate their argument in a fair and sensible manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800033#LL00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392747600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm a bheith in ann seasamh anseo agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair anocht.

The politics of this debate centre on the censorship of certain views.  Rory O'Neill's interview on the &quot;Saturday Night Show&quot; was taken off the RTE website and compensation was quickly paid out to certain individuals who are not shy when it comes to expressing their own opinions.  This amounts to censorship of Mr. O'Neill and a denial of his right as a gay person to name homophobia.  We question the speed at which RTE paid out compensation to these individuals and the legal advice it received before doing so.  The national broadcaster receives significant public funding and, as a result, it is a matter of public interest that the legal advice it received be published in full.  The payout from RTE has huge implications for the way in which debate on social issues is conducted on our airwaves, with small unrepresentative groups having the potential to set the parameters of what is considered acceptable debate.  This particular case is unusual in that it has received far more attention than any other defamation claim levelled at RTE and, as such, the public has a right to see the advice on which the State broadcaster acted.  I am calling on the Minister to ensure RTE publishes that advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800034#MM00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800034#MM00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>This case does not set a good precedent for the upcoming referendum on marriage equality.  There is a fear that if Rory O'Neill was censored by RTE for speaking out about homophobia, then the same could also happen to other members of the LGBT community in the course of the debate.  It is the LGBT community which is in a position to define what homophobia is.  It is the LGBT community that is at the receiving end of homophobia and knows its demeaning and discriminatory characteristics best.  In that context, we welcome the recent statement by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin.<\/p><p>We must be careful to avoid a politics of censorship surrounding this debate.  This is not just about homophobia and gay marriage; it is about freedom of speech and the obligation of the State broadcaster to facilitate it.  From the early 1970s until the early 1990s, republicans were banned from Irish airwaves and television screens.  This ensured that important voices could not be heard and that a State-centred view of the Troubles prevailed unopposed.  It is not acceptable for RTE, as the State broadcaster, to censor this or any other debate on issues to do with human rights and the equal standing of minority groups before the law.  RTE must ensure the LGBT community receives adequate air time in the run up to the referendum on marriage equality.  We are focusing on RTE in this debate, but we should remember there are other television broadcasters in the State as well as a range of radio stations, all of which are subject to legislation.<\/p><p>I have several questions for the Minister.  Why did RTE not contest the allegations made against it by John Waters etc. and why did the Minister not intervene?  One is either for freedom of speech or one is against it; there can be no half measures.  As Minister with responsibility for the national broadcaster, Deputy Rabbitte failed to defend this basic premise on behalf of the people of Ireland.  Maidir le TG4, t&aacute; br&oacute;d orainn go dtugann s&eacute; l&eacute;argas eile ar an saol in &Eacute;ireann and that it has branded itself as the &quot;s&uacute;il eile&quot;.  In an Ireland of diverse communities, TG4 has experience in broadcasting content that is outside of the mainstream and it has a remit in this area.   It would be unfortunate if RTE had the monopoly on public service broadcasting on this issue.  It is important that funding for TG4 is secured and that it is held to the same rigorous standard as applies to RTE under the equality legislation.<\/p><p>I am very proud that Sinn F&eacute;in launched a paper on LGBT rights in Ireland at our recent Ard-Fheis in Wexford, where my colleague, Chris Curran, spoke very strongly on these issues.  He highlighted the failure by successive Governments to have the moral courage to stand up for what is right.  We must never forget that this State was shamed into the decriminalisation of homosexuality by the European Court of Human Rights.  The prolonged effect of this State-led discrimination has not only left a legacy of inequality, mental health issues and discrimination; it leaves overt and subtle homophobia and transphobia unhindered to undermine and demean LGBT people.  This is not just an Irish phenomenon.  The regressive legislation adopted in Russia and Uganda, for example, sends a message around the world that gay people are something other than normal.<\/p><p>In an Irish context, we have a State broadcaster unable to cope when challenged with subtle homophobia being brought to the surface.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800034#MM00400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800034#MM00500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>In fact, when our own LGBT garda&iacute; are prevented from marching at Gay Pride in their uniforms, while their European colleagues look on in amazement, there is evidence of a more pressing need, not just for legislative change but a change in societal attitudes towards LGBT people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800034#MM00600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800034#MM00700","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>The Government has the power to make this change and it should not be found wanting.

The concept of freedom of speech is a long-standing one that is found in several early human rights documents.  England's Bill of Rights of 1689 granted freedom of speech in parliament and is still in effect.  The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen adopted during the French Revolution in 1789 specifically affirmed freedom of speech as an inalienable right.  Article 11 of that declaration defines the free communication of ideas and opinions as &quot;one of the most precious of the rights of man&quot;.  The Article further states, &quot;Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.&quot;  Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers&quot;.<\/p><p>At the same time, everybody, on all sides of the debate, would agree that there is no absolute right to freedom of speech.  Mr. Kevin Brophy, solicitor for John Waters in the recent case, has described a statement issued by RTE in respect of the matter as &quot;a grossly misleading version of what actually happened&quot;.  Mr. Brophy stated, &quot;[RTE] further went on to say that they took a particular course of action partly because of 'the decision by the complainants not to accept RTE's proposed remedies'&quot;.  Outlining the course of events, Mr. Brophy indicated that on 11 January, he was instructed by John Waters to write to RTE seeking an apology, a retraction and the removal of certain defamatory comments from the Internet broadcast of the &quot;Saturday Night Show&quot;.  &quot;My instructions were very clear at that time&quot;, he said, &quot;John Waters and the Iona Institute clients wanted an apology and a retraction and nothing else&quot;.  Mr. Brophy indicated that RTE had proposed a right of reply which, he said, was &quot;like asking my clients to prove they are not homophobic&quot;.  He further indicated that Mr. Waters made several attempts to deal with the matter himself, proposing the precise wording of an apology and further proposing that a donation of &euro;15,000 be made to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to mark the seriousness of the defamatory comments.<\/p> <p>Mr. Brophy also states:<blockquote><br \/>This proposal did not come from RT&Eacute;, it came from John Waters.  RT&Eacute; were not happy to broadcast the apology we had drafted and instead said they intended to go ahead with a totally unsatisfactory two sentence statement.  Over the course of the following seven days, an unsatisfactory wording was eventually agreed and was broadcast.<\/blockquote>He further stated that RT&Eacute;'s response &quot;to the proposed donation to the St Vincent De Paul was that they felt the figure should be &euro;5,000.  My very strong advice was for John Waters to issue proceedings against RT&Eacute; as I did not believe they were taking the matter seriously.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800034#MM00900","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392748200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Mr. Waters was still a member of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

There are, however, two sides to this story.  I fully support equality and inclusivity in society.  While there are those who might suggest he was forced into doing so, it must be noted that a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Justice decriminalised homosexuality in this country.  My party has a proud record on inclusivity and I stand over that.  I am under no illusion whatever with regard to the difficulties faced by those who are gay, lesbian or transgender.  I have absolutely no illusions whatsoever about the hurt they have experienced and, on occasion, the vile abuse that has been hurled at them down the decades.

The Minister is genuine in terms of his position on this issue.  There is a need to move on from what happened and to learn from the mistakes that were made.  Those mistakes have been well articulated.  I agree with colleagues on all sides who were somewhat dismayed at the speed with which RTE coughed up money in this instance.  A significant number of people were of the view that the station made the wrong decision.  I am inclined to agree with that school of thought.  What RTE did was not appropriate.  We need to move on and create a society in which people will not just be equal but which also respects difference.  Such a society must recognise that people have different orientations and treat them as equals.

Whatever about going for a haircut, Mr. Francis should certainly avoid a warm towel shave in the weeks immediately ahead.<\/p><p>I am glad Senator Mooney raised the question of the apology.  My understanding is that concession of the apology in the terms drafted would have been tantamount to destroying the honestly held opinion of Rory O'Neill.  There would have been very serious implications involved in accepting such an apology.  In saying that, I in no way wish to impede the desire of Mr. Waters to give money to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.<\/p><p>The controversy which gave rise to this debate has brought the issues of gay rights, homophobia, freedom of expression and the obligations of the public service broadcaster to the fore.  The handling of and reactions to that broadcast have been subject to commentary, criticism and query.  I have spoken about the issue on a number of occasions during the past few weeks.  I said that, personally, I would not use the term &quot;homophobe&quot; to describe those who disagree with me on issues of gay equality, in general, or gay marriage, in particular.  Perhaps that is the instinct of the politician whose natural disposition is to persuade rather than confront.  I have stated that, on one hand, it is too loaded a term and, on the other, too imprecise in its meaning to be used to categorise all those who hold contrary views on a matter for legitimate public debate.  Issues such as this are informed by deep-felt religious, moral and social considerations, but also, unfortunately, sometimes only by prejudice.  Opinion undoubtedly will be divided.  The best we can hope is that people will debate the matter calmly, in good faith and with respect for opposing viewpoints.  I have also said that people who hold themselves out as commentators on or contributors to public debate must appreciate that such debate can be robust, heated, personal and sometimes even hostile.  We politicians are expected to function as normal in such an environment.  That norm apparently does not apply to those fragile wallflowers who themselves are not restrained when it comes to dishing it out.<\/p><p>Freedom of speech and expression - and equally the right to be heard - are central tenets of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  They are central to the proper functioning of civil society and cannot be taken for granted.  Unless the media can report without fear or favour, then the public good is undermined.  The right and ability of media to do this must be proactively asserted and maintained.  To quote the UN Secretary General, &quot;When it is safe to speak, the whole world benefits&quot;.  As we all know, RT&Eacute; is an independent public service broadcaster.  It is obliged to be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, to reflect the varied elements that make up the culture of the Irish people and to uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression.  However, RT&Eacute; will not be the lone platform for debate in the forthcoming referendum.  We must remember that information will be presented and opinions exchanged across all media.  As the debate in recent weeks indicates, media matter.  As citizens, as voters and as representatives, we need a free, diverse media which is not beholden to a single sector of society, to large commercial concerns or to a single political party.<\/p> <p>Whether we chose to admit it or not, for both politicians and those we serve, media play a central and critical role in conveying information, parsing outcomes and passing judgment.  They create the written and recorded account of what happens.  In a very practical sense, they create the reality within which we exist and act.  As a result of this, the nature and character of media matters as well.  Its ability to speak truth to power and to challenge authority is one of those slender columns that sustain democracy.  If that capacity is reduced in any way, we are all the poorer for it.  If media is fettered, either by the interests of owners, by fear of authority or by the simple fact of groupthink, our democracy is worse off.  That proposition stands, irrespective of what any Member of this House may think of the focus of sections of today's media.<\/p><p>The development of a free and pluralistic media, both in terms of the technology and the legal and economic frameworks, has proceeded stepwise with the development of democracy.  In simple terms, it is impossible to conceive of a modern democracy without a free and diverse press - the two are intrinsically linked.<\/p><p>At EU level, both individual member states and the EU institutions have long had constructive involvement in media at a number of different levels.  One of the instruments that remains available, and which retains immense value, is the fact that each member state can still support, due to the space made in EU law, its own national public service broadcaster.  This is thanks in no small part to Protocol 29 of the EU treaties, which recognises that each member state's public service broadcaster aims to meet the democratic, social and cultural needs of the society in which it operates and which also speaks of the need to preserve media pluralism.<\/p><p>My conviction that public service broadcasting is a public good is not in the slightest undermined by the seeming inability of our own public service broadcaster to drag itself out of the rut of negativity that has so absorbed it since the economic crash.<\/p><p>While I have not been silent on my views on homophobia and the use of &quot;homophobe&quot; as a label, I have sought to avoid intruding into or ascribing motivation to the RTE decision in respect of settling contemplated litigation.

It is true that RTE is the public service broadcaster, but it is also true that it is a commercial company and it made a commercial decision as it does frequently in the face of contemplated defamation actions.  In his commentary on RTE's handling of events, Mr. Killane stated that RTE had explored all possible legal redress mechanisms, including the possibility of a right of reply.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's right of reply scheme provides for the broadcast of a right of reply statement that facilitates the correction of incorrect information which has been broadcast and which has resulted in a person's honour or reputation being impugned.  It is an opportunity for a person to correct incorrect information without recourse to legal proceedings.  All broadcasters are required to include on their website a copy of the scheme and contact information.  Decisions by a broadcaster to refuse such requests can be reviewed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's compliance committee.  However, a right of reply is about the correction of incorrect facts or information.  The scheme does not provide for the broadcast of alternative or contrary opinions.  In other words, a person may not be satisfied with the manner in which a broadcaster has relayed information about him or her but a right of reply will not be granted unless the facts or information are factually incorrect.  This was not therefore deemed an option for RTE on this occasion.

While the defamation laws are outside my remit, the Broadcasting Act is not.  At present, section 39 requires every broadcaster to ensure that nothing is broadcast that may reasonably be regarded as causing offence.  I repeat my view that this seems to me to be an unfeasibly rigorous approach.  We all know how easy it is for some people to be offended - even where offence was not intended and is not objectively ascertainable.  I will shortly be proposing miscellaneous amendments to the Act.  Among them, as I announced in the D&aacute;il recently, I am now considering an amendment that would require broadcasters to avoid causing undue offence.  That seems to me to be more objective and more in tune with the realities of public debate.  I am not sure I agree with Senator Zappone that the difference is minor but we can talk about that when the legislation is published.  If memory serves me, the term used by the Press Council of Ireland and Office of the Press Ombudsman is &quot;grave offence&quot;.  I do not know whether that goes closer to meeting the objective here.<\/p><p>  In the specific context of referendum campaigns, Senators no doubt are aware that the Broadcasting Act 2009 requires the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, as the independent regulator responsible for compliance in respect of broadcast content to draw up broadcasting codes on the standards and practice to be observed by broadcasters.  The BAI has accordingly published a broadcasting code on referenda and election coverage.  This code sets out the rules with which broadcasters must comply when covering any election or referendum.  The aim of the code is to ensure that broadcasters' coverage of elections and referendums is fair, objective and impartial.  Coverage should be undertaken without any expression of a broadcaster's own views on an election or referendum or on parties or candidates.  In covering the forthcoming referendum, broadcasters must ensure, for example, that coverage of the referendum is fair and equitable to all interests.  The BAI has previously highlighted the need for broadcasters to put in place transparent mechanisms for ensuring that coverage in the run up to the referendum and on the day that citizens cast their vote is fair, objective and impartial.  It is incumbent upon the BAI and all broadcasters in the State to ensure that they adhere to the code on referenda and election coverage, as well as to the spirit and letter of the relevant judicial rulings in this area.<\/p><p>  I know that many people think the broadcasters' hands are tied by the Supreme Court decision in Coughlan <i>v.<\/i> Broadcasting Complaints Commission, given in 2000.  The immediate effect of that decision was to get rid of party political broadcasts during referendums.  Perhaps most Senators would say this is no great loss.  A knock-on effect, however, seems to have been the &quot;stopwatch&quot; phenomenon when it comes to measuring news and current affairs output in order to comply with a supposed &quot;50-50&quot; rule.  Senators may recall Dr. Gavin Barrett of UCD writing back in 2009 that the application of the Coughlan ruling had the effect of politicians and parties in a referendum finding themselves given literally not one second more time on the airwaves than unelected campaigners whose sole qualification before being handed 50% of air time on both public and private broadcast media is that they have uttered the word &quot;No&quot;.  He wrote that, <br \/>put another way, influence formerly enjoyed by elected politicians has been transferred directly to unelected pressure groups or politicians with a tiny proportion of national electoral support.  The result of the application of this case law and, almost as crucially, the failure to provide an appropriate legislative reaction to it, has been, to borrow the words of Barrington J. in his powerful dissenting opinion in the Coughlan case, to play down or neutralise the role of political leaders in favour of committed amateurs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800036#OO00600","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1392748800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Why not test it again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800036#OO00700","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1392748800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>That is certainly a thought but it should probably come from a citizen rather than an officeholder.  It is argued that, taken together with the second McKenna judgment, this case ensures that the entity which arguably has the most democratic legitimacy claim to exercise persuasive force - the elected Government - is largely prevented from doing so and effectively emasculated in its leadership role.  Dealing with the Coughlan case specifically, that ruling was directed only at \"uncontested broadcasts\", including party political broadcasts, since no complaint was made in respect of news and current affairs coverage.<\/p> <p>In practice, however, the effect of the Coughlan judgment seems to have been to create a situation in which broadcasters feel constrained to give 50% of air time to both sides of a referendum campaign.  If this is so, it is not because of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, or its codes.  The current edition reads:<blockquote><br \/>[T]here is no automatic requirement to allocate an absolute equality of airtime to opposing views during coverage of a referendum.  However, the allocation of airtime must be equitable and fair to all interests and undertaken in a transparent manner.<br \/><br \/> Broadcasters should note that allocation of airtime is not the only measure of fairness.  It will be necessary for a broadcaster to consider the range of ways in which fairness is achieved and to ensure that active consideration is given to ensuring its achievement whether through the selection of contributors, the scope of the debate, the structure of the programme, the make-up of audiences, the role of the presenter or through other suitable means.<br \/><br \/> Broadcasters should also note that a referendum debate is a dynamic discussion and the approach taken to airtime and to coverage in general is likely to evolve over the duration of a campaign.<\/blockquote>None the less, it seems that 50:50 is still the default provision.  We all recollect how artificial it was to seek to allocate equal time on the airwaves to those arguing against the Good Friday Agreement, the children's rights amendment or the establishment of a court of appeal.  I invite the BAI and the public service and commercial broadcasters that are bound by its codes to consider what further refinements can be made to the referendum code while respecting the strictures of the Supreme Court judgment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800036#OO00800","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392749400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800037#PP00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>It may be that, so far as political parties are concerned, the 50:50 rule creates a perverse political incentive to oppose constitutional amendments, given the almost guaranteed access to the airwaves that will follow.

I tabled this matter because the budget moved the goal posts as regards qualifying for the State pension.  Up to last year, a yearly average of 20 contributions would have given a person 95% of a State pension.  With the graduation of rates of pay and bands, however, this is no longer the case.  Women in particular have been caught in the cross-fire.  I am referring to a cohort of women who gave up working voluntarily to raise their families or because of the marriage bar.  They only worked for a few years before they had their families and returned to work after their children were raised.  Their yearly averages are reduced by the number of years they spent raising their families.<\/p><p>In April 1994, the homemaker's credit was introduced for women who stayed at home to raise their families.  While that is to the good, some women now reaching pension age are being caught in terms of their pensions.  Not every woman needed to give up work.  Some never returned after raising their families, others are in receipt of widow's pensions and others are financially better off as dependent adults on their husbands' State pensions.  I am seeking credits for the small number of women in question in respect of the period 1968 to 1994 so as to increase their State pension rates.  I will wait the response of the Minister for Social Protection, on which the Minister present has been briefed, before contributing further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800037#PP01700","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Moloney for raising this matter.  As she is aware, the homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualifying for a State contributory pension easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.<\/p> <p>To be eligible for the homemaker's scheme, a person must permanently live in the State, be aged under 66, have started insurable employment or self-employment on or after the age of 16 and before the age of 56, not work full-time - although a person can work and earn less than &euro;38 gross per week - and care for a child under 12 or an incapacitated person on a full-time basis.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  However, it is important to note that the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. <\/p><p>The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least ten contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  For those who do not satisfy these conditions and have an income need a means-tested State pension may be available.  The 2007 Green Paper on pensions indicated that to backdate this scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced, would cost the Exchequer some &euro;160 million.  Under current rules, costs in relation to this scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994.<\/p><p>The National Pensions Framework 2010 proposed a system of homemaker's credits to replace the current disregard.  Backdating of this credit to 1994 has been considered as part of the broader pensions reform process, including a move to a total contributions approach to pension eligibility.  This means that people reaching pension age could have credits rather than disregards applied to their records to cover periods of care since 1994.  This would represent an enhancement, particularly for women, and those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  However, such an approach would impose additional costs and could only be considered in the context of the wider pensions reform debate and in the context of the budgetary process.<\/p><p>I will convey the Senator's anxiety to have this matter dealt with to the Minister for Social Protection.

I am pleased he is here to deal with this issue of direct relevant to his portfolio.  As the Minister will be aware, I raised the issue of a scheme to support national organisations in May 2013 in the hope that we could have a new scheme in place for January 2014.  When I again raised the matter in December 2013 I was told the then scheme was to be extended by six months.<\/p><p>This scheme, in terms of the types of organisations involved and how it has evolved, concerns me.  When I was involved with the Children's Rights Alliance the scheme was known as the federations and networks scheme.  In terms of funding provided over the past three years, the mix and spectrum of organisations has been different.  I have raised with the Minister the fact that for some of those organisations such as the Children's Rights Alliance in which, as I stated, I previously worked, State funding is the main source of funding.  Other organisations such as the FAI, were contributing 10% of this funding to the salary of their CEOs, which deserves attention.<\/p><p>The real issue for me is the new scheme and the proposed &euro;90,000 cap on funding, which means some of the recipient organisations will be hit by further cuts.  Cuts of 12% across the board were announced at the beginning of last week, which is a hugely significantly cut.  Many of the organisations who contacted my office were anxious to find out how they would be affected.  The scheme was extended in December from January to June 2014.  The organisations concerned have only found in mid-February that their funding is to be cut by 12%.  Some of them have had to make drastic decisions regarding staff, projects, activities and so on and they still do not know exactly what will happen post-June.  It is groundhog day.  We have had this situation before.  I have been raising this issue in the House since last May.  The Minister in one of his responses told me about the evaluation of the scheme that had been undertaken and that this is about enhancing the capacity of the community and voluntary sector, good governance and raising the levels of the organisations but the organisations have been instead left reeling because they are not being given adequate funding.  Funding for these organisations has since 2008 been cut by more than 50% across the board.  These cuts have not been proportionate or related to the performance or activities of the organisations.  Regardless of whether these organisations are doing good work and meeting every objective, or none of them, the same cut applies.  <\/p><p>The manner in which this matter has been handled has been extremely unfair to organisations.  The organisations about which I am speaking are organisations for whom this State funding is their primary funding and not a top-up fund.  They are leveraging funding from philanthropic organisations based on the State funding but are finding this increasingly difficult because the funding from the State continually diminishes.  We know that this is all happening against the backdrop of foundations such as Atlantic Philanthropies and the One Foundation winding down their operations here.  It is a perfect storm for organisations and this is severely damaging them.  I look forward to hearing more about the cap that has been announced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800038#QQ00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1392750000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the Seanad on the funding scheme to support national organisations.  The current funding scheme was due to finish at the end of last year.  In view of the importance which the Government and I attach to volunteering and the role of volunteerism in promoting societal well being, I am pleased that even in the context of the difficulties in the public finances l have been able to bring forward a new programme.<\/p><p>As rightly pointed out by the Senator, the funding scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector commenced in 2008 under the auspices of the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  This scheme replaced and amalgamated schemes previously operating under the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity.  It aims to provide multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.  I have extended the current scheme by six months to end June 2014.  Some 64 organisations are funded under this scheme, with funding of some &euro;3.5 million provided during 2013.  <\/p><p>As a consequence of the reductions in my Department's Vote for 2014, it was necessary to reduce the funding of the various schemes operated by the Department.  In doing so, l have aimed, in so far as is possible, to protect front line services.  A new Scheme to Support National Organisations 2014-2016 will come into force in July and the total funding for 2014 for current and new schemes will be &euro;3.1 million.  During the summer and autumn of 2013, my Department carried out a review of the scheme.  The terms of reference for the review included an examination of the extent to which the objectives, rationale and approach of the scheme remain valid and the making of recommendations regarding the future role and scope of the scheme.  The review found that the scheme has fulfilled its main objective of providing multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.<\/p><p>Funding of a range of national networks and organisations was seen to enhance the capacity of the community and voluntary sector in organising itself at a national level and in raising standards across the sector.  The review also found that the scheme is in line with international best practice, including a partnership approach and providing core funding on a multi-annual basis.  Therefore, the new scheme will continue in a broadly similar manner to the current one.<\/p><p>I am conscious of what Senator van Turnhout had to say.  I can assure her that in the context of the review of this scheme I will be taking account of some of the issues raised by her.  I am not satisfied that some of the existing organisations are best served by the type of support they are receiving or whether some of the organisations in receipt of support should be receiving that support from Departments other than the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p><p>The review recommended that organisations be required to clearly demonstrate the need for the funding requested, how this need was identified, the added value of the work proposed, how the proposed activities will demonstrate value for money and how the organisation will collaborate, co-ordinate and engage in partnership work with other relevant agencies and organisations.<\/p> <p>This information will improve the targeting of available resources.<\/p><p>The effective use of core funding in recipient organisations requires that robust governance and cost-control procedures are in place within those organisations, particularly at board level, and this will also form a key element of the assessment process.  The new scheme was recently advertised for applications and the closing date is Wednesday, 19 February.  The assessment of applications and notification of successful applicants will be completed in the second quarter of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800038#QQ00400","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392750600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I really appreciate the Minister coming to the House.

However, do we need to go as far as apps such as Angry Birds requesting the user's location and unique device code?  This app has been downloaded more than 1 billion times.  Candy Crush Saga, which is the most popular game on Facebook, Google Plus and Google Maps all ask for locations and individuals' private information which has nothing to do with the mobile phone app.<\/p><p>  This came to light recently through documents acquired by Edward Snowden, who has hit the headlines in the past 12 months.

There have been discussions at EU level and I have raised the issue previously.  It is important that people should be aware of the potential risk from using these apps.

The Minister for Justice and Equality has responded to me in the past 12 months on the issue and it is a matter that needs to be kept to the fore.  I know the European Parliament is expected to adopt proposals in April.  However, I wish to hear the Government's approach to this and how we are moving to protect personal data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800039#RR00600","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1392750600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Before I call the Minister of State, I welcome members of the Irish Girl Guides who are in the Gallery.

They are more than welcome.  I am very fond of any organisation that organises women.<\/p><p>I am standing in for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality who is unavailable at present.  The reply is fairly lengthy, as one would expect from the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Clune for raising this important issue.  It is important to all of us that our personal data, including personal data on our smartphones, are safe and secure and that we do not feel that the use of apps will lead to misuse of our data, including misuse for purposes we might never have envisaged when we decided to use a particular app.<\/p><p>Communication networks and information systems have become an essential component of both our economic systems and social life.  All of us here today have witnessed an information technology revolution in our lifetimes and the pace of change shows no sign of slackening.  The development of smartphone technology and the widespread use of such phones is a good illustration of this phenomenon.<\/p><p>Specific safeguards for the protection of personal data are in place at European Union level.  I take this opportunity to briefly set out the background.  The centrepiece of existing EU legislation on personal data protection is Directive 95\/46\/EC which seeks to reconcile the protection of personal data with the free flow of such data within the Internal Market and to countries outside the EU.  It has been transposed into Irish law in the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003 which supplements the Data Protection Act 1988.<\/p><p>This legislation requires all those handling personal data to take appropriate security measures against unauthorised access to, or unauthorised alteration or disclosure of, the data, in particular where processing operations involve the transmission of such data over a network.  In determining what is appropriate in any particular case, account must be taken of the risk of harm that might result from security breaches and the state of technological development and costs of implementation.  These security measures also apply where data are transferred to a destination outside the European Union.<\/p><p>The Data Protection Commissioner, who is independent in the performance of his duties, deals with complaints about companies and organisations established in this jurisdiction where there are allegations that they may not be meeting these security requirements.  The commissioner has extensive investigative and enforcement powers, including the power to take summary proceedings for offences under the Act.  The commissioner also carries out audits of organisations, which include an assessment of data security systems.<\/p><p>The 1995 directive has been supplemented by other more specific legislative measures, such as the e-privacy directive which applies to providers of publicly available electronic communications services, namely, telecom providers and ISPs.  This directive requires such companies to take appropriate measures to safeguard security of their services and to protect the confidentiality of communications and related traffic data.<\/p><p>It is generally recognised that the 1995 data protection directive's standards need to be updated to take account of more recent developments such as increased usage of mobile phones, cloud computing, social networking and increasing globalisation of data transfers.  In January 2012, the European Commission tabled proposals for a reform of the current data protection framework and these proposals are currently being discussed at EU level, as the Senator mentioned.  The proposed regulation's enhanced data protection standards will, when agreed, apply directly in all member states without the need for transposing national legislation.<\/p><p>In addition to the responsibilities of those who develop and supply apps to incorporate appropriate security measures to secure data transmitted between the app and end-user, many basic steps are available to those who choose to download and use apps, including limiting the amount of data stored on the smartphone to which apps are given automatic access.  Users should be also vigilant in terms of the security of the Wi-Fi networks to which they connect.<\/p> <p> We cannot ignore the important fact that there is a recognised need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats and dealing with this requires access to certain data.  However, in doing so it is necessary to ensure that the information is lawfully obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards.  Any security surveillance undertaken must be balanced and appropriate.  Moreover, it must take account of individual rights to privacy and ensure the respect for human rights contained in the European Convention on Human rights.  For these reasons we have in place statutory provisions with judicial oversight governing police surveillance and access to these data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021800039#RR00800","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392751200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I fully agree with the Minister of State in respect of the last point she made.

The obvious question is the timeframe.  When will we see it?  The legislation referred to by the Minister of State originally was the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003.  Apps have only been around for the past ten years and therefore things are moving at a faster pace and they always will be.
