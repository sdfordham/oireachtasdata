The 20% cut to that grant takes effect today.  I ask the Leader to investigate whether anything will be done to repeal this savage cut of 20% or more to these people.  These are people who live on meagre incomes, and something should be done about this cut.  In addition, we learned in recent days that the mobility grant, to which it seems there is still no solution, was savagely cut.  Dealing with that has been deferred further to October at which time these people will be discriminated against again.  No new applicants are being permitted.  Surely it is within the capabilities of the Oireachtas to deal more quickly with this issue.  We are talking about the most vulnerable people who face challenges that most of us in this House do not have to overcome.  It is incumbent on us to take action urgently, and I would be grateful if the Leader could address this issue and raise it with the relevant Ministers without delay.<\/p> <p>I call for a debate very specifically on the issue of securitisation in the banks.  A very brave housewife, Miriam Freeman, succeeded in recent days in the courts as a lay litigant to gain full discovery against a bank with regard to her loan.  Are the loan books being sold on through third party companies?  Does this occur in the banks which the State, as shareholder, owns?  Will the small borrowers of Ireland, the people struggling in mortgage arrears, be under additional pressure from a bank calling in these loans and trying to repossess homes which it no longer owns?  Is this legal?  We have seen the leadership shown by a very brave housewife from Dublin who took on the might of the huge legal team of Bank of Scotland Ireland and succeeded in gaining full discovery.  Unusually but thankfully, here is a bank which must tell the truth.  I call for a debate in this regard because it is of the utmost importance that the small borrowers of Ireland struggling with the market know whether the banks which, we as people own, sold their mortgages to third-party companies.  At the same time these banks are increasing the pressure to recover their loans and threatening repossession in many cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200002#A00600","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371029400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I echo the words of the Cathaoirleach.

It is important that we conduct ourselves with decorum and be respectful of the House.

The figures released by Women's Aid today show a very worrying rise in the abuse of children in family settings.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has promised comprehensive reform of the law on domestic violence.  It has been reformed over the years and important reforms have been introduced by the Government, but we still lack overarching or codified legislation in the area.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to update us on the progress of his work on law reform in this area?  We need to ensure our legislative responses are adequate.  Legislation alone is not the answer to this and a good deal of other work must be done with regard to policing and education.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, I asked the Leader for a debate on prison policy and sentencing.  I support Senator Paul Coghlan who called for a debate on a related matter concerning the Law Reform Commission report on mandatory sentencing which was published yesterday.  It recommends reversal of mandatory sentences for drugs offences, which it pointed out have only been applied to couriers rather than to those organising the trafficking.  We could incorporate a debate on this into a general debate on prison and sentencing policy.<\/p><p>  A survey conducted in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> on the lives of women working outside the home shows interesting results, which are published in today's paper, on the views of women towards paternity leave and seeking the introduction of a measure of paid paternity leave.

In Britain two weeks' paid paternity leave was introduced a number of years ago.

I must confess to occasional feelings of enjoyment at the drama which can take place.  What really bothers me about the coalition's behaviour is how it treats people, facts and language.  I was very disappointed at the tone of the Taoiseach's public comments on the proposed referendum on the Seanad.  Several people with no particular axe to grind told me they wondered how statesmanlike such language actually was.  There was a tendency to denigrate and apportion blame which I do not think was appropriate.<\/p><p>There is widespread concern that the coalition is engaging in spin about its proposed abortion legislation, starting with the title of course, which mentions protection of life during pregnancy.  There is widespread concern this is about directly targeting innocent human children.  It has nothing to do with the sad facts of the Savita case.  It is all about how the suicide ground will be exploited and turned into abortion on request.  People like to have rows about church and State, but it is interesting that the language of misleading the people has come into the debate.  This is the feeling out there.  Between 30,000 and 40,000 people gathered for the national vigil for life in Merrion Square on Saturday and they feel the Government is seriously misleading the people and proposing something very harmful.

This is the second morning in a row that the State Examination Commission, SEC, has declined to appear on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;.  The damage done to young people by the mistakes in the mathematics paper in particular and the further mistakes in today's Irish paper requires an apology.  If the SEC gets a third invitation to appear on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; tomorrow, I hope it appears.  Doing so would be important.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on the Adjournment.<\/p><p>  As Ms Katherine Donnelly wrote in today's <i>Irish Independent<\/i> on foot of the Education Research Centre's report, and as mentioned in an editorial entitled, &quot;Stop the foot dragging on science and maths&quot;, the report shows that we do not have sufficient training in these subjects at primary level, which is the foundation for later development, and our teachers are younger but not trained properly in science and maths, which means that this problem will persist for a long time.  The main universities are running down teacher training.  It is divorced from science and mathematics departments and is becoming a branch of sociology.  Research funds are being used to buy out teaching, the most important function in teacher training and universities as a whole.  We have a great deal to do if we are to remedy this situation.<\/p><p>  In light of the mistakes, the SEC's disregard for the hundreds of thousands of young people doing examinations shows that we have much to do.

At least when he was here we got some credit for the work we do.<\/p><p>  I raise the matter of violence against women.  In May 2011, the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence opened for signature.  Out of the 47 states of the Council of Europe, Ireland is one of a minority of 18 countries that have not signed the convention.  The sad fact is that one in five Irish women have been subjected to domestic violence.  Safe Ireland reports that in 2011 alone close to 8,000 individual women and more than 3,000 children received support from domestic violence support services.  Today, at the launch of its annual report, Women's Aid announced there had been an increase of 50% in the reporting of child abuse to its helpline.  This is a very serious matter.  Thousands of Irish women and children are experiencing violence on a daily basis in this country.  It is unacceptable that Ireland has not ratified the convention.  I ask the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to communicate with the higher echelons of this Government, in particular the Minister for Justice and Equality, to ask him to sign the convention before Ireland's EU Presidency ends within the next month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200005#D00100","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1371030600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>It is both public and common knowledge that the money that applies in the appointment of Sean Donlon-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200005#D00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1371030600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The Senator is not allowed to display newspapers like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200005#D00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1371030600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>-----who was a former holder-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200005#D00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1371030600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>He cannot display it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200005#D00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1371030600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>It is very effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200005#D00600","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1371030600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>It is completely out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200005#D00700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1371030600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>There is no secret about the name.

We could usefully ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to the House to discuss this.  The costs of doing business need to be kept as close as possible to minimum at this stage.  It was revealed this week in a survey by Kantar that grocery prices have risen by 5% in the past year.  The survey highlights price rises across a number of categories, some of which have been magnified by global price fluctuations, which I accept.  However, many of them point to the fact that the cost of doing business in Ireland is a contributing factor.  This relates to an issue raised yesterday by Senator Mullen.  We could have a debate in this House as to how we might help to reduce costs.  Some of the Dublin councils have reduced rates which is helpful.  The rate of reduction is not inconsiderable in that some have reduced by 0.5% but perhaps it is time for councils throughout the country to look at ways of emulating this model.  For example, meat and fish prices are up by 6.2%, bakery goods are up by 4.2% and household products are up by 5.8%.  While some of these figures, such as the 16% rise in the price of vegetables, can be explained partially by external factors there is no denying the underlying trend.

That has been underlined in Donegal in the past week, as An Bord Plean&aacute;la overturned the decision of Donegal County Council to grant planning to 25 wind turbines that would be 64 m high.<\/p><p>This underlines the fact that the relevant Bill, spoken about by Senator Kelly and others, needs to be progressed by the Government.  There should be no further planning approvals granted within the State to any wind turbine application until the Oireachtas updates guidelines.  Why should the views of communities on a natural resource be ignored for multi-millionaire developers?  It is an absolute disgrace and the Government is standing idly by in allowing it to happen.<\/p><p>The abortion Bill will be debated this morning.

There is a package of measures which are necessary to ensure those people who do a tremendous, difficult and demanding job in looking after people in their homes have proper supports.  This week, as the Leader will know, the respite care grant cut comes into effect and more than 77,000 carers will see that respite care grant cut by one fifth.  It is an appalling, cruel cut. We made these points during the last budget but I appeal to the Government that it is not too late to change its mind on this issue.  The Government has continually refused to increase taxation at any level, including on those at the top, and has no difficulty standing over that, but it also has no difficulty standing over the cuts to carers who need respite.<\/p><p>Respite has an impact on the person who is being cared for, but it is hugely important for the carer who needs a break from a very demanding job.

Then it is down to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as people's last hope of overturning a decision.  It is clear from the Donegal decision this week that An Bord Plean&aacute;la wants legislation on minimum distances put in place and does not want to adjudicate in such situations.

I have a question on a topic that affects some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  Last November our Independent group tabled a motion on the social welfare appeals system.  During the debate we highlighted a number of concerns that are shared by Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and raised in its well-titled report, Not Fair Enough.  Our motion called for a social welfare application and appeals system that is transparent and independent.  The social welfare appeals office, which makes quasi-judicial decisions, is not independent of the Department because the Minister has the responsibility to appoint the chief appeals officer.  The social welfare appeals system is also inefficient, not because it is not managed well - from my conversations with the chief appeals officer it is managed well - but because of the pressures on the system resulting in a number of appellants being unable to access their fundamental rights due to delays.<\/p><p>During our debate we identified we need better decisions in the first instance.  We outlined that 42% of original decisions are overturned on appeal.  We have to raise questions about this.  In May this year, the average waiting time for a social welfare appeal was 28 weeks - that is seven months - for a summary decision or 37 weeks for an oral hearing.  I was recently contacted by a person representing a woman who has been waiting more than 25 weeks for her appeal to be processed.  What must that feel like?  More than 17,000 appeals are pending on the system.  How can we expect people to wait this long without serious consequences to their families, lives and health?  Things are still not fair enough.  I understand the chief appeals officer will shortly publish her annual report.  Bearing in mind the concerns raised by our Independent group of Senators, I ask the Leader of the House to debate the contents of this report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200007#F00600","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1371031800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Senator MacSharry raised the question of the respite grant and mobility allowance.

The Bill makes provision for the Government's decision on 30 April 2013 to permit access to the Irish labour market for nationals of Croatia upon its accession to the EU from 1 July 2013.<\/p><p>I propose first to summarise the background and context for the Bill.  I will then discuss the primary objectives of the Bill and conclude by briefly outlining the sections.<\/p><p>On 9 December 2011, Croatia signed the Treaty of Accession to become the European Union's 28th member state.  Ireland signed the Instrument of Ratification for the Croatian Accession Treaty on 21 September 2012.  The ratification process, by the parliaments of all 27 EU member states, is expected to be concluded by the end of June 2013.  Therefore, entry into force and accession of Croatia to the EU is expected to take place on 1 July 2013.<\/p> <p> At its meeting on 30 April 2013, the Government considered the EU accession of Croatia.  Based on the Forf&aacute;s analysis and other information available to my Department, the Government agreed to permit access to the Irish labour market for nationals of Croatia upon its accession to the EU from 1 July 2013.  The decision reflects the low likelihood that Croatia's entry to the EU could have a distorting impact on the Irish labour market.  The Government agreed, therefore, that transitional arrangements should not be applied in the case of Croatian nationals seeking to work in Ireland following Croatia's accession to the EU.<\/p><p> The Government took a number of factors into account when making its decision.  For example, it is highly unlikely that significant numbers of Croatians wish to migrate to Ireland<b><\/b>given that Ireland's current economic status presents a very weak pull factor for Croatians.  International studies also shows that migration is heavily influenced by existing migrant populations<br \/>and established social networks in the destination country.  There is not a sufficient population of Croatians in Ireland at present to create an attracting factor.  Of Croatians living abroad in European Union countries, Ireland constitutes just 0.2% of all Croatians living outside of Croatia.  There is a very low propensity for Croatians to emigrate.  When they do, they tend to emigrate to neighbouring European countries or North America.  The size of Croatia's labour force is relatively small<b><\/b>with a total labour force of 1.78 million and some 350,000 people in the 25-34 age group, which is generally the most mobile demographic of a country's population.  Ireland's labour market, in line with EU obligations, is already open to an EU workforce of 229 million.<\/p><p> The Government's decision pertains only to employment.  Croatians would, in any event, enjoy certain rights afforded to all EU citizens from 1 July and would, therefore, be able to reside in Ireland subject to the residence directive.  Such nationals will be able to study, work as self-employed persons or establish businesses here.  Applying restrictions to employment when it is possible work as a self-employed person can increase the potential for undeclared work.<\/p><p> Experience suggests that opening access to the Irish labour market may not have a significant impact on the State's services.  The experience in respect of Bulgaria, a country with a labour market twice the size of Croatia and to which Ireland gave full access to its labour market in 2012, suggests that only a modest increase arose in respect of personal public service, PPS, number registrations.  That could not be described as having a distorting impact on the Irish labour market.<\/p><p> The rate of employment permit grants to nationals of Croatia has been approximately 12 per year.  At a practical level, were<br \/>Ireland to restrict access to the labour market for nationals of Croatia, a separate employment permit regime would have to be maintained to manage approximately 12 employment grants.  That would be difficult to justify.<\/p><p> It was also noted that Ireland has an excellent relationship with Croatia.  It is important that the relationship is developed further to the benefit of both countries.  Bearing in mind that Croatia applied for membership of the EU under Ireland's last Presidency of the EU, it is timely that Croatia will join the EU just after the conclusion of Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the EU.  By providing full access, Ireland is continuing its policy of openness to new member states and highlights the need for continued EU solidarity.<\/p><p> Under section 2 of the Employment Permits Acts 2003 to 2006, a foreign national is not required to have an employment permit where he or she is entitled to be in employment in the State, pursuant to rights from the treaties governing the European Communities.  Section 1 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 2012 provides that the definition of &quot;treaties governing the European Communities&quot; includes the treaties as amended by the Treaty of Accession of the Republic of Croatia.  However, under paragraph 2 of Annex V of that accession treaty, the entitlement of Croatian nationals to employment for the first two years post-accession must be provided either by way of national measures or measures resulting from bilateral agreements.  Hence, the reason for this legislation.  Therefore, a legislative amendment to the Employment Permits Act 2003 is required to exempt Croatian nationals from the requirement for an employment permit while not conferring any greater rights than those included in the treaty.<\/p><p> The Bill is short and technical in nature and must be enacted by 1 July 2013.  I will briefly outline the content and purpose of its provisions, section by section.<br \/><b><\/b>Section 2(1)(<i>a<\/i>)<b><\/b>gives Croatian nationals employment rights equivalent to other EU nationals for the first two years post-accession.  Section 2(1)(<i>b<\/i>)<b><\/b>ensures Croatian nationals have the same employment rights as other EU nationals after the first two post-accession years.  Section 2(2)<b><\/b>ensures the family members of Croatian workers have the same entitlements as the family members of other EU workers.  Section 3<b><\/b>amends the Employment Permits Act 2003 so that Croatian nationals who have equivalent EU employment rights do not need an employment permit.<\/p><p> I would be happy to expand on any of the provisions during the course of the debate if Senators wish to raise any particular issues.  We will have an opportunity during Committee Stage to examine the Bill in detail.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators during the debate.  I hope the House will support the passage of the Bill and assist in securing its early enactment.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200008#G01000","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371033000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>As Senator White is getting her notes ready, she has given way to Senator Clune, which is very ladylike.

Croatia is important politically and for many other reasons due to its location in the Mediterranean, Balkan and eastern European areas.<\/p><p>Forf&aacute;s examined the potential impact on the Irish labour market.  Allowing a person to be self-employed and not an employee would increase the chance of people falling outside of the tax net.  It is important that people would be allowed to work here because they have been allowed to set up a business or be self-employed, and therefore this decision would be important in an effort to avoid them falling outside of the tax net.<\/p><p>The Government's decision and the legislation are important.  Under the treaty of accession, a number of options are open to the Government.  For a two-year period, member states can choose to restrict the rights of Croatians to work in particular sectors.  They can review those arrangements after two years or to have a transitional arrangement that will end after five years.  It may be extended for a further two years in those member states where an arrangement is being ended.  The Government has decided to allow Croatians to seek employment immediately.  As the Minister has outlined, we can expect very few individuals to come here.<\/p><p>Croatia is the second former member of the Republic of Yugoslavia to join the EU.  That is important when one considers the principles that surrounded the original reason to establish the EU, which was peace for all of the people in the European Union.<\/p><p>Croatia is an important location and will play an important role in the EU.  Croatia has stated its goal is to have all of its neighbours join the EU.  I know that Croatia is eager to engage with its neighbours to promote membership.<\/p><p>Croatia is located on the Mediterranean and in the central European and Balkan region.  Croatia has two very important deep sea ports, particularly for countries such as Hungary and Slovakia which do not have access to the sea.  Croatia has a strategic location, and its engagement with its neighbours will be very important.<\/p><p>Croatia reminds us of our history and position before we joined the EU.  Croatia did well up until 2008 but, like Ireland, it has suffered from the economic downturn.<\/p> <p>Its population is very similar to that of Ireland, its unemployment rate is 18% and its youth unemployment rate is particularly difficult, given that one in two of the under 25s is unemployed there and the financial crisis has hit Croatia.  Approximately 66% of the people in Croatia wanted to join the European Union and while that is a particularly low figure, it nevertheless is a positive majority.<\/p><p>I have visited Croatia and was particularly interested to read that approximately one third of Croatia is part of Natura 2000, the European Union standards to protect biodiversity that were established under the birds and habitats directives.  This will be important, as the European Union tries to protect its special areas of conservation.  When one thinks of the raised bogs and the debate on that issue, Ireland has a lot of experience in this regard and people here know well the value of special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas, as well as the value of support we received from the European Union in establishing such areas and ensuring they are protected.  In daily debate, one forgets the benefits of joining the European Union and what it brings to our country but the fact that one third of the landmass of Croatia will now be under Natura 2000 is highly positive.<\/p><p>Croatia will benefit from Structural Funds and is due to gain approximately &euro;8 billion between now and the year 2020.  Members can recall and can see all around them the value and benefits of Structural Funds, in terms of investment in road, sewage and communications infrastructure.  All Members are familiar with them and it is interesting to consider Croatia joining on 1 July in the knowledge that its future will be positive.  It already has benefited from much inward investment, particularly from Austria, France, Germany and the Netherlands, and undoubtedly will continue to so do.  However, the country has weaknesses, which European Union membership will help it to overcome.  It has a poor climate for private investment, too big a government and a public services sector that is too large, as well as much red tape.  These issues are all familiar to a small country such as Ireland with a similar population.  It does not have sufficient investment in research and development or in innovation.  It must modernise its labour market and has an ageing population, as well as a shrinking labour market and low rates of female participation.  If one considers a brief on the Croatian economy, these are the headlines.  While Ireland also has had such headlines, Members are aware of the support of the European Union, not necessarily simply in terms of financial support but with regard to mentoring, driving and ensuring the directives that are initiated across the European Union will be implemented in Europe.<\/p><p>This is a positive development and while Ireland's Presidency will finish just as Croatia is joining, it is important because the last time Ireland held the Presidency was when Croatia applied to join the European Union.  Consequently, there has been a strong relationship between the two countries.  I reiterate the make-up of the two states is very similar and I am sure the passage of this legislation will mark the beginning of a fruitful relationship with the 28th country to join the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200009#H00300","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371033600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I remember well the strong support given by the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to Croatia's accession to the European Union during his term as EU President.  This was a critical time in the process of Croatia's accession to membership of the European Union and there was fierce opposition to its accession.  Despite this, however, the Fianna F&aacute;il Government strongly supported Croatia through the process.  As Members are aware, citizens of each member state of the European Union have the right to get a job within the Union itself.  The 2011 treaty of accession, in line with previous accession treaties, permits the labour market restriction whereby for a two-year period, European Union member states can choose to restrict the right of Croatians to work in that member state or in particular sectors therein.  If we are to permit Croatian nationals access to our labour market, what is the purpose of this two-year transition period?<\/p><p>Our esteemed President Michael D. Higgins, spoke in Zagreb on 6 June last.  While welcoming Croatia's accession, he reminded us all that &quot;the EU is both, of course, a political union and an economic union&quot;.  He also reminded us: &quot;It is a Union that is not without its problems.&quot;  There have been serious issues, such as the euro crisis, where the whole thing nearly crumbled.  Personally, however, I believe the euro is back on track and we have overcome the problems we had.  The President noted some of the aforementioned problems were &quot;created within the Union, others from outside, from the international consequences of deregulation in ever more speculative markets&quot;.  There is no doubt about that.  He went on to note the major issue facing what now will be the 28 member states is that of unemployment, &quot;particularly youth unemployment which is at alarming levels in some member states&quot;.  He stated it &quot;is the greatest challenge and carries a danger of delegitimising democratic institutions&quot;.<\/p><p>My husband and I have travelled through Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia, and Croatia's physical beauty must be seen to be believed.  It is an absolutely idyllic country.  We travelled there by car last year and the economic development that is taking place is fascinating.  As a motorway runs right across the country, it is very easy to gain access further into eastern Europe.  This new road in Croatia has had a dramatic effect on its connectivity with other European countries in both eastern and western Europe.<\/p><p>As for Ireland's accession to the EU in 1973, I note that until then, married women were not allowed to work.  Once they got married, they were obliged to give up their jobs.  It is very hard for young people, such as the young Senators who are present, to believe that women were not allowed to work but were obliged to give up their jobs when they got married.  Accession transformed Ireland when we joined the European Union in 1973.  We leapt over Britain and never looked back.  We became Europeans rather than being just a small state that simply looked to Britain.<\/p><p>It is very welcome that Croatia is entering the European Union.  I refer to the terrible Bosnian war and the murders, killings and savagery.  Throughout those Balkan countries, there are cemeteries with white crosses marking the ethnic cleansing that took place.  Consequently, Croatia's accession is welcome.  It is a highly ambitious country with talented young people and we welcome them very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200010#J00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1371033600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and am delighted to have the opportunity to speak for the Labour Party on this Bill, which I greatly welcome.  In particular, I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill in this House.  It always is welcome to see Ministers so do, where there often tends to be a more conducive atmosphere for the introduction of amendments and for having a wide-ranging debate.  It is not that I anticipate there will be much amendment or opposition to this Bill.  Certainly, as Senator White has welcomed the Bill, I believe there is absolute support for it across parties and across the House.  Senator White spoke of the immense benefit to Ireland, particularly from the point of view of gender equality, that EEC membership brought.<\/p> <p>It is worth remembering the impact of membership of the EU on Irish society as well as the economy when we consider Croatian accession on 1 July this year.  It is likely that similar benefits will be felt in Croatia, although a great deal more has been achieved there in terms of equality than would have been the case in this country in the 1970s.<\/p><p>I have personal reasons for welcoming the Bill as I have family connections in Croatia.  My grandmother is from Croatia although she described herself as being from Austria-Hungary because, when she was born, there was no Croatia; it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at that time.  Her father was a diplomat involved in the service of the empire.  There was not a sense of Croatian nationalism then.  Senator White also referred to the appalling tragedy of the recent wars in Bosnia and Croatia.  There were many causes but one of the causative factors was the poison of an aggressive form of nationalism across Croatia and Serbia.  It is interesting to note that at the start of the 20th century that sort of nationalism was less evident.  I still have family in Rijecka in Croatia so I am aware how important it is that there is Croatian accession to the EU.  Personally, I am sorry accession will not take place under the Irish Presidency.  We will just miss out because, as the Minister has outlined, accession will take place on 1 July.  He indicated that the accession was negotiated under the previous Irish Presidency so we have a close connection.  As the Minister said, we have an excellent relationship with Croatia and long-standing connections.  Many Irish people travel to Croatia and there is much tourism interest for Irish people there.  That is all of relevance too.<\/p><p>I am delighted we are providing access to Croatian nationals to our labour market.  The Minister referred to the likely lack of impact of the measure due to a probable low level of take-up by Croatian nationals of the opportunity to work in Ireland.  It might well be that the travel goes the other way and that Irish nationals will travel to Croatia given our current economic situation.  I echo the words of Senator Clune, because whether the take-up is low or high, it is a positive development that we are providing access on these open terms.  There is immense benefit to be had in society and the economy from having an open attitude to other citizens of the EU coming here to work and to live among us.  We have seen some very positive developments in inward migration during the boom years in this country and it is great that so many members of new communities have stayed in this country even since the recession.  There is little more to be said.  The legislation is welcome and I applaud the policy behind it and the openness of the Government to incorporate access to the Irish labour market for Croatian nationals in the context of Croatian accession to the EU.  I very much welcome the fact that Croatia will become a member of the EU on 1 July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200010#J00300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371034200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I would like to welcome St. Ann&rsquo;s national school in Castlerea to the House.

They are very welcome.  The Minister is also very welcome.  We are adopting the right approach to welcome Croatia immediately into the labour market.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and I am quite friendly with the Croatian ambassador to Ireland, Jasna Ognjanovac.  She is a very forward-looking woman and she could teach us a great deal about the benefits of the European Union.  The clear benefit she pointed out to me is that Croatia has been the site of three wars - its own war ten years ago and the previous two World Wars.  Croatia is joining the EU for the peace project.<\/p><p>As Senator Clune and other Senators clearly pointed out, there is not much evidence of Croatian nationals wishing to come to this country.  A total of 12 applied for citizenship in 2012 and we have a total of 846 Croatian nationals resident in this country currently.  There is much to be gained by both sides.  As Senator White said, Croatia is an extremely beautiful country and Irish people holiday there.  I have been there on two occasions.  On one occasion I had a serious accident and it would have been of great benefit if Croatia had been a member of the European Union because my rights were infringed.  I was involved in a boating accident in which I was hit by a boat.  A cruise ship was out of control and hit the tourist boat on which we were travelling.  It was impossible to find a way to navigate the medical and legal system there without the European Union framework.  This works both ways.  It is a very beautiful country.  Its strong benefit is in tourism.  We are always growing in terms of our tourism product.  Croatia consistently enjoys beautiful weather compared to this country, even though we cannot complain about the past week.  Croatians are a very bright, fair and beautiful people and we could learn much from them.<\/p><p>In recent weeks the ambassador asked me if we could help her to find a wine merchant in this country that would import Croatian wines.  I put out the call in the Seanad today.  That is another example of how we could do business.  Every country brings its own product to the market.<\/p><p>I have one or two questions for the Minister.  Two different sections in the Bill give Croatian people rights for the first two years and then post-two years.  Could the Minister clarify why there are two separate sections dealing with rights?  When Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union, they were blocked from accessing the labour market initially by this country.  I am delighted that we are welcoming Croatia to the labour market but could the Minister explain why there is different treatment for different countries?<\/p><p>On the whole, the situation is positive.  I spoke with the Croatian ambassador this morning and she said Croatia is very happy with the decision by the Government not to impose restrictions on Croatian nationals.  Such a step enhances bilateral relations.  There is no expectation of a significant influx of people.  Could the Minister elaborate on relations between the two countries and how we can grow them?  We see the accession of Croatia as being of mutual benefit.  I refer to Croatia&rsquo;s understanding of the value of the EU in terms of advancing peace.  That was a core value in the founding of the EU.  We would do well to remember that.  This country, thankfully, has never been the site of war, other than our own Civil War.  Sometimes, we do not realise what it is like to be occupied in that way.  We have a lot to learn in that regard.  Our problems are more economic but if we did not have peace or security for people our priorities would change.  I would be delighted if the Minister could address my two questions.  I thank him.

As other speakers have indicated, it has a great deal to offer.  Like this country, Croatia is a remarkable country with a great landscape, heritage and culture.  It is no surprise to read that trade between this country and Croatia is already worth approximately &euro;50 million a year, with many Irish people travelling there as tourists.  I hope Croatia&rsquo;s accession to the Union will tempt more Croatians to consider this country for a visit.  Croatia&rsquo;s entry to the Union also highlights the enduring strength of the appeal of the European Union.  It is far better to be in the EU than not and even with recent turbulence there is a queue of nations who aspire to be part of the Union, which itself says a great deal.<\/p><p>It is important to point out, as the Minister indicated, that the Bill is technical in nature and is created in order to allow Croatians to access the Irish labour market while not conferring any rights above and beyond the Treaty of Accession to the Republic of Croatia.  Any fear that Croatians having access to the Irish labour would lead to a wave of people entering this country is unfounded.  There are a number of factors which ensure that it is highly unlikely that anything approaching large numbers of Croatians will migrate to this country.  First, Croatians do not tend to migrate and do not have a history of migration.  Although there are high unemployment levels, Croatia has a relatively healthy economy with solid inward investment.<\/p> <p> The main provisions of the Bill include giving Croatian nationals employment rights equivalent to other EU nationals for the first two years following accession.  The Bill ensures the family members of Croatian nationals have the same entitlements as family members of other EU nationals and amends the Employment Permits Act 2003 so that Croatian nationals with equivalent EU rights do not need an employment permit.  It is worth noting that only 12 employment permits were issued in 2012 to Croatian nationals, which perhaps gives an indication of the level of inward migration we can expect from Croatia.<\/p><p>I look forward to Croatia's accession on 1 July as the 28th member state of the European Union.  Croatia had originally aimed to join the EU in 2007 and, as we all know, the world and the European Union is a different place now from when that process started but the country's appetite has not diminished and its commitment has not wavered.

This is a great Bill to bring into the House and shows the work we can do in this regard.  Ireland has a close relationship with Croatia in that it will never forget that discussions started on it acceding during the last Irish Presidency of the EU and that it is at the end of the current Irish Presidency that the country will become a full member state.<\/p><p>There are benefits for both sides.  Irish citizens will now have the full right to work in Croatia, just as Croatians will have the right to work here.  That could be of benefit because there are many skills we have here that might have not been developed to the same level in Croatia.  I have been to Zagreb and other parts of Croatia and I agree with Senator White that it is extraordinarily beautiful country, as is Ireland.  As a former trade Minister, I know we have the opportunity to promote Irish trade in Croatia.  We have a relationship with them, and these things matter a lot because Ireland has proved to be a friend of Croatia.  The skills that were built up here during the years of the property bubble for architects, engineers, builders, site workers and specialists who would add to the workforce in Croatia, will help it develop dramatically.<\/p><p>Croatia has a very close relationship with Germany.  Many Germans have holiday homes in Croatia and both countries have relations that go back quite some time.  The relationship we have with Germany is extremely productive.  When I was Minister, we were always welcome in Germany, as we will be in future in Croatia.<\/p><p>The one regrettable point is that when we voted for the Lisbon treaty, people did not realise we would lose an MEP because Croatia has become a member state.  It is not Croatia's fault; it is a result of the arrangement of the European Union that the limit is 751 MEPs.  If another country becomes a member state, such as Turkey, we will end up with six MEPs, the same as Malta or Luxembourg.  That is a very difficult situation for the country.  We need good MEPs in Europe and more of them, but we will get fewer.<\/p><p>The restructuring of constituencies is yet to be decided.  I note the Government did not veto the reduction, at least at this point.  Perhaps there have been discussions at Cabinet level we do not know about.  The veto could still potentially be used although there is still a limit to the number of MEPs.  If Germany lost one or two MEPs, it would not matter too much, they are closer to the centre of power.  On the periphery of Europe, Ireland needs extra MEPs and we should negotiate for that.  It is a fact that we are the most isolated country in Europe, with all the others being on the European mainland.<\/p><p>From tourism and industrial points of view we are on a winner and the Government is to be commended for being courageous enough to offer full free access to our labour market, even though we are under pressure.  Equally, Croatia is under pressure and, on balance, it is of benefit to this State to have free access to this member state, as it will be beneficial to Croatia to have access to the Republic of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200012#L00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1371034800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We do not see him as often as we would wish but hopefully in years to come we will remedy that.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill.  We have dealt with Croatian accession on previous occasions in a more substantive way, with a welcome from all Members for that development.  The bringing together of Europe continues apace.  It was 20 years ago last week when I attended the famous Eurovision Song Contest in Millstreet in County Cork.  Dublin was very excited at the time at the concept of such an event being held in a rural town without a hotel but it was an extraordinary success.  That night was the first occasion when the new countries that had emerged from behind the Iron Curtain appeared on the international stage.  There was huge excitement and emotion at the arrival of Croatia and Bosnia and other countries that had previously been suppressed.  We have travelled significantly since then and bringing those countries into the European Union and its development is something we must all welcome.<\/p><p>The legislation relates to labour law and employment rights.  Of course at a time when there is such significant unemployment in the country, people's reaction is that we must ensure there are jobs for Irish people and we must protect those jobs.  We must also have vision.  The tradition of Irish people working abroad was beneficial not just for those working abroad but to their families at home and we must be as generous as we can when allowing EU citizens to work in this country and therefore I support the Bill. <\/p><p>Senator Leyden spoke about the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament.  Decisions have not yet been finalised but it looks like Ireland will lose a seat.  The Senator made a valid point about Irish representation in the European Parliament, which is now down to 11 seats out of a Parliament of 751.  I attended the Garrett FitzGerald memorial lecture given by Brendan Halligan, who served with distinction in the Oireachtas and who is now very much a scholar of European politics.  He made a pertinent point about the importance of Irish representation in the European Parliament, stressing the fact that when we now have only 12 Members out of 751 Members so the quality of those representatives and their work is of huge significance to the country.  He posed the question of what sort of electoral system should be in place to elect the 12 Members to represent Ireland on a stage that has 751 Members.  He reminded us that when we acceded to the EEC in 1973, the Government suggested that unlike our electoral formula for D&aacute;il elections, there should be a different electoral formula for the European Parliament.  The proposal, however, was dropped and we ended up with a multi-seat PR system.  As the Government will put in place the commission to redraw the European constituencies, there is no constitutional provision underpinning of the electoral system to the European Parliament and we should consider this.  <\/p> <p>We need to put forward a premier league team, rather than people who will be lost in the big debates taking place in Europe.  I ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, and others to consider this in view of the importance of having people of significant and weighty political ability on the European stage.  For this reason, we must reflect on the electoral system and constituencies for electing Members of the European Parliament.  As early as 40 years ago, Governments were wondering what was the best system for electing people to the European Parliament.  Now, 40 years later, we should reflect again on the issue. <\/p><p>I apologise for wandering from the substance of the Bill.  I support this legislation, which is about being generous.  Our country has benefited from the generosity of other countries.  Unfortunately, men and women from this country had to emigrate to find work found but they benefited from the generosity of other countries on many occasions.  We, too, must be generous. <\/p><p>We will have many more debates with the Minister on the Government's agenda for job creation, which must be the primary purpose of government.  It is great that the European project continues apace and a Continent once divided by an iron curtain and threatened by nuclear holocaust is now peaceful and prosperous.  I hope this will continue to be the case in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200012#L00300","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371035400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill and has consistently supported Croatia's accession to the European Union and EU enlargement generally.  As the Minister will be aware, however, my party has difficulties with the political, social and economic direction Europe has taken in the past 20 years and the democratic deficit in the Union.  Notwithstanding these reservations, we fully respect the decision of the people of Croatia to join the European Union and we do not have any objection to ratifying Croatian membership of the EU.  Having met the criteria laid down in law, we welcome the country's membership of the European Union.<\/p><p>As Sinn F&eacute;in has argued previously, Croatian workers should not be discriminated against in the European Union.  They should be allowed to travel where they wish, as other EU citizens do.  The purpose of the legislation is to allow Croatian nationals to access the Irish labour market, while not conferring any greater rights than those included in Croatia's treaty of accession signed on 9 December 2011.  Croatia will become the European Union's 28th member state.  Ireland signed the instrument of ratification for the Croatian accession treaty on 21 September 2012.  The ratification process by the parliaments of all 27 member states is expected to conclude by the end of June 2013.  For this reason, the legislation must be enacted by 1 July 2013 to ensure the full accession of Croatia to the European Union.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not seek to delay the Bill. <\/p><p>The main provisions of the Bill are to give Croatian nationals employment rights equivalent to other EU nationals for the first two years after accession, ensure family members of Croatian nationals have the same entitlements as family members of other EU nationals and provide that Croatian nationals who have equivalent EU employment rights do not need an employment permit.  These measures make sense and are supported by Sinn F&eacute;in.   I welcome the legislation on the basis that Croatian nationals should be afforded the same opportunities as other EU citizens to access employment in Ireland. <\/p><p>I propose to make some general comments on the accession of Croatia.  As I indicated, Croatian citizens voted for accession and given that the country met the standards set for it, there can be no argument about its entitlement to join the European Union.  However, the Union is far from a bed of roses as it has been experiencing an economic crisis for many years and unemployment in the EU currently stands at record levels.  A neoliberal agenda lies at the heart of the European project.  Many people have genuine concerns about the political aspect of the project as the European Union is moving from a Union in which independent states protected their sovereignty and respectively sought to find ways to co-operate to one in which the larger members states, specifically France and Germany, are coming to dominate. A wider debate is needed about the direction the European Union is taking.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in's approach to Europe has always been one of critical engagement.  While we are enthusiastic supporters of the concept of Europe and the European project and Community, we have difficulties with the willingness of the State to cede sovereignty in many areas in recent decades.  We need to have a conversation about a social Europe.  Many social democratic and socialist parties believe in a social Europe and want the EU to play a clear role and do much work on women's rights, poverty, human and environmental rights.  While many good European directives have been implemented in all of these areas, we appear to be moving from a social Europe towards a different type of Europe.  This is a cause of concern for many citizens, as the Irish people have shown in rejecting several treaties, even if we passed them when pressure was exerted a second time.  The rejection of treaties by Irish people was a clear manifestation of the general concern among the public about the direction in which Europe is moving.  This concern needs to be factored into discussions as we seek to expand the European Union in the process of enlargement which Sinn F&eacute;in supports. <\/p><p>Senators referred to the loss of an MEP for Ireland.  Despite political differences, the 15 MEPs from this island have worked together and, to borrow a phrase, pulled on the green jersey and worked on behalf of the country, North and South.  This has been highly beneficial and the loss of one MEP would be regrettable.  It is unfortunate that the Government did not proactively engage on this issue and failed to mount any significant opposition to the loss of an MEP.  It is only fair that candidates for the next European Parliament elections know what are the new constituency boundaries.  Some of those who contested the most recent local elections were unsure of the boundaries of the new local authority constituencies, although this issue has since been addressed by the Boundary Commission.  It is important that candidates for the European Parliament are made aware of the exact boundaries of their constituency and given an opportunity to properly canvass and plan for the forthcoming European Parliament elections.

I also hope we will continue to have a constructive debate on the future of the European project and the direction in which the European Union is moving. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200013#M00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1371035400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions and welcome the broad consensus on the legislation.  To paraphrase Senator Leyden, one of the first lessons one learns in economics is that trade and economic interaction deliver mutual gains.  This lesson remains very much at the heart of the European Union.  Great benefits are realised from trading across borders and the free movement of goods and people and this has been a pillar of the European Union.<\/p><p>As Senator Bacik noted, there is a deeper significance to this legislation.  Croatia has been in the cauldron of many of the great divisions that have afflicted the western world.  The country is located on the boundary between the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires, the Orthodox and Catholic religions and Islam and Christianity.  Virtually every divide in Europe has criss-crossed the countries that made up the former Yugoslavia.  Croatia now follows Slovenia into the European Union.<\/p> <p>Acceptance of the <i>acquis<\/i>and the opportunity of a peace dividend, which will repair the wounds of a continent and in particular a country riven over many years of conflict, is an important context within which to see this.<\/p><p> As stated by Senator Mary White, the <i>acquis<\/i>is not only about labour rights but about political union.  The visit by the President, Michael D. Higgins, to Croatia last week showed the connections there that need to be built upon.  In terms of this provision, in European terms Croatia is a small labour market.  It has not had close connections of any great scale with the Irish labour market.  In terms of the argument about floods of people coming here, it is clear from the analysis that this will not happen.  <\/p><p> As stated by Senator Bradford, it is important that as a small country for whom migration has been an opportunity and lifeline, and which has in part made up this country over many years, we show generosity towards new members.  The goodwill which we are seeking to show towards another small country wishing to join the European Union is an important statement in terms of our political and diplomatic relations.  Some 13 member states of the 18 who have declared thus far have signalled that they will be giving full rights.  As such, most other member states are taking a similar line to Ireland.  <\/p><p> I will try to address the specific points raised.  Senator Healy Eames asked why we took a different position in respect of Romania and Bulgaria.  That decision was taken more than five years ago and not by the current Government.  I presume in weighing up its decision the then Government took account of the relative size of those countries.  The combined population of Romania and Bulgaria represented a labour market of 13.5 million as compared to a labour market of 1.8 million in Croatia.  As such, there may have been more arguments around the potential for disruption and so on.  Last year, we removed the remaining restrictions on Romania and Bulgaria such that they now have full access to the Irish labour market at this point.<\/p><p> Senators Healy Eames and Mary White also asked about the significance of the two year period.  The manner in which the new treaty has been structured provides for different phases of entitlement.  In the first two years, there is a right of restriction and in the following years different provisions prevail.  Having different sections for two years and for a specified period thereafter is reflective of provisions within the original treaty of accession.  It is treated differently in different sections of the Bill to reflect the different provisions in the parent accession treaty.  We can deal with that further on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> I thank Senators Clune, Mary White, Bacik, Healy Eames, Noone, Leyden, Bradford and Cullinane for their contributions, which have been very useful and reflect the goodwill most people would show towards Croatia's decision to accede to membership of the European Union.  Senator Cullinane raised issues that went beyond discussions on this particular treaty.  The European Union is not a perfect body.  No one would say it is.  However, the concept behind it, of 27 member states - soon to be 28 - being willing to share sovereignty to achieve things together that they cannot achieve on their own is an important bulwark against the type of divisions and wars witnessed in the past.  It has the potential for good.  One can criticise the manner in which the Union has handled this crisis but on reflection of the crisis during the past three years it is evident that Europe has evolved.  Things that seemed to be impossible at the start of the crisis are now being freely done.  It is bolstering people's opportunities.  I do not pretend it is a perfect model.  It never will be.  A model based on unanimity among 28 member states will in terms of make-up always be part camel rather than horse.  It has been a great help to Ireland.  It is hoped it will be a similar help to Croatia as it moves to join.<\/p><p> A number of Senators raised the issue of the impact on representation in the European Parliament.  I have taken note of the points made and will pass them on to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, within whose remit this issue comes, although the boundaries will be set by the Commission.  Senator Bradford asked whether we should be moving away from PR for the selection of MEPs.  The UK, which is the bastion of the first past the post system, opted to go for PR for the selection of its European candidates in order to ensure it achieved a more balanced representation.  There are others who believe ours is a good system of selection for the European Parliament.  Nonetheless, I take the Senator's point.<\/p><p> I again thank Senators for their courtesy and interest in this issue and for their unanimous support for it, which of itself is not something that happens every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200013#M00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371036000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1371036000,"counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200014#N00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1371036000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200014#N00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1371036000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>As there are no amendments to this Bill, with the permission of the House we will proceed to Committee Stage now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200014#N00400","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1371036000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Usually during Private Members' time the Gallery is filled with representative organisations but youth organisations are at present gathered at a round table in the Civic Offices at Wood Quay hosted by the National Youth Council of Ireland and the European Youth Forum to discuss the implementation of the youth guarantee and the role for youth organisations in the future.  I hope the Minister will make contact with these organisations to discuss the feedback from that round table.<\/p><p>  Last week, I organised a conference in County Cavan on the youth guarantee which was attended by representatives of youth organisations, the European Commission and Parliament and other organisations with an interest in the matter.  The broad discussion we had at that conference included contributions from a considerable number of young people.  Several of the points I will be making today arose in that discussion and I will put a number of questions to the Minister that I hope she will be able to answer.<\/p><p>  The motion sets out statistics on youth unemployment drawn from the CSO and Eurofound.  They make for depressing reading, with 53,800 people under the age of 25 listed as officially unemployed and 24,100 fewer young people in employment now compared to last year.  Since this Government took office, the number of young people in the labour force has shrunk by 14%, which equates to 34,100 young people who are no longer in the labour market.  The number of young people not in employment, education or training in Europe equates to the population of the seven smallest member states of the EU.  That is a harrowing figure.<\/p><p>  While some of the young people who have left the labour market have gone into full-time education or training, most have emigrated in search of work or disengaged from local employment services.  Many of the youth organisations I have consulted regard the Government's response as completely inadequate given the scale of the crisis facing young people.  Only four of the 333 recommendations in the Action Plan for Jobs published in February related to young people.  That is simply not good enough.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister why the Government has decided to locate the youth guarantee within the Department of Social Protection rather than the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  What role will the latter Department play in the pilot project and eventual State-wide youth guarantee scheme?  The representative from the European Commission Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, Catherine Blair, who attended our conference on Friday, stated that the issue will not go away on its own because young people need specific support.  It will require a cross-departmental action plan and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation cannot shirk its responsibility in that regard.<\/p><p>  The announcement in February of EU funding for youth employment initiatives, including the guarantee, is welcome but I share the concerns expressed by others, including the European Youth Forum, that the &euro;6 billion allocated to these initiatives is nowhere near enough even to begin to address the problem.  I am also concerned about the gradual implementation of the scheme.  The Council recommendation on the youth guarantee called for schemes to be implemented at the earliest opportunity, while stating that member states with budgetary difficulties or high numbers of young people not in employment, education or training could consider more gradual implementation.  However, we seem to have interpreted the recommendation as requiring us to adopt a more gradual implementation of the schemes.  Why have we adopted this gradual approach despite our high level of youth unemployment?  Given the social and economic consequences, the problems of youth unemployment and emigration cannot be put on a waiting list until the economic situation improves.  Some 14% of young people under the age of 25 have left the labour market in the two years since this Government was formed.<\/p> <p>If we wait any longer, we will only exacerbate the problem even further.<\/p><p>How is the Government proceeding in respect of the timescale for the implementation of the guarantee in the current circumstances?  What criteria are being used and what type of phasing is involved?  From the presentation that was made on the youth guarantee, I understand the Commission is very keen to obtain action plans from the various governments in the context of the roll out.  I sensed some frustration with regard to the slow response from various member states on how the guarantee is to be rolled out.  The Commission wants to hit the ground running from 1 January next.  Has the Government developed a plan and forwarded it to the Commission?  If not, will the Minister indicate when this will be done?  I do not believe we should exit our Presidency - at the core of which has been the youth guarantee - without having our own blueprint in place.<\/p><p>The Ballymun pilot project is very welcome but I have a number of concerns.  When will the project be up and running, when will the various stakeholders be brought together, how will it be evaluated and how will the lessons learned be transferred to other areas, particularly those with less well developed community supports?  Is the Minister in a position to provide a guarantee to the effect that youth organisations will be centrally involved in all aspects of the pilot project and the subsequent State-wide youth guarantee?<\/p><p>We are all aware that the cost of youth unemployment is massive.  According to one study, the economy loses &euro;3.16 billion annually as a result of our high level of youth unemployment.  This roughly equates to 2% of GDP.  The cost for young people and their families and communities is equally devastating in economic, social and emotional terms.  There is going to be a demographic fallout from our high level of youth unemployment and it prompts us to inquire as to who is going to pay for pensions in the future.  The guarantee should not just revolve around putting people in quality jobs today, it should also be about preventing poverty and social exclusion into the future.  That is why we need a youth guarantee scheme which is going to assist the 53,800 young people who are currently unemployed to get into training or employment.<\/p><p>I firmly believe that the design, implementation, governance and ongoing evaluation of this scheme should involve the relevant Government Departments, employment services, educational and training services, employers, youth services, youth advocacy organisations and young people.  A phrase that was used at the conference I organised was &quot;Nationally led but locally delivered&quot;.  Timo Mulari of Allianssi, the national youth council of Finland, used the term &quot;public private people partnership&quot; in the context of the implementation of the guarantee.  That is something which is very important.<\/p><p>If we learn from previous experience, then the scheme should focus on the long-term unemployed, those with low skill levels, those who are furthest from the labour market and those who are not currently engaging with employment services or who are not involved in formal education or training.  Our public employment services have a crucial role to play and they need to be fit for purpose.  We need to obtain a real and accurate sense of the number of young people who are unemployed.  The scheme should be open to all and not just to those who are currently registered with the public employment services.  As everyone is aware, there are many people who are hidden from the live register.  These individuals may not, for example, be eligible for jobseeker's benefit or allowance.  In addition, they may not be on the radar for some other reason.<\/p><p>An individual needs assessment and personal plan will be required for each person who engages with the youth guarantee process.  An important point was raised this morning to the effect that we need to track youths who engage with the youth guarantee system and we must ensure that we are not just shifting them from one scheme to another.  We must examine how we can create sustainable situations for them in the aftermath of the initial couple of months for which they are on the youth guarantee scheme.  It emerged earlier today that there are no statistics for 39% of those youths who engaged with the youth guarantee scheme in Finland.  This means that the Finnish authorities do not know what happened to 39% of those who were involved with the scheme.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that tracking is put in place.<\/p><p>Many young people attended last weekend's conference and gave voice to their concerns.  One of those concerns relates to the fact that they do not necessarily want to be employees but rather they want to be employers.  These young people want to start their own businesses and become entrepreneurs.  However, they cannot obtain access to funding and neither can they get loans guaranteed.  The youth guarantee will ensure that all young people under the age of 25 receive an offer of good quality employment, continuing education, apprenticeship or traineeship within a period of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  What is going to be incorporated into the guarantee for young people who are unemployed, who want to start their own businesses and who may not require education, training or an apprenticeship?  I refer here to individuals who have the idea, who possess the necessary drive and who are ready to go.<\/p><p>My final point relates to costs.  If 53,800 of those under 25 are officially unemployed and if best practice - as highlighted by the National Youth Council - places the cost per participant in the scheme at approximately &euro;6,600, we will need approximately &euro;335 million in order to deal with these people.  As already stated, those who are off the radar are not included in the 53,800.  With youth unemployment so rampant across Europe, our leaders should be collectively considering how we might move towards the estimate produced by the International Labour Organization, ILO, of &euro;21 billion being required to combat youth unemployment as opposed to the &euro;6 billion which has been set aside.  Would it be possible for the Government to make strides in this regard either prior to the end of Ireland's Presidency or before the meeting of EU Labour Ministers is held in Berlin on 3 July?  Who will be representing Ireland at that meeting?<\/p><p>I referred to the creation of sustainable situations for those exiting the youth guarantee.  The Minister, in an article she co-authored, argued in favour of more investment in growth.  How are we going to invest in the jobs that will be required in order to get young people who are currently out of work back into employment post the youth guarantee?  What is going to be brought forward in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200015#O00200","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371037200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I second the motion.

She only has one friend left who is her own age.  The only reason that girl has remained is because she is a single mother and cannot afford to leave.<\/p><p>  It is important to note what the motion states.  From the point of view of their amendment, those on the Government side appear to have stuck their heads in the sand to some degree.  The motion states:<blockquote>That Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes that:- 30.4% of under 25s were officially unemployed in 2012;<br \/>- this is the fifth highest rate of youth unemployment in the eurozone, after Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy;<br \/>- our youth unemployment rate has more than trebled since 2007;<br \/>- 53,800 under 25 were officially unemployed at the end of March 2013;<br \/>- the cost of youth unemployment to the Exchequer is estimated to be &euro;3.16 billion annually;<br \/>- the number of young people in employment has fallen by 24,100 in the last 12 months;<br \/>- since Fine Gael and Labour took office the number of under 25s in the labour force has fallen by 34,500;<br \/>- 31,181 under 25 emigrated in the year up to April 2012;<br \/>- 18% of young people are not in education or employment or training, the fourth highest rate in the EU;<br \/>- of the 333 actions listed in the 2013 Action Plan on Jobs only four relate to young people;<br \/>- the European Council Recommendation of February 2013 announcing a youth employment initiative with a fund of &euro;6 billion, while welcome, is not sufficiently resourced;<br \/>- the International Labour Organization has called for an investment of &euro;21 billion EU wide to tackle youth unemployment;<br \/>- the proposed youth guarantee pilot project in Ballymun, while welcome, may not be up and running until 2014;<\/blockquote>However, the Government amendment advocates the deletion of all words after &quot;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&quot; and suggests a replacement text.  What is the problem with the facts outlined in the original motion, which are true?  If we are going to tackle the issue of youth unemployment, we must be realistic and acknowledge the facts.  There is nothing in the motion which castigates the Government or its policies.  Neither does lay blame at the door of this Administration as opposed to a previous one.  That is the <i>status quo<\/i> and surely we must acknowledge this fact.  I call on all Government Senators to support the motion in the sense that it at least acknowledges the location of the starting point.  Let us admit that a difficulty exists and let us consider how we can move on from it.<\/p><p>  The motion tabled by Senator Reilly clearly and concisely highlights the lack of action on the part of the Government in respect of this matter.  It is in stark contrast to the Government's amendment, which is actually quite laughable.  Everyone is familiar with the adage &quot;Lies, damn lies and statistics&quot;.  The Government's amendment is an exercise in finding any kind of statistic in order to justify its position, while denying the truth of what is actually happening.<\/p><p>  Those on the Government side are sticking their heads in the sand if they believe they are offering anything like a reasonable defence.  I ask them, therefore, to withdraw their amendment.  The amendment notes that the number of young people unemployed is down to 53,800, a reduction of 26,800.  However, as the motion indicates, the number of young people in employment has fallen by 24,100 in the past 12 months.<\/p> <p>We note that the number of under 25s in employment has fallen by 34,500 since Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office.  What does that tell us?  It tells us that the numbers in employment are not due to any increase in population but are due to the inordinate levels of emigration which are blighting Ireland.  We all know the situation, and the Government is kidding itself if it believes that it is dealing with the matter. We all know families where a mother has had to see two, three or more children travel to the far side of the world to seek work because there is nothing here.  We see families separated, and towns and villages emptied of young people.  That is particularly evident in communities along the west coast; I see it at home in Connemara.<\/p><p>We had a course at Easter of student teachers who went to Carraroe to learn Irish, and I was asked to talk to them.  Towards the end of the presentation I asked the approximately 200 teachers how many of them expected to have a job as a teacher in Ireland within the next three or four years.  Approximately 10% of them expected to still be here at that time.  That shows a huge lack of hope among the youth in that particular sector in terms of their future prospects of finding full-time employment as teachers here.<\/p><p>Shops and pubs that were once thriving are now struggling.  GAA clubs are struggling to put 15 players on the pitch yet we see clubs in London and Warrington thriving, and clubs in Sydney and Melbourne have greater numbers than ever.  If the Minister is wondering where the 26,800 who were on the dole are gone, they are not gone into jobs.  They are most likely gone into employment but they are in Perth, Dubai or Toronto.  Some 31,181 emigrated in the year up to April 2012, and many more have emigrated since.<\/p><p>The issue of emigration is closely related to the issue of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, as it is the category between the ages of 22 and 35 who are most likely to be mobile.  The key solution to the emigration crisis is to solve the unemployment crisis but the Government has effectively done nothing.  It points to the pilot project in Ballymun but as the motion notes, it will be 2014 before we even see that, and that is a mere pilot.  We can take it that it will be at least two years before the vast bulk of the population sees any benefit from that.<\/p><p>The motion notes that the youth guarantee needs more funding - currently, it has only &euro;6 billion - and that the employment issue is the real issue, particularly in rural areas.  The role of LDCs is unsure, and they are key to creating employment in rural areas, as is the capital budget in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  This issue must be targeted in conjunction with the employment targets that have to be set down, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200016#P00200","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371037800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote><br \/>To delete all words after ''Seanad &Eacute;ireann'' and substitute the following:<br \/>''notes that:-- the number of people in employment grew by 20,500 in the year ending March 2013, compared with a reduction of employment of 50,100 in the year ending March 2011;<br \/>-- the rate of unemployment in Ireland has fallen to 13.7% at the end of Quarter 1 2013, down from 15% in Q1 2012;<br \/>-- the number of people unemployed at the end of Quarter 1 2013 is 292,000, down 30,000 on Q1 2012;<br \/>-- the number of unemployed young people aged under 25 has fallen by a third to 53,800 since it peaked in 2009, a reduction of 26,800;<br \/>-- notwithstanding these positive developments, unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment, remains a serious concern;<br \/>-- the Government has prioritised actions to stimulate employment creation and reduce unemployment under the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work Strategies;<br \/>-- the Government has also prioritised Youth Unemployment as an issue to be addressed during Ireland's term as President of the European Union.

That is because young people tend to be the most junior employees in an organisation and they also tend to work in sectors such as retail and services, which feel the brunt of any reduction in demand.  It is crucial, therefore, that an effective strategy is in place to tackle youth unemployment before it becomes prolonged and systemic.<\/p><p>In the first instance, the Government's primary strategy to reduce youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  Past experience suggests that youth unemployment can be expected to fall relatively rapidly when recovery takes hold.  That is the good point.<\/p><p>In this context, although there is a long way to go, the Government has stabilised the economy and economic growth has returned at a modest level, but it has returned.  It must be remembered that in the period after 2009, the bank guarantee period, the economy lost 250,000 jobs.  That haemorrhaging of jobs in that period after the bank guarantee was an enormous shock to unemployment in this country at every age level, but most particularly for young people.  <\/p><p>Official labour market figures published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, recently indicate that the number of unemployed people aged under 25 has fallen by 10,000 on the same time a year earlier to approximately 54,000.  The statistics cited by the Sinn F&eacute;in Members are wrong.  I do not know if that matters much to Sinn F&eacute;in but they are wrong.  I am not sure who did the research but the other figures cited in their presentation are wrong.  For instance, it is not true that the number of young people in the labour force has fallen by 24,000 in the past 12 months.  The number of young people in unemployment has decreased by fewer than 4,000.  In a range of 50,000 people the Senators' figures are dramatically wrong.  If they are trying to forecast economic growth, they should try to work with the correct figures.<\/p><p>One of the obvious reasons we have these changes is to do with demographic patterns.  If the Senators check with the CSO it will tell them the demographic patterns.  In addition, as a consequence of the recession, and I am sure everybody here knows this, huge numbers of young people have chosen to remain in education.  That is a factor.  Emigration and the distress it causes is also a factor but I strongly suggest the Senators should check with the CSO or get their researchers to verify the facts with the CSO because the figures they are using are wrong.<\/p><p>The official labour market figures published by the CSO show that they have fallen by 10,000 on the same time a year earlier.  That is a positive.  The unemployment rate for young people has fallen from 29.7% to 26.6% over the same period.  This downward movement in unemployment has bucked the trend in the EU as a whole, and that is important in the context of Ireland, where youth unemployment has continued to rise.<\/p><p>Furthermore, in the most recent 12-month period, virtually all the decline in youth unemployment was accounted for by a fall in the number of young people who were out of work for a year or more.  From the comments made by Senator Reilly I understood that her concern is specifically about young people in the younger age group.  I ask her to check the statistics because there are things that the people of Ireland have worked hard for and she should recognise and acknowledge that we are doing better than a huge number of other countries.  Our rate is very high.  We are not the fourth or fifth highest; we come after about eight other countries.  The Senator should check the facts.  It is hoped that the trend will continue as the economy recovers.  Specifically, there is a requirement for specific national and EU-wide strategies to address the youth unemployment crisis.<\/p><p>I will start by discussing the European context because of the Government's role in securing an EU-wide youth guarantee and the crucial discussions now taking place on the way the guarantee will be implemented.  These are very important.<\/p><p>Youth unemployment is an EU-wide crisis.  The number of young people not in education, employment or training across Europe is estimated at 7.5 million.  For that reason, the youth guarantee was identified as a major agenda item to be delivered during the Irish Presidency of the EU.  Senator Reilly asked the reason I was involved.  It is because of the catastrophic fall in employment that I mentioned earlier that I identified this as a priority, as I have done regarding other initiatives by my Department, particularly JobBridge, to help young people get work experience and get on the ladder to work.  As the Senator is aware, my colleague, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, has significantly expanded a wide range of opportunities for young people in regard to education.<\/p><p>The EU's response since the outbreak of the financial crisis has largely been a fiscal one.  That is the reason the Irish Government chose to make the European-wide framework for a youth guarantee a priority for the Presidency.  I have long argued that there must be a social response to ensure the effects of the crisis on our people are lessened.  The youth guarantee will be a crucial step in that regard.<\/p> <p>The Government and the Department were at the forefront of securing agreement on the adoption of the EU Council recommendation on the youth guarantee.  The recommendation received political agreement at the EPSCO Council meeting of social affairs and employment ministers on 28 February under my chairmanship and was formally adopted in April.  There was very wide welcome and support for it because the Commission's initial documentation had only been signed off at the end of December.  It is a mark of how concerned countries throughout Europe are that they were able, under the Irish chairmanship, to agree to the framework of the youth guarantee being adopted in February.<\/p><p>The recommendation states member states should ensure all young people under the age of 25 receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  As part of the European Council agreement on the 2014-2020 EU budget, it was decided, in association with the agreement on the youth guarantee, to provide &euro;6 billion for a new youth employment initiative for regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment.  This funding will consist of &euro;3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion from a new youth employment budget line.  While it is recommended that the guarantee should be implemented as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation could be more gradual in some member states experiencing the most severe budgetary difficulties and higher rates of youth unemployment.  However, it is crucial to maintain momentum in terms of implementation of the recommendation.<\/p><p>At EU level, the Irish Presidency, particularly the T&aacute;naiste and I, have pushed strongly for early production of implementation plans in all member states.  The Commission has backed the Irish Government's approach that we should try to front-load this for countries with severe youth unemployment difficulties.  This is under negotiation.  I will be in Luxembourg at the end of next week and I hope the member states will agree to do this.  The European Parliament has been very positive, particularly the socialist group, in pushing the youth guarantee and was doing so two years ago when it was not a very fashionable idea.  I am not sure Sinn F&eacute;in was that taken with it when it was first discussed.  It did not seem to like the idea, no more than it liked the JobBridge idea.  None the less, the idea has gained general acceptability and support.  I hope it will be advanced further at the Heads of State meeting.<\/p><p>For our part, the Government will review the range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the guarantee.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the guarantee before the end of 2013.  The Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a youth guarantee in Ireland.  In this regard, we have sought funding from the European Commission for a proposed pilot youth guarantee project in the Ballymun area of north Dublin.  Numerous organisations, such as IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre and the National Youth Council of Ireland, have agreed to participate in the pilot.  Last year, I launched an initiative on a pilot basis specifically referencing young people with a disability in the Border, midlands and west region through European funds.  These projects are under way as we speak throughout the region and are very positive.<\/p><p>More generally, the scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular on the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  While recent trends have been positive in this regard, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private sector recruitment and supports for self-employment.  As Senators are aware, there is a review of apprenticeship in Ireland.  Apprenticeship as we know it collapsed with the collapse of the construction boom.  In any event, the old-style apprenticeship largely recruited young men and there were relatively few apprenticeships for young women, except in the areas of hairdressing and beauty.<\/p><p>Returning to the issue of the EU funds, the European Commission has published its legislative proposal for this initiative, which in the first instance will have to be considered by the Council and then, in turn, negotiated with the European Parliament.  The timing of the expenditure for this initiative and the distribution of the funding throughout EU regions is not yet clear because the negotiations are ongoing.  The Irish Government will over the coming weeks, while we still hold the EU Presidency, explore the possibility of front-loading funding towards the beginning of the forthcoming EU budget period which will run from 2014 to 2020.  I do not want to pre-empt a final decision on funding but it is expected the Border, midland and west region and the south and east region will qualify for funding.  Perhaps some of the funding under the UK package, if it decides to be involved, will apply with regard to Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly spoke about young people.  I am extremely anxious to develop a programme with regard to young people and unemployment which would specifically include young people with disabilities, whether intellectual or physical disabilities, and I hope the Seanad supports this.  It is very important they should be included.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion does not address this, but it is important that the various organisations seek to be as inclusive as possible in this regard.  We have put forward and discussed proposals on young entrepreneurs and I have had an opportunity to meet organisations of young people representing young entrepreneurs.  This is positive.  I also think young people who have a disability ought to be in the programme, and I hope, as Minister, to be able to influence this.<\/p><p>The Government has a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market.  We have initiatives on education, training, job search assistance and guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  The JobBridge national internship scheme overseen by the Department is focused on providing work experience to young people.  A recent independent evaluation of the scheme by Indecon Economic Consultants indicates that three out of five of those who complete their internships subsequently progress into paid employment.  In the short period since it started, more than 17,000 people have participated, and it is gratifying to note that five months after they have completed an internship, more than 60% of young people have secured further employment.  This is very positive because in a tight labour market, very good young people coming out with various levels of qualification find the labour market is closed and they hit a brick wall.  This is what often makes it very depressing for them.<\/p><p>In the December budget, I secured funding for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes, including JobBridge, T&uacute;s and community employment.<\/p> <p>Approximately one quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people.  The Youthreach programme provides 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience places for early school leavers who do not have qualifications or vocational training and are between 15 and 20 years of age.  The back to education allowance, which my Department runs, provides income maintenance for unemployed people.  More than 20,000 people are on this scheme, of whom approximately 6,000 are less than 25 years of age.  This scheme provides an important opportunity.<\/p><p>Approximately 12,000 people under 25 years of age completed training courses with F&Aacute;S in 2012, including apprenticeships and evening courses.  This year, MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions as part of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is being rolled out by the Department of Education and Skills.  In the next month, I will launch a new initiative that I have developed and that I mentioned at the time of the budget, entitled JobsPlus.  Under this scheme, an employer will receive an incentive of &euro;7,500 for recruiting a person who has been unemployed and on the live register for between 12 and 24 months.  The employer will also receive an incentive of &euro;10,000 over a period for recruiting a person who has been unemployed for two years or more.  At a typical starting wage, this incentive will cover approximately &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer's wage costs.  I will launch it next month.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative, as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment.<\/p><p>The original Action Plan for Jobs set out a target of 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016.  Many of these will be filled by young people.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection's Pathways to Work strategy includes targets for increasing the number of long-term unemployed people moving into employment.  Specifically, we want to return 75,000 long-term unemployed people to employment and to increase the exit rate of people on the live register for two years or more by 50% by the end of 2015.  We also want to reduce the persistence rate - the rate at which short-term unemployed people become long-term unemployed - to 25% by the end of 2015.  As more than two out of every five young unemployed people are long-term unemployed, these targets are important to young people.<\/p><p>As the Minister for Social Protection, I have a specific concern in this regard.  Our young people represent a wonderful resource for Ireland.  As a country, we have invested heavily in their education and care.  Parents, families and communities have also invested heavily in this regard.  Everyone wants the best for them.  To answer Senator Reilly's question, I became involved because this represents a significant opportunity for Ireland.  My job and that of the Labour Party - this is why we are called the Labour Party - is to help young people and their families to return to work.  The best way to do so is to put in place educational and training structures that meet the needs of modern labour markets.  We are receiving a great deal of foreign direct investment, FDI, and we must ensure that our young people are able to fill the ensuing jobs.  We must also ensure that our young people have the confidence and encouragement to participate in employment.<\/p><p>I assure the House that the issue of youth unemployment, indeed, overall unemployment, is a priority for the Government.  We will know that the economy has recovered when the unemployment figures drop, the banking issues are sorted and life returns to the construction sector, which traditionally employed many young people before the crash began in 2008.  It is important that the young people who entered the apprenticeship system at the height of the Celtic tiger with the promise of work experience, only to be left without sponsors when the property market crashed half way through their apprenticeships, are offered the opportunity to complete their training, albeit perhaps in different fields.  We need to be able to provide such training and education so that young people can use their skills in the workplace.  We will do this through apprenticeships, internships, traineeships, State work experience, employment schemes and employer-subsidised jobs.<\/p><p>We need to examine the countries that have been the most successful in reducing their levels of youth unemployment, for example, Germany, Austria and Finland.  The latter two are small countries and working closely with employers has been one of the keys to their success.  My Department is building in this regard so that people can work from an early age in a training and education context so that they can gain experience of employment as they complete their educations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200017#Q00400","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371039000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il strongly supports the motion.  The Minister has picked holes in the statistics, but there is no doubt that people of all ages and their families have been devastated by the economic crisis.  Young people have suffered the greatest toll by far in recent years.  This is true across Europe.  The Minister cited some statistics and the Sinn F&eacute;in motion cites others, but the statistics do not capture the scale of youth emigration.  Often, this element underplays the extent of youth unemployment, as tens of thousands of young people who have left Ireland are unaccounted for in the statistics.  They are not present to raise this issue because they are struggling to make lives for themselves elsewhere.  They worked hard to get the best possible education and enough points for college and they put in the effort and commitment required to get good degrees, only to find that there were no opportunities for them.  This is an important point.<\/p><p>The National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, published an excellent report recently entitled &quot;Time to Go? A Study of Youth Emigration in Ireland&quot;, on the impact of emigration on young Irish people.  We can argue the figures, but this debate should be taken as an opportunity to put our heads together and come up with solutions, not to make party political arguments.  This is my party's stance.  The motion made excellent suggestions.<\/p><p>I welcome Senator Reilly's comment on young entrepreneurs.  There is significant potential in harnessing their creativity and ideas.  With little investment or support, we could give them the tools necessary to create the businesses of the future.  They are well placed to do so.  We should use the remainder of our debate to make constructive suggestions.<\/p><p>Last year, Fianna F&aacute;il published a paper on youth unemployment.  We have the same concerns as those that have been mentioned.  For example, the Government has published a number of jobs initiatives in recent years, but no specific strategy on youth unemployment has been proposed.  While I welcome the Minister's initiatives relating to other aspects of her brief, for example, JobBridge, her willingness to review and change them to ensure they are fit for purpose and her overall commitment to the area, there is a wide cross-Government gap, in that a specific strategy on youth unemployment has not been introduced.  The European youth guarantee is a positive initiative, but it is significantly underfunded, given the figures announced today.<\/p> <p>More than 7 million young people are unemployed in the EU so the figures announced so far are probably only a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed.<\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge how good it is that work is being done on this on a European level, and that there is a co-ordinated response, because we are not in this on our own.  Other European countries are facing exactly the same problems we face and therefore we should put our heads together on an international level and come up with the most sensible strategy for addressing this on a continental basis.  At the same time there is no excuse for delay on a national basis.  There is nothing to stop the Government bringing forward a specific national strategy.  Of course each country will be required to submit implementation plans and suchlike as part of the European process but that is for down the road.  It is clear from the Minister's opening address that the process has started but there is still a way to go.  I fully support the efforts of the Minister and her colleagues to use the Irish Presidency to try to accelerate this pan-European effort.  That is very important but there is nothing to stop the Government focusing on the bringing forward of a national strategy ahead of what emerges in that regard.  We have already lost time in this area and cannot afford to lose any more.  To reiterate, too many young people have already left this country and they wonder if they will ever have a future here.  They are looking to us to put initiatives into place now, not next year or two, three or four years down the road.<\/p><p>Last year, for this reason, Fianna F&aacute;il published a specific strategy on youth unemployment.  I ask the Minister to take the time to consider some of the initiatives we put forward, in regard to internships and improving and extending the JobBridge programme, to ensure that people are offering real jobs.  I welcome the fact that many young people who are taking part in internship programmes get real jobs but there are also those who are being abused in the process.  I know several young people who are on their third or fourth internship, which I do not think was the original intention.  Internship should be for people who have the relevant education but need to get work experience that will help them to get inside the door elsewhere.  It is important to review the internship schemes and change them, but much more important is the need to create real jobs.  Instead of having people wondering if they are going to be volunteering endlessly or getting a slight top-up on their social welfare, we should create real jobs for young people.  Many of them cannot afford to stay here and will end up leaving if their only real choice is to find employment elsewhere.<\/p><p>I welcome this debate.  My party wants to be part of the solution to this problem and we see that as part of our role in constructive opposition.  I hope all of us can do the same, both in the remainder of this debate and in the future.  We should all put ideas out and work together on this.  There is a temptation for us to argue about the causes of the crisis and be party-political about its impact but people are looking to us, to Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn F&eacute;in, to put aside the politics and work together on sorting out the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200019#S00200","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371039600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her contribution to date and I acknowledge the work that has been done, by her and the T&aacute;naiste in particular, in progressing the youth guarantee and highlighting it during the period of Irish Presidency of the EU.  She has ensured it is front-loaded, which is very important.  This is a serious issue, not only for Ireland but across Europe.  We all know the figures.<\/p><p>We should put this in context.  We have lost very many jobs in this country, some hundreds of thousands.  Our unemployment level was over 14%, with jobs being lost in the construction sector in particular, which used to employ many young people, in retail, banking and many areas of the services sector.  I noted some business publications and news this week.  The latest news from the Department of Finance, its economic bulletin of this week, shows that for the second successive year we have had growth, 1.3% last year.  The  Department, the IMF, the Central Bank, the European Commission and the ESRI all forecast that the economy will recover in the next few years, with growth from a minimum of 2.2% to a maximum of 2.7%, and from next year to 2016 they forecast an improvement of some 2% in GDP.  That is positive and we should all acknowledge it.  The Minister has mentioned the employment figures, noting how the numbers of those in employment have increased, according to recent bulletins.  The figures for young people show they are gaining employment.  At present we are seeing improvements in all the headline figures that were so depressing and disappointing in recent years.  The services value index rose again, by 1.2% in April.  Irish bond yields rose as did loans to SMEs this week, as acknowledged by ISME.  Foreign direct investment continues to improve in this country.  Governments do not create jobs; they create the environment in which jobs are created.  The Minister has outlined her role in dealing with the difficulty young people have in gaining employment, a role that rests with her Department as well as with the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills.  <\/p><p>I will take issue with another point, if I may.  The Minister has dealt with the motion tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in but I refer to that party's statement that of the 333 actions listed in the action plan for jobs only four relate to young people.  That is completely untrue.  Every one of those actions relates to young people and to ensuring that jobs are created within a suitable environment.  I entirely refute that statement.<\/p><p>I mentioned the economy and how it is improving.  Slowly we are beginning to see a start whereby we can get this country back in action.  It is only by improving the economy that jobs can and will be created.  The Minister outlined in the budget of last December the additional places she has secured in a range of programmes, including JobBridge, T&uacute;s, and community employment, with 25% of these expected to be taken up by young unemployed people.  JobBridge in particular has been very successful.  This has been established by an independent survey from Indecon.  As the Minister noted, there have been 17,000 participants in the programme so far.  The most positive result seen in the independent report by Indecon into JobBridge is the fact that more than 60% of participants have gained employment.  It is an extremely positive and beneficial programme.  I encourage the Minister to continue with it, as I am sure she will, because it engages across not only the public and private sectors but also the voluntary sector.<\/p><p>No single solution will cure our current unemployment problem but a number of issues are being tackled.  Education and training are very important.  Job searching assistance and guiding, gaining work experience and encouraging job creation are what the action plan for jobs is about.   I particularly welcome the statement by the T&aacute;naiste last week in which he agreed an action plan on youth unemployment with the OECD.  From listening to OECD delegates reading their papers and hearing them speak on a number of occasions, I know they are really concerned about the level of youth unemployment, in particular throughout Europe.  They have much experience in dealing with challenges and I know they will work at close hand with the Government in addressing this issue.  The OECD calls continually for industry to engage in training structures, to offer either technical training or engage via third level institutes or universities to ensure the correct programmes and types of training are being developed so that young people can move into employment.<\/p><p>I refer to the entrepreneurship programme.  There was a debate in this House recently on entrepreneurship.  The microfinance scheme established by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, if not specifically targeted at young people, is available to them.  It is for traditional businesses that cannot get collateral or support from banks.  Funding is available, ranging from as little as &euro;2,000 to &euro;25,000.  I urge Senator Reilly to encourage those people to whom she speaks to participate in this scheme because funding is available directly for the type of businesses in which young people who want to start their own enterprise should engage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200020#T00200","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1371039600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome to the House.  I very much welcome that Senator Reilly and her colleagues tabled this motion.<\/p> <p>It is an important issue for us to debate, and considering the motion and amendment, one could see the glass as being half full or half empty.  Nevertheless, it is really important that we are discussing youth unemployment.  Unemployment, and specifically youth unemployment, is something that concerns us all across the House.  Nevertheless, focus should not be solely on employment as for the age group in question, this is the period in which they are most likely to be in education and training.  Unfortunately, the picture remains seriously bleak when we take employment, education and training into consideration.<\/p><p>Some people have already cited the Indecon assessment of the economic value of youth work report of 2012, which was commissioned by the National Youth Council of Ireland.  We know Ireland has the fourth highest number of young people not in education, employment or training at 18.4%, compared to the average at 12.9% for the EU in 2011.  In April 2013, the figure for young people who are long-term unemployed for more than 12 months was 27,857.  I realise that is a reduction on previous months but it is still a considerable number of long-term unemployed young people.  Ireland also has the highest number of children and young people under 18 at risk of poverty or social exclusion, with the figure at 37.6%, as compared to the 27% EU average.<\/p><p>We are all aware of the devastating impact that unemployment has, particularly on the social and health aspects of young people's lives, as well as morale and self-esteem.  It is generally accepted that increased social pressures such as financial and employment worries can trigger mental health problems or exacerbate existing issues.  Unless concerted action is taken, the mental health of young people in Ireland and Europe will decline in coming years.  We know that in 2009, Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, which is based in Dublin, conducted research indicating that across 21 EU member states, the cost of exclusion of young people from employment amounted to more than &euro;100 billion.  The study considered the cost of social welfare payments and contributions to GNP and it put a preliminary figure for the cost to society at &euro;14,000 per young person who is not in education, employment or training.  Some &euro;11,000 would be from unpaid contributions like PRSI and PAYE and &euro;3,000 is representative of benefit payments.<\/p><p>The cost to the Exchequer of youth unemployment is estimated to be &euro;3.16 billion annually.  Last December, the Independent group put forward a motion in this House on the importance of the value of youth work.  We had good support across the House in our belief that the State must recognise the value of the youth work sector and its potential for a cohesive approach in tackling youth unemployment and exclusion.  We know just under 400,000 young people benefit from youth work in Ireland and 53.3% of these are from socially or economically disadvantaged areas.  Over 40,000 volunteers are involved in youth work, with almost 1,400 whole-time staff equivalents.  Some 26% of young people in Ireland participate in a youth club or youth organisation, and that is the highest level in the EU.  The Indecon report proved that for every &euro;1 invested by the State in youth work, we save &euro;2.22 as a State in the long run.  This can be contrasted with the fact that youth organisations have received cumulative cuts during the recession, with the cuts running at approximately 30%.  Youth organisations could be used as a vehicle in tackling youth unemployment but we are cutting their funding.<\/p><p>The youth guarantee is very important to me and everybody in this House because it will give young people an offer of a job, work experience, apprenticeship, training or combined work and training.  It is hoped this will be found within four months of the young person finishing education or becoming unemployed.  We should hope it will achieve the target of having 2 million young people out of unemployment by 2014.<\/p><p>I agree with the contention in the motion that the youth guarantee scheme must play a central role in the Government's strategy to address our young person not in education, employment or training, or NEETs, crisis in Europe.  I commend the Government for signalling its support for the youth guarantee from the outset and making it a priority.  Given what I have stated on the importance of the youth work sector, I also welcome the determination of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in securing EU agreement on a greater role for youth work in supporting EU policy proposals for youth employment and social inclusion.  I welcome the pilot scheme planned for Ballymun.  It is good that we will have a pilot but we must consider local circumstances.  I am a bit concerned about the length of time it may take to mainstream the process.<\/p><p>I am conscious of the time but I will comment on those who are most disadvantaged.  These are the 9,000 young people who have been on the live register for three years or more.  They have literacy issues and they are early school leavers.  The have a poor relationship with State agencies.  We must do much more to tackle the problems of this cohort of young people within the youth guarantee.  The youth sector is well placed to work with this cohort, who are the hardest to reach.  There should be a joint initiative between the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection, Children and Youth Affairs and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>Has the Minister identified additional measures to support young people who are long-term unemployed in avoiding the weaknesses identified in the scheme already in operation in Finland and Sweden?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200020#T00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371040200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to speak on the EU guarantee.  The wider problem of youth unemployment is something that has consumed this Government's focus since coming to office.  The matter has been raised in the Seanad on many occasions and I commend Sinn F&eacute;in Senators for once again bringing it back on the political agenda through Private Members' time.<\/p><p>The Central Statistics Office recently stated that the level of youth unemployment had fallen in Ireland by nearly 10,000 in the year to May 2013.  I will not get into an argument about figures as one can see the glass as half empty or half full.  There is no denying that some of the fall may have come through emigration, activation or people staying longer in education.  We must not believe that the job is done and the tough work has only started.<\/p><p>In the five years since 2008, this country has lost six out of ten jobs held by people under 25.  That is a catastrophic collapse that has been a significant body blow to the morale of young people in this country.  This has a devastating effect on families, communities and the Exchequer.  There are even places where we cannot field a GAA team and clubs must band together to form a team.  This proves that we are missing young people in this country.<\/p><p>I hope the recent approval of the European youth guarantee can offer some relief to young people in this country.  A youth guarantee aims to provide every young person between 18 and 24 with an offer of a job, internship or training within four months of becoming unemployed.  The fact that this progressive measure has been confirmed by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, EPSCO, Council meeting during the Irish Presidency of the EU means this Government is putting the unemployment crisis at the heart of political discussion both nationally and at EU level.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister, Deputy Burton, for her work in securing this approval.  She is deeply concerned about the level of youth unemployment in this country and she is very committed to bringing forward measures to solve it.  It is important to note the EU-wide youth guarantee scheme is partially funded by the European Commission, with 7.5 million young people across Europe not in employment, education or training representing 12.9% of young Europeans.  It is highly unlikely that the &euro;6 billion pledged by the Commission will cover all the costs of the scheme and as a result individual states will probably have to provide the majority of funding.  Given the state of public finances, the funding for a full youth guarantee will not come overnight, and I hope the Government will continue the measures contained in the Action Plan for Jobs and reinforced in the last budget.<\/p><p>As outlined by the Minister, Deputy Burton, the Government's plan is to gradually implement the EU youth guarantee to obtain best value for money and the most effective results.  The Government currently has a number of schemes in action designed to combat youth employment and long-term unemployment in particular.  Currently, 12,500 young people are participating in F&Aacute;S schemes aimed at providing the skills to enter the labour market.<\/p> <p>Youthreach has 6,000 young people receiving integrated education and work experience aimed at early school leavers.  JobBridge, a scheme commenced by the Minister, Deputy Burton, is providing 2,700 people with work experience places.  This year, Momentum, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs initiative is being rolled out by the Department of Education and Skills.  Momentum will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long-term jobseekers to gain skills and access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  More than 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under-25s.  I welcome today's announcement by the Minister of JobsPlus which will help the employer take on people who are long-term unemployed, and that scheme will be launched next month.<\/p><p>These are some of the many schemes by the Government designed to combat unemployment and, as I said before, these schemes are beginning to tentatively make an impact on the live register figures.  A perfect example of this can be seen in the JobBridge scheme enacted by the Government.  Over 60% of the participants in this scheme find paid work afterwards.  We have seen from JobBridge that the Government needs to aid young people by providing them with the right education and skills.  It is also necessary in the current climate to provide employers with assistance and confidence in taking on more staff.  It provides an opportunity for employers to see the value and qualities of the new staff without the financial cost.<\/p><p>Ireland is not in a position financially to provide a Scandinavian style youth guarantee that costs and estimated &euro;6,600 per young person.  This means the Government needs to be creative and come up with fresh ideas.  I commend the Minister and the Government for the energy they are putting into coming up with these ideas.  It is important that when we speak about the training and education of young people we consistently remember the jobs market.  I want to see Ireland providing our young people with the right tools to enable them to find work.  I refer specifically to PayPal, which had to go outside Ireland for nearly 50% of its employees because Irish people did not have the right language skills to take up the jobs.  We have to look to the future and work to the future and to do that we have to educate our youth in the right sector, and in particular in language skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200021#U00200","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371040800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Reilly and the Sinn F&eacute;in group for putting forward this motion.

I propose that this is much higher now.  Some 18% of young people are not in education, employment or training, the fourth highest rate in the EU.  The Minister has disputed these figures here but they are the correct statistics from Europe.  Of the 333 actions listed in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs by this Government, only four relate to youth unemployment.  That is outrageous.<\/p><p>As the Minister said, the European Council recommended in February 2013 that &euro;6 billion be set aside for the youth guarantee scheme.  Last Friday I attended a conference organised by my colleague, Senator Reilly, in Cavan.  That conference was addressed by a number of experts, some of them officials from the European Community, and the representative from the European Youth Forum and youth guarantee said a minimum of &euro;21 billion would be required to accommodate another startling statistic, the 7.5 million young people in the European Union who are not in employment, education or training.  So &euro;21 billion would be required, not &euro;6 billion.  That &euro;21 billion is based on the region having a minimum of 25% youth unemployment.  What about the regions that have 24% or 23%?  They do not qualify for anything.  If we divide the &euro;6 billion proposed by Europe by the number of unemployed people in this country who would qualify, that would give them a little more than &euro;6,000 each.  Is that acceptable?  It is not acceptable to me.  It may be to the Government.  I accept and appreciate that it is a proposed figure and is not finalised, and I request that the Government fight as hard as it can before the end of its Presidency to ensure that &euro;6 billion is dramatically increased so the young people we are referring to, who are still in our country, can be facilitated and accommodated.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister on the JobBridge scheme.  It is an excellent scheme.  I have first-hand knowledge of it.  More than 17,000 people have availed of it since its inception.  If we are to believe the statistics, and I have no reason not to, three out of five have got employment and I commend everybody involved in it.  The Minister mentioned that 6,000 young people are engaged in Youthreach.  If the Government had not cut the budget for Youthreach by 25% we could have 12,000 young people involved in the programme which is an excellent programme of education and training.  We could have 6,000 more than we have now, and there is a long waiting list to get on the programme.  The Minister mentioned the back to education programme, another excellent programme in which 6,000 young people are involved.  Again the budget was cut by 25%.  If it was increased by 25%, that scheme could cater for 12,000 young people.<\/p><p>The Minister also referred to F&Aacute;S.  Again, 6,000 young people received training and apprenticeships.  However, again, that budget was slashed by 30%.  Had it been increased by 30% we would have an additional 6,000 young people on it.  They are the true facts.  That is the reality.  It is time this Government woke up to the reality of the situation.  I know money is tight, but to cut budgets for vulnerable young people involved in Youthreach, the back to education allowance and F&Aacute;S schemes is totally unacceptable.  To pay lip service to it is not acceptable to me or my party.  I commend Senator Reilly for putting forward this motion.  We will fully support it.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200022#V00600","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1371040800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in this area.  I commend Senator Reilly who has been very vocal on this issue for some time and I am happy to see she has tabled her motion here today.  Money is tight, that is for sure, and the reason it is tight is because Fianna F&aacute;il was in power recently.  I have great respect for Senator Wilson, but it is difficult when one is on the Government side to hear talk of our cutting budgets which we do not want to cut and very difficult decisions being made because of the situation we are in.<\/p> <p>I am not one who subscribes to constantly reminding Fianna F&aacute;il of what it did wrong but that is the reality.  <\/p><p>There is no disputing the fact that youth unemployment has reached crisis level in most EU states with more than one in five young Europeans currently out of work.  Currently, Ireland has the fifth highest rate of youth unemployment in the eurozone after Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy.  However, it must be noted, as stated by Senator Marie Moloney, that the latest CSO figures are positive in the sense that the number of youth unemployed dropped by almost 9,000 in 2012 on the same time in 2011.  As others have said this drop can be partially attributed, unfortunately, to emigration but it attests to the success of initiatives such as Youthreach, the vocational training opportunities scheme and the back to education allowance programme.   What is not in dispute is that the uphill battle against the scourge of youth unemployment remains.  In light of this today's announcement that Cloud computing firm Citrix is to create 50 new jobs in Dublin following unprecedented customer demand is timely.  The importance of training young people in the new wave technology cannot be overstressed.  As we are all aware, Dublin has become a major hub for technology companies in Europe.  Facebook, Google and LinkedIn all base themselves here.  Other home-grown successes in this space include Paddy Power.  <\/p><p>As I highlighted when I spoke previously on this issue, the major challenge facing the technology industry is the shortage of graduates.  The skills shortage is the greatest impediment to business growth in the digital sector.  We need to address this issue as a matter of urgency.  We must ensure that the new technology universities have IT skills to the forefront.  I wish to reiterate a point I have made previously that we consider having conversation courses in all relevant IT skills such as apt  development and programming.  This is equally vital at second level.  The time has come when Ireland Inc needs to grasp the nettle and introduce a proper IT and programming optional syllabus at junior and leaving certificate levels.  By the time it comes to college most people feel IT is not an option because they do not know enough about it or the succession to third level is often reduced to only IT hobbyists whereas it should be an open door for anybody who wishes to pursue it.  These measures would greatly assist in killing two birds with the one stone - the technology skills shortage and the youth unemployment crisis.<\/p><p>A fiscal response to the plague of youth unemployment although helpful is not enough.  There must also be a social response.  I welcome the Government initiatives being rolled out including the JobsPlus initiative which has been designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people.   Under this scheme, the State will pay approximately &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the live register.  Momentum, which is part of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs initiative, will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long-term jobseekers to gain skills and access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  More than 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s.  An additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes have also been made available by JobBridge, T&uacute;s and community employment.  About a quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people.<\/p><p>The original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people.  We have to hope that this target will be met.  It is encouraging that the Department of Finance anticipates that the overall unemployment rate will fall from 14.7% in 2012 to 12.3% in 2016.  This could mean that youth unemployment, which fell by 30% in 2012, will fall to 24% or less in 2016. <\/p><p>I believe that the final adoption in February of the EU recommendation on implementing a youth guarantee offers the potential to make a key difference to the lives of millions of young people across Europe and Ireland.  We are all in agreement that a central part of the Government's strategy must be a high quality youth guarantee scheme that provides young people with an offer of employment education, particularly in the IT and engineering apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.  I applaud the Government's progress to date while acknowledging the huge amount of work yet to be done especially in providing and encouraging training in the technology sector where the creation of another 15,000 jobs is a strong possibility.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Katherine Reilly for bringing the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200022#V00700","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371041400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it McGinley anseo sa Teach.  I also acknowledge the response by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton and do not doubt her  bona fides, sincerity or idealism.  I applaud to a great extent the JobBridge programme of which I have personal experience.  Broadly speaking, the spirit of what it seeks to achieve is commendable and worth praising.<\/p><p>I welcome the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and the opportunity to continue to highlight the ever increasing scar on society.  The Minister acknowledged this in her contribution when she said that long spells of unemployment have a permanent scarring effect on a person's life.  The statistics and the points which have been highlighted in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion are stark and dispiriting.  It is true, in fairness, that the Government has prioritised youth unemployment as an issue to be addressed during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I commend the Government's role under Ireland's Presidency that the European Union has agreed a recommendation for a youth guarantee.  As has been explained earlier, each member state should guarantee each unemployed person, under the age of 25 years, a job, training or education opportunity within four months of registration with the employment services.  At present, the youth guarantee is supported by the allocation of &euro;6 billion at EU level under the multi-annual financial framework.  I understand from the Government's amendment to the motion that Ireland has applied for advance funding as part of an EU pilot initiative to support the implementation of a youth guarantee project in Ballymun.  I also noted from the Minister's comments that she is talking to other organisations such as IBEC and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  As there is no indication in her contribution, what is the timeline for this pilot scheme?  Will it happen this year or in 2014?  The Minister said it is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the guarantee before the end of 2013.  That says very little.  What I think it means is that a plan will be established in 2013 but maybe the pilot scheme will not start until 2015 or 2016.  I seek clarification on that issue.<\/p><p>I do not want to get bamboozled with the various sets of data and figures that Sinn F&eacute;in and the Government amendment have put forward.  However, whatever we agree on, even if it shows a decrease, the number of unemployed young people under 25 years of age is too high.  The Government contends that the figure has fallen at about 30%.  However, we have still the fifth highest rate of youth unemployment in Europe after Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy.  That has not changed.  Some 80% of the young are not in education, employment or training making us the fourth highest in the EU.  These figures are stark.  I do not want to slice and dice them but commend Sinn F&eacute;in for acknowledging and bringing them forward in this debate.<\/p><p>I am disappointed that in the Government's amendment and the Minister's contribution there is no mention of emigration.  This is the elephant in the room.  Its omission in the amendment is symbolic of the abuse we all feel when speaking of emigration.<\/p> <p>The scar repeats itself from generation to generation.  It is disappointing that the word was not mentioned by the Government in the Minister's speech or the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200023#W00200","speaker":"1167","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371042000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>She did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200024#X00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1371042000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I was not speaking about the Senator, but the Minister's notes and the Government amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200024#X00300","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1371042000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Senator Moloney is not in government yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200024#X00400","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1371042000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>No, but the Minister did mention it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200024#X00500","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1371042000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Senator Mac Conghail without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200024#X00600","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1371042000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I am referring to the notes that the Minister supplied.<\/p><p>The plays of Tom Murphy have such resonance for today's audiences because they deal with the disease of emigration.  There is no acknowledgment that emigration has played an important part in the falling unemployment rates.  According to the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, the Government is failing to address youth emigration adequately or to support the needs of young people who are leaving the country in search of work.  This makes the Government amendment dispiriting.  A poll of 1,003 people carried out by RedC on behalf of the NYCI found that one in four people had a close family member emigrate in the past two years.  Half of all people aged between 18 and 24 years and still living in Ireland have considered emigrating while four out of ten people aged between 25 and 34 years have considered moving abroad.  Some 41% of those considering emigration stated that they would leave because they were unemployed.  When asked whether the Government was addressing the issue of youth unemployment adequately, 83% disagreed and 85% replied that not enough was being done to tackle the problem of youth emigration.  This proves my point about the Government's amendment to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.<\/p><p>In a separate report, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, presents a similar and equally disturbing picture.  It points out the recession's negative impact on the young, who have been most deeply affected by the jobs crisis.  The national unemployment level remains close to 15% while the youth unemployment level is just below 30%, albeit depressed by emigration.  In Limerick, the figure is 50%, which is just above Donegal's figure of 49% and Wexford's figure of 47%.  What emerges from this report is the high price paid by the younger age groups for the financial crash and the necessary ensuing fiscal adjustment.  The high rate of youth unemployment risks the creation of a jobless generation with worrying social consequences.<\/p><p>The UN's most recent report on world youth unemployment reads: &quot;With almost 74 million people in the 15 to 24 age group unemployed around the world, translating into a 12.4 per cent unemployment rate for this subset, job prospects for the world's younger workers are looking increasingly bleak&quot;.

It is wholly appropriate and commendable that Sinn F&eacute;in would use its Private Members' time to highlight this issue.  No Government, including this one, is above criticism.  Regardless of what is done in terms of job creation, more should be done.  It is the No. 1 issue in Ireland, as the Minister of State is keenly aware.  He comes from an area that has suffered significantly from emigration.  Although he may not have mentioned it yet, he has seen that suffering along the west coast from County Donegal to County Clare.<\/p><p>This morning, I spoke at a conference in Croke Park.

The plan has met with tangible success.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, on leading many trade delegations to various parts of the world, particularly the US.  These have resulted in significant job announcements.  I commend the tourism industry, which has borne the brunt of some of the harshest job losses.  We are seeing green shoots.  The Gathering is one of the most phenomenal tourism initiatives in which the country has ever engaged.  All stakeholders have bought into it.  I am not just referring to the tourism industry, but also to local authorities and the Government.<\/p> <p>It was a very focused and determined marketing drive that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of extra people visiting the country.

I wish I could share the enthusiasm and confidence of Senator Keane and others on the other side that Europe is somehow solving the problem of youth unemployment.  In reality, Europe is making a complete hames of addressing the problem of youth unemployment and despite several initiatives, the youth unemployment rate - which is bad enough in this country - is soaring to over 50% in Spain, Portugal, Italy and other southern countries.  If we are to solve youth unemployment in this country, we will have to try to do it ourselves, and I compliment the Government on the initiatives it is taking, notwithstanding the difficult period we are in.<\/p><p>  I do have a gripe.  There are a great many multinationals in this country constantly being presented as salvation in our economic problems.  Why do these multinationals seem to have a high number of vacancies while not taking on graduates coming from third level colleges?  They have stated that the companies cannot get experienced personnel but what is to stop the Government from imposing a quota for taking in graduates coming from third level colleges and training them?  This is instead of having to go across the world to import workers into the country.  We have one of the highest participation rates at third level in Europe at between 40% and 45%, when the European average is approximately 25% to 30%.  I am sure Senator Barrett will correct me if I am wrong.  Nevertheless, part of the reason we have a youth unemployment problem is that youths cannot get work in their own country and, as Senator Mac Conghail noted, those who feel they have an opportunity to find work abroad are emigrating.<\/p><p>  A photograph appeared in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> only two weeks ago, following London's defeat of Sligo in the Connacht championship.  The caption included not only the names of the team but the occupations they held; some 12 of the 15 players were involved in the construction sector, and they were all Irish-born people who emigrated.  These youths were plumbers, carpenters and civil engineers.  The collapse has occurred in the construction sector since 2008 and there is a real need for the Government to upskill and retrain those people.  I would love to get an answer on why some responsibility is not placed on multinationals by the Government to introduce some sort of a quota system for graduates coming out of college.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200025#Y00900","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1371042600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I join with those who have thanked our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues for putting down this motion, as it is very important that we discuss these matters.  Our problem is that we have an \"insider-outsider\" labour market and it is all designed to protect those with jobs.  The people outside have borne the burden, with 143,000 people under 25 emigrating in the last four years.  We would be in Greece's position if that emigration had not happened.  We are locked into a fixed exchange rate with Germany, along with Greece and Spain, and I do not see Europe as the solution to this either.  The euro is a fundamentally flawed concept and countries like ours are bearing the burden.  Why did we sleepwalk into the currency nine or ten years ago?  Such questions must be asked as we are now having an internal devaluation, which means marginalised people in the labour force are bearing the burden.<\/p><p>My time is limited.  On page 37 of the Book of Estimates from the Taoiseach's Department, there is an indication that the number of staff went down by 7% and the wage bill went up by 2%; that amounts to 9% per head extra for the people in the Taoiseach's office.  There was a similar pattern in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, where the wage bill went down by 3% and the number of people working there went down by 8%, which is a 5% real increase.  In the health Department, staff numbers decreased by 4.7% but salaries have increased by 5%, which is a real increase of between 9% and 10%.  That is what social partnership and benchmarking achieved.  It gave us the most expensive people in jobs and excluded all the others, who were priced out of the labour market.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State but he must reaffirm the reform agenda.  We are approximately half way through the term of the Oireachtas and all the reforms in the manifestos have not been implemented in the Taoiseach's Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or in health.  The IMF has been particularly critical of the health sector.  We do not yet have proper banks because of the legacy of bad capital appraisal, benchmarking, social partnership and the insider-outsider labour market.  All of these problems are being borne by young people.  We should reform and stop the platitudes that we might have a few shillings to throw at young people after we have destroyed so much of the economy because of misguided policies.<\/p><p>This Government badly needs to create a Government economics service to ensure we run many policies far better.  We must tidy up the absolute destruction that bad economic policies have brought about.  The process is still geared to giving much money to people in jobs, particularly in Departments, although I am sure if we went through the Estimates for 2013, we could see it happened across the board.  We do not have a value for money culture and the burden is being borne by people outside.<\/p><p>Senator Conway and others have mentioned tourism but Oireachtas research has shown that Ireland is increasingly being perceived increasingly as bad value for money.  The tourism sector must bear on its shoulders the excess costs we have spoken about and we have an horrendous sheltered sector that makes life in the unsheltered sector of the Irish economy so difficult.  The results have been mass emigration and unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200025#Y01000","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1371042600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Youth unemployment continues to be a main priority of the Government in its efforts to deal with job creation and getting people back to work.  At the outset I acknowledge the work of my party colleague, Ms Emer Costello, MEP, who has worked tirelessly on the youth guarantee at the European Parliament.  Since taking office, she has relentlessly pursued the issue and was instrumental in bringing forward the youth guarantee.  I also commend the Minister, Deputy Burton, for her speech today and for her work and dedication to youth unemployment.  Although it was noted otherwise, emigration was referred to.<\/p><p>The Labour Party is taking the youth unemployment issue very seriously and we are committed to finding viable solutions to rectify the problem.  Reputable organisations like the National Youth Council of Ireland have strongly welcomed the youth guarantee and I eagerly await the decision at EU level for advanced funding for the pilot initiative to be introduced at Ballymun.  The youth guarantee offers the person aged 18 to 24 a job, work experience, apprenticeship, training or combined work and training within a defined period after leaving school or becoming unemployed.<\/p><p>I recognise the programme has issues that must be addressed, and my biggest concern is that the programme is adequately funded.  We must also be aware that additional measures to support the youth of Ireland and long-term unemployed young people should be within the guarantee.  This problem cannot be solved with one initiative but it will be done through a combination of efforts across all Departments.<\/p> <p>The situation will take a multidimensional approach.  There has been much talk about youth unemployment and I welcome the opportunity to have this debate and thank my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues for bringing this motion before the House.  The Government has taken actions within the action plan for jobs 2013, pathways to work strategies and by prioritising the youth guarantee at European level.  I welcome each of these initiatives on the part of the Government but believe we can do more.  This problem is seeing our young people leave our shores at such an alarming rate while many who stay face a life of few options and exist on social welfare.  As I said previously, I encourage all Departments to work on a cross-departmental basis to find new and further innovations to deal with the problem.  I urge the Members of this House to work on a cross-party basis to come up with further motions and ideas where we can move forward.  We must not forget to continue to prioritise this at European level after we have passed on the European Presidency.  It is important to continue to highlight this and remind our EU colleagues of the difficulties we face in Ireland.<\/p><p>This morning I was listening to the radio and heard a segment from the German ambassador to Ireland and he admitted that for Germany to do well, its neighbours must also do well.  Addressing the youth unemployment crisis would be instrumental to our recovery process and the health of our European counterparts.  We must be vigilant abroad and I recognise that many of our representatives at European level are already raising the important issue for Ireland.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this extremely relevant and continuing issue.  I hope we can build on this debate, work across Departments and parties to ensure the youth guarantee works and we can reduce the rate of youth unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200025#Y01100","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371043200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I commend the youngest Oireachtas Member, Senator Reilly, for bringing forward this important motion and for her excellent articulation of the issues affecting young people.  It was a very strong performance.  I read an article in one of the national newspapers today and it mentioned an exchange yesterday in the Seanad, which was unfortunate.  The same article referred to the fact that the vast majority of people outside the Seanad would not be able to name a handful of Senators.  The media is partly responsible for that because it does not cover many of the excellent debates we have here in the Seanad.  In this case a Senator organised a conference that was a mix of organisations representing young people from this State and Europe to come together and discuss ideas on how we can create jobs, assist young people, support the Government on the youth guarantee and ensure we have the best possible model for people, and to take those ideas into the Seanad and have a discussion with the Minister.  As the Minister can see, the members of the media are not interested in that, but that is their problem.  We will get on with our work in this House.  I commend Senator Reilly for bringing forward this very important motion.<\/p><p>Despite the fact that the Minister got off to a bad start in her contribution, I strongly agree with and support her conclusions where she says the youth guarantee in Ireland will make a real difference to the many talented young people.  She spoke about young people being innocent victims of the boom-to-bust legacy and that this has been exacerbated by a lack of opportunities to match their ambition.  We would all agree with that.  We want to be able to ensure when our graduates come out of colleges with ambition, the opportunities are there for them.  That is not the case for a lot of young people.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned emigration and it is a blot on all of our copybooks that it is affecting another generation of young Irish people, graduates of colleges at a high cost to their families and the taxpayers of this State who put people through colleges to get the education they want.  They have the talent, energy, enthusiasm, but unfortunately, for many of them the only opportunities are in America, New Zealand, Australia, the UK or wherever, and not here in this country.  Anything we can collectively do to provide opportunities for those young people is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned apprenticeships.  We need to fundamentally re-examine this because, unfortunately a perception, a prejudice even, about apprenticeships has built up in this country.  Some people and employers look down on apprenticeships and do not value them.  The Minister acknowledged the problems we had in the apprenticeship schemes during the Celtic tiger years and afterwards, when people dropped out.  Other European countries do apprenticeships much better than we do.  The Germans, for example, strongly value it.  There are very strong, robust connections between industry and the apprenticeship schemes, and not just in manufacturing but also in food production, dairy, ICT and a range of sectors where we do not look at apprenticeships.  We have internships, but we need apprenticeships that offer young people jobs and a training element.  We need to go back and examine the apprenticeship model in this country and value them more because there is a lot more we can do to encourage business to ensure there is ongoing training and innovation in companies, which supports employees and young people.<\/p><p>Youth entrepreneurship is very valuable.  I am one who places great faith in creativity, innovation, thinking outside the box and encouraging young people to be part of that.  That could be done in secondary schools.  There is much more we can do to foster innovation in secondary schools and enable young people who show innovation, who are creative and want to set up their own businesses, to do so.

I thank the Minister for taking part, Senators Power, Clune, van Turnhout, Moloney, Wilson, Noone, Mac Conghail, Keane, Conway, Mooney, Barrett, Moran and my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Cullinane.  One of the important things about this debate is that we always remember that what matters going forward is not the label guarantee but what we have in the youth guarantee.<\/p><p>I agree, and everybody would agree, with the Minister that long spells of unemployment cause permanent scars, especially for young people.  In her contribution she said youth unemployment can be expected to fall relatively rapidly when recovery takes hold but, as a number of Senators reiterated here today, the implementation of this guarantee in Ireland needs to happen as a matter of urgency, given our high levels of youth unemployment.  As I said, the issues cannot be put on a waiting list until the economic situation improves.<\/p><p>I asked a question on the role of the Department of Social Protection in the youth guarantee and I was definitely not questioning the Minister's bona fides and her dedication in terms of piloting and making this the flagship project of the Irish Presidency.  I was questioning why the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation had not been taking a greater role.  There were many questions, especially in terms of the youth organisations, when there is a lot of talk about back-to-work jobs anchored in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I was not questioning the Minister's bona fides in that respect; it was just a question on the rationale for having the Department of Social Protection anchoring it instead of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>I support the Minister's comments on the inclusivity of the guarantee and Senator Conway touched on it in terms of high levels of unemployment among other groups, especially people with disabilities.  At the round-table discussion of the conference I attended this morning someone mentioned people who have left school by the age of 16.  As the youth guarantee scheme does not kick in until they are 18, what happens for those two years for those people who are not in employment, education or training?  We need to go further to try to assist these people in that age group between 16 and 18 years.<\/p><p>I welcome the support of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Senator Power mentioned that statistics do not capture the picture of emigration and they are silently unaccounted for.  Senator Mac Conghail went into emigration again and it is important.  Senator Power mentioned that we need to put our heads together on this issue at a continental level and I made that point in terms of how we move towards the &euro;6 billion that has been earmarked at EU level towards the International Labour Organisation, ILO, target of &euro;21 billion.<\/p> <p>It requires greater thinking.  That is why EU leadership has to come forward.  I hope the initiative being brought forward by Angela Merkel on 3 July will go some way to expanding on the &euro;6 billion and put a proper concerted effort into this issue.  If we do not put the resources in now it could fall on its face.  We do not want it to be just the label \"guarantee\" with measures which are not up to scratch.  That is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200026#Z00400","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371043800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>According to the rule of the House, as it is now 4.30 p.m. the Senator's time has expired.

This is a relatively short technical Bill that amends the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  Its aim is to remove the legislative barriers to redeployment and overall mobility within the public service and to address other issues that arise on changing employer.  If passed, it will facilitate greater movement across the broader public service and into and out of non-commercial State bodies.  This is vital in the current context, where the redeployment of surpluses in one organisation to meet deficits in another is likely to continue for some time as we seek to maximise the existing resources within the public service.<\/p><p>I am also taking the opportunity of the passage of the Bill to remove a provision in the 2004 Act.  At present the Act provides for an exemption in relation to appointments recommended by the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, following competitions confined to certain civil servants.  The rationale for the exemption was that Civil Service candidates for senior posts had already been subjected to a recruitment and selection process that had been regulated by the Commission for Public Service Appointments, CPSA.  As a result of the extension of TLAC to candidates from outside of the Civil Service since 2007, the exemption no longer applies.  As open competitions are now the norm and TLAC appointments are subject to the provisions of the Act, I have taken the opportunity to reflect the new reality in the legislation by deleting the exemption.<\/p><p>The Bill is being read here today in the context of a clear vision for the public service for the future.  It will be a public service that is better integrated and more responsive to an ever-changing environment, with a focus on the needs of citizens and business customers and on the need to deliver value for money.  It will be more open and accountable in how it spends taxpayers' money and in decision-making.<\/p><p>Significant progress is being made in achieving the vision and implementing a programme of reform with a scale and ambition unprecedented in the State.  The very difficult fiscal position and increased demands on services is driving the reform agenda.  We must continue the process of meeting the five major commitments in our public service reform plan that we published in November 2011 as follows: placing the customer or citizen at the core of everything that we do; maximising new and innovative service delivery channels; radically reducing costs to drive better value for money; leading, organising and working in new ways; and a strong focus on implementation and delivery.<\/p><p>The ability to move and redeploy staff from one post to another, and from one organisation to another, is an integral part of delivering on the reform programme and in supporting a more fit-for-purpose public administration.  Redeployment and mobility will be required on an ongoing basis to meet demands for staff to support priority programmes and schemes from within existing public service resources.  At present, definitive redeployment from one sector of the public service to another is not legally possible.  Secondment arrangements are used pending the enactment of appropriate legislation.  This is the purpose of the Bill.  It intends to provide certainty of assignment for those on secondment and for those who will move in the future.  It will also provide certainty for the sending and receiving organisations involved in the redeployment process regarding their staffing assignments.<\/p><p>The public service across Europe is operating in an environment of reduced resources and staff numbers.  Renewing public service capacity is a key challenge for our European neighbours, as well as for us, as the pace and scope of reform places extra demands on public administrations.  The demand and supply pressures require more specialist skills and competencies in key strategic areas, including procurement, ICT, and change management.<\/p> <p>The demand and supply pressures require more specialist skills and competencies in key strategic areas, including procurement, ICT and change management.<\/p><p> One of the key instruments in addressing the staffing capacity challenge as we move towards a more fit-for-purpose administration is the adoption of a strategic workforce planning approach.  It is vital that this approach is embedded as a core element of the business planning process.  Workforce planning can be a powerful management tool and is most effective when integrated within a Department's strategy and budgetary processes in a way that supports strategic decisions made by managers.  A key enabler of this is the design of an appropriate workforce planning process to ensure that the right staff are in the right place, at the right time.  Cross-sectoral mobility is intended to support this objective and the passage of this Bill is required to facilitate definitive cross-sectoral transfers.<\/p><p> My Department is responsible for the roll-out of workforce planning across the Civil Service.  The first iterations of the workforce plans were submitted last year and Departments are currently preparing the next iteration based on the feedback provided.  This will allow a more consistent approach to be adopted right across the public service.  It will also support central monitoring, as well as playing a key part in the provision of robust and timely information to decision makers.  This, in turn, will enable service-wide analyses of staffing supply and demand as part of ongoing Civil Service resourcing.<\/p><p> Redeployment and mobility are not merely aspirational values to be achieved as part of some future public service.  In the past the Croke Park agreement has been an enabler of the public service reform plan and has played a strong part in underpinning many of the changes we are making in the public service.  It has provided an unprecedented opportunity to achieve changes in an atmosphere of stable industrial relations and co-operation.<\/p><p> For the first time, the Croke Park agreement provided a basis for movement within the Civil Service, the health services and local authority and education sectors and, where internal redeployment is not possible, between these bodies and non-commercial semi-State bodies.  These arrangements have played a key role in the reassignment of over 10,000 staff at this stage - it is remarkable to think that 10,000 staff have moved in the past couple of years - and were reaffirmed under the new Haddington Road proposals currently being voted upon.  Redeployment will continue to facilitate flexibility and ensure that we can make the best use of staff resources by moving staff from areas where there is surplus capacity to areas of greater need.<\/p><p> I have noted in this House previously that there has been a substantial ask of public servants under the Croke Park agreement and in the context of the Haddington Road discussions.  I have spoken in recent debates in this Chamber about the reason that was, and remains, necessary.  I have also acknowledged, both in those debates and elsewhere, that public servants have contributed significantly to addressing the current fiscal and economic challenges through the pension levy imposed in 2009, a pay reduction imposed in 2010 and through other measures, including head count reductions, reduced salary rates for new entrants and reductions in pension payments to pensioners.<\/p><p> As part of the negotiation process that has resulted in these outcomes, the Government has agreed that compulsory redundancy will not apply to public servants, subject to the agreed flexibility on redeployment being delivered.  The passage of this Bill will allow definitive cross-sectoral redeployments to be made and in doing so will enable the Government to meet part of its commitments, both under the existing Croke Park agreement and, hopefully, the newly-to-be-agreed Haddington Road.<\/p><p> I will briefly go through the sections of the Bill and give a brief outline of their content and purpose.  Section 1 defines the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 as the principal Act.  Section 2 defines a &quot;public service body&quot; for the purposes of the redeployment function, which is assigned to the Public Appointments Service, PAS, under sections 4, 5 and 6, to include all public service employers except commercial State bodies and their subsidiaries.  Section 3 removes the existing exemption I just indicated, under section 7(2)(<i>a<\/i>), from the general provisions of the principal Act in respect of the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, appointments, bringing these within the ambit of the Act.<\/p><p> Sections 4, 5 and 6 provide for the insertion of a new section 34A and a new Part 6A, which comprises sections 57A to 57F, inclusive, into the principal Act.  Section 34A provides that the Public Appointments Service shall have the functions set out in Part 6A.<\/p><p> Section 57A provides that a person designated by the PAS for redeployment to a position in another public service body shall be appointed to that position.  Section 57B enables the PAS to designate a public service employee for redeployment to a comparable position elsewhere in the public service.  A person on a fixed-term contract may be redeployed for the period remaining on his or her contract.  The assignment of this role to the PAS is fully consistent with its current statutory role as the main recruiter for the public service and also with its role in operating the existing redeployment arrangements for transfers between public service bodies under the existing Croke Park agreement over the past few years.<\/p><p> Section 57C provides that redeployment is to be on no less favourable conditions of basic pay - defined in section 57A - and pension, except in relation to fast accrual arrangements.  It will provide certainty for the individual being redeployed in two ways: first, it provides for the transfer of the responsibility to meet the redeployee's superannuation liabilities to the receiving organisation; and, second, it provides for the preservation of various statutory rights of the redeployee that are linked to length of service.  These include rights accruing under the Redundancy Acts, Unfair Dismissal Act, Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 and the Parental Leave Act.  Section 57C also provides that those assigned to the Civil Service will be subject to the Civil Service Regulation Acts and the Ethics in Public Office Acts.<\/p><p> Section 57D sets out the factors to be considered by the Public Appointments Service when designating a person for redeployment.  These are the competencies, qualifications, grading and pay rates of the person being redeployed and those required in the post to which the person is being redeployed; the terms of any policy of the Minister, or collective agreement, relating to the mobility or redeployment of public service employees; and the methods of recruitment and selection applying to public servants generally.<\/p><p> Section 57E sets out details of those who are precluded from redeployment by the PAS.  These are holders of political, judicial and constitutional posts, presidential and Government appointees, as well as special advisers, members of the Permanent Defence Force, officers of the Houses of the Oireachtas and those employed by the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency.  This section also provides that the Minister may, by order, add further bodies to this list.<\/p><p> Section 57F removes any impediments under the Data Protection Act 1988 to the transfer of personal information to the PAS, or to another public service body, for the purpose of redeployment to that body.<\/p><p> Section 7 corrects Schedule 2 of the principal Act to reflect the fact that there is no section 14(4) in the Aviation Regulation Act 2001 and the Schedule should refer instead to section 11(4) of that Act.  Section 8 inserts an additional schedule to the principal Act to list the commercial State bodies which are excluded from the definition of &quot;public service body&quot;.  Section 9 is a standard provision providing for a Short Title, and for commencement on a day to be appointed by the Minister, by order.<\/p><p> I am asking the House to support this short, limited but important Bill as part of the reform agenda under way in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200029#DD00800","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371044700,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The Fianna F&aacute;il group would like to support this Bill but, today, we will be reserving our position on it.  In this regard, I will be putting a few queries to the Minister.<\/p><p>As the party that helped negotiate the original Croke Park deal, Fianna F&aacute;il is prepared to play its part in and support the reform of the public sector to ensure it is more flexible, while valuing its work and making it work in even more efficient ways.  We support redeployment and making the staff resources as flexible as possible to change in response to the needs that arise as the years go by, but I have a few questions for the Minister in this regard.<\/p><p>The Minister has been careful not to frame the legislation in terms of the Haddington Road agreement.  My overarching concern is whether this is going beyond Haddington Road and whether it is part of a wider reform agenda of the Government, and I suppose the question comes down to how that relates to the workers.  Have the unions been consulted specifically on this legislation because I have not heard much about it in the media?<\/p> <p>Redeployment is dealt with in the Haddington Road agreement, which contains quite a considerable number of paragraphs about it.  However, there is a procedure within the aforementioned agreement for redeployment, which refers to looking for volunteers for redeployment before one starts to get into a mandatory situation.  As far as I can discern, this is not reflected in the legislation and it is not a factor that must be taken into account legally.  The other general point I wish to raise is that the redeployer, that is, the Public Appointments Service, must take into account a number of items when it decides to redeploy, one of which is sectoral agreements into which the Government has entered.  The Bill refers to the &quot;terms of any policy for the time being of the Minister, or collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union or staff association&quot; and I assume the Haddington Road agreement is such a thing.  What in practice does the Minister envisage over the years?  Will this be just one item that is taken into account or is this what actually will decide how things operate?<\/p><p> I have another major concern about a definition in the Bill and I seek some comfort from the Minister on this point.  As I stated, Fianna F&aacute;il will be reserving its position on the Bill today and certainly will not object to it today.  However, I will listen to what the Minister has to say and my party will consult further in this regard.  A definition of basic pay has been brought into the principal legislation via section 6 of the Bill, which states:<blockquote>'basic pay' means, in relation to the person the subject of the designation concerned, the amount of the person's pay or salary, by virtue of the position held in the public service body, by the person immediately before the redeployment day, other than amounts in respect of--(i) specific work or a specific duty undertaken,<br \/>(ii) unsocial or atypical hours worked,<br \/>(iii) shift work,<br \/>(iv) piece work, or<br \/>(v) overtime.<\/blockquote>I do not know whether there is such a definition of basic pay in the statute because were a definition along those lines to be put in, which did not take account of the normal allowances, for example, of nurses, which form part of their core pay, that would be different to what public sector staff members themselves consider to be their core or basic pay.  The Minister might recall that in the original Croke Park II talks, before they became the Haddington Road proposals, the nurses voted overwhelmingly against the Croke Park II provisions.  I believe it was 95% to zero, precisely because of this kind of thing, that is, it was perceived to be an attack on the allowances that people outside the system and who are not obliged to work overnight or on Sundays perceive as some kind of bonus.  I am afraid that were this to be put into statute, Members would be setting a new standard for pay, which in practice might work out as reducing pay in the long term.  Moreover, it might not take into account, as does the Haddington Road agreement, the type of work that actually is done by many in the public sector at a time when many of us are asleep.  In my own case and that of many other families, while I am asleep at home someone else is working as an nurse overnight.<\/p><p> I also am concerned about the practical implications of that definition.  Leaving aside overtime, which pertains to additional work, I refer to someone who is redeployed and for whom a large part of his or her salary might comprise allowances for Sunday work.  People begin to have an expectation that they will work two Sundays per month and so on and it all becomes part of the ordinary wages coming into those families and, in practice, is not perceived to be a bonus.  This was the reason the nurses and a number of other unions voted overwhelmingly against the Croke Park II proposals.  Given the previous experience with the 10,000 staff to whom the Minister referred, how will this work in practice?  For example, can a nurse or fire fighter be taken out of his or her job - if for some reason the job is no longer required - and be put into a Civil Service job with a consequential loss of a considerable amount of pay if that person's actual pay as it was is not being taken into account?  It is unfortunate that this definition is being included in the legislation.  If the Minister tells me it already is in place I will accept that.  While I do not believe it appears anywhere in legislation, I will listen to the Minister's response.  It could send out a signal that this work is not valued and could inflame passions again, based on what happened in respect of the Croke Park II agreement.  Moreover, I do not know whether it is necessary, when one considers the Haddington Road proposals, in which some allowances were cut but others that were extremely important to staff members and reflected the realities of the work were retained.<\/p><p> I reiterate that Fianna F&aacute;il supports and wishes to encourage the Minister in his reform efforts.  However, my party wishes to ensure that everyone is being treated fairly and I have raised some questions to which Fianna F&aacute;il seeks answers from the Minister.  My party may table amendments on Committee Stage but despite what the Minister said, this does not appear to be a highly technical Bill.  I do not agree with the Minister's suggestion that this is a technical Bill, as it could be quite significant for many people.  Therefore, it is important that Members tease out precisely what is happening and get the profile for it, if it goes beyond the Haddington Road proposals.  While Fianna F&aacute;il wishes to support this Bill, I ask the Minister to respond to the concerns I have outlined in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200030#EE00200","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371045300,"counter":256,"content":"<p>First, I again welcome the Minister to the House.

The purpose of the Bill is to allow greater mobility within the public sector and, as a result, greater flexibility.  The Bill sets out the technical amendments needed to facilitate such increased mobility.  The Croke Park agreement provided a basis for movement within the Civil Service, the health service and the local authority and education sectors, as well as in cases in which internal redeployment is not possible between these bodies and non-commercial semi-State bodies.  The arrangements are reaffirmed in the Haddington Road proposals.  We live in a fluid business environment in which staff must be flexible enough to change and respond to new work practices and I commend the public service on working with the Government to bring about substantial change within the sector that has contributed much to Ireland's economic recovery.  I believe this statement cannot but be reiterated and reaffirmed.  At present, such movements of staff within the public sector are not possible legally and secondment arrangements have been used, pending the opportunity to address the legal impediments involved.  This Bill removes the legislative barriers to redeployment and mobility in general within the public service, which I believe will create a better public service for better governance and better government.  With this in mind, I believe there is little else to say but to commend the Bill to the House and to commend the Minister on bringing it before the House.  However, before concluding, I have one query to make of the Minister.  I refer to a hypothetical case within the public service, in which a person at grade 8 level was to retire and that post was to be filled from within through redeployment.  Could it arise that a public servant at grade 5 or grade 6 level was redeployed into that position?  Must a grade 8 level public servant be replaced by another grade 8 level public servant?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200031#FF00400","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1371045300,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and always have wished him well in his reform agenda.  As for this one, I refer to the attempt at an internal devaluation, given we do not have a currency to devalue externally.  In itself, that opens up issues as to the reasons we did not read the small print before joining up with the single currency.  However, it is very difficult where one has an extremely strong public sector trade union movement and very little trade union movement outside of that because, as the Minister has pointed out himself so many times, they have taken the hits.  This measure must come in tandem with other proposals.  I have heard the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform talk about the need for a Government economic service to improve the expertise through all the Departments, rather than having them operating as independent republics.  Similarly, the control of lobbyists is absolutely essential, certainly as one considers how we got into trouble.  Moreover, I refer to the role of whistleblowers, where they see inefficiencies and so on, to tell the Minister or other Ministers as the Government tries to steer its way through all of this.  I refer to a problem outlined on page 12 of the bord snip nua report, which is that in the period of expansion between 1997 and 2009, higher management levels in the Civil Service grew by approximately 82%, while Civil Service numbers as a whole increased by 27%.<\/p> <p>That is all part of the adjustment which the Minister is attempting.  I welcome his statement on the first page that we must envisage a redeployment of surpluses in one organisation to meet deficits in another.  In previous discussions on such matters I looked at the exemptions.  I note that C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, Cork Airport Authority, Dublin Airport Authority, the ESB, EirGrid, and the Shannon Airport Authority are exempted.  According to Mr. Guiomard, the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation, they are documented bodies with surplus staff because of the decline in air traffic .  The extra money that CIE got last year was used entirely to buy out surplus staff.  Do we not have vacancies elsewhere for drivers of public transport vehicles?  Could they not be redeployed?  The Minister is unnecessarily constrained by Schedule 3.  That does not mean I do not commend him for the significant issue being tackled.  He can take it I will support him in that regard.<\/p><p>I have another concern.  In the Book of Estimates for the Minister&rsquo;s own Department, on page 59 there is a reference to the Exchequer pay bill between 2012 and 2013, which rose from &euro;18.773 million to &euro;20.382 million.  As I am sure his officials correctly calculated, that is a 9% increase, but the associated public sector employees reduced from 340 to 318, which is a 6% decrease.  There has been a large increase in average pay in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  Perhaps that is necessary when we are trying to accomplish this reform but I have gone through the numbers and something similar happened in the Department of the Taoiseach where there was a 7% increase in staff and a 2% increase in pay.  It also happened in the Department of Health, which as the Minister is aware has been a source of some discontent as far as the troika is concerned.  There has been a large increase in the average pay of employees in the Department of Health.  The salaries bill went up by 5% and the number of people employed went down by 4.7%.  There was an approximate 10% increase in the staff of the Department of Health at managerial level.  Are the managerial costs of what we are trying to do exceeding all benefits that are possible?  We must review the situation.  One could ask whether we should be much stricter in preparing the next budget than the figures that have been presented to us.  Those are nettles that we must grasp.<\/p><p>I sat on the National Economic and Social Council and heard for years from the public sector trade unions that if only the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, which controlled that entity at the time, would be imaginative they would be brilliantly imaginative and wonderful reform proposals would emerge.  I have never seen them and I am still waiting for them.  I hope the Minister will be the person to deliver them but it has taken an lot of hot air and empty promises.  The legacy of social partnership in that regard is not great when one considers benchmarking and the recruitment of all the extra managers.  Everyone who was elected two years ago must try to cope with that and we rely on the Minister for leadership.  We need much stricter economic control.  We must examine whether the managers are delivering.  There is no point in getting rid of people low down the scale and for the average pay to keep rising rapidly.  One could ask how much of the expenditure is influenced by social partnership and whether it is an appropriate model given that it is an insider-outsider labour market.  More than 300,000 have left the country, 40% of whom were under 25.  We would be in a similar situation to Greece were it not for emigration.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to keep us out of such a situation by the reforms we are implementing but we need more radical reform than we are seeing.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to the top level appointments committee, TLAC, and the concerns that existed before he came to office.  There was a remarkable record of appointing only insiders.  Could the composition of the TLAC be changed to give one availability to a wider pool of people on which to draw?  This is the kernel of a reform agenda that we need.  All sheltered sectors in this country cost too much and public sector services are part of that.  The Minister&rsquo;s attempt to get more efficiency should be supported by the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200031#FF00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371045900,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I too welcome the Minister to the House.  As he said, the legislation presented is required.  It is common sense legislation that removes the barriers to redeployment and mobility within the public service and addresses issues that arise in terms of changing staff and the changed environment in which staff are employed.  The Act amends the 2004 legislation and takes into account the circumstances and current policies of the Government.<\/p><p>It is a fact that 37,500 public servants have either retired or have terminated their retirement in one way or another through early retirement or other means.  The public sector is under great stress with that number of people being removed.  However, the public sector in this country is derided in some quarters.  It is an excellent body of people.  Those who are employed within the public sector are dedicated people and work extremely hard on a daily basis.  They are cognisant of the situation the country is in and have sacrificed a lot in recent years in order to turn things around.  That has been successful.<\/p><p>It is also worth noting that more than 10,000 staff have already been redeployed across various Departments and sectors within local authorities.  It should be recognised that one cannot take staff from one section of the Civil Service or public sector and put them into another sector without proper training facilities being put in place.  Funding has been set aside by the Minister for that purpose.<\/p><p>The Civil Service and the public sector are completely different to how they were 25 years ago.  When I started my working life I was a public sector worker.  The agreement in place at that time was that for every person who got promoted another person had to be taken from the seniority panel to complement the promotion.  That was the environment in place at the time but it has completely changed now.  The opening up of positions, in particular for the recruitment of senior staff, to external applicants has completely changed the focus of the public sector in this country.  That is to be welcomed.  If people are in a job for too long they lose their flair and energy.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  It is always good to have new people coming into a job, be it in the public sector or private sector.  The legislation will help to re-energise the public sector by allowing senior staff to redeploy to other Departments or between local authorities.  The Bill amends existing legislation.  In spite of the indication by Senator Barrett that a number of areas are precluded from the remit of the Bill it is still a positive development.  I would be interested to hear a response from the Minister on the sectors that are excluded.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne referred to staff and union agreements.  The Minister indicated that the legislation is technical in nature.  I assume agreements are in place to deal with the 2004 Act and that those arrangements will follow through on the enactment of the amending legislation.  I would like the Minister to clarify the point.<\/p> <p>It is very important as we move forward and, although this is separate from the Haddington Road proposals, it has ramifications for staff and it is important people would move into this in a willing way rather than there being an issue about it in future.<\/p><p>I welcome the legislation and hope it will be passed swiftly.  I hope it will help the recovery of the country and ensure those staff who are under-employed because of changes in their areas can be redeployed to allow them to find fruitful employment in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200032#GG00200","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371046500,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions on this Bill.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne asked a number of questions.  Is this wider than the Haddington Road agreement?  It builds upon what has happened in recent years.  We had significant redeployment of 10,000 people under the Croke Park agreement without any great hassle.  That was unprecedented.  There was, however, no legislative basis for that redeployment.  It was done on the basis of secondment and those people must have their positions formalised for their own security and that of their employers.  This legislation does that.  It removes the legislative barriers that prevent that.<\/p><p>There has been significant redeployment in the health service, which has been extremely flexible, with 5,880 people moving across the executive in the last couple of years.  In education, 1,772 staff, comprising 1,675 teachers and 97 administrative staff, have moved in the last couple of years.  In the Civil Service, 600 staff have moved into the Department of Social Protection, while another 1,770 from F&Aacute;S and 1,020 from the community welfare service moved into the Department.  These were not easy movements because the pay and structures were different.  It has always been difficult to achieve that flexibility.  It is important we put a formal structure in place to allow that to happen much more easily in future.<\/p><p>The unions were consulted on this and they raised no issues on these proposals.  They are consistent with Croke Park arrangements that were formally agreed and the arrangements outlined in the Haddington Road proposals.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne mentioned volunteers.  Organisations will identify posts that are surplus to requirement and will ask people to redeploy and look for suitable redeployment for them.  In the Bill, sectoral agreements will be fully maintained.  Haddington Road will run its course in the next few years, assuming it passes, but this Bill will be a permanent feature.  We do not want to instance particular agreements but all sectoral agreements will be reflected.  This Bill will fully reflect Haddington Road and the agreements on redeployment.<\/p><p>The Senator raised the important issue of a definition of basic pay.  The Senator is right that basic pay is core pay but not overtime pay.  It is important where a person is moving from a job, such as a nurse who routinely works overtime or is on night shift-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200033#HH00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1371046500,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Forget the overtime; I was talking about night shift.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200033#HH00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1371046500,"counter":265,"content":"<p>-----that the core pay would be protected, but a person will not get a shift allowance if he does not work the shift.  There is a formula agreed with the unions and this has been worked out in detail.  Will a redeployed person retain his allowances?  Yes, if he is working to another pattern that would require the same anti-social hours.  If that is not the case, there is an agreed formula for the allowance to be capitalised and a lump sum payment to be made.  That is all in an agreement with the public sector unions and that is why there was no resistance in the past and we do not expect any in the future.  It gives certainty to people when it comes to redeployment.<\/p><p>Senator Sheahan welcomed the proposals.  No one will be disadvantaged.  When a post at a fixed grade becomes vacant, unless the post itself is to be suppressed at that grade, we would not expect someone to work that grade for a lesser pay grade.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett raised a number of issues.  The Government economic service has been an extraordinarily good innovation but we have hired a number of young economists, some of them trained by the Senator no doubt, and while they were originally located in my Department, they are to be redeployed across the public service.  They played a sterling role in the Haddington Road negotiations.  They were of huge value.<\/p><p>This relates to the second part of the Senator's question on average play increasing.  The unit costs will increase into the future because the bulk of the Civil Service up to this point were clerical officers because of the nature of bureaucratic administration.  It is part of my job to get rid of that as far as I can.  There are more than 300 Government services available online.  When I started out 30 years ago, if I wanted to buy an airline ticket, I would go to the travel agent to buy one.  We would not dream of doing that now, and an increasing number of services are going online.<\/p><p>The Senator mentioned external recruitment and TLAC.  One of the first things we did as a Government, and which I did in my Department, and I do not mind admitting to the House there was some resistance from the permanent government, was to appoint a lay majority of non-civil servants to TLAC and a lay chair.  All senior appointments are now filled by a committee with a majority of non-civil servants and non-civil servant chair, and each interview panel is constituted on that basis.<\/p><p>In my Department, I have made three significant appointments in the recent past.  The new director of the office of reform has been working marvellously, and we presented the reform agenda in November 2011 - I am not sure if the Senator has had a chance to read it - with 200 timelined significant reforms, and we are on target as we roll those out.  They are ground-breaking reforms.  Last week it was my privilege to open the first significant shared service centre, PeoplePoint, where 48 human resource management centres are migrating to one.  Instead of every Civil Service agency and Department having its own human resource management, there is now one centralised unit for the entire service.  The next project we are working is to centralise in three centres the payroll for the entire Civil Service, which is currently in 16 centres.  We are looking at financial service management and a range of other services we can centralise in a shared services centre.  That model is also being rolled out to local government.<\/p><p>As there is less bureaucratic work, we will see more specialists working in the Civil Service, with more policy-driven economic advisers who are very competent people.<\/p> <p>While the unit pay costs will probably increase, the volume of personnel will decrease over time as more of the mundane work is done electronically and by means of new technologies.<\/p><p>I strongly endorse Senator Barrett's comments on the suite of activities under way in my Department.  The reform agenda being undertaken by the office of reform must be mirrored by the political reform agenda.  In that context, significant reform lies ahead in the Civil Service.  Senators will forgive me for pointing out that reform of the structure of the Oireachtas is part of this process.  Within the Oireachtas, the whistleblower legislation, restructuring of the Freedom of Information Act and a Bill providing for a register of lobbyists, all of which the Senator alluded to, will come on stream this year.  We have already completed, through the Seanad, legislation expanding the role of the Ombudsman and so forth.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett always refers to the commercial semi-State bodies when I bring legislation before the House.  These companies have a unique mandate and are not part of the Civil Service or Haddington Road agreement.<\/p><p>I do not agree with the Senator's comment that Ireland would be in the same position as Greece if it were not for emigration.  Our colleagues in RTE will be shocked by the decision of the Greek Government to close down the state broadcasting station last night.  I will have to restrain the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, in these matters.  If one examines in detail the calamity that has befallen Greece or the position that pertains in Spain, Portugal and Cyprus regarding benefits, supports and social transfers, one will find that despite the unprecedented meltdown in our economic fortunes, we have been extraordinarily resilient and resourceful in maintaining resource transfers, social welfare benefits and so forth at a much more robust level that obtains in the countries in question.  This should be acknowledged.<\/p><p>Senator Landy made an important remark on the quality of the public service and we should acknowledge that point.  In my first two years in office, I regularly read in some quarters a diatribe against and vilification of the public service as if all public servants were overpaid and underworked.  I see at first hand the quality of people in the public service, not only those on the front line such as doctors, nurses and garda&iacute;, to whom Senator Byrne referred, but civil servants who, throughout recent months, have taken on the most complex of agendas in the European Union and worked all the hours God sent in the interests of this State and the European Union.  It has been remarkable.  I am highly impressed by the work done by my team in all the areas of activity in which I have asked them to engage.  Senator Landy is correct in this respect.  I answered the Senator's other question on union consultation.<\/p><p>We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out any other issues Senators may wish to raise.  In essence, what is at stake here is the need to provide for a formal capacity to transfer public servants.  Where staff are moved, they will hold on to their pension rights, pay rights and so forth.  There is significant frustration in the public service, including among workers, that staff are under-deployed in some areas and completely overworked in others.  We need to have the capacity to balance this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200033#HH00400","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371047100,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371047100,"counter":268,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200034#JJ00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1371047100,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200034#JJ00400","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1371047100,"counter":270,"content":"<p>On that point, while a period of six days between Second Stage and Committee Stage is an improvement on previous legislation in respect of the time provided between Stages, the programme for Government contains a commitment to have one week between legislative Stages.

This matter was tabled to the Minister at that Department, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who gave a commitment to the Seanad in November 2011 that he would ensure this project was evaluated from a cost-benefit perspective.  As the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure, cost-benefit analyses come within his brief.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, raised this issue with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of a number of financial projects which come within his brief.  He responded by stating Senator O'Brien, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, had made a number of constructive points about the proposal and gave an express undertaking to have the matter investigated.  He stated:<blockquote>There is a propensity for engineers to have big schemes.  They much prefer to build reservoirs than fix leaks.  There is nothing sexy about fixing a hole but construction of a multi million euro dam and piping water for miles is a big event.  I prefer to fix the leaks.<\/blockquote>The Minister's statement shows a healthy and welcome degree of scepticism about the proposal to build a massive sewage treatment plant in north Dublin.  He also gave an explicit undertaking to have the proposal investigated to ensure, as we would all expect, that the sums add up and the project is appropriate.  A half-page chart published yesterday indicates the sums involved.  The project will cost, at a minimum, almost &euro;500 million because the chart lists the costs associated with the construction of a pipeline, utilities and land acquisition but does not take account of factors such as traffic disruption and the broader economic costs that are supposed to be taken into consideration.<\/p> <p>The Government's own guidelines for cost-benefit analyses make it very clear that broader social costs must be taken into account and that every proposal should be evaluated from the perspective of society replacing all of the costs and benefits on a comparative monetary scale.

All I can take from that is that he does not stand over this project and is not comfortable with answering any questions on it.  It does not stand up.

The subject raised in the House today is the greater Dublin drainage project, a critical wastewater project that will facilitate employment and economic growth in the wider Dublin region.  It is essential for that purpose into the future.  I can understand the frustration of local people but no matter where we put one of these treatment facilities, concerns will be voiced.  I assure Senator Power that there will be an opportunity for further public consultation when the matter is referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is the next stage of the process.<\/p><p>It is anticipated that there will be insufficient drainage and wastewater treatment facilities in the region by 2020 if a project is not progressed at this stage.  I understand from Fingal County Council that the greater Dublin strategic drainage study identified eight different strategy scenarios.  Each of these options was subject to detailed technical, social, economic and environmental analysis and, on foot of this, six of these scenarios were considered unfeasible.  Following a detailed evaluation of the final two scenarios, including assessment of the capital and whole-of-life costs, the development of a single regional wastewater treatment plant in the north Dublin area, with an orbital sewer connecting this to the existing network, was deemed to provide the required solution.<\/p><p>The strategic environmental assessment of the study concluded that the location for the new regional wastewater treatment plant should be identified following a rigorous alternative site assessment process.  In October 2011, Fingal County Council identified nine potential land parcels in the northern part of the greater Dublin area within which a proposed regional wastewater treatment plant could potentially be located, along with a marine outfall and an orbital drainage system.  These nine land parcels were then assessed as potential locations in which to site the regional wastewater treatment plant.  The routes for the orbital drainage system and the marine outfall pipe locations were also assessed.  Site-specific information, more in-depth desk-top research and detailed site surveys, as well as feedback from the public, were used to assist in identifying the locations with the least impact under 15 criteria.<\/p><p>Of these nine land parcels, three sites located at Annsbrook, Clonshaugh and Newtowncorduff were then identified by the council as emerging preferred-site options.  Following further analysis, consultation and consideration of all submissions, Fingal County Council announced on Monday last that Clonshaugh had been identified as the preferred site option for the development.  The assessment notes that in addition to the many technical and environmental benefits, the estimated overall cost during the lifetime of the project for this preferred site option is over &euro;80 million less than other options studied.<\/p><p>A further detailed appraisal of the project to be located at the preferred site will be undertaken by Fingal County Council over the next six months and the local authority will carry out a full economic appraisal as part of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200035#KK00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1371047700,"counter":286,"content":"<p>In response to the Minister's comment, unlike his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, I accept that there is a need for increased sewerage treatment facilities in north Dublin.

When schools apply for internships in the education sector, they are getting caught up in time constraints.  Deadlines have been published but when schools apply, they are advised that the applications will not be authenticated until 1 August.  This does not give them much time to advertise, interview and select candidates, and then arrange Garda vetting before the start of the school year.  As we all know, Garda vetting takes six to eight weeks at a minimum.  There is no way that the schools will be ready to appoint interns at the start of the school year.  I refer in particular to St. Brendan's College in Killarney, which has applied for a laboratory technician.  Its hands are tied because it cannot do anything until 1 August and the intern has to start at the beginning of the school year if he or she wants to complete a nine-month internship.<\/p><p>I had hoped the Minister for Social Protection would be here because I had wanted to ask her to bring the date for authentication forward to 1 July at the latest.

As of 6 June 2013, 17,986 individuals had commenced JobBridge internships, 6,045 were in active internships and 2,078 internship opportunities were advertised on the JobBridge website.  The independent evaluation of the scheme carried out by Indecon International economic consultants and published by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection on 1 May showed that 61% of those who completed an internship five or more months ago had progressed into employment.  These progression outcomes are exceptionally positive and compare extremely favourably with European averages in this area.<\/p><p>The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals to bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work.  In the current labour market, JobBridge provides individuals with a unique opportunity to secure work experience in a new field.  This is a win-win situation for all parties involved.  Interns gain valuable work experience which enhances their skills and competencies while the organisations involved benefit from fresh talent and ideas from people who could be excellent future employees.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection is committed to the continual monitoring and review of the JobBridge scheme, including its eligibility criteria, on an ongoing basis.  Any individual who wishes to report a suspected abuse of the JobBridge scheme is invited to contact the JobBridge team directly.  All such claims are fully investigated.  In addition to investigations, the Department carries out random monitoring visits and requires all host organisations to complete monthly compliance protocols.  More than 2,100 monitoring visits have been conducted to date and, very encouragingly, 98% of these visits have been satisfactory.  Remedial action is taken in cases of non-compliance.<\/p><p>As of 11 June, there were 487 interns in the education sector.  The Department takes the view that internships in the education sector are a special case where interns, who under the terms of the scheme are entitled to receive a high quality real workplace experience, are at risk of missing out on that high quality internship experience during academic holidays.  I accept there may be some circumstances where an education sector internship experience would not be affected by the academic holidays but, as the House will appreciate, it would not be feasible to review and examine all placements advertised within the education sector on a case-by-case basis.  Therefore, a clear and transparent operational decision was made that all such placements must coincide with the academic year.  Deadlines have been introduced, before and after which education sector internships will not be approved.<\/p><p>Applications are dealt with by the national contact centre in Edenderry, County Offaly, from 1 August to mid-September in the case of nine-month internships or to mid-December in the case of six-month internships.  Given the large number of applications processed by the national contact centre and to ensure internships in the education sector are not disrupted by the long summer holiday period, the Department operates a window system for receipt and processing of applications for internships in the education sector.  For the academic year 2013-14, this window commences on 1 August and terminates on 6 December 2013.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to vary these dates as to do so could result in internship periods running into the summer holiday period in 2014.  This decision was clearly advertised on the home page of the JobBridge website and every effort is made by the Department to provide reasonable notice of this arrangement to potential education sector host organisations.<\/p><p>The Department works with stakeholders to make JobBridge as easy to administer as possible, but our first concern is to ensure interns are not idle, abused or deprived of the high quality real workplace internship experience they deserve.  It is in the interest of the taxpayer as well as the jobseeker that we maximise future employment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200036#LL00300","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1371048300,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I could have done without the first part of the Minister of State's reply because it merely outlined statistics we already know.

What I have suggested would have the opposite effect because interns would be able to start earlier, at the beginning of the school year, instead of waiting until mid to late September.  If the date for authentication were brought forward to 1 July, schools would be ready to roll when the school year starts because they would have completed the Garda vetting process.  As Garda vetting takes six to eight weeks, there is no way schools can be ready to take on interns at the start of the school year if they commence the process on 1 August.

As he is probably aware, this building and the artefacts contained within it are, from a historical, recreational and cultural perspective, of special importance to the people of south Galway.  He may also be aware that the building was completely restored - replete with a collection of first editions of Yeats' work and also items of furniture - by the Kiltartan Gregory Cultural Society in 1965.  Following the flooding of the Cloon River in 2009, however, Thoor Ballylee was extensively damaged and has since not been open to the public.  All of the furniture and ancillary items were removed an placed in storage.  Despite significant works recently undertaken by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to protect the structure, it appears unlikely that Thoor Ballylee will ever be reopened in its previous capacity as a point of interest for tourists.<\/p><p>I previously raised this issue on the Adjournment in the Seanad.  At that stage, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht indicated that responsibility for the building may very well be transferred to his Department and stated that he is considering the possibility of establishing a cultural and educational centre there, which I very much welcome.  I am raising this matter again because the tower and the artefacts previously held there are critical to any tourism revival in south Galway.  Shortly after becoming a public representative in 2011, I set about working extensively on this issue as a means of maximising the area's connection to W. B. Yeats.  Thoor Ballylee is steeped in connections with Yeats.  He took up residence there in 1917 and used it as a summer home for his family until he left in 1929.  South Galway has suffered badly in recent years and it needs a tourism boost.  The allocation of some of the artefacts from the tower in alternative accommodation is critical to the revival of the tourism sector in the area.<\/p><p>The south Galway connection to Yeats should be just as important in the context of tourism as is the poet's grave in Drumcliffe, County Sligo, which tens of thousands of people visit annually.  The latter highlights the tourism potential of Thoor Ballylee to south Galway and the people who live there.  I have always advocated the tower being reopened.  I wrote to the Minister to request that funding be made available to facilitate such an eventuality.  If the tower is reopened, it is unlikely that all of the artefacts relating to it will be able to be housed there because, as already stated, it is proposed to put in place a cultural and educational centre at the site.  I request, therefore, that the Minister consider housing the artefacts relating to and previously contained in Thoor Ballylee in alternative accommodation, such as local museums or other suitable locations, in Gort and the surrounding area.  If this is done, members of the public will be able to view the artefacts and the area will receive a tourism boost.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200037#MM00300","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1371048900,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter, which relates to the future display of those artefacts relating to and previously contained within Yeats' Tower at Thoor Ballylee, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  The importance of Thoor Ballylee is fully recognised.  As the Senator is aware, Thoor Ballylee is the former holiday home of W. B. Yeats.  The tower house was given by Michael Yeats - the son of W. B. Yeats' - to the regional tourism authority, Ireland West, and transferred to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in 2006 when the authority was amalgamated with it.<\/p><p>  I know that Senator Higgins is <i>au fait<\/i> with the situation which obtains in this instance and that she debated the issue with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Cannon, last month.  However, by way of background for other Senators, I wish to explain that Ireland West was among a number of regional tourism authorities that were amalgamated with F&aacute;ilte Ireland at that time.  It is important that Senators be aware that on taking over the regional tourism authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland also took on the operation of an extensive network of tourism information offices throughout the country.  It is also important to be aware that the management and staffing of these offices, their opening hours and their locations are administrative and operational matters for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  In view of the pressure on the public finances and in response to changes in the needs of tourists, like many other State agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to reconfigure service delivery, reshape its services and prioritise the locations where tourism information offices are provided.  As part of this process, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been working in partnership with local communities, where possible, in the provision of tourism information by local groups and businesses.  During 2011 and 2012, F&aacute;ilte Ireland established a good track record in this regard when co-operation with local communities ensured that many tourism information offices that might otherwise have closed have remained open.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has outsourced the provision of smaller tourist information offices across the country and, to date, approximately 40% of these offices have been taken over by local authorities, chambers of commerce and community groups.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland does not operate tourism attractions and where it inherited such, it disposed of its interest at an appropriate stage.<\/p><p>  In the context of the specific situation at Thoor Ballylee, Senators will be aware that this area of Galway was badly affected by flooding in 2009.  The tower house was extensively damaged by this flooding and has been closed ever since.  In 2012, F&aacute;ilte Ireland spent &euro;200,000 in weatherproofing the building and protecting its fabric but, as matters stand, it is not fit for occupation and further work will be required if the building is to reopen.  However, it would not represent value for money for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to make any further investment in the tower house as the number of visitors who sought tourist information when the house was open was too small to justify spending scarce resources on reopening the building as a tourist information office.  In light of this, it is clear that Thoor Ballylee will not be used by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  As a result, other possible uses for it - outside the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and its agencies - are being explored.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has suggested that it might serve as a cultural and heritage centre.  This matter has been raised with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, who, it is understood, is considering the position.<\/p><p>  The future of the building will, needless to say, have a large bearing on the future location of the artefacts.  That said, it must be emphasised that the future of the building and the associated artefacts is primarily a matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  In that context, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is concerned with the protection of the artefacts and that the integrity of the collection, which has been accrued over a number of years, will be maintained.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has shown that it is prepared to be flexible in respect of the display of the Yeats' material and recently loaned out some of the artefacts for Sligo's second Yeats Day which takes place tomorrow.  I am pleased to advise the Senator that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has advised that it would be prepared to agree to a similar local arrangement, provided that local interests can identify a suitable organisation with the ability to give the appropriate assurances regarding the display and protection of the artefacts.  Such an organisation would have to be in a position to enter into a legal agreement with F&aacute;ilte Ireland because, as I am sure the Senator will appreciate, the artefacts must be safeguarded for future generations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200037#MM00400","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1371048900,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The fact the solution did not work out would have caused further stress to students.  The conditions under which students found themselves were not uniform.  The State Examinations Commission has stated the possible impact will be taken into account when completing the marking system.  It is very difficult to have a consistent approach.<\/p><p>It is particularly unfortunate this has occurred in the honours maths paper.  With the introduction of project maths quite a number of papers must be produced but we should have checks and balances.  We need a report so that teachers and students who sit the exam next year can have confidence and we can see what exactly went wrong.  It is easy to stand back and examine these issues in the cold light of day but the highly stressed situation of an exam hall must be factored into our reaction to this matter, into examining the papers and into preparing the papers for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200038#NN00300","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1371049500,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We are all on the same side.  Not that long ago the Minister wished 116,845 people good luck in the examinations.  We had a very good discussion in the House yesterday but it was overshadowed by much less creative events.<\/p><p>Mistakes were made and the apologies so far have been like those give by one senior counsel to another.  This is the State apologising to 15 year olds and a little more sympathy is required.  I know this is the Minister's nature because I have known him for such a long time.  People do not want to apologise because they are afraid they may end up in court.  This involves young people who are under great stress, as Senator Clune stated.  We should consider some forms of redress also.  The apology stated that these errors may have caused some distress and confusion.  They did so and the word &quot;may&quot; should be removed.  This is a stressful period.  The Minister is trying to tell other education stories other than on exams and it is unfortunate this happened.<\/p><p>Two mistakes were made in question 8 but the apology was for an error.  The apology also states no candidate will be disadvantaged by the more significant error.  The two errors were with regard to an internal angle and an external angle.  The Minister is an architect and Senator Clune is an engineer and it is a pity we did not have such expertise to correct the errors.<\/p><p>The ordinary level paper for project maths also contained two mistakes as it contained two items which were not on the syllabus in questions 5(b) and 5(c) and only one has been apologised for.  No apology has been issued with regard to question 6(b) on the ordinary paper, which 40,000 students took.  They were asked to construct an axial symmetry which was not on the syllabus.  The junior certificate exam also contained a typo as one of the questions should have read -1 -4 and not the two put together -14.  The statement apologised for some of the errors to the 15,000 students who sat the leaving certificate higher level paper 2, to the 1,276 students who sat the ordinary paper, the 2,441 who sat the foundation paper and the 1,500 who sat the junior certificate paper.  Another 30,000 were a victim of another junior certificate error and another 40,000 students should have an apology for the axial symmetry question.<\/p><p>The custom is that when errors are made they are read out before the exam starts.  We must do away with this.  The exam is tense enough without students wondering what they heard.  If there is a written error the correction should be in writing.  Erratum slips are inserted into publications and this should be the practice for exams.  We must liaise much more with the mathematics teachers' association.  We need them involved in the proof reading and printing.  With the support of everyone in the Oireachtas, including this House, the Government has the goal of having science and technology as the way to go.  Another disturbing report has been issued today by the Educational Research Centre about our deficiencies in this regard.  What happened in the exam does not help with an important national goal which we all share.<\/p><p>This must be corrected.  The 116,000 students affected want redress.  I would give full marks to anybody who attempted question 8.  The apology stated every effort will be made to ensure no candidates will be disadvantaged by the more significant error in question but two errors were made.  This subject gives bonus points for getting into high point faculties.  I know the Minister has other ideas about this, and we share them, but at present these points are needed and we are causing distress to 116,000 students.  Perhaps the State Examinations Commission should have been less legalistic and more altruistic and sympathetic, as we all are, towards 14 to 18 year olds at this difficult time in their careers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200038#NN00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1371049500,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for raising the matter.  At the start of these exams I stated that while 116,000 young students sit them at least 500,000 relatives, parents, brothers, sisters and everybody else do the exams alongside them, so this is a much bigger issue.  It is not unique to this country, but it certainly generates far more coverage than would normally be the case.  I will ensure the comments made in this Adjournment matter are brought directly to the attention of the State Examinations Commission.<\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission was established as an independent agency in 2003 to deal with the operational issues relating to State examinations.  Running the examinations is an immense logistical operation.  The examinations involve more than 116,500 candidates in more than 4,900 main examination centres and 10,000 special centres.  The process also involves more than 250 different test instruments, 90 curricular and 15 non-curricular subjects.  It is a big logistical test.<\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission has indicated that question 8 on Monday's leaving certificate maths higher level paper 2 contained, as Senator Barrett correctly stated, not one error but two.<\/p> <p>The commission has advised me that there were also errors in three other mathematics papers, both leaving and junior certificate, provided to candidates this year.  The SEC acknowledges that these errors may have caused confusion and distress for some candidates, and it has apologised publicly.  I accept that it did cause confusion to many people.<\/p><p>The process of creating an examination paper encompasses a number of stages including drafting, setting, proofing, translating and signing-off stages.  The development of examination papers is controlled through a range of guidelines and protocols that govern the work of the personnel involved.  The Chief Examiner for each subject is responsible for the preparation of examination papers and their marking schemes, and has overall responsibility for the content, standard and quality of examination papers.  I presume that includes accuracy as well.<\/p><p>Contract personnel with relevant subject expertise and experience are appointed and comprehensively trained to draft and set the examination papers under the supervision of the Chief Examiner.  At each stage of the drafting-setting process the examination paper is proofread and reviewed by the setting team in accordance with the Commission's procedures.  The proofing process involves the review, revision and processing of edits to the draft material.  The SEC's protocols require marking schemes and, in subjects such as mathematics, worked solutions to be prepared in tandem with examination papers, and assessment grids are used to ensure that questions on examination papers are on the published syllabus.  I have to tell the Senators that concern has been raised about that matter as well, separate to what we have been speaking about.<\/p><p>Although the SEC has a range of procedures in place to enhance reliability and to minimise error, it is an unfortunate fact that errors can occur on examination papers from time to time.  On occasion, errors are not detected in advance and come to light during or after the sitting of the examination.  The SEC aims to preside over a system that is completely error free.  However, it is recognised in examining circles that this will always be an aspiration rather than a completely achievable goal.<\/p><p>The SEC has expressed its regret for these errors, and I welcome that it has done so.  When errors occur, the SEC must focus on two issues.  As a priority, it seeks to ensure that no candidate is disadvantaged as a result of an error that has occurred.  Therefore, the impact of these errors on students' answers will be taken into account by the Chief Examiner when finalising the marking schemes for these exams.  The marking schemes will, as usual, be published along with those in all other subjects after the issue of results, in mid-August in the case of the leaving certificate and in mid-September for the junior certificate.  Leaving certificate students can view their marked examinations scripts to see how the published marking scheme has been applied to their work, while all students have the option of appealing their results.  Then, in the context of the specific error, the SEC reviews its existing processes and procedures in order to implement measures to strengthen the quality assurance underpinning the preparation of examination papers.<\/p><p>I assure the House that I have asked the SEC to report to me comprehensively on this issue.  In particular, I will bring to its attention and to the attention of the Chief Examiner the remarks made by Senator Barrett and Senator Clune on the impact any marking system might have on the outcome for students, particularly leaving certificate students to whom CAO options are of critical concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013061200038#NN00500","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371050100,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The suggestion of announcing that there is a mistake in something in writing is not good enough.  When these errors are discovered after printing we should be able to print erratum slips to deal with that because I can imagine difficulties arising under examination conditions if an announcement is made in what may be a very large hall, where acoustical difficulties may arise.  If the error is in print the correction should be in print, and I ask the Minister to consider that.<\/p><p>The SEC should comment on the fact that more errors than were apologised for have since come to light, and we have drawn attention to those in the mathematics papers and perhaps be more fulsome in its apology.  We are talking about young people of 14 or 15 years of age doing the junior certificate and this could give them a bad impression of education.  We are all there to try to help restore Ireland for them, and this is not a very good start.  <\/p><p>I appreciate the Minister's sincerity and involvement, and I thank Senator Clune for raising the matter on the Adjournment.  I wish the Minister well.  His attitude towards young people and students might help to inform some of these apologies and explanations.
