Attending with me today are two of our most prominent members and large players in the motor insurance market.  Mr. Paul Carty is managing director of ARB Underwriting and wears two hats here today: one as a managing general agent and the other as a broker; and Ms Caeva O'Callaghan of O'Callaghan Insurances Limited, whose broker business has a large personal lines client base.  Also with me are our director of general insurances, Mr. Brian McNelis, and Mr. Frank Lahiffe, our public affairs adviser.<\/p> <p>  Our members are at the coalface and have had to deal with the many confused and angry motorists whose premiums have increased by over 70% in recent years, although the majority remain claims free.  The reasons for the dramatic increases in premium have at this stage been well documented and what I would like to focus on in this brief presentation to the committee is what we consider as remedies to spiralling premiums, and, ultimately, to what will lead to a more consistent pricing model.<\/p> <p>  Insurers have failed in the past and probably will fail in the future.  We, in Ireland, have had too much experience of insurers failing.  The root cause has always been unsustainable pricing models to win market share.  In the 1980s, we had the collapse of PMPA and Insurance Corporation of Ireland, and in the past number of years we have seen the collapse of Quinn Insurance, Setanta and Enterprise and have also witnessed insurers having to be recapitalised by parent companies and investors to stay in business, namely RSA, FBD and Liberty.  Five years ago, drivers could get comprehensive car insurance for as little as &euro;230 which is approximately a third of the price in the 1980s.  Putting this pricing into context, it was well below most individuals' motor tax and also if the policy included windscreen cover, the cost of replacing that windscreen was more than the cost of the policy.<\/p> <p>  To arrive at a sustainable affordable price, certain market dynamics need to be urgently addressed.  We, as a body, have witnessed first-hand the dysfunctional nature of the present market whereby we have seen prices increase and margins improve, and yet insurers like Zenith are leaving the market while at the same time there is not a queue of insurers seeking licences from the Central Bank of Ireland to enter, or passport in to, the market.  This is because, apart from the small scale of the Irish market, the ability to make a return on capital is too uncertain.  If we are to have a functional market that is competitive, we need greater certainty to allow companies price properly and make a return for the shareholder.  In the Irish market today, capacity is reducing which inevitably leads to price increases and if the limited capacity is to continue, prices will inevitably rise further.<\/p> <p>  All stakeholders have a role to play in normalising the market - Government through policy changes, the Central Bank through proper oversight of pricing and reserves, the insurance industry by being more transparent on claims and the sharing of data, the courts in respect of awards, the broker in providing choice and claims support, and the consumer with regard to driving behaviour and fraudulent or exaggerated claims.  In particular, the Government has an important role to play and we believe these important first steps need to be taken as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  In essence, Government needs to take the following action.  It should ensure the market is attractive to new entrants and competition by removing uncertainty, and tackling the claims culture that currently exists.  Greater capacity in the market avoids the cherry-picking of perfect risks, increases competition, reduces price and improves choice for the consumer.  It should increase the powers of the Injuries Board, ensuring fewer cases end up in the courts and if they do, that the courts refer to the book of quantum.  This, we believe, would reduce significantly legal costs which could amount to approximately 50% of the overall claims cost in disputed cases.<\/p> <p>  Any innocent third party should be adequately compensated for injuries caused in a road accident.  However, up to 70% of all claims are for soft tissue injury with no long-term detriment to health or lifestyle.  There is undoubtedly an element of exaggeration, or indeed fraud, in many of these cases and therefore, if the incentive of cash was replaced with treatment for injuries, many of these claims would disappear from the system.  We would, however, reiterate that people seriously injured should get adequately compensated.<\/p> <p>  The Government should remove retrospection with regard to changes in legislation.  Insurers price on the factors that apply at the time of taking the risk.  However, we have seen in recent years changes that have affected claims not yet settled, examples of which are where they change the discount rate, court award limits and compensation rules.<\/p> <p>  The Government should appoint the Central Statistics Office to gather information regarding claims data.  The co-ordination of existing databases holding claims data, penalty points, driving licence and NCT information is essential in the efforts to fight fraud, improve processes and ultimately reduce costs to the benefit of the consumer.  Data protection rules are often used as excuses, but if the availability of data allows for better and fairer pricing models then in our view the majority of motorists will agree to allow visibility of relevant data.<\/p> <p>  The Government should set up a compensation fund to cover the inevitable future failing of an insurer.  It could be funded through contributions from insurers who operate in the market relevant to their market shares and by the current insurance levy on premiums.  This would ensure a level playing field for all operators in the market, take pressure off the Exchequer when a failure occurs and ensure that the industry does not have to cover the liabilities of an imprudent competitor, which makes no sense and would be a major inhibitor of new insurers entering the market.<\/p> <p>  Fraud needs to be punished to deter offenders.  If a case is fraudulent, wasting time, money and, more importantly, ambulance, fire and Garda resources attending an accident, the perpetrators should be heavily fined and in certain cases, receive custodial sentences.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank needs to make the public aware, from May 2017, of the solvency and financial control report, required under Solvency II regime, for all insurers operating in the Irish market which will greatly enhance transparency of their financial standing.  This will enable consumers and their advisers make more informed decisions regarding from whom they purchase insurance.<\/p> <p>  Insurers need to become more transparent and provide the relevant data on claims so that the whole claims picture is in the public domain.  The settling of claims early, and outside the courts, is acceptable if all parties are happy but the absence of data causes distrust when the industry is trying to explain the actions it is being forced to take.  Also, policyholders should be more involved when an insurer agrees to settle on their behalf.  In many situations, this only becomes apparent at renewal.  We all have heard stories of minor damage being exaggerated and settled without any recourse to the policyholder to defend the settlement.<\/p> <p>  Courts need to be mindful of the book of quantum as a fair assessment of injury compensation so that there is a consistency in awards.  Also, if cases are found to be fraudulent, they should be sent to the DPP with a view to criminal prosecution.<\/p> <p>  The Garda should be resourced to reduce the numbers of uninsured drivers who take chances knowing their chances of being caught are negligible.  All garda&iacute; should have APNR equipment so that they can scan registrations to see if cars are insured, and the requirement for insurance discs should be abolished.  If vehicles are not insured, they should be confiscated and the driver banned from driving for a number of years.<\/p> <p>  Drivers also have responsibilities.  They need to provide accurate details when acquiring insurance.  Education is required with regard to fronting, whereby the parent insures the car as the main driver, even though it is the son or daughter's car and he or she will be the main user of that car.  Parents think they are saving their children money when, in fact, their children are driving without insurance.<\/p> <p>  With insurance costs so high for young drivers, the premium is now often in excess of the value of the vehicle they purchase.  We tend to allow the most inexperienced drivers drive the oldest and less roadworthy vehicles.  Most of these older cars do not have the safety features of modern cars and may have previously been crashed or renovated.  There is also a strong correlation of older cars being used for fraudulent or staged claims.  We also need tougher penalties for speeding, careless driving and the use of mobile telephones when driving.<\/p> <p>  Brokers play an important role in the arranging of insurance.  Indeed, unlike an insurance company, they shop around at time of renewal to ensure their customers are getting the best cover at the most affordable price.  As a result of the current hike in premiums, members have seen an increase in new business.  However, with reducing capacity, their ability to find better priced products has reduced.  Also, certain insurers operate a differential pricing model whereby they offer different premiums for the same risk through different distribution channels.  They often also discriminate between new and existing customers.  In our view, a risk is the same irrespective of which channel it comes through or whether it is new or renewal, and the price charged should be the same.  In fact, purchasing insurance through a broker not only provides a wide choice of product, but also ensures a fairer settlement as the customer is often represented in the claim.<\/p><p>It is a dysfunctional market with no new entrants and the incumbents are losing money.  Unfortunately, we have a system with high awards, which, unless tackled, will lead to further premium increases.  The insurance industry not only provides significant employment but invests heavily in the economy and facilitates daily living and business through the transfer of risk.  It is imperative that we address the issues highlighted to the committee if we are to continue to have a competitive and profitable industry.  In the past, premiums were too low.  Consumers must realise the new norm will see average premiums closer to 1990 levels than what we have been used to in recent times.  The correction in premium size was warranted but in a functional market it would have been more gradual and less discriminatory.  I will be delighted to answer any questions that committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciaran Phelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473933600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.

The MIAB statutory investigation into the cost of motor insurance started in 1998.  We had a very strong board and a particularly strong statistician.  We had to threaten to resign <i>en masse<\/i>as a board because of the non-co-operation of the insurance industry at the time in providing data.  Our excellent statistician - I know I am not supposed to name anybody - was able to disprove some of the actuarial data models submitted to us and subsequently gave evidence at the Equality Authority on actuarial data produced to justify age discrimination, which turned out not to be age-related.  I give these examples from the point of view of how important it is not just to get data but to interrogate it.  At the time, the joint Oireachtas committee had an extremely important role in establishing the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  It is important to stress the Long Title of the Act, as its objective is the making of assessments to prohibit in the interests of the common good the bringing of legal proceedings.  This is the sole function of the Injuries Board in this context.  Representatives from the Injuries Board came before the committee yesterday, and much has been achieved, as was anticipated at the outset.  There was never any question of its being a lawyer-free zone.  We do not see that anywhere in the legislation and I never said it.  The heads of the Bill regarding section 7 made it very clear that nothing would stop people from getting their own advice from any agent or expert, but they would do so at their own expense.<br\/><br\/>The risk of introducing a streamlined quick personal injuries redress system is what is called the expressway principle - that is, that it would be made too easy.  The balancing measure is the Civil Liability and Courts Act, which is the deterrent to what I call exaggerated claims.  We need to discuss the word &quot;fraud,&quot; because it can be quite misleading.  In 2007 the PIAB experienced a situation whereby a small number of high-volume solicitors rejected PIAB awards but took the same money the next day and received litigation costs.  Unfortunately, the industry did this.  Legislation was introduced in 2007 whereby if someone rejects a PIAB or Injuries Board award the amount stands as a tender or lodgement in the court system, in accordance with existing court rules, and if the court does not award any more than this the party ends up being liable for both sets of costs and will probably receive no compensation.<br\/><br\/>In 1986 a joint Oireachtas committee examined this issue.  At the time, litigation overheads were considered to be a mouth-watering 25% of the cost of insurance.  That committee was chaired by Ivan Yates.  We now know that by the time of the MIAB report this had risen to 46%.  I understand the Injuries Board uses a figure of approximately 60%, based on data from the National Competitiveness Council.  In October 2008, I told a joint Oireachtas committee that we had come a long way from the 1996 Deloitte report, when it took five years for people's cases to reach compensation settlement.  Perhaps during that time insurers used investment income to delay paying out claims, but it ceased to be a good business model to rely on investment income from the time the PIAB came into operation, when the maximum wait would be nine months and the statute of limitations was adjusted to two years.<br\/><br\/>In April 2014 I carried out my final function as chair of the PIAB before I retired very early.  It gives me no pleasure to say I saw this coming and had seen it coming as far back as 2013, particularly with regard to increasing the compensation limit in the Circuit Court from &euro;38,000 to &euro;60,000.  The last time that happened, in 1999, for supposedly the same objectives, it did not work and the Central Statistics Office index increased by 81%, but that was over a decade and not over three years as we see here.  When I challenged the Irish Insurance Federation as to why it was not pressing for this not to happen, I was told it wanted to focus its lobbying of Government on the single issue of the introduction of compulsory private pensions.<br\/><br\/>I have been asking myself what questions would I ask if I were a committee member.  One is what success would look like for this project.  The first element would be to stop the further increases that apparently have been signalled.  I will be cautious about what I say about this, because I understand the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will investigate it.  I note with some irony that some representatives of the insurance industry in this morning's newspapers state that they relish the fact that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is to investigate the high level of awards in Ireland.  I understand from the press release from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission that what it will actually investigate is megaphone collusion.<br\/><br\/>The next question to consider is the real reason we have seen the increases that have taken place.  If it is because of unpreparedness for Solvency II, we will not like it, but it is a one-off and we will not have further increases.  Let us put a price on Solvency II, as we really need to get to the bottom of this.  The data I have point in a different direction.  Longer term, because there are urgent actions that need to be taken, we should stop the boom-and-bust economics that seem to operate in the insurance industry.  We have seen elsewhere where it can lead.<br\/><br\/>I am here to assist the committee because I feel I have unique expertise in this area.  I have experience of implementing successful reforms.  I am here solely in a personal capacity.  As I have stated publicly, I am very concerned that insurers are being allowed to dictate the reform agenda without any empirical evidence to support their arguments - in fact, to the contrary.  I have provided the committee with some data on this and comparisons with other EU member states on average claims costs and average premiums.  If insurers had been allowed to dictate the reform program with regard to the MIAB and establishing the PIAB, we would not have had the 40% reduction in the CSO index in the following decade, which was to the end of 2013.  It has all gone pear-shaped since then, which has nothing to do with the fact that I retired at the same time.  I have no confidentiality issues because it was before the PIAB was a statutory body.  I see indications that the Irish Insurance Federation is making demands for the Injuries Board to do a whole lot of things that would be offensive to the separation of powers and would usurp the position of the courts, and these must be resisted.  According to international research I undertook as part of my PhD, this type of thing has happened before.  The unsuccessful reforms in the UK have been a disaster, as is the case in some US states.  The most seriously injured have been the biggest losers and policyholders have not gained anything.<br\/><br\/>The real pressing issue for today, in my view, is that reputational damage is being done to Ireland Inc., and I can provide the committee with many examples.  This is putting the frighteners on potential entrants.  I also suggest that there is a potential constitutional challenge with regard to the quantum as planned, for reasons of principle and pragmatism.  I am sorry to say prices are not the only problem with the insurance industry, and I will quite happily discuss this with the committee.<br\/><br\/>In its 2004 report, the MIAB had to state that matters had got worse regarding victims' rights under EU motor insurance directives.  The Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, was given special powers which, in the opinion of the MIAB, are contrary to rights under EU law.  As the MIBI is an emanation of the State, it has been charged with this responsibility by the State.  In 1999, Mr. Justice Brian McMahon found that there was a danger of Francovich damages against Ireland and, if there are, it will go on the bureau and the policyholders.  It is another emerging bomb that we need to defuse.<br\/><br\/>I have thought about measures the D&aacute;il could take next week.  I suggest a review of ministerial portfolios.  We should reverse the Act that increased compensation in the Circuit Court from &euro;38,000 to &euro;60,000.<\/p><p>If we pass a law and it is not working and if it is not done in the European Union - we have sovereignty here - then I think we should reverse it.  We should simply say that we have tried it but it does not work because it has not fulfilled any of the objectives and it is having numerous unintended consequences.  We should take it on the chin, reverse it and bring back stability because stability is what we all need.  Certainly, it is what insurers need.  Moreover, we should not operate the book of quantum as currently set out, and I have explained why.<\/p><p> We really need to beware of rhetoric, anecdotes, hearsay and short-term thinking.  Insurance is a long-term business.  We should stick to the available data and then chase the missing data.  There is plenty of data.  I have given the committee much of it.  I have stacks more but I did not want to inundate the committee.  Having read the transcripts I have been surprised by some of the contributions, especially at the extent to which the existing data has not been referred to by people who would present themselves as professionals in this business.  If they are not looking at this data when they are doing their job, then I am sorry but I have to call into question the governance structures within the industry.<\/p><p> My experience on reform is that we need to define the challenge properly before designing the reforms.  It is very important to uphold the rule of law.  I will set out two examples.  One involves an insurance company.  The details are in the public domain and the case, involving Aviva, has been mentioned in the committee.  The excuses the company gave were extraordinary.  There is no fact in any of it except for one point of fact, supposedly, which is the 34% increase in High Court awards in 2014 compared to 2013.  Frankly, I consider that to be schoolboy mathematics.  It is misleading.  Are those responsible speaking out of both sides of their mouths?  Are they saying to their staff that they should pay 34% more in High Court cases because the company will not get rid of them otherwise?  Are they saying something completely different to our Government and their shareholders?  It is not that they do not know because the figures were announced at an actuarial company breakfast briefing which I attended.  I stood up and challenged the calculations because I had the raw data.  I knew the median, which is the figure we use if there is big range.  Let us suppose there are 500 cases and numerous are at the &euro;5 million level as well as some down at the bottom.  The median is actually the technical statistical term we use.  The median had gone down.  I stood up and explained that I was sorry to be awkward but that it was altogether misleading.  I actually approached the actuary afterwards and suggested that those responsible should not go with those figures because it was bad for their credibility.  I also approached Michael Horan of the Irish Insurance Federation and pointed out that although numerous problems needed to be solved, the approach being taken was not credible and that I intended to keep saying that it was wrong.<\/p><p> There are things the committee members could do in the D&aacute;il to stop this rot.  I have tried to show in some of the data I have presented that Irish motor underwriters are making far greater profits than their United Kingdom counterparts.  We saw the same in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board back in 2004.  I am conscious of the fact the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is, according to the press release, signalling for next year a further 20% change.  That has to stop.<\/p><p> What we really need to focus on - I know this from speaking to people - is making Ireland a benign environment for new entrants.  My view is that many of the things being said about many situations, including uninsured driving, amounts to giving out deliberate bad messages about Ireland as a place to do business.  It was really embarrassing when Royal Sun Alliance had to put in extra money.  I think there were perverse incentives in the bonus structure.  That is a personal view - I am not making any accusations.  The chief executive got &euro;1 million from the Employment Appeals Tribunal for unfair dismissal, so I do not know anything about the rest of the situation there.  People who are in the business read the trade journals.  That applies whatever the business.  The international trade journals painted the situation as being the Irish problem, again.  Actually, it was nothing to do with the Irish market but rather it had to do with lack of governance at board level.  Let us suppose a person is sitting in the head office of a European or transnational company in London.  If most of the company's profit is coming from little old Ireland, then those on the board need to ask themselves some governance questions.  Chopping off the head of the chief executive, in my view, is not a sufficient response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Dorothea Dowling","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the two deputations for their presentations.

As I said in my presentation, they started to drop significantly approximately four or five years ago, especially when several of the online distributors started to come into the marketplace.  It was as if they had found a new way of pricing motor insurance.  We took the view that the pricing was very aggressive.  On several occasions, we talked to the Central Bank about the pricing models to ensure those responsible were happy that those pricing models were actuarially calculated and that there was a basis behind them.<\/p> <p>  We are price takers in the marketplace; we are not price makers.

The Central Statistics Office index is a published and reliable statistic and it is in the pack supplied to committee members.  The index of motor insurance inflation has been coming down every year from 2003 to 2009.  In 2009, the Central Bank asked all the non-life insurance companies to undertake a stress test.  We all know from the banking inquiry what that is.  Then, the price index actually went up in 2009.  There was nothing in the claims market that I could identify which would have caused it.  The fact that two elements of data correlate does not mean they are causative but my reading is that a stress test was done by the Central Bank.  The sense was that there was too much price cutting in light of the new Solvency II Directive regime, which had been flagged since 2007.  Then the index went up in 2009.  I do not know the outcome of those stress tests but I imagine Central Bank representatives can tell committee members.  However, it is history now; it is from the old regime.  I cannot agree that this is only from past four or five years.  In fact, I believe the difficulties started earlier.  According to the data, following the stress tests, it started to go up a little.  Then, the gender directive came in from January 2012, according to which men and women had to be charged the same.  According to the data I have given the committee, this has caused insurance premiums to go up by 25% for males under 35 years.  There are other factors as well but I was keen to point out these facts as a matter of data correctness.  I am sorry for cutting across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Dorothea Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Again, we hear about the claims culture.

From its introduction to June 2016, only 32 cases were fought by defendants and not all of them were insurance industry cases.  A total of 19 cases were dismissed.  There is a pretty good chance of them being dismissed if the industry pursues them but short-termism arises.  I think the AA said that the industry is not really concerned about fraud as long as it can price for it because it can pass it on to policy holders.  It is important to emphasise that of the 19 cases that were dismissed, 12 were what is called assessment only where the person who was being sued agreed that they caused the accident but they felt that the claim was exaggerated.  I will give members an idea of the type of injuries involved.  Two cases involved fractures.  In one case, a man maintained he was in a wheelchair for life, video surveillance showed that this was not quite the case and the case was thrown out.  In another case, a person was an amputee.  That counts for four of the 19.  The remainder were what are called soft tissue injuries so there is an issue.  There is some very good socio-economic analysis of that.  A total of 14 of those cases involved the building trade.  One can understand how during a recession, the building business goes bust so soft tissue injury claims could be an alternate.  I am speaking from the records of the written judgments rather than expressing a personal opinion.<\/p> <p>  In respect of care versus cash, as a Master of Laws, I would say that this would probably be unconstitutional and would also not be compliant with the EU directive on motor insurance, which says that victims in motor insurance claims are to be dealt with in compensation terms under national law in no less favourable terms than any other injury.  I am sure the Attorney General could answer that question.  I am also counselling against something completely different which might be very disruptive and create volatility and uncertainty when the solutions might be far simpler.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Dorothea Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Again, this is my concern in terms of \"care, not cash\" in that we are presenting this as a solution when it will not be a solution at the end of the day.

As everybody has said, there is no one single solution.  It is a combination.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on some of the comments that have been made.  One area that is very hard to manage involves soft tissue assessment-only cases where there is no liability.  In this scenario, it has been determined that an accident, frequently of a very minor nature, has occurred.  It can involve soft tissue injury or a psychological impairment of some kind.  From the insurance industry's perspective, what is a bit frustrating is that sometimes one can have an engineering report that shows that an accident was of an extremely minor nature but those making the assessment such as the Injuries Board, the courts subsequently or the system must take on board the medical opinions here.  In our experience, the medical opinions are not often read in conjunction with the engineering reports showing that they are very mild.  As a consequence, one can have some dramatic cases where the actual assessment of the physical damage done to two vehicles can be under &euro;500 but the award can be &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000.  People can suffer significant injuries in those circumstances but I think it is overplayed and we need some system that allows us to better assess the combination of the actual circumstances of an accident and the ultimate award provided.  It is very difficult for the medical profession when members of the profession interview an individual who is trying to explain to them the nature of their injuries, for example, that they have a stiff neck.  They cannot judge it.  It is very difficult.  Naturally, they tend to reiterate what the client has told them in the medical report.  Producing evidence to that effect is always much more difficult except in severe cases, which are all too easy to identify and which we all accept must be properly compensated.  However, there is a huge range with regard to what we are talking about and right now and I am not sure we are handling it properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Carty"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Again, there is an over-emphasis on that solution but I appreciate the point Mr. Carty is making.

I want to drill down to this issue of data.  It seems there is not perfect knowledge in terms of how the industry operates.  We do not have perfect knowledge except through the reports we have from the PIAB.  Its submission to the committee gave the average award from 2009-15, which was approximately &euro;23,000.  The PIAB submission stated there is:<\/p><blockquote>...no public information available relating to overall numbers and costs of claims for personal injuries and the only figures that were made public did not contain any information on the costs of directly settled cases.  Without access to that information, a full picture of the impact on insurance premiums is difficult to establish...<\/blockquote> <p>The Irish Brokers Association, IBA, submission states the same thing.  I am trying to grapple with the issue.  Insurance Ireland through its public utterances in the past 48 hours or so has been quoting from &quot;independent data sources&quot;, from the Injuries Board figures, from the bodily injuries review published by the Central Bank and from the OECD report which states that Ireland is the eighth most expensive country in which to enforce a contract, given the average award of a Circuit Court increased by 21.2% in 2015, following a 13.5% increase in 2014.  The point I am getting at is that I do understand why Insurance Ireland is not sharing data.  First, I am making an assertion that is it not, so the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong and I would like to get the IBA position on that.  If we had perfect knowledge in regard to all of the claims, we would be able to drill down to the reason people's premiums have gone up by 70% to 80% or why some people are not being insured at all.  To give an example I have used before, if a premium goes from &euro;500 on a Thursday to a cost of &euro;800, which is a surcharge of &euro;300, what percentage of that &euro;300 is what I call super-normal profit and what percentage is attributable to the cost of the historical decrease in insurance and the provisioning that is necessary?  The witnesses should correct me if my analysis of the situation is wrong.<\/p><p>I am directing my questions in the first instance specifically to the IBA.  The second element I need an answer on is in regard to Zenith.  There seems to be a contradictory position between what Insurance Ireland is saying and what Zenith is saying.  If I understand Mr. Humphreys correctly - he is on the public record so I have no issue about naming him here - he is saying Zenith is exiting the market because it does not have access to proper data.  If so, I would like to have an assessment or a view from the IBA as to why that is the case or what its take is on that.<\/p><p>I was very taken by a point in the IBA submission, which states: &quot;All garda&iacute; should have APNR equipment so they can scan registrations to see if they are insured, and the requirement for insurance discs should be abolished.&quot;  If we think about that logically, the driver gets the insurance disc in the post and slots it into the pouch on the window, and the technology now exists to scan or copy it in order to create a false disc.  If we are depending on a garda at a checkpoint with hundreds of vehicles passing through to intimately examine the disc, there is a case to be made for the APNR model so this can be based on checking of registrations, and we can look at the enforcement procedures thereafter.<\/p><p>What this committee is trying to do is to drill down into what it is that we need to recommend by way of solutions.  I will come back to Ms Dowling in the second part of the meeting as she suggests there is a potential legislative solution to this.  Those are my opening remarks and I will come back in again later, if I may.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#F00500","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473933600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>There are three questions within that.  At the outset, I want to point out I am a managing general agent and I represented Zenith in Ireland, so I have to be careful.  I wanted to put that on the record so we know where we are.  I want to deal with the disc piece first.  I liken discs to the old airline tickets in that it is time they were gotten rid of.  It is a paper chase, given we need special printing, we have to stick in them in envelopes and get things to hold them up on windscreens, and so on.  We have gone way beyond that.  Garda&iacute; should be able to go to a car and know it is insured, taxed and registered - that is where we should be.  I do not think we should be deflected from that target, so let us go for that.  That is the way it should be.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the hypothetical &euro;300 increase, the Deputy is looking for some sort of apportionment of how much one could blame on the various factors.  The Deputy knows we cannot give him more than a view.  I believe a significant portion is that it was underpriced in the first place because the market had just gone down.  Whereas we hear lots of quotes about a hypothetical Mrs. Brown whose premium has gone from &euro;300 to &euro;460 in a year, maybe it should not have been &euro;300 in the first place.  Whether it should have been &euro;340 or &euro;360, I do not know, and perhaps six years earlier, it could have been lower again.  We are taking it at a particular point, so there is a correction.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of the environment we are in, to which Ms Dowling and my colleague, Mr. Phelan, referred.  We do not know the effect of Solvency II, which historically was very important here.  We have to remember that under Solvency II, all insurers next May have to publish what is called an SFCR - a solvency and financial control report - on their figures for 2016.  We do not know what balance sheet re-jigging is going on this year to make sure it looks the right way, but that can have a bearing on what insurers might do.  They will hardly publish that they are doing that for the purposes of their SFCR.<\/p> <p>  As to Zenith and Mr. Humphreys, whom I know well and who is a very nice man, they have signalled they are withdrawing from the market.  They have said that, for a variety of reasons, they are simply unhappy with the courts system and the uncertainty, they are unhappy that the Injuries Board is not dealing with the number of cases they would like it to deal with and they are unhappy - their words - with the co-operation they have been getting from the industry.

We are beginning to drill down into the nub of this now.  If the insurance I am paying for suddenly increases by 20% or 30%, I will scratch my head.  Most people will accept that historically, it might have come down for a certain demographic.  Where is the loading?  Mr. Carty has referred to the SFCR.  If I am interpreting him correctly, he hinted that the corporates are rejigging balance sheets and preparing for the Solvency II rules.  It seems to me that the victims in this, if I can use that word, are the people who are driving cars in Ireland.  Regardless of the age of their vehicles or their own ages, their risk profile has not increased over a short period of time.  It does not matter if their cars are three months old or 30 years old.  If they have passed the NCT, they are roadworthy.  This is the point.  It seems to me that ordinary people are becoming victims or pawns in a bigger corporate game.  There is a bit of re-provisioning going on.  There is pressure to adhere to the SFCR rules or the Solvency II rules.  There is a bit of naked profiteering going on as well.<\/p> <p>  This is why the joint committee wants to drill down into the issue of public knowledge.  The market is not perfectly competitive.  If it were, anyone who wanted to enter the market tomorrow would have perfect knowledge of all elements of data.  The Injuries Board is telling us one story.  As it is a public body, we absolutely believe in the veracity of its figures.  Not everybody is going through the Injuries Board.  Why are the insurance companies settling?  We know there was a constitutional case relating to the right to legal representation.  I have sympathy for the IBA position in respect of transparency around the insurance system and the measures that can be taken.  Everyone is saying the same thing with regard to data.  We do not have perfect knowledge from the insurance industry.  Maybe we have to wait for Insurance Ireland to come in later on to drill down into that element of it.

I will not go into the detail.  This would have provided more transparency to those of us involved in public policy and to external parties that might have been thinking of looking at the market.  The Central Bank published such a breakdown from 2002 until 2009, but it stopped publishing it in 2009.  When I challenged it to ascertain why it had stopped publishing this information, it emerged - reading between the lines - that the insurance industry had told the Central Bank it was too much hassle and it did not want to do it anymore.  In its 2005 report on the insurance industry, the Competition Authority said not only that what the MIAB had recommended should be done, but also that it should be done in respect of public liability and employers' liability as well.  That is relevant to the motor sector because they all involve injury.  We can see the injury trend here.  Rather than taking the advice of the MIAB, the Central Bank did a consultation process, largely with the industry.  Anybody could have been involved in the consultation process, but I am sure those who were most interested in it were involved in the industry.  As a result, the MIAB recommendation died a death.

I ask the members to imagine a Transit van about to pull,  rather than reverse, into a parking space.  If one is pulling into a parking space, one will be going pretty slowly.  As this Transit van was pulling into a parking space in rural Ireland, it glanced off the front of a people carrier in the space behind.  Whether the people carrier was moving out at the time is another matter.  Our chap moved in and claimed liability.  As such, it was assessment only and one is not arguing about who was to blame.  The garda who attended said it was hardly an accident at all.<\/p><p>According to the engineer's report we got, there was a pencil mark on our Transit van.  There was some scraping on the other vehicle.<\/p><p> The bottom line is that the person in the other vehicle claimed &euro;950 in damages for a car, which is neither here nor there, and actually got &euro;380.  There were two ladies in the car - one was pregnant - and four children.  The final award was approximately &euro;85,000 because of claims of psychological impairment to the four children.  The courts have to rule on any award that one provides.  We offered more than &euro;3,000 per child, for example, but the judge would only rule for a minimum of &euro;7,500 because of allegations that the children were wetting their beds.  Nevertheless, &euro;380 of physical damage was done to the vehicles and the cost was approximately &euro;84,000.  I am not saying that the children might not have deserved that but what questions were asked and how would one challenge that?<\/p><p> I have a case this week involving a Jeep.  Our insured driver ran into the back of a Jeep.  It was a tap.  Our insured driver had a cracked number plate.  The Jeep had a tow bar.  There was an impact on that and damage done to the radio.  The Jeep's driver is claiming &euro;500 because orange juice spilled on the radio.  Two people were in the Jeep and we have received a solicitor's letter.  The process will go to the Injuries Board but the dance has started.  God knows where it will take us.<\/p><p> Given our day to day experience, we believe that the Injuries Board was a terrific revolution under Ms Dowling's guidance - it needs to be reviewed and we would like to see it enhanced in some shape or form - but many assessments are rejected by clients.  This means that cases automatically enter the court system.  Hypothetically, if the Injuries Board offers &euro;15,000 and the person feels that he or she can get more, we must pay two sets of lawyers.  We are threatened with a Circuit Court action.  Given that court's jurisdiction, we are threatened with the certainty of having to pay out approximately &euro;20,000 in costs.  We would not want that action to proceed in the court, particularly given the medical and legal costs, so we would put an extra few bob on top of what the Injuries Board was going to give.  In an economic sense, one would be rewarding the non-acceptance purely to avoid costs running out of control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#J06800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Carty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473933600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>The acceptance rate of Injuries Board awards has been stable for the past eight years at 61%.  That is a hard piece of data.  I have listened to what Mr. Carty stated.  Part of the reason that the industry has not supported the Injuries Board is because the industry does that sort of thing.  With the assistance of the Houses of the Oireachtas, we introduced amending legislation.  If one rejects the award, which is a statutory award and has the same status as a court order, it stands as a tender or lodgement.  If one does not get more, one is at risk in terms of both sets of costs.  Short-termism on the part of the insurance industry means that it offers someone &euro;600 for fees.  It is the same amount of compensation.  This is a hypothetical example.  The person will not accept the Injuries Board award tomorrow because the industry has just told him or her that it will pay a little bit more if he or she rejects the award.<\/p> <p>  There should be a higher level of consent to Injuries Board awards, since only 6% of claims go to trial.  Given what someone called the bizarre behaviour of underwriters, however, the Injuries Board does not have full data.  It should have full data on all claims in 94% of cases.  I do not know whether this was a strategic decision on the part of the industry but I will say no more on that.  Mr. Carty is correct about the cost-benefit analysis.  If one engages in short-termism, one must consider the cost of going ahead with something.<\/p> <p>  When I worked in the self-insured sector and we were an identifiable defendant, one would go all the way with it because two messages would go out quickly, the first of which was \"soft touch\".  The second was that, if we went hard at them, got an award for costs and went to collect &euro;5 from them every Friday night, they would be asking whether we had nothing better to be doing.  They would be in the pub complaining about a utility coming to collect &euro;5 every week.  This sends out a good message to the effect that it is not a free ride and there are downsides.  However, the insurance industry does not follow this type of model like it used to in the old days when I worked in the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Dorothea Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>What should be done with the Injuries Board?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#K00300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473933600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Very little in this sense.

Using the maximum in a celebrity case - it was &euro;400,000 for a quadriplegic, a person who, sadly, was not getting better; such people are the serious cases - as 100% on our scale, one would calibrate the other injuries down that scale to 1%.

The law has changed; that is the Court of Appeal.<\/p><p>Since then, from looking at the published judgments, the High Court judges are not following that direction from the Court of Appeal.  If the High Court judges are not following a direction from the Court of Appeal, they are most certainly not going to follow a direction from the executive or from a book prepared by the PIAB.  The second reason why it should not be based on settlements by insurers is that insurers are telling the Government - and this committee, I suspect - that High Court awards have gone up by 34% when they have not.  That would mean that they have been telling their staff that they are going to have to pay up to 34% more on High Court cases to get rid of them.  They have actually been throwing money away.<\/p><p> Alternatively, when we produced the original book of quantum to take the \"guessing game\" out of it, as one academic called it, we did not rely on data.  We had a professional person who is expert in this area, Dr. Brian Greenford, who went in and examined the actual files.  He also went over to England to examine files there.  At that time, our damages were 12 times what they were in the UK.  They are now twice what they are in the UK.  There may be reasons on a insurer's file why a certain amount of money is paid out.  The claimant does not feel confident about the case and takes half the value.  If one only takes the data, which is the final settlement figure and seems to be all the PIAB have, one does not see that nuance or realise that a claimant thought that he or she was on the back foot or that the insurance company paid less that the claim was worth.  Therefore, data in itself are not sufficient.  There has to be the qualitative and well as the quantitative aspect.  I also have a trust issue in regard to data from the industry, in light of the MIAB's experience over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#L06300","nonspeaker":"Ms Dorothea Dowling","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Before I call on Ms O'Callaghan am I right in saying Ms Dowling is arguing for a different approach?

I suggest that the PIAB run it because it has most of the data.  All claims must be registered there.  This would not only be helpful with data in the insurance industry, it would also tackle money laundering because there is organised crime involved in some of these cases.  It would also tackle the situation which can arise in which some claimants receive an award for medical expenses, put that money in their back pocket, make a claim for tax relief on medical expenses or get money back from the hospital, which is entitled to charge the full economic rate for a hospital in a road traffic accident.  They put that in their back pocket as well.  These payments would all be registered.  For example, if somebody wanted to make a tax relief claim for their medical expenses, Revenue would have the details and be able to say the person in question had already got that money back in a claims settlement.  From the point of view of the Exchequer and hospitals, if the full economic rate is due to a hospital for a claimant being there for five nights or whatever, that amount is paid straight to the hospital.  At the moment, the HSE has to chase the plaintiff to get the money.  Administratively, it has so many potential advantages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#M01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Dorothea Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Okay.  I would like to come back to the purpose of this and what people want, which are solutions.  They also want to figure out what is going on here and why it has gone on.  Ms Dowling mentioned an area at which I have been looking.  If the cause of this is Solvency II, the insurance industry should just say it, apologise, get on with it and stop all this pretence that it is about something else that is not related to the issues that have appeared over the last two years.  The European stress test that took place in 2014, which 60% of the insurance voluntarily took part in, found that we were very vulnerable to a period of low interest rates.  We know that is exactly what happened as a result of quantitative easing.<\/p> <p>  My own assessment of looking at the core data here is that the medium of High Court awards has not gone up, legal fees have not gone up - indeed it is argued that they have gone down - the amounts paid for whiplash have been paid historically at that level so it cannot be the factor, and the frequency in claims has not gone up.  All of these issues do not stack up.  Fraud has not increased in the last number of years.  It has always been suggested that is has been &euro;50.  Whether one believes it is &euro;50 or not, we will leave that for another day.  Ms Dowling made those arguments in her presentation.  Therefore, what is the factor that has driven a 70% increase?  I ask Ms Dowling, as well as the IBA, to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  From my view, it is the issue of the investment arm of these insurance companies which lost over &euro;100 million in their investment or had their investments reduced by &euro;100 million over a two-year period.  Solvency II kicked in and meant that they had to increase their capital base.  This is not based on risk at all.  It is based on the fact that the companies have to ramp up their profitability.  They have had to do it over a very short period of time because they acted in my view recklessly up until then.  The people that are now feeling the pinch are those who are getting a 40% premium, if they are lucky enough to be on the average, and the outliers who are seeing 200% or 300% increases.  That is my own assessment from what I have heard so far and from what I have investigated so far.  I ask Ms Dowling to comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#M02000","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473933600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I would give Deputy Doherty questions to ask of the Central Bank when it comes before the committee as the regulator because there was a stress test done on life insurance, or so we were told, back in 2009.  Presumably, the companies passed that stress test in regard to claims reserves, etc.  That seems to be reflected in the CSO.  There was a bit of a hike as well.  Back in 2009, we were all fine on the question of solvency.  At an actuarial briefing in November 2013, on which I have given the committee slides, there was a survey among those who were there as to how many companies were ready to implement Solvency II.  Only 13% of companies had it fully implemented.  We are not talking about some little accounting thing that can be done overnight.  It is raising capital and it is a long process.  40% of the companies in the survey had partially implemented it.  How did we not know this was coming down the tracks?  We had a stress test, or so it seems, by the Central Bank in 2009 and everything looked rosy.  There is a real data question to put to the Central Bank.  Remember that the extra requirements in Solvency II are not just the EU-imposed ones.  As the MIAB stated in its report, the regulator in this country has a habit, in order to sleep well at night, of requiring much more than what the EU requires.<\/p><p>I am not sure if that is the case now, but it is a question that might be asked.  Another question is of the &euro;1 billion motor premium income, how much extra would have been required on that to bring it up to solvency?  Is it an extra 30% or 40%?  We then park that.  It is a one-off.  It will not happen again.  They are bold boys.  We must look now at the rest of them that we need to do something about rather than starting off by cutting victims' rights and doing many other difficult things that are probably doomed to failure.  <\/p><p> My research shows that the rehabilitation system which was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1999 turned out to be a disaster because the medical professionals were arbitrating the system.

In slide No. 47 I have given the members some connections to an increase in profits being announced by these companies and projecting profits for 2017.  Whatever has gone on in the past, it cannot go on forever because it seems that with regard to the suspicions some people had about restoring profitability, talking out of the other side of their mouths, they are actually telling shareholders and investors that they will be in profit or that in one place they are already in profit.<\/p> <p>  It is also ironic to be complaining about \"passporting\" insurers when some of the insurers who were based here have now shifted to head office in England, and they are \"passporting\" into Ireland.  Brexit will be important for us.  We have to look after ourselves.  We have partners in England.  If many insurance companies decided that they can no longer be located in England, and companies do not like uncertainty - they want to plan for tomorrow and next year - they will base themselves in Ireland to do the European market.  We then have the potential to have many new players in this market, provided it is benign.  Currently, however, we are sending out all the wrong signals to potential new entrants, and we are depriving them of the data which exists but is only available to members of the Irish Insurance Federation, and companies should not be obliged to join the federation in order to get the data.  The Central Bank should have it.  The overwhelming opinion of the insurers at the briefing I referred to was that it should be an independent body nominated by the Central Bank.  I want to stress that it is all anonymous.  I was questioning the methodology of something they said and they replied that they could not do any more than that because of data protection, which is not true.  There are many exemptions under section 2 of the Data Protection Act.  If someone is doing something that is required by legislation, by ministerial order, in the public interest such as prevention of crime, and there is an entire list of them, everybody seems to say, \"Oh, data protection.  We cannot do that\".  That is not true.  There is no barrier to the collating of data.  The 2005 Competition Authority report specifically states that there is an exemption under an EU regulation because in all types of insurance it is vitally important that there is not information asymmetry and that all the information is available publicly so that public policy as well as new entrants have access to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#N01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Dorothea Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>We were told by the representatives of the law society yesterday afternoon that it was not valid for us to compare costs across Europe because most of Europe, other than the UK, does not have a legal system like ours.

It is very important that when people get their renewal notices, and I gave the Senator the number of the statutory instrument that can be used for that, they should state that of the premium quote, this is the amount that is compulsory insurance and this is the money for all the other bells and whistles.<\/p><p>It is the same when it comes to one's car.  My car is 12 years old and those in the industry would write it off.  What is the point in my paying for comprehensive cover?  I would not submit a claim in any event because I would be afraid of losing my no claims bonus.  One can see from an insurance renewal the insurance cover that is compulsorily required by law and one can pay that amount.  However, one would say, for example, that they do not want the breakdown cover as they already have AA membership and that they do want personal accident cover as they have that cover on their household insurance.  All that is enforced by law is the compulsory insurance component.  In other member states of the EU, that cover can be unbundled whereby one can get compulsory cover with one company and comprehensive cover with another.  One can get cover for one's test and one would lose one's bonus on that but one would not lose one's 60% no claims bonus on the big part of the premium, which is for third party injury cover.<\/p><p> Many people do not understand the insurance cover they buy.  The compulsory insurance cover is nothing to do with themselves or their car, it is to cover for somebody else being injured.  One gets a huge number of documents with one's renewable, which is mandated by the Central Bank.  I got 19 pages with my motor renewal.  I could understand the detail because I am a chartered insurer but it did not give me any of the information I needed.  It is a complete waste of money, a burden on the industry and of no benefit.  I always haggle.  I telephoned another company regarding household insurance and I got a scripted call from the person to which I responded that I was busy, I am a chartered insurer and that I understand all about averages and the duty with respect to misrepresentation.  The person apologised and said that they had to go through all that.  Most people have to listen to such scripted calls and we have no regulation effectively where we need it.  We have lots of burdensome, costly regulation.  That is not doing anything except doing a CYA for the insurance industry whose staff say that they told the caller about the small print during the course of a scripted telephone call.

If 20% or 30% of drivers were getting them replaced, that would be a different figure.  I do not have the statistics on the number of windscreen replacements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#O05400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473933600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Some 90% of policyholders every year do not make a claim.

I also have responsibility for criminal enforcement and corporate services.  I am joined by fellow members, Mr. Patrick Kenny, who is responsible for competition enforcement and advocacy and Mr. Fergal O'Leary, who is responsible for consumer enforcement, communications and market insights divisions.  Our chairperson, Ms Isolde Goggin, is unfortunately unable to be with us today.<\/p> <p>  We share the concerns of consumers, this committee and the Government about the rising cost of motor insurance.  Our consumer helpline has received 1,466 queries since the middle of last year about motor insurance, 227 of which were specifically about increasing motor insurance premiums.  We have closely followed this committee&rsquo;s deliberations and that of the Department of Finance working group.  We are grateful for the opportunity to discuss our work and views.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly outline our structure, functions and work in the broader insurance sector.  The committee will be aware that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, consists of a chairperson and membership structure which together form a collegiate decision-making commission.  In addition, each member has individual executive responsibilities.  The CCPC is the statutory body responsible for enforcement of competition and consumer protection legislation across the economy.  With a few important exceptions, such as groceries, our economy-wide remit means that we do not regulate individual sectors.  In relation to the financial services sector, Government policy means that, along with consumer protection, the Central Bank imposes the sectoral rules and codes of conduct under which financial services providers and the market must operate.  The CCPC enforces competition legislation which, in contrast to regulation, provides for intervention after a breach has happened.  We also have a specific remit in terms of personal finance information and education for consumers.<\/p> <p>  Sectoral regulators such as the Central Bank are usually the first port of call to address sectoral issues, given their in-depth expertise and sector-specific powers.  The exception to this is where the CCPC's remit and powers specific to the problems at hand, such as competition enforcement and public awareness, are not replicated by the sectoral regulator.<\/p> <p>  The CCPC has been active in the insurance sector over the years.  In 2005, the then Competition Authority undertook a major study which identified a number of reasons competition among insurance companies was not as strong as it could be.  For example, consumers were slow to switch to another insurer.  The study recommended greater disclosure of risk related data as a lack of data acts as a barrier to entry.  New entrants would find it extremely difficult to assess the overall market risk without accurate data.  We have on several occasions investigated complaints relating to alleged anti-competitive behaviour by industry participants.  These included an investigation into whether private motor insurance companies had regular access to competitor future pricing information through a shared IT system.  This was resolved by means of legally binding agreements and undertakings obtained from the relevant parties involved.  As part of our statutory personal finance education role, we provide information to consumers to help them make informed choices.  Along with conducting consumer awareness campaigns, we publish periodic insurance surveys which help consumers become aware of the options available to them and we regularly publish switching reports to encourage consumers to find the best deal available to them.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the open investigation, in October 2015 we engaged with Insurance Ireland with regard to concerns about price signalling.  No immediate enforcement action was required but we implemented a strategy to monitor the sector more closely and establish whether there were grounds for suspecting a breach of competition law.  The industry has in recent times openly signalled upcoming increases in premiums.  We have noted public statements made by insurance companies forecasting, with confidence, that premiums will rise, at times specifying the amount of the predicted rise and that these increases were inevitable.  Statements signalling future pricing intentions may result in a degree of unspoken co-ordination which may breach competition law.  We have been very concerned by these statements and this week, after detailed planning over a number of months, we issued, under our powers, summonses and formal requests for information to players in the sector.  The evidence collected will allow us to establish the facts and take appropriate action.<\/p> <p>  On the question of what would make things better, our views on the market are informed by our activities.  It is clear to us that there are significant issues of transparency, disclosure and confidence in the sector.  Parties that have come before the committee have offered different, often conflicting views on what is happening.  This does nothing to promote confidence in the market, and the frustration of motorists facing sustained increases is understandable and well founded.  We are extremely active in the sector, but our actions alone will not explain what is happening in the market.  We are glad, therefore, to see that the Department of Finance working group, on which our parent Department is represented, is studying this issue as a matter of priority.  We are available to assist either this committee or the working group as necessary.<\/p> <p>  As for what we would like to see, it is clear that publication of more detailed, up-to-date and extensive statistical data, particularly relating to claims and settlements, would allow for a better diagnosis of what is happening in the sector.  This could be done perhaps by either the regulator or the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and it should restore some confidence.  It may also, in turn, promote the entrance of new firms to offer competition, something which is vital to the long-term health of the sector.  We must also ensure this competition is healthy, and both the regulator and ourselves have different but complementary roles in this regard.  We would welcome any initiative that would allow for consumers to switch provider more easily, thus encouraging competition and greater choice.<\/p> <p>  We urge the committee and the working group to scrutinise the cost of legal services, an area in which we have advocated for years, and their impact on the cost of insurance.  We will be represented on the board of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which is being set up at present.  We are of the view that the work of this committee and the working group is shining an important light on the issues in the sector which we hope will result in recommendations, legislative changes or co-ordinated action that will have a positive and lasting effect on this vital market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":421,"content":"<p>For clarification, Ms O'Leary said the commission was very active in the insurance sector and that, as part of its work, the Competition Authority had undertaken a major study in 2005 which recommended greater disclosure of risk related data because a lack of data acted as a barrier to entry.

What could the outcome potentially be after the investigations?  If the commission makes findings against the insurance industry, what recourse does the commission have?  Mr. Kenny has not given us a timeline.  He has said months but we need to be more definitive.  If it runs to court proceedings after that, then this could conceivably take years.  I am pressing Mr. Kenny because if we have to wait for the CCPC to make a determination but the industry has already signalled a 20% increase for next year, then it seems to me the firms are not going to stop that increase pending the investigation the commission intends to carry out.  Therefore, the consumer will still end up paying more.  Not only will the consumer be subject to the 2016 increases, he will also be front-loaded with 2017 increases as well while this investigation is going on.

How does a cartel usually come to the attention of the commission and other competition authorities?  It is normally in one of two ways.  The first is through an immunity application.  We have an immunity programme with the Director of Public Prosecutions and we have a special hotline for immunity.  That happens when an industry player decides it no longer wants to be part of a cartel.  It phones us and asks to be first in the queue for immunity.  In return it must tell us everything it knows about the cartel.  This is known as a leniency application in other jurisdictions, and across Europe that is very often how agencies hear and find out about cartels.  By their nature they are secret and hidden.  A whistleblower is needed, or a cartel member who says \"This is not working any more,\" or who fears someone will find out about it and so wants to be first in.  The other way we find out about cartels is through bid rigging - for example, in procurement.  This happens when several market players come together for a public or private sector procurement and agree on prices so that one wins this time and another the next time, or one gives the other the work afterwards.  That kind of agreement is very serious and is a criminal breach of competition law in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The DPP has agreed to prosecute a bid-rigging case we sent to her.  It will come before the courts in the first quarter of 2017.  We have another active investigation into bid rigging which came to our attention through procurement officials.  In one case a disgruntled former employee made a phone call and blew the whistle.  Cartels are secret by nature and very often we have to find out about them from an insider.  That distinguishes them from other anti-competitive behaviour that is not criminal in our jurisdiction or in others, such as this case, which was made known through public pronouncements.  Were those announcements followed by action?  That is the differentiating factor: is it secret and private - does it need a whistleblower - or is it in the public domain?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>People are probably signalling all the time, possibly unintentionally.

In the mortgage sector it is considering giving people longer to switch.  At the moment we have between 15 and 30 days to renew motor insurance.

The witnesses can tell us that the commission is looking at the notified intention to increase pricing but that is still only one element of it.  After this submission, we still will not know whether there is a legislative basis that can be provided or whether a case can be made for legislating for perfect knowledge within the industry aside from whether or not one is a member that is locked in or out of Insurance Ireland or whether one is a broker, an underwriter, a small indigenous insurance house or a large international insurance house.  It remains the case that if there is a proprietorial element to that data, there could be all kinds of constitutional provisions around that in respect of who owns the data, who minds it and how one interprets it.  We can have all sorts of assessments and can make a rough adjudication on what is in the book of quantum.  We have already heard that the book of quantum needs to be updated.

No matter what way one parses this, there must be an element of profiteering here if a premium increases overnight by 50%, 60% or 70% or if certain people have been locked out of the market when by any objective analysis their level of risk has not increased.

Therefore, it is a case of the country coming first.  The information is necessary to get the country and its people right and, therefore, it should be made available to the industry.<\/p> <p>  The other side of that question is to make it publicly available across the board.  We have heard where the Irish Road Haulage Association at an open forum asked questions of the insurance industry which the industry would not answer even though it knew the answers.  The industry would not give a customer in the market the information that was required for the customer to make a commercial decision or to understand why the premium was at such a level.  There is no flexibility on both sides.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that Insurance Ireland withholds the information.  That has been the complaint from the outset.  On the other side in respect of policy holders, they never explain or will not explain it even to the largest players like the Irish Road Haulage Association or the freight carriers.  On one side, it is competition.  What is happening is anti-competitive.  The consumer is being short-changed and is not being given the information they need to understand why the insurance premiums have gone up.  Those two questions echo those asked by Deputy Sherlock.

Even taking historical factors into account, we were told there was a reduction in the market for premiums, with certain players trying to get to the top of the market or have the most market share, resulting in a reduction in premium costs, but all of a sudden there is a reset going on.

Our members make up 95% of the domestic market and over 80% of the international life insurance market in Ireland.  Our role is to represent and support the development of our sector in the interests of our members and their customers.  To put the insurance sector in context, the overall tax contribution from the insurance sector to the Exchequer is approximately &euro;1.8 billion.  Almost 28,000 people are employed directly or indirectly in insurance.  We welcome the work of the joint committee in the area of motor insurance.  We eagerly await the publication of its report.  The committee's efforts are in the interests of consumers and of the sector itself.  We believe these interests are very much aligned.  We have watched the proceedings to date with interest.  We believe we can best serve the committee's work by focusing on two key questions.  What is causing the volatility in the market?  How do we address it?<\/p> <p>  The motor insurance industry is acutely aware of the concern and frustration that exists with regard to rising premiums.  We want solutions, but if we are to find solutions we have to recognise the fundamental concepts of insurance.  In essence, insurers price risk and liability; that is, the likelihood of something happening and how much it could cost to address it if it happens.  At present, risk and liability are increasing.  I emphasise that an annual rate increase in excess of 30% is not in the interests of the Irish motor insurance industry.  This steep rate of increase is causing motor insurance to become unaffordable for some motorists.  This is resulting in higher levels of uninsured driving, as evidenced by the recent figures from the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland.  Would any sector reasonably wish to have to impose such price increases on its customers in the knowledge of the irritation and hardship this causes for consumers and businesses as they seek to go about their daily business?  I cannot emphasise enough that as an industry, we are not happy with the current market dynamic.  Consequently, we have been working for the last 18 months to call for structural reforms.  We believe the proposals in our driving for change document, when taken with the cost restructuring undertaken by each of our member companies, will remove the volatility from the Irish motor insurance market.<\/p> <p>  Some commentators have made the point that the current situation is primarily attributable to two factors: previous under-pricing by motor insurers and the fall-off in the performance of investment returns.  On under-pricing, a long-established underwriting cycle that is common to every insurance market and not unique to Ireland dictates that, following a soft market, there has to be a period of correction when rates are adjusted upwards to reflect the cost of providing the insurance.  We have publicly acknowledged that this was the case in Ireland, with rates driven too low by over-competition in the market and insurers fighting to maintain market share.  This process was accelerated by new entrants to the market.  The subsequent collapse of some of these companies left a financial burden on customers, the State and prudent insurers.  While we do not deny this was a factor - rates had become too low and a correction was needed - we stress that under-pricing on its own does not explain the level of premium increases we have seen.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the decrease in the performance of investments made by insurers, the low interest rate environment has an impact on the performance of insurers' investments.  In the main, these are low-risk investments which are adequately matched against liabilities, including current and future claims.  The reduction in yields has contributed to premium increases, but it is not the main reason for them.  We have made it clear that the main factors we believe are leading to the current steep increases in premiums are the extreme volatility in the claims and compensation environment and the significant increase in the associated legal costs.  The compensation situation was further compounded by the changes in court limits in 2014, which required insurers to increase reserves for claims in the pipeline and carry such costs into current premiums.  The consequences of recent insurance liquidations such as the liquidation of Setanta Insurance may be added to this.  The proposed solution is forcing responsible insurers to pick up the tab for the failings of less responsible companies.  Put simply, there are more motor insurance claims and they are costing more.  This is not solely my view or the view of my members, it is borne out by independent data sources, which we are happy to discuss with the committee.  Details of those independent sources are included in our notes.<\/p> <p>  We believe the key factor in halting the upward spiral in the cost of premiums is achieving consistency and reasonableness in the awards regime.  We have called for certain things to be done to that end.  We believe there is a need for consistency in awards to help reduce volatility in the market.  Inconsistent awards increase volatility, which is reflected in pricing.  We think there is a need to tackle whiplash.  Eight out of every ten motor injury claims in Ireland are for whiplash.  Awards here are three times higher than those in the UK.  The average award here is &euro;15,000, compared to &euro;5,000 in the UK.  As premiums are a function of the cost of claims, high awards mean higher premiums.  We believe the powers of the Injuries Board should be reinforced to resolve more claims and reduce costly legal fees.  Insurance Ireland supports the Injuries Board and its good work, including the swifter settlement of claims, but it needs new powers because the claims environment has changed.  For example, claimants should be compelled to provide loss of income information and to attend medicals.  Insurance Ireland first made these points in 2014.  They should be legislated for as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>  We believe the book of quantum should be internationally benchmarked.  There is a need to ensure it is reviewed on a regular basis.  As part of this review, the Judiciary should have a role in drafting the contents of the book of quantum, which is what happens in the UK.  The size of awards should be internationally benchmarked.  We believe there is a need to fix Setanta Insurance.  The Government&rsquo;s proposed policy response to address the claims of an insurer in liquidation poses a systemic risk to the motor insurance market.  This policy exposes insurers to unlimited liabilities of competitors.  This would have to be factored into pricing.  No other industry has to do this.  It is the equivalent of Dunnes Stores bailing out Tesco.  We believe there is a need to reduce legal costs.  The National Competitiveness Council has said that legal costs are at a six-year high.  Injuries Board costs are 6%, versus legal costs of 60% in litigated cases.  We think there is a need to act to ensure fraudsters are deterred.  Suspended sentences are not an adequate deterrent.  Insurance Ireland believes that convicted insurance fraudsters should face the full rigours of the law in terms of custodial sentences.  We believe the resources given to road traffic enforcement should be further increased because there is no substitute for enforcement.<\/p> <p>  High premiums are not in the interests of insurers because they raise the threshold of affordability, which leads to more uninsured driving.  Our strong preference is for a more consistent and reasonable level of premium, sustained by a reasonable level of claims costs.  We acknowledge that insurers also have their part to play.  Rates had become too soft and returns from investments had declined.  These factors alone do not explain what has happened with premiums.  It is our view that the majority of the premium increase that we have seen in the motor market is due to volatility in the claims environment.  As an industry, we have responded in the past when policies were put in place to reduce the cost of claims and we will do so again.  In addition, the issue of industry data has been mentioned.  We acknowledge that work must be done on this issue and we are committed to doing this.  We thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  We look forward to assisting the committee with its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":582,"content":"<p>Given that Mr. Thompson has been following the proceedings of the committee, it is interesting that he left it until the last paragraph of his submission before he mentioned the sharing of data.

It is shared at very different levels and for very different purposes.  First, we collect data in respect of uninsured driving and, more importantly, vehicles which are insured.<\/p><p>That is in an automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, system.  Our insurers provide the ANPR database of all insured vehicles, with the purpose of passing that data on to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that it can check whether a car is insured.  That is the first data we share.<\/p><p> The second level of data share relates to InsuranceLink.  InsuranceLink is a database which monitors claims, with the sole purpose of trying to identify profiles in fraudulent claims.  That data is shared, again with insurers, with the sole purpose of combating fraud.<\/p><p> The third database we have is the IIDS, which is the information insurance data services.  That relates to the area of penalty points where our database is connected to the national fleet database, which is held in Shannon.  In terms of what we do, our members, through that database, can access it to verify people's disclosure about penalty points.  That information is shared.<\/p><p> The next data about which there has been much talk is in respect of aggregate market data, that is, how well the industry performs in terms of profits, loss, claims and so on.  In respect of that area, we report to the Central Bank under our legislative and regulatory obligations.  We also produce our own fact file.  The Central Bank also produces the private motor statistics, which we feed into.  That was borne out of a statistical analysis the Motor Insurance Advisory Board did.  The Central Bank of Ireland has continued on with that.  We collect that as well from the industry and pass it on.

It also breaks down the costs per claim based on age profile, so there may be an age profile between 17 and 20 years, 20 and 25 years and between male and female drivers.  The private motor insurer statistic also shows in its appendix, not on a name basis but with an indicator A to Z, the profile of each company.

An associate membership fee for Insurance Ireland is &euro;10,000 per annum but I qualify that by saying that we are a voluntary, non-profit organisation.  That is the way we work.  We know the associate member who was here this morning.  When someone becomes an associate member, they have access to all our data.  There is no blockage whatsoever.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the fee they are charged on top of that, we have databases so if they want to get a connection they pay an InsuranceLink set-up fee, which ranges between &euro;2,000 and &euro;4,000.  It is a one-off fee.  It does not go to us; it goes to our IT provider for connecting that service to them.  They then pay an InsuranceLink usage fee.  As I said earlier, InsuranceLink is about monitoring claims so every time someone accesses the system, it is on a pay-as-you-go basis.  They get charged every time they access it.  The charge will depend on one's usage.  A very large player who has a large market share and who accesses the system frequently will pay a lot more proportionately than a very small player in the marketplace.  We believe that is the right way to proceed.<\/p> <p>  A figure was quoted this morning of &euro;100,000.  That is not the figure.  There was some confusion in that regard.  That figure relates to our IIDS system.  Regarding penalty points, what we have within our IIDS system currently is that our direct providers, that is, insurance companies, have access to it.  We are building an enhanced module to it which will allow brokers to have access to it.  That overall IT enhancement and development will cost approximately &euro;100,000.

That is in terms of associate member costs and the comment regarding &euro;100,000 made this morning.<\/p> <p>  Regarding our databases such as ANPR, and particularly InsuranceLink, where we are trying to combat fraud, the system is only as good as the number of people in it.  If someone who is trying to combat fraud has only have 50% of the market, they are only capturing 50% of potential fraudulent claims.  They want as many providers as possible to be in that system.

Almost every commentator talked about the lack of clear data, the lack of explanation and the lack of visibility in terms of what is going on in the motor insurance sector.  We can see the personal injuries information in the Injuries Board and we can see what is going through the courts system.  That is only 30% of the overall amount of claims, so 70% of cases are settled and most people who appeared before the committee said they did not believe they had any great visibility on that.  Are the witnesses saying that if one becomes a member of Insurance Ireland, one gets access to that information or is it available to the public through the Central Bank figures?  Many of us, including me, asked what questions other witnesses wanted us to put to Insurance Ireland.

There has been a focus on data.  I am looking at this from the point of view of whether the market is competitive.  Whether it is perfectly competitive or not remains to be seen.  There is still a fundamental question about whether there is perfect knowledge around the market.  We all recognise there has to be a surplus on every premium derived by a company.  That is a given but we are finding it difficult to reconcile the extent to which premia have increased.  It is a steep, unaffordable rise.  If insurance companies are pricing risk and liability and if by any reasonable, objective analysis the individual motorist's personal circumstances have not changed, the car has passed its NCT test and nothing has changed from the motorist's point of view yet they are incurring a cost of 30%, 40% or 50% they are asking themselves, &quot;What is going on here?&quot;.  Most people will accept the argument around the resetting of the market to adhere to rules and provisioning.  The witnesses' opening statement outlined that the price of premiums had reduced significantly over quite a number of years.  What most people cannot reconcile is the extent of the increases.  I have listened carefully to what Mr. Horan is saying about the data.  He speaks about the private motor insurance statistics report in 2015, the IIDS, the ANPR and so on.  In the Personal Injuries Assessment Board's submission to us it states there is:<\/p><blockquote>...no public information available relating to overall numbers and costs of claims for personal injuries and the only figures that were made public did not contain any information on the costs of directly settled cases.  Without access to that information, a full picture of the impact [of personal injury claims] on insurance premiums is difficult to establish.<\/blockquote> <p>If we take Insurance Ireland's submission before us today and its willingness to seek a solution to this issue and layer on the fact that it is saying there is adequate data available to make an assessment of the market, why is it that the PIAB, which is a statutory body, is telling the Houses of the Oireachtas there is not perfect knowledge?<\/p><p>How do the witnesses reconcile this statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#GG02300","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473933600,"counter":668,"content":"<p>We have explained there is a lot of data.

People accept the insurance companies must make a surplus on the premium and accept, to a certain extent, a rejigging or resetting of provisioning, but they do not accept the stark increase.

There is nothing in the opening submission, with all due respect, or in the subsequent replies which answers for the ordinary motorist the question as to why premiums have increased.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have not spoken to us about behaviours in the insurance industry regarding the settling of claims - whether the insurance companies interrogate fully every claim that comes before them, or whether they settle them just to get them off the desk and out the door.

Motor insurance and premiums are based on a number of rating factors such as age, driving experience and claims experience.  The overall claims costs underneath the surface dictate what way premiums will go, and this is the fundamental issue.  Some of the issues we are speaking about are internal to insurance companies, some are about insurers' pricing and some are external to insurance companies - for example, the level of awards and legal costs.  A holistic view needs to be taken on how to address all of these issues.  We need to focus on the large size of awards in the country, particularly for whiplash.  We need more consistency in the awards.  We need lower legal costs in litigation cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#HH00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Horan"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1473933600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Senator Gerry Horkan took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":674,"content":"<p>The reality contradicts this.  If I am to be very frank and blunt, insurance is a hard-nosed business and is highly competitive.  The companies have shareholders and a bottom line.  The witnesses cannot come into the Oireachtas and state that there are eight aspirations or solutions to this and that the sixth is to reduce legal costs, when we know, anecdotally and factually, that insurance companies settle out of court without investigating to a large extent whether a claim in the first instance was fraudulent, or where there is a history of repetitive cases involving people who are up and down the steps before it goes into the courtroom.  There is a culture of settling before going to court, where the case could be interrogated properly, and the industry is not taking on the fraudsters.  The companies have realised it is much easier to just settle and get cases off the books and off the table.<\/p><p>The second solution suggested is tackling whiplash.  The witnesses have stated that eight out of ten motor insurance claims in Ireland are for whiplash and awards here are three times those in the UK.  They stated that premiums are a function of the costs of claims, so high awards mean higher premiums.  However, they did not tell us the percentage of these whiplash claims which are settled without going through an Injuries Board process or are settled outside the doors of the court . Until we can drill down into this information it appears that the insurance industry will ride the storm, apply the further 20% increase in the premiums already signalled to the market, and go through the investigation with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and pay lip service to what we are trying to achieve, which is lower costs for motorists.

Between 2009 and 2013, the first-year settlement rates, that is, the speed at which we settle a claim, reduced by 13% for comprehensive policies and by 17% for third party insurance.  Settlement rates have been slowing down, and that is reflected in the statistics from the Central Bank.  That indicates to me that the sector investigates every claim.<\/p> <p>  Let us be clear, though.  Our job is to pay claims.  Our job is to settle claims.  We cannot treat every claimant as a potential fraudster.  When people have a genuine claim and are entitled to financial compensation, they expect insurers to settle those claims quickly and diligently.  We are also mandated by the consumer protection code to do that and to do it fairly.  There is a balance to be struck between paying claims quickly in respect of genuine claimants and giving them a fair level of compensation while also having proper systems in place to make sure that where there is a suspicion of a fraudulent claim, we follow it through.  I urge the Deputy to look at the latest statistics from the Central Bank which show that our settlement rates in the first year have been reducing.  That says to me that we are taking more of an active role as an industry in investigating claims, but it is a fine balance.

Another factor is the adverse development of existing claims.  This is where insurers have claims already on their books and have to increase the reserves on them.<\/p><p> A number of things happened in 2014 that caused the change.  We had three changes in 2014 that had a retrospective effect on claims that were already open and had already been made but not settled.  The main change was the increase the financial limits of the courts.  The Circuit Court limit increased from &euro;38,000 to &euro;60,000.  There were two other changes as well.  Legislation introduced what was known as the recoverable benefits and assistance scheme.  Previously, insurers could deduct social welfare benefits from personal injury claims but the legislation required them to may repayments to the Department of Social Protection.  The third change related to what is known as the discount rate at the end of 2014.  This affected catastrophic injury claims.  Given low investment returns, it was determined that we needed higher lump sum payments.  All these had a retrospective effect and required insurance companies to effectively go back and increase their reserves.  This fed in to the cost of claims and that has been a factor.

In some of them, the slogan it used contained the phrase \"taking money from your pockets\" and was very memorable.  The evidence from witnesses who have come before the committee in the past week and a half indicates that what has been happening is a major campaign of spin on the part of the insurance industry.  The Law Society called it a long-running and widespread campaign in which the industry sought to blame everybody but itself.  The massive hikes in premiums have been the subject of a campaign of misdirection, away from the issue of profits and the drive to return to profitability and towards the issues of costs, in particular those related to claims, and fraud.  In his opening statement, Mr. Thompson said, \"Put simply, there are more motor insurance claims and they are costing more\".  He repeatedly gave that as the driving factor in the course of his contribution.  The figures for 2015 do not illustrate that this was the driving factor.  If there are increases of 70% in premium costs and increases in the cost of claims over the same period of 25%, that does not amount to a majority of 70%.  He referenced independent sources such as the Injuries Board, the PIAB, but Mr. Conor O'Brien said in his presentation yesterday that the PIAB figures showed personal injury motor claims volumes and the average value of awards were static this year.  The Injuries Board does not agree that claims are going up so how can Mr. Thompson stand over this idea?

We also looked at statistics from the Courts Service, about which there has been some commentary in the past few days and which give information about the level of increases it has seen.  As for our messaging, we have said this is the main factor but we have also said that prices have gone too low and we have explained the part we have played in that.  In any radio programme I have been on I have clearly articulated that.  The statistics are there.  They have been validated by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Courts Service.<\/p> <p>  There has been commentary from the competitiveness council on the direction of associated legal costs.  The Motor Insurance Advisory Board's statistics of 2004 stated that litigation costs had an overhang of 43%.  The Injuries Board states that there is a litigation overhang of 60% so there has not been that much movement in that space.  As a sector, if we have to give everyone with whiplash &euro;30,000 we can price that.  If we give them &euro;50,000 we can price it too, but if we want affordable premiums and stability in our premiums we need consistency in the level of awards and a level of awards which we can reasonably afford as a society.  That has been the core of our messaging.  <\/p> <p>  We have our part to play in this and in the issue of the data.  We know we have a part to play in terms of the settling of claims.  We recognise the figures from the Injuries Board but we need to put them into context.  The Injuries Board settles non-contentious cases, where liability has been accepted.  Both parties agree that there is no issue - it is just a question of what the level of the award is to be.  We would expect steady amounts in these cases, without fluctuations or inconsistencies.  The claims we deal with outside of that process, either pre-settlement or post-Injuries Board, are where liability has not been accepted or it is in contention.

The Injuries Board is designed to deal with claims where there is no argument about liability.  If an insurance company believes something is not an Injuries Board case, it is because there is an issue around liability and an argument about who is at fault for the accident.  We would like the powers of the Injuries Board to be strengthened to include, for example, the power to require people to turn up for medical exams and to provide information on loss of earnings.  We would also like the scope of the Injuries Board to be expanded.  At the moment, the legislation requires the board to deal with a claim within nine months.  If it cannot do so, the case has to be released.  Insurance companies would like as many cases as possible, where there is no argument on liability, to be dealt with by the Injuries Board.  An injury about which there is no argument about liability may not settle down for 12 months, 18 months or two years and there should be no reason the Injuries Board cannot deal with it.  If it could and did not have to release them back into the litigation system it would be a good result.<\/p> <p>  There are systems issues that could be looked at to address the costs of claims and changing the legislation around the Injuries Board, to expand its scope and give it more powers to deal with more claims, is one such issue.

In this report, the Central Bank stated that in the context of the data provided it was not possible to obtain a comprehensive assessment of all costs and revenues in the industry.  It talks about the weaknesses of the data which are provided but that is the witnesses' example of transparency.  Mr. Horan then said he agreed and that there would be a scoping exercise on giving more data.  Why should people believe him?  In 2002, the MIAB report executive summary stated that it had not been the board's experience that insurers had willingly provided all material information.

We have wholeheartedly supported the Injuries Board since its foundation.  As far as we are concerned the more not-at-fault cases we can bring to the Injuries Board, the better because then we do not get back into the situation we had in the past of a Mexican stand-off between the two sides and cases being litigated all the way to the steps of the court.

The question was asked but not answered about young drivers.  According to the Central Bank report that Mr Horan referred to, younger policyholders continue to present the highest average surpluses.  That is surplus per premium which over time will equate to profit.

There are more than 40 players in the market, although eight or nine players are well established and probably account for over 95% of the market.  From our experience, they compete fiercely in the marketplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":758,"content":"<p>That is not my experience with the people who deal with me.  I thank Mr. Thompson for clearing up the matter of Zenith Insurance.  Others might disagree with him, but it is important to have it on the record.<\/p> <p>  With regard to volatility, the argument of Insurance Ireland is that volatility is to blame.  That is just nonsense.  Steady increases are not signs of volatility, but signs of price increases caused by a failing business model.  The witness argues that there are a number of claims from the Injuries Board.  I have the same table.  The average award in 2010 was &euro;22,271 and in 2015 it was &euro;22,878.  That is not a volatile claims environment.  In fact, it is a very static environment.  There are more claims because there are more cars on the road, which means more business for the industry, a bigger market and less competition.  There are no more people as a percentage using solicitors in the Injuries Board process than previously.  The court awards are not much higher if one cuts through the spin.  Where is the volatility?  The one place where there has been volatility, of course, is the international bond markets.  We live in an age of 0% interest rates.  Is that the volatility to which the witness refers?  Did Irish insurers fail abjectly to plan for Solvency II reserve requirements?  Is there an aggregate figure for the increase in the reserves over the last couple of years?  It would appear that motorists are bailing out the insurance industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#NN00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473933600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>The Senator made a number of points, and Mr. Horan and I will take them in turn.  First, regarding the Injuries Board, the Senator referred to a steady claims inflation.  We do not see it that way.  As I said in my earlier comment, the Injuries Board is dealing with non-disputed claims.  It is dealing with claims where both parties are in agreement, so there will be a steady level of award.  That is my first response.  Since 2008 there has been a 34% increase in the number of claims going through the Injuries Board, but there has been a corresponding 13% increase in economic activity over that time.  Some of it is probably related to an increase in the number of cars on the road, but there is a big difference between 34% and 13%.<\/p> <p>  There has been an increase in court awards.  These are Courts Service statistics, not ours.  The statistics that we quote relate to the lower court, which is the Circuit Court.  We have not quoted the High Court.  We accept the point regarding medical evidence and we know how distorting that can be in the High Court.  However, the soft tissue injuries and lower-value claims are in the lower court, the Circuit Court.  In its annual report for 2015, one can see a 22% increase in awards in the Circuit Court, and that was on top of a 13% increase for the previous year.  We have seen it come through.<\/p> <p>  Regarding volatility, our point is that there is a situation whereby there is an inconsistency or fluctuation in court awards for any particular injury - that is why we believe the book of quantum and giving more powers to the Injuries Board are so important - and a general increase in the level of awards going through the court.  In addition, there is the case of Setanta Insurance, whereby there is a proposal from the Government that basically creates a situation in which, in the case of future failures, prudent operators in the market have unlimited liability for their competitors' losses.  All of those matters start feeding through and must be priced for, and it is the variation and fluctuation within them all which results in the level of volatility within the marketplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#NN00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1473933600,"counter":760,"content":"<p>Does Insurance Ireland have an aggregate figure for the increase in reserves over the last couple of years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091500002#NN00500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473933600,"counter":761,"content":"<p>We do not have an aggregate figure but one can see the figures in the Central Bank insurance statistics.

There might have been some commentary around Irish insurance companies not preparing for Solvency II, but most of our companies are subsidiaries of larger multinational groups and those groups would have subsidiaries in other European countries that have been preparing for Solvency II.

There were probably 13 different bodies in here before Insurance Ireland.  Consistency is a word that the witnesses said was very important in the insurance industry.  Consistently, those bodies have told us that the information they need is not being provided and is being kept hidden from them.  It is for companies trying to enter the market to say whether the lack of data is an impediment to them or not.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  However, I am satisfied leaving here today that the witnesses are saying that absolutely any information that the Central Bank wants in regard to the insurance industry will be provided by Insurance Ireland in a timely and up-to-date manner.  That should at least give us something to work on because so far we have been unable to do the analysis.  It is important that it is the non-interpreted data and the raw data that are provided.  I believe we have made some progress even in the past 20 minutes in this regard.  It is unbelievable that it has not been done to date.  Either the Central Bank or other bodies have not requested it or it has not been provided.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, the information is there.  If I was running a small corner business, I would know how many of each item I was selling and how much profit I was making from each one.  I would have to know that.  It is hard to believe that an industry the size of the insurance industry does not have all of this information to be able to plan forward and, as the Chairman said, to be able to project increases for the next year and the year after.  I see that even FBD are looking forward to a profitable 2017.  The other insurance companies' profits were up 39%.  It is a very profitable industry and we are told that it is not.  It is more profitable than the UK.  There are profits to be made here.  Competitors do want to enter the market and we are trying to examine why they are not.  What they are telling us is that the data are not available.  That is the crux of what we are trying to get at.
