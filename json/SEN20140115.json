It is appropriate that is done in the committees.  A question that needs to be answered in respect of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, is that he said he does not micromanage any aspect of his Department.  I do not think &euro;180 million is a small amount of money.  An example of what he and the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, have done is that they have literally thrown Mr. John Tierney and senior officials in Irish Water under the bus.  The Minister, who will be in the House this afternoon, has many questions to answer.  We debated the Water Services (No. 2) Bill in great detail here, on which I commend the Leader.  That is one thing the other House did not do.  These are very serious issues.  People are extremely annoyed about what they are hearing.  The lack of governance within the Departments appears to be at the crux of the issue.  Irish Water passed all details to the Minister and his Department.  As they were signed off on and approved, let us not fool anybody about who is responsible.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is responsible.  At the appropriate time, when the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht have finished their deliberations we should have a debate on the specific issues around cost and the roll-out of metering.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to request the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to come to the House at the earliest possible opportunity.

The Government has also made it far more difficult for people to avail of the grant and this has increased the amount the elderly and the disabled must pay towards the adaptation of their housing.

We established yesterday that the budget does not meet the anticipated costs for 2014 and we are not giving the agency a fighting chance.  It has not even got off the starting line.  There is an agency that is to herald a new start with a &euro;545 million budget and we are not giving it a fighting chance.  In parallel, there is Irish Water where several Ministers and officials have defended, and even supported, the establishment costs which, according to the briefing document of September 2012, are &euro;180 million.  Establishment costs are important.  The Child and Family Agency got zero for establishment costs.  It has no start-up budget.  Its funding is not sufficient.  No doubt it will have a deficit this year.  Are we throwing out the baby with the bath water?

The information suggested the problem with respect to the waiting list for dermatology appointments is still really critical.  While it has been brought under one year in several Dublin centres, I am aware of at least one Dublin centre where it is longer than one year.  I am aware of one centre outside of Dublin where it is two years.  I am aware of another two centres outside Dublin where it has been brought down, but by the recourse of taking patients who are on long-term waiting lists and getting them private appointments in Dublin.

As it happens, I have here in my hand the contract and the terms of reference for this allegedly independent investigation.  The investigation was, in fact, initiated and commissioned by the management of St. Vincent's Private Hospital - the same institution which should have been under investigation.

While the gloss and glow from the halo of Members' referendum success still glows brightly, my wish is that they should be productive and work together to ensure this House will be a stronger place by this time next year.  Can the Leader apprise Members as to when he hopes to have a debate on rural development or redevelopment?  Second, I refer to an issue I have raised a number of times previously.  As fresh announcements have been made by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, when is it likely that Members will have a debate on the issue of CAP reform and Pillar 1 and Pillar 2?  The Leader might try to facilitate an early debate on this subject.<\/p><p>My major concern this afternoon is the plight of those farming communities, particularly in disadvantaged areas, in which, instead of Santa Claus coming for Christmas, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, or someone within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has taken huge amounts of money from disadvantaged farmers under the single farm payment scheme.  In many instances, the cuts amounted to as much as &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000.  These amounts are substantial for these farmers and the cuts were unilateral, unjust and unfair.  Moreover, no notice whatsoever was given.  On Monday night, I attended a public meeting in Bantry, chaired by a Sinn F&eacute;in candidate, to which 500 farmers turned up.  Many of these disheartened farmers were expecting the payments before Christmas as they usually were made between October and December.  This was money that was needed to pay the feed suppliers, the credit unions and the banks for money the farmers had borrowed during the appallingly difficult spring of last year after a very long winter which lasted until the end of May.  Lo and behold, they got their cheques.  Some of them received no cheques while others received cheques reflecting a cut of 30% to 40% to what they were entitled to or deserved.  It is an appalling scenario.<\/p><p>As some of the people who attended this meeting were from south Kerry, I note this is widespread in counties Cork and Kerry.  I am unsure whether it is widespread throughout the western counties and the north west.  However, this is such a severe cut that it will do huge environmental damage.  It is not so long since farmers were encouraged to keep their furze breaks, to keep the land preserved for the corncrakes, the birds and the bees and to protect the fauna.  However, what will happen next spring when burning is allowed on farmland during the month of March?  Incidentally, the period allowed is very short; in Northern Ireland, the burning season lasts until mid-April.  Farmers, to compensate for lands that have been taken away from them, will take out their matches and burn all around them.  They will take out their diggers and dig away scrub and areas that should be there for preservation.  Were &Eacute;amon de Buitl&eacute;ar alive, what is happening would have him turning in his grave.  It is a serious situation as approximately &euro;50 million has been taken out of the rural economy as a result of these cutbacks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500006#E00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1389798000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Does the Senator have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500006#E00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1389798000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I ask the Leader to try to ensure that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will reverse these cuts, if possible.

The reason this has happened is this eye from Mars or the eye in the sky has come out and taken photographs from many miles up.  It is being stated that people have a certain amount of farmland and are over-claiming.  This is a furtive and devious way to do that and it is unfair to the farming community.  In my view, the matter is so serious that I propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  I ask that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, or the Minister of State responsible for this area should come into the Chamber today for an urgent debate for one hour to give answers to the very depressed farmers - some of whom are suicidal - who were left without money for the Christmas period and who are facing a bleak spring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500006#E00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1389798600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank and pay tribute to members of the emergency services, particularly ESB, Eircom and council workers, who worked outdoors in terrible weather conditions throughout the Christmas period while the rest of us were by our firesides.<\/p><p>A serious and worrying development occurred at the Liebherr crane factory in Killarney last night when workers at the plant voted to reject Labour Court proposals to resolve an ongoing dispute with management.  I am a strong advocate of workers' rights who believes workers should share in company profits.  I ask both sides in this dispute to compromise.  The Liebherr factory, which is more than 55 years old, is the largest industrial employer in County Kerry, with more than 670 employees.  It also outsources work to many other companies.  This morning, I wrote an e-mail to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, requesting that he intervene to break the impasse at the company and seeking the re-establishment of the national implementation body to resolve the issue.  While I am awaiting a response, I seek the support of the Seanad for my call on the Minister to intervene in this matter.  I ask also the Leader, through his good office, to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the re-establishment of the national implementation body to assist workers.  The Liebherr case highlights the fact that such a body has been absent in this country since the collapse of national partnership.  Every other modern economy in Europe has such a body in place.

My first question for the Leader is on Ireland's international taxation strategies and policies.  A recent article by Carl O'Brien in The Irish Times revealed, through a freedom of information request, that the Department of Finance authored a document entitled Principal Risks to Ireland's Corporation Tax Strategy, in which it outlines significant concerns that international moves to tackle tax avoidance could make it less attractive for multinational companies to locate here.  Mr. O'Brien's article lifted the veil on internal Department of Finance discussions.  I suspect the Minister's decision in the most recent budget to close a loophole on stateless companies arose from a recommendation made in the Department's report.  Is one budgetary measure sufficient to address the potential for reputational damage to Ireland arising from these matters?  Should we not plan for international moves on anti-abuse taxation measures for multinational companies?  These are urgent issues.<\/p><p>  As we begin a year in which we have a real chance for recovery, where is the parliamentary oversight of this issue?  Where is the matter being investigated?  I understand the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has established a sub-committee on global taxation.  Is the sub-committee examining this issue?  Has it commenced an investigation?  If so, when will it be completed?  Who is appearing before the sub-committee as witnesses?  Will the chief executives of multinational companies come before it?  If not, why not?<\/p><p>  On Seanad reform, I agree with one point made by Senator Paul Coghlan in an opinion piece written for <i>The Irish Times<\/i> earlier this month in which he stated that we need to focus on how the Seanad can operate effectively as a key element in our participatory parliamentary democracy and that we owe it to the people to ensure this happens.  I am concerned, however, by the implication later in the article that constitutional change may be required to reform the system of nominating and electing Senators, as that is not the case.  I understand the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is to review and produce recommendations for procedural reforms of the Seanad.  When I was doing various media interviews earlier in the week following the publication of a document by Democracy Matters, I was repeatedly asked what the Seanad is doing to reform itself.<\/p> <p>What is the Seanad doing to reform itself?  I understand the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be meeting after the Order of Business.  Will the issue be discussed in that context?

It would have been appropriate to make funds available to construct an emergency rock armoury in the Quilty area to protect the 14 homes in question given the fear that exists about the further high tides due on 1 February.  I ask the Leader to use his good office to encourage the relevant Departments to make emergency funding available to Clare County Council so that it can secure these families' homes.  As Members will be aware, serious damage was caused to the coastline of County Clare and neighbouring counties as a result of the bad weather.  An application needs to be made to the European Union Solidarity Fund and other European structural funds to ensure that adequate defence mechanisms are put in place so that we do not see a repeat of this devastation.  This is important for private as well as public property.  We must not discriminate in this context between public and private property because at the end of the day the private property is owned by citizens of this country who pay taxes in this country.

I had the pleasure of being in his company on Friday evening and, like all his friends and loved ones, I was shocked and devastated by his tragic death and the unnatural manner of his passing.  I thank the garda&iacute; and the emergency services personnel, who see things nobody should have to see.  They do their work well and in doing so make life more bearable for us all.<\/p><p>Tom was a gentle person, who was blessed to be free of cynicism or dishonesty of any kind.  He was highly intelligent and a clear and honest thinker.  He was incredibly witty and funny, as well as enthusiastic and idealistic.  His vocation was to be one of life's thinkers.  I do not think he would have been as happy as an engineer, a businessman or a surgeon.  He expressed his gifts and talents in his research and advocacy, primarily for the Iona Institute but also in his use of social media and his personal engagement with people.  His behaviour in public mirrored the private man.  He had a deep affection for children and a concern for their welfare.  He was horrified about anything that could endanger or threaten them and he saw the protection of unborn children as a core part of a just and civilised society.<\/p><p>That something so terrible could happen to him is hard for us to comprehend.  He is the latest victim of the strangeness of the world, and there will be others.  However, Tom would insist - and it is important for us to do likewise on his behalf - that good, not evil, is ultimately in charge and that somewhere in the fullness of time his dramatic and violent departure from this world will be comprehended, accounted for and even turned to account in a way we cannot understand.  In human terms, his time was too short, but those who knew and loved him are confident that he succeeded in all the important things.<\/p> <p>May he rest in peace eternally and may all those who knew and loved him be consoled.

The scourge of obesity is a very serious issue in the country, not least among children, with one in four people now obese.  Obesity accounts for a serious number of health issues which must be dealt with by a health service that is already struggling.  These include cancers and the 80% of type 2 diabetes that is caused by obesity.  These statistics are well known by people at this stage but it seems that we are not coming up with a multi-faceted policy to deal with this.<\/p><p>Who is at fault?  Is it parents, society, the food industry or policymakers?<\/p> <p>The response must be multi-faceted and from all sides of society, not least ourselves.  I have sought a debate on the issue on numerous occasions and hopefully it can be dealt with in the new year.  It is too simplistic to target particular food types, as happens with sugary drinks.  It would help if fiscal measures can be put in place to reduce the amount of sugary drinks children drink.  Sugary drinks cost less than water in shops, which makes no sense.  We also need to educate mothers.  An obese mother is more likely to give birth to an obese child and to a child who will have serious problems with obesity throughout life.  We measure the weight of children between zero and four years but in other countries this practice extends beyond four years of age.  We must consider it in this country as it works effectively elsewhere.

Its purpose is to provide fathers with the opportunity to share the maternity leave allocation of 26 weeks from the workplace if the mother wishes to do so.  Such flexibility in the workplace with maternity leave would give fathers a more active role in caring for the child while also providing women entrepreneurs with the opportunity to devote more time to developing and growing businesses and, subsequently, creating what we need most in Ireland, namely, employment.  Everyone in the room knows that the responsibility to raise young children rests almost entirely with women.  Currently, two and half times more men than women create businesses.

There is a propensity within the public service and local government to engage consultants at the drop of a hat for a range of issues.  This happens despite the fact that a local authority might be laden within engineers within the system.  To some extent, this is done to insulate those in the organisation from accountability, but that is wrong.<\/p><p>Also, there is very little openness in the recruitment of people into the public service and State companies.  We have talked about this previously, but I ask the Leader to consider a debate on the issue.  There needs to be greater mobility between the private sector and the public sector.  People in the private sector must have the opportunity and equal access to jobs in the public sector and similarly from the public sector to the private sector.  Both sectors would gain immeasurably from this because of the different strengths within each sector, with each helping the other.<\/p><p>I concur with the comments made by Senator Conway and Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen in regard to Tom O'Gorman.

A recent newspaper report indicated, and there has been much talk about the fact, that this is the largest single semi-State organisation that has been created since the ESB.

The Minister might be blunt, but he is trustworthy and I doubt I would have huge difficulties with him in this area.  However, one never knows what or who is coming down the line.  Therefore, substituting &quot;insuperable problem or problems&quot; for &quot;difficulty&quot; would provide a higher and better provision.  If the word &quot;difficulty&quot; remains, difficulties are there to be confronted, not to be swept under the carpet, as Lord Denning liked to do.  The word &quot;difficulty&quot; gives the Minister a large sweeping or yard brush, but I would prefer to see him with a little dustpan and brush.  Perhaps that should be the other way round and I am mixing my metaphor.  It would be useful to say there was this provision if there was an insuperable problem or problems, rather than just a difficulty, because a difficulty could mean anything.  This change would not affect the Bill in any way, but it would mean that there could be no tricking around with the issue for no reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500023#Z00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1389804900,"counter":193,"content":"<p>During the Committee Stage debate on section 2 of the Bill I undertook to examine the wording in subsection (2) and, in particular, the use of the term \"expedient\".

The Local Government Reform Bill, when enacted, will give effect to a comprehensive reform of local government structures, functions and governance.  It involves significant amendments of and additions to the existing local government code and it is possible that unanticipated issues may emerge post-enactment.  This section has been designed to provide a mechanism for dealing with such difficulties should they arise and similar provisions are found in other Acts within the local government code.  I do not envisage that such issues will arise and if I did, a specific provision would be included in the Bill to address them.  However, it is only prudent, in the context of such a wide-ranging reform programme, to provide a mechanism to deal with any unforeseen problem that may arise.<\/p><p>I emphasise to the House that the use of this provision is subject to a number of restrictions.  In the first instance, it is time bound and may only be used within a period of three years following the coming into operation of the section.  Second, regulations made under the provision will require a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Furthermore, the making of regulations under this provision will be subject to rigorous oversight by the Office of the Attorney General.  In addition to this triple lock, against any Minister who might try to engage in some nefarious practice in the future, the Supreme Court will act as a further bulwark against a Minister who might seek to interpret and use this provision in a way that was unconstitutional.  These are fundamental principles attaching to the operation of this provision.<\/p><p>In addition, it is important to point out that the term &quot;necessary or expedient&quot; is referred to almost 900 times in the electronic Irish Statute Book.  The earliest reference is in section 36 of the Public Works (Ireland) Act 1831.  There are 834 uses of the phrase in primary legislation since 1922 and 284 uses in respect of delegated legislation.  The phrase was also used in the District, Circuit and Supreme Court rules.  Given the extensive history and continuing usage as outlined, it is unsurprising that the phrase is well known to the courts in its various uses.<\/p> <p>I am advised, therefore, that to use a different formula of words would be open to interpretation by the courts that the Oireachtas intended a different meaning or result to that which would have obtained by using the long-established phraseology of \"necessary or expedient\".  Equally, a seemingly straightforward substitution of words as suggested in amendment No. 4 or a deletion of the term \"or expedient\" as suggested in amendments Nos. 5 and 6 could result in the threshold for coming within the ambit of the provision being set so high as to make it virtually unusable.  At a minimum it would significantly reduce the scope of the circumstances in which the regulation-making power under section 22 could be used.<\/p><p>I understood the arguments that were made by Senator Norris on Committee Stage and was certainly very open to amending this particular section.  However, since then I have received extensive legal advice on foot of further legal examination of the Bill, including by the Attorney General's office and based on the precedent that was established back in 1831, I am strongly advised that any other interpretation could have implications for other legislation.  Regrettably, but in good faith, I cannot accept the amendment which was tabled by Senators Norris and Barrett in good faith.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500023#Z01100","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389805500,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being seconded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500024#AA00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1389805500,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500024#AA00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1389805500,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the trouble that he has gone to.  He has obviously consulted widely on this issue but I suggest that perhaps he has consulted with people who have a commitment to tradition, precedent and so forth.  The fact that the use of the phrase goes back to 1831 does not mean anything as far as I am concerned because there was an awful lot of trouble in this country at that time.  A lot of very bad legislation and very bad phraseology was introduced then so the argument with regard to precedent is not, in my opinion, convincing.  In fact, one of the reasons I tabled this amendment is that I thought it would be a good idea to get rid of the phrase.  Whatever about the interpretation of the courts, there is a difference between necessary and expedient.  Necessary covers every single aspect.  If something is necessary, then it is necessary.  Not even the maddest court in the land would find it any other way.  I defy anybody, including the Attorney General, who is a very charming person, to prove that this would affect a judgment.  I do not believe that for one second because if a thing is necessary, then it is required to be done for the good of the people and the good of the legislation.  Expedient means something very different.  It is close to what, in theological terms, we call situational ethics.  In other words, one does what is easiest and most advantageous from a partisan point of view.  I believe it is very bad to continue to use this term in legislation.  If the effect of this was to remove or to cause to be reconsidered 834 uses of the word, which is one which brings politics into disrepute, I would be absolutely delighted.  I am afraid, despite the Minister's relatively emollient tone as compared to his very vigorous broadcast this morning, I will be pushing this to a vote because I believe it is very important.  I do not think we should be hidebound.<\/p><p>People do not like change, by and large.  If one is part of a large operation in bureaucracy, there is a tendency to resist change, particularly if there is a long tradition behind something.  However, that is no reason.  No reason has been given to me by the Minister that convinces me, even though I do accept his goodwill.  He has taken advice but I believe he has swallowed that advice a little too hastily.  I maintain that the term &quot;necessary&quot; covers any appropriate situation whereas expediency leaves the Bill tainted.  It emerges from a time when politics was unrepresentative and undemocratic, when we had no parliament in this country. <\/p> <p>The Minister said up to 1922 there were 834 uses of the phrase.  That was when we were ruled from Westminster.  On numerous occasions they refused to consider the Irish question, including famine, in the Queen's speech.  I have just been reading a superb book about Parnell by Mr. Brian Cregan, a member of the Law Library.  It is a wonderful book.  The obstructionism of the British Parliament at that point is made absolutely clear.  I would not be terribly concerned about upsetting a precedent that comes from that time, which had no respect for democracy, when women were not allowed the vote and Ireland was, not always but generally, walked on by an imperial parliament that produced this noxious phrase, \"good republicans\".  I am not a republican really at all.  I would love to have the O'Conor Don back.  I suppose we could not push the President, Michael D. Higgins, out of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in but we could get him somewhere nice and have him as a king.  That would be wonderful.  That is light-hearted, but I will press the amendment to a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500024#AA00400","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1389805800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the words proposed to be deleted stand.\"<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 27; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Sean D.

What I see happening is that the permanent government is preventing us as legislators from having a debate on amendments.  It is telling us which amendments are in order or out of order.  We are putting ourselves in a straitjacket and preventing ourselves from having a proper debate and scrutinising Bills.  The debacle with Irish Water is an example of what happens when we do not have proper scrutiny.  The Minister has failed to answer even simple questions about the issue.  He is dodging questions.  It is simply not good politics.  This is the only opportunity I have to do so and I strongly put on record my opposition to again railroading through an important Bill, ruling out of order amendments which are in order and should be debated and discussed.  It is a sad day for the Oireachtas and the Seanad that this has happened again.  It has happened to so many Bills and here we are again carrying on with the same sort of nonsense.<\/p><p>In the context of the Minister telling us that this Bill is about improving democracy and adding value to existing democracy, we have the charade of not being able to debate many of the provisions in the Bill or not being able to amend them.  Even if the Government disagreed with them the Minister could at least listen to us and have the courtesy to allow us to table an amendment and have a debate on the issues.

Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 propose additional categories to be covered in regard to the membership of committees.  I do not agree that a reference, as proposed, to drawing members from communities of interest is required, because section 128D (2)(d) already provides for members to be drawn from representatives of local community interests and this includes communities of interest.  A key aim is to ensure a tight focused membership of the committees.  The proposed amendments to provide, for example, for guaranteed membership for representatives of all social partnerships would inevitably result in a larger than intended membership.  It is well known to all here today that we have had a plethora of large committees and boards, where frequently their effectiveness suffers due to the size of the membership.  The recommendation made to me by the expert group that studied local development alignment was to keep the committees as small and as focused as possible.  Accordingly, I do not support these amendments.<\/p><p>Similarly, I do not support amendment No. 45, concerning the nomination of elected members to local community development committees.  When the chief officer is seeking nominees for the local community development committee, he or she shall do so in consultation with the corporate policy group, CPG, as a result of an amendment that was accepted on Committee Stage.  Given that the process for selecting nominees will now be carried out in consultation with the CPG, I oppose amendment No. 45.<\/p><p>This argument also applies to amendment No. 46, which proposes that the elected members to be nominated to the committee shall have been elected by the local authority.  I will, in due course, bring forward regulations to cover the detailed arrangements for the nomination by various stakeholder bodies to the local community development committees and in doing so, I will consult with the representatives of elected members to ensure a fair and reasonable process is followed in the nomination of elected members to the committee.<\/p><p>I do not support amendment No. 47, relating to local authority membership and the chairmanship of local community development committees.  The legislation, as drafted, reflects the balance between the status of the committee as a committee of the local authority on the one hand and the independence of the committee in the performance of its functions on the other, for example, for the purposes of drawing down EU local development funds.  A guarantee that the chairperson should be drawn from a specific sectoral interest or that a specific sectoral interest should have a minimum number of members would undermine the independence of the committee and impact on its eligibility as an implementer of key EU local development programmes.  Given this requirement, I am not in a position to support the amendments as proposed.  However, I should point out that elected members may very well be the chair of these committees.  This has already happened in the case of County Cork.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 relate to the making of regulations regarding local development community development committees.  As proposed, amendment No. 49 would require the Minister to consult with non-governmental organisations, community groups and communities of interest when making ministerial regulations.  I do not believe it would represent an effective process to consult with stakeholders in the very wide manner envisaged by the proposed amendments on each occasion that regulations are to be made or amended.  However, I believe that consultation with citizens and communities is very important in the workings of the committees and in that regard the Bill provides significant avenues of consultation for citizens and communities in regard to the work of the LCDCs.  For example, committees will be required to consult with members of the public in the preparation of the local economic and community plans.  Moreover, I will provide for participation by the local community in local government in a more general way through the implementation of the recommendations of the working group on citizen engagement.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 50 proposes to remove the provisions that the Minister may consult with public authorities, as he or she considers appropriate, in the making of regulations.  There is a range of public authorities with whom it would not be appropriate to consult, such as those with no involvement or interest in local development or community development.  Therefore, I do not support the deletion of the text as proposed as this would require the Minister to consult with all public authorities.<\/p><p>I do not support amendment No. 56 as proposed.  The amendment seeks to insert a provision in section 128, which deals with local community development committees, regarding what the amendment calls a working group on active citizenship.  Section 44, relating to consultation with local communities, was accepted already on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  This provides the framework for a range of measures which will flow from the recommendations of the working group on citizen engagement, which I am currently considering.  Therefore, the amendment that has been proposed to section 128 is not necessary.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 57 seeks to add to the bodies designated as relevant bodies in section 128F.  Section 128F (1) and Schedule 16 prescribe those bodies that shall be considered to be relevant bodies for the purposes of ensuring co-operation with the work of the local community development committees.  It is envisaged that the programmes managed and delivered by the bodies listed as relevant bodies in the Bill will be the first to come within the provisions of section 128F.  However, new bodies will be added to the list of relevant bodies by ministerial order as new arrangements are agreed with the LCDCs for the implementation of programmes by bodies other than those listed.  Similarly, when more programmes come within the remit of the local community development committees, the list of bodies coming within the scope of section 128G and therefore deemed to be the relevant bodies will be expanded.  The fact that the groups mentioned in the amendment are not designated as relevant bodies in 128F does not indicate a lack of recognition of the role of these groups in local and community development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500033#MM01300","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1389808800,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.

He has talked about the fact that community groups will come to the council but that this will be in consultation.  He disabused us of the notion that they would be in any way subservient, but at the same time, he made it clear that he was here defending the elected members.  This is all fine and dandy.  It is right and I agree with him.<\/p><p>However, why is it the Minister is leaving the provision so loose in regard to the membership of local development committees.  In general, he refers to the committee including members, representatives, individuals and other such persons or bodies as may be provided for.  I get the impression - correct me if I am wrong - that the Minister will issue, by regulation, the number of people who will serve on the committees, in other words, the total membership of the committees.  There is nothing in the Bill to indicate whether there will be five, ten, 15 or 20 members on a committee, so I assume the Minister will make that decision by regulation.<\/p><p>If so, I assume he will also, by regulation, define the number of members in each of the various categories.  In other words, he will say there will be three or four members of the local authority, X number of representatives of public authorities and X number of representatives.  Otherwise, the system cannot work.  There must be a starting point and we must know how many members the committee will have and this membership must then be divided out on a proportionate basis.  That is the nub of the question.  Who will be in the ascendancy?  Will it be the non-elected members or the elected members?<\/p><p>The reason I raise this issue is that when the local development companies first started in the late 1990s, one of the major bugbears elected members had was that they found themselves in a situation where they sat on local development partnerships.<\/p> <p>There would have been four representatives in the local partnerships.  They found that because the funding was bypassing the local authority and going directly from the European Union or, in some cases, Dublin, an individual who had contested the previous local elections and had lost out to one or other of these four members was, as chairman of the committee or partnership, in a much more powerful and influential position because he or she had money to dish out.  It was a great source of annoyance and frustration to elected members who found themselves competing, as it were, with non-elected members.  I raise this matter because I wonder if the balance will now tilt towards the elected members.  <\/p><p>I am not in any way trying to take away from the enormously important work done by community groups.  It is vitally important that the membership of local community development committees be as widely representative as possible of the communities in which they operate, even if that means that there is a substantial and significant number of non-elected members.  The question is whether the Minister will try to achieve a balance or will there just be token representation by local authorities, with the overwhelming majority of those on the committees being non-elected members.  That may lead back to the difficult situation in which the partnerships found themselves at the beginning.  I am not expressing any criticism of the work the partnerships have done as they have evolved since 1997.  They have done extraordinary work and continue to do so.  I hope the Minister will ensure those who are now working with the local development companies will still have an important role to play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500033#MM01400","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389809400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>A number of my amendments were ruled out of order.  I will speak to amendments Nos. 42 and 43 which were deemed to be in order.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 42 seeks to include representatives of the social partners as members of local community development committees and also communities of interest.  The Minister has gone some way towards answering the second issue regarding communities of interest, but I am sure he will agree that the social partners have played a very important part in the development of the State.  The city and county development boards will be dissolved once the new arrangements come into being, but representatives of the social partners, including the trade union movement, business groups, farming organisations and so forth, sat on these boards.  While there may have been some difficulty with the operation of the boards in overall terms, the social partners added some value.  I accept that when one is trying to put together the membership of any committee, one does not want it to become cumbersome or unwieldy.  One wants the committee to be able to function and work effectively.  However, at the same time, one also wants the membership to be as wide-ranging as possible.<\/p><p>We also sought in an amendment that was ruled out of order to have the specific needs of minority groups represented.  I ask the Minister to respond on that issue.  It might be wise to have representatives of some specific statutory agencies on the committees, but our amendment to that effect was also ruled out of order.  We asked that the issue of social inclusion be prominent in the development of the plans.  Our amendments were seeking to improve the operation of the committees which would come into being in order to ensure they would be as representative and wide-ranging as possible and add value for all of the people we represent.  It is important that the plans do exactly what is needed and if that is to be the case, they must have the support of as many groups and organisations as possible.  If statutory agencies, social partners and certain community interest groups, particularly those representing minorities, are outside the door, that will not be good in the longer term.  That is why we are seeking to improve this section by tabling a group of amendments, some of which, unfortunately, were ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500034#NN00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1389809400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I agree with the Senator's sentiments.  What we are trying to do is rebalance the powers in favour of the elected members who were frustrated in recent times when the finances of local authorities were in difficulty and they saw an enormous amount of activity in their communities in the form of EU programmes into which they had little or no input.  What we are doing is aligning the community with local government.  We are not excluding anybody but including everybody and getting people to work more closely together at a time of finite resources to ensure we get the best possible results for the community without the enormous administrative costs that were a feature of various programmes in the past.  I am showing some flexibility in terms of the numbers in bands and guidelines that I will lay down.  In many of the Border counties, for example, peace programmes are operating in addition to the usual statutory programmes being implemented by the Government in the Republic.  Therefore, there is a good reason for representation on local community development committees to take account of some of the existing programmes that will continue into the future, particularly in the context of the European Union's bottom-up approach to certain funds.  My Department is consulting on a regular basis about the next round of EU funds and programmes to determine the most appropriate structure in order to get the best value for money and maximise the amount of money that goes to projects.<\/p><p>The elected members and the statutory bodies will not be allowed to dominate the local community development committees.  If, for example, a committee has 15 members, eight must be non-statutory, non-elected and non-local authority representatives.  The 15 members can decide who will chair the committee.  In most cases, there will be three representatives of the local authority system, two of whom will be elected members, while the other will be an official.  It will be up to the 15 members to decide who will chair the committee.  As I said, in one of the pilot programmes we run in Cork a local community development committee has already been established and an elected member has become the chairperson.  It depends on the relationship people have with their community.  Elected members must foster that relationship and if they wish to become chairpersons of their local community development committees, there is nothing to stop them from doing so.<\/p><p>If all of the social partners want to be represented, as Senator David Cullinane has suggested, something will have to give.  That something would probably be the local development companies, the partnership companies or the community sector.  We should not have an unwieldy number of members of any group, but at the same time, we should have everybody, in so far as it is possible to do so, represented.  It is very important that the representatives in the local community development structures - whoever they may be - are able to feed back the necessary information to their communities in a much more structured way than we have seen in the past.  We do not want a repeat of the situation where people - often from the community sector - sat on committees but did not engage with those who had put them there.  We need a more structured approach in that regard and that is what I am seeking to in the Bill.  That is also why I asked Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy and his committee to come up with proposals to improve matters further in order that everybody would know what was going on and everybody would have an input.  The final decisions, however, will be made by the local community development committees.  They will have the money and receive the applications for funding, while the funds will be dispersed through the existing financial structures of the local authorities.  That will save money because we are using a structure that is already in place.  It also bolsters the local government system, but it does not in any way denigrate the community projects that will come through the community sector and the elected members to the local community development committees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500034#NN00300","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1389809400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I welcome what the Minister has just said.

I wish to add to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's contribution.<\/p><p>The main reason local authorities other than those designated in the Bill should be allowed this flexibility is that when the question of the change of title first arose some years ago, one of the arguments put forward by those who advocated that the first citizen be called &quot;mayor&quot; mainly concerned the representative role, rather than the executive role, that a mayor would have, especially in representing the county abroad.  In America, the term &quot;cathaoirleach&quot; would mean absolutely nothing.  This is one of the reasons that led to the renaming of Dublin Corporation as Dublin City Council.  When the Lord Mayor of Dublin went to America and said he represented a corporation, as far as the Americans were concerned this meant he represented some big company rather than an elected body.  For that reason, if none other, there should be some flexibility built into this section that would at least allow the option to exist.  It is quite possible that there are some counties which, for traditional or historical reasons, may wish to retain the style of cathaoirleach or leas-chathaoirleach.  In my county, Leitrim, the titles &quot;cathaoirleach&quot; and &quot;leas-cathaoirleach&quot; have been retained, because they serve to point to our Irish identity as much as anything else.  This does not necessarily take account of the pragmatic view I have been putting forward as to why there should be flexibility in regard to whether one is called &quot;cathaoirleach&quot; or &quot;mayor&quot;.  In terms of the representative role the first citizen carries out, particularly abroad and especially among the Irish diaspora, the term &quot;mayor&quot; is useful.  As the Minister knows, the mayor or first citizen tends to travel to very specific events annually among the Irish diaspora, particularly in Britain and the United States.  For no reason other than a very entrepreneurial one, the use of the title &quot;mayor&quot; rather than &quot;cathaoirleach&quot;, whose exact meaning might be questioned abroad, might help to enhance the attractiveness of the county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500039#TT01500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1389811200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>When I spoke on the last occasion, I neglected to welcome the Minister to the House.

During Second Stage, the Minister stated there was an agreement between the two associations, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the Association of County and City Councils that the title &quot;mayor&quot; would be used sparingly and in a limited capacity.  We outlined during Committee Stage what cities could use the title &quot;mayor&quot;.  The Minister stated he understood that what he outlined was the case.  However, it is not the case, and I thank the Minister for clarifying that during Committee Stage.<\/p><p>There should be flexibility such that where a county wants to call the cathaoirleach &quot;mayor&quot;, it should be allowed to do so.  In Cavan, we have always called the chairperson &quot;cathaoirleach&quot; and my hope and preference is that we will continue to do so.

For example, it reiterates the recognition given in the Local Government Act 2001 to various historic charters for civic ceremonial purposes.  Specifically, it provides that the title of \"mayor\" will be reserved for cities and municipal districts that contain boroughs and county towns, or towns with a population of over 20,000 at the last census.  In other cases, the officer will be entitled \"chair\", \"cathaoirleach\" or \"leader\".<\/p><p>The Bill also provides the option of adopting the title &quot;mayor&quot; would no longer be available to county councils.  It restores the position that applied prior to the Local Government Act 2001.  When examples of largely rural authorities having a mayor can be found, the more usual practice internationally is for the office of mayor to be associated with significant urban centres.  Confining the office of mayor to larger urban centres will enhance the status of that historic office.

Unlike the county and city enterprise boards with a board structure, LEOs will not have a committee with members but will be serviced by LEO staff and as such, it is not possible to make legislative provision for the chair of the SPC to be a member of the non-existent board.

At present, town councils have control over land and in the case of Kells, it comprises nearly 350 acres.  There is great sentimental attachment to that land in Kells and the people of the town believe the land belongs to them.  The amendment seeks, in general terms, to amend section 183 of the 2001 Act to ensure that if land is being sold by a local authority, not only would a majority of the members of the local authority support that resolution, as is required at present, but that within that majority, there would be a majority of members from the municipal district in which the land is situate.<\/p><p>  That is as far as I can go in my proposal but I state further to the Minister that I understand members of Kells Town Council have asked to meet him.  I urge him to accede to the request, because there are other things that could be done in respect of this particular landbank.  It is not really a landbank and actually is known as the farm or lands of Lloyd and, in the main, is operating as a farm.  It generates an income for the town, there are allotments there, as well as a tourism area.

Its purpose is to ensure proper regard is given to income that is generated in and redistributed to municipal districts and that such redistribution takes place in a fair and equitable manner.  It proposes to add to the current section on the reserve functions of the municipal district members and the requirement on the part of the chief executive to take account of the budgetary plan adopted by district members.  The amendment proposes that a county or city council will be required to ensure that income redistribution to municipal districts takes place on a fair and equitable basis and is reasonably proportional to the income directly generated within the municipal district in question.<\/p><p>  It will take local authority management and members some time to get their heads around the new structures and approach being rolled out by the Minister, especially with regard to how the new districts will work out in practice.

In my home county of Waterford, for example, a new merged authority, Waterford Municipal District, will be established.  It will have three electoral wards within the district and a further two electoral areas outside the district but within the overall county council boundaries.  As the Minister will be aware, one of the fears people voiced about the merger is that it may result in one area subsidising the other and being disadvantaged as a result.  The Minister will argue that one must ensure one pools resources and obtains the best for the entire electoral area, city or county.

The draft local authority budget must be prepared setting out the amounts necessary for the functional programmes of the authority, including an amount to be provided as the general municipal allocation.  A consultative process commencing with the input of the corporate policy group, as set out in the Local Government Act 2001, remains central to the development of the local authority budget.  The chief executive must subsequently prepare a draft budgetary plan for each municipal district.  The members of each municipal district shall adopt the draft budgetary plan and the chief executive shall take account of any adopted budgetary plans in preparing the draft local authority budget.  Each draft budgetary plan will set out the general municipal allocation being made available to that municipal district.  It is important to ensure that these allocations are made with due regard to the principles of fairness and equity.  This is being done in the legislation, which sets out the principles to be applied by the chief executive in making resources available to the district members for consideration in a draft budgetary plan.  It provides that the chief executive have regard to the resource needs of the municipal districts and the broader needs of the local authority.  Resources are allocated accordingly.  It is common sense that each local authority member will fight hard for his or her municipal areas.

We also believe there are question marks over the future development of local government in rural areas because many of its powers have been taken away and because of the drift of members from the west to the east.  The Minister has said it remains for future Governments to decide how they might adapt or change the legislation and I hope that is something that will be looked at in order that that imbalance will be corrected.<\/p><p>I wish all candidates who are gearing up for election to county councils well and commiserate with the many hundreds of excellent town councillors who will find themselves out of work and a job in June as a result of the Government's proposals.  In the context of the Minister's democratic aspirations which he has brought forward throughout the debate since he first initiated the legislation, when looks at comparisons between this country and similar countries, taking Denmark as an example, at local level it has town councils that have very real powers, yet this country which has already been criticised for having one of the most centralised administrations in central and western Europe now finds itself denuded of democracy at the very lowest level of the town council.

There has been a radical overhaul of the system.  As somebody who has been involved in local government for 20 years and in response to Senator Paschal Mooney's last statement that local councils have been denuded of their powers, massive power has been given to district councils, devolved from county council level to local district level, which town councils did not have.  That is a very positive aspect.  Naturally, every councillor, Senator, Deputy and even the Minister cannot do everything in one day.  He has only been in office a short time, but this has been a reforming Minister.  He has always said he has local government at heart and we will see an increase in funding this year during which there will be a boost in funding to local authorities of &euro;98 million, an increase of 11%.  Therefore, we cannot say the Minister does not have local government at heart; he does, as he has shown.  Some 44 functions have been transferred to district councils - that is democracy at local level.  For the first time consultation with communities is being provided for in legislative form.  We did have a consultation system in place in local government, but it was never written into legislation.  We now have it in legislation. <\/p><p>I thank the Minister.

I respect that this is a democracy and accept what has happened within my party and the Government in general with regard to the abolition of town councils, but it is important that the local elected representative is the person who represents local people.

At the same time, we must remain true to ourselves in what we have stated through Second, Committee and Report Stages.  I have real concerns about the Bill.  I do not believe the Minister is radically reforming the local government system at all.  In fact, what I think he has done is missed a big opportunity to genuinely reform it.  One of the core issues raised, if one goes back to the start of the debate on Second Stage, is that we have not devolved real powers from Departments to local government.  We  have not given it the powers it has in many other countries.  What the Minister has done is rearrange the deck chairs.  We are going down the same road the Government followed in the case of the Seanad, which was to reduce numbers.  Under the Bill town councils will be abolished and the number of councils and councillors will be reduced; they will be given no real powers.  There are also the concerns of the community and voluntary sector, the Leader programmes and councillors, especially town councillors, but there are concerns right across the board.  The Minister has missed an opportunity, whcih is unfortunate.  It will take a new Government involving parties which are genuinely committed to reforming local government to bring forward the type of local government system that I want to see, which is genuine, robust and has the power to deliver for communities to the extent that it should.

I will not second-guess the Minister's reply, but I do not imagine we will receive any great news this evening.<\/p> <p>The group is a parents' group and the Minister of State has met them in the past.  I do not need notes to speak about what the group does.  I am one of the people who raise &euro;250,000 a year to provide services for 350 children in County Clare.  The lady who set up the group, Ann Norton, will not mind me putting her name on record.  I remember having an argument with her eight years ago and I said the day would come when we were all older and unable to do it any more.  The children get older and require more support.  Without the Clare Federation in County Clare supplying those services, Clare Early Intervention Services provides only 5% of the services and supports in County Clare.<\/p><p>We talk about value for money, and I can guarantee that the Clare Crusaders are value for money.  We do not spend any money but fund-raise ourselves, so the group must be good value for money.  We do not get the same value for money from the Clare Early Intervention Services structure and we never will.  The model does not work and I said as much eight years ago when it was set up under Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  It was not going to work then and it will not work now.<\/p><p>I am very passionate about the children and the services they receive and the support we can give them.  Last Thursday, my 21-year-old child was swimming with the group in the Auburn Lodge Hotel.  There were children from 8 to 18 years and they have held onto our 21-year-old even though we said we would finish at 20 years of age.  One of the two issues is the core funding needed to keep the group ticking over, which does not amount to &euro;250,000.  Between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000 will get them through this year.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the new implementation framework and facilitate a meeting.  Deputy Michael McNamara attended a meeting in Ennis and Senator Conway is part of the same Clare group.  Local Deputies also attended.  We would like to look at the model in County Clare.  We do not want to turn it into the current service provider model.  The Minister of State knows my views on the matter, which are that the model is too expensive and does not work.  As parents, if we could set up a board of management and support the Government and the agencies and receive some support now, I would like us to be considered as a pilot group under the new implementation framework.  Perhaps we can meet with the Minister of State and the representatives of the bodies involved to explain what the Clare Crusaders do.<\/p><p>If we are not able to continue tomorrow morning, and if no one comes along to raise funds, Clare will become a disaster in respect of disability services.  Even though I have been involved with the group since its inception, I was not aware that a real problem is the failure of the HSE in County Clare to inform the HSE in Limerick and the HSE nationally that the Clare Crusaders exists and provides services.  Worst of all, the HSE refers clients to the Clare Crusaders, which is a voluntary group.  I do not want the standard HSE reply.  A root-and-branch investigation of the Clare Crusaders must be put in front of the Minister of State, the HSE and the steering group to show people what they do.  The Minister of State will see absolute value for money.  Perhaps Senator Martin Conway will add to that point.  I can only speak as a parent and as a representative of the group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500043#ZZ02400","speaker":"1134","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389813300,"counter":538,"content":"<p>There are a number of positive aspects.

The prepared answer goes into Government policy, which we all know, particularly Senators Conway and Mulcahy.  Some &euro;1.4 billion is spent on disability and 80% of it goes to non-statutory agencies that deliver disability services.  There are 300 agencies around the country.  My prepared answer is available to any Member who wants it and it provides worthwhile information.<\/p><p>  The big advantage we have this year is a director dealing specifically with disability and older people.  He is very familiar with the area, having been the regional director of operations for HSE south.  I know him well, although I was not part of the interview process and had nothing to do with it.  Everyone recognises that he has in-depth knowledge of the area.  His credentials are the fact that such difficulties or crises did not exist in HSE south, because Mr. Pat Healy is very capable of managing issues and is <i>au fait<\/i> with possible difficulties so that they can be dealt with as they arise.<\/p><p>  When we concluded budgetary negotiations, he managed to get &euro;4 million for those under 18 years of age.  That is where we need to be.  The issue involves the availability of a service when people need it rather than relying on a diagnosis of disability.  Legally, we are still obliged to carry out a diagnosis because it is part of the Disability Act.  We must also carry out an assessment of needs.  The difficulty is that I can afford to have my child diagnosed at an early age by paying &euro;600 or &euro;1,200, and the diagnosis gives me access to services.  This is unfair and unequal because some people cannot pay for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>  The &euro;4 million set aside for those under 18 will have a major impact on the service.  We must continue to deliver a service in the community as opposed to having the service tied up with service providers.  Senator Mulcahy will agree with that point and we must ensure it happens.  There are groups, maybe one or two or more, providing the types of service the Clare Crusaders provide.  I know about the Clare Crusaders.  They are providing the service on the basis that mainstreaming is what we all want to do.  It is about how people live their lives rather than how they interact with services.  A combination of elements coming together will make sure we deliver the service in the way groups such as the Clare Crusaders are delivering it.  Groups such as the Bray Lakers have a similar model.  The legislation, in terms of capacity, will change things fundamentally for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>We are going to start to do things differently.  I know the director has very clear ideas on how to change the service and his aim in life is to ensure that people live as normal a life as possible.  I will bring to his attention the fact that the likes of Clare Crusaders do not receive any funding.  I should say to both Senators that it is always tempting, when an organisation works extremely well without receiving State funding, providing a service with which everybody is happy, to tell the people involved they are doing a great job and leave it at that.  I very much take on board that the group that is there now will not always be there.  I suppose it needs to be more established.<\/p><p>I will bring the concerns of both Senators to Mr. Healy, the new director of social care, and I will ask him to look at these matters.  We are confined with regard to funding and it is not like the good old days when we could go back and get more.  That is not how it works any more.  I will consult with the director about having a serious look at the issue.  He knows the group involved.  The beauty of having a director with responsibility for the service in the entire country - along with planning and development of services - is that there is a degree of flexibility.  I thank the Senators for raising the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500043#AAA01100","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389813300,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for not reading the five-page reply that has been distributed to us but rather answering the questions.

He has stated that much more funding must be allocated.  I know the efforts that he and his Department are making to obtain further funds from Europe with regard to the disaster that struck in recent times, particularly in view of the fact that two storms occurred in quick succession and did major damage everywhere.  Although I am concerned about the effects everywhere, this matter relates to Rossbeigh, which was a fantastic expanse of sand dunes.  I spoke today to my colleague Senator Tom Sheahan, who was born and grew up in Glenbeigh, a neighbouring village, and he told me there were 375 acres of sand dunes there not long ago and that is now down to approximately 100 acres.  As the Minister of State probably knows, the gap between the dunes has extended to approximately a kilometre.<\/p><p>The concern must be for the back lands where the sea has invaded.

As he has highlighted, we had a very difficult week or two, with storms ravaging parts of the western counties, especially Galway, Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Cork and Mayo.  I know there is a Senator from Galway here and Waterford was also affected.<\/p><p>The Senator is aware that the Cabinet considered the matter yesterday and the initial assessment from the affected counties is that &euro;65 million will be needed to repair some of the damage, of which &euro;35 million relates to a variety of issues around coastal works.  My Department has written to all the city and county managers advising them of the minor works schemes that we run in our Department, with funding of up to &euro;500,000 provided for flood defence schemes of a minor nature.  Anything beyond that is clearly on a larger scale.  We have written to managers and changed some criteria to make it easier to make applications.  I publicly gave a commitment - which I repeat tonight in the House - that when we see those applications come in from local authorities we will prioritise the counties that have been worst affected and see if we can quickly get money to these areas.<\/p><p>The first priority for us is to repair damaged flood schemes, as many parts of the western counties had flood schemes in place that have been damaged.  The priority has to be to repair the damaged schemes as quickly as possible.  It is still relatively early in the winter and there are difficult weather days before us.  The &euro;45 million allocation is for the whole country and we must wait to see the full scale of applications that will come to us.  As I stated last week, it is inevitable that more funding will have to be found to deal with repairs.<\/p><p>The Senator raised the specific case of Rossbeigh.  Consideration must be given to the fact that coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process.  Although it may have an adverse impact on coastal communities and infrastructure, it can also have beneficial effects, such as providing natural nourishment and a supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.  Due to the considerable extent and nature of the Irish coastline affected by erosion and the fact that it is an ongoing natural process, it is clearly not feasible from an economic or practical viewpoint for the State to protect all of this coastline.  Any approach toward addressing problems of coastal erosion must be informed by an assessment of the risks involved.  The Government recognises this and is taking active measures to assess and monitor the risks of coastal erosion.<\/p><p>The Irish coastal protection strategy study, which is a major examination of this matter, is effectively complete, and this will provide invaluable and essential information.  That strategy is providing an entire mapping system for the national coastline, which is a very important element in the proper management of the coastline.  The Office of Public Works is currently undertaking a series of catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, studies, which also feed into the issue of coastal communities.  The CFRAM assessments are supported by the collection of data under the programme following flood events to identify areas and numbers of properties flooded, flood depths and mechanisms, etc.<\/p><p>There is a tendency sometimes to assume that problems such as coastal erosion require fixing, usually through engineered solutions.  These interventions are usually very costly in terms of both initial capital and ongoing maintenance costs.  However, it is important to stand back and look at the problem in the round.  For example, the European Commission study entitled Living with Coastal Erosion in Europe, completed in 2004, highlighted some important findings, including the fact that some previous interventions, while solving erosion problems locally, exacerbated coastal erosion at other locations.  This study also highlighted the concept of &quot;coastal squeeze&quot; which occurs in low-lying and intertidal areas which would otherwise naturally adjust to changes in sea level, storms and tides but cannot do so due to the construction of sea walls.  The outcome can often be a gradual loss of amenity beach and habitat.<\/p><p>To conclude, I assure the Senator that I am fully aware of the coastal erosion issues at Rossbeigh.  I was there some years ago with a colleague of the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500043#BBB00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1389813300,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Only a year ago, I would say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500043#BBB00600","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1389813300,"counter":555,"content":"<p>That is right.

The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, is very welcome.  I thank him for coming to the House.  We are following on the theme of the recent storms but focusing on a different element of what took place.<\/p><p>I spent much of the past week or so walking the highways and byways of Connemara and Galway looking at the damage, which in many cases was devastating.  One issue that came to light is the situation in which small fishermen find themselves.  I spoke to people who are in their 80s who said they had never seen anything like the damage that was done and the type of storm we saw in recent weeks.  Among the casualties were fishermen, some of whom had their boats and pots well away from the pier but they found that even that was not enough to protect them.  Their boats have been damaged, gear has been lost and engines have been damaged.  In a number of cases, slipways and piers have been badly damaged.  The extent of the damage to the infrastructure of the piers will not be apparent for a number of weeks or months.  Structural engineering audits of piers must be carried out to see whether damage has been done to their bases.<\/p><p>Much of the focus to date has been on the response of county councils, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the OPW among others.  Fishermen find themselves in a much more difficult situation.  Small fishermen in particular have been finding it hard to make ends meet.  A joint Oireachtas committee compiled a report on fishing and a group visited the island of Inis O&iacute;rr in County Galway.  One of the main findings of the report is that more support must be given to smaller inshore fishermen with boats under 10 m.  Many of those fishermen have found their livelihood is in serious jeopardy because of the damage done to boats and gear.  The gear of a small number of fishermen has been severely damaged and their livelihood is in jeopardy.<\/p><p>Could the Minister of State indicate whether an emergency fund is available to help reinstate the boats, gear and lost pots due to what has been described as a perfect storm?  The swell, full moon and spring tide all came together in conjunction with the wind to do untold damage.  In most cases the fishermen do not have the financial wherewithal to cover the cost of replacing their gear.  Last year when there was a fodder crisis the Government was rightly able to introduce measures to alleviate the pressure on farmers.  Small fishermen are in an equally bad position.  If they do not get help they will not be able to resume fishing.  That is the bottom line.  We need to keep as many men as possible fishing in their boats on the sea.  I hope the Minister of State will have positive news for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500043#CCC00700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1389813300,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue and giving me an opportunity to come to the House to discuss the matter.  At the outset, we must look at the variety of impacts the storms have had on the fishing industry and coastal communities.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, along with all his colleagues in government, are acutely aware of the ferocity of the recent storms combined with the exceptionally high tides which in combination have resulted in widespread damage right around the coast.  A critical impact of the storms for fishermen has been the damage to vital pier and harbour infrastructure, which the inshore fishing industry depend on to carry out their work safely and efficiently.<\/p><p>Since the storms occurred, the Minister has been actively assessing the damage to the many small local authority piers and harbours right around the coast.  He presented an assessment on the damage to fishery piers and harbours to Government at yesterday's meeting.  He is aware that serious damage was caused to vital public infrastructure in various small local authority piers and harbours and to various navigational lights and beacons around the coast.  He continues to assess the damage and to estimate the cost of repair and will feed the information into the Government's overall consideration of the issue.<\/p><p>The Government, in considering the totality of the impact of the storms yesterday, decided that local authorities need to carry out a full assessment of the damage and the costs involved and should revert to Government in the coming weeks.  The comprehensive assessment will then enable the Government to decide on a fully informed response to the damage that was wreaked on our coastal communities as a result of the exceptionally bad storms.  The Minister is aware of the critical importance of the local pier and harbour infrastructure to the 1,900 odd inshore fishing vessels that provide a backbone to our inshore fishing fleet.  He is anxious that damage to critical pier and harbour infrastructure is addressed as comprehensively as possible and will work through the Department and with the local authorities to achieve the objective.  The Minister is anxious that the repair of vital public infrastructure for the inshore fishing industry is a priority element in any overall Government response.<\/p><p>On the specific issue of Government support for inshore fishermen for losses of equipment or boats, it is useful to recall that there is a range of grant aid schemes already available to inshore fishermen administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  There have been some reports in the media about the loss by some inshore fishermen of their pots.  It is not unusual for inshore fishermen to experience some pot losses through the winter.  The Minister will talk to industry groups in the coming days and endeavour to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.<\/p><p>In deciding on an appropriate response to the situation that emerges, the Minister will have to take account of the fact that EU law limits the options.  The EU requires that any financial assistance provided by Government to the seafood sector must always be considered in terms of what is permissible under EU state aid rules.  It is clear that under state aid rules, no aid may be given for the replacement of any lost or damaged fishing boats.  Aid for the purchase of a fishing boat is only allowed for young fishermen under 40 years of age purchasing their first fishing boat, so no replacement boat is eligible for assistance.<\/p> <p> The European fisheries fund regulation does allow for financial assistance for purchase of pots, but only where the replacement pots provide for more selectivity in regard to by-catch and under size fish.  Any such assistance to purchase fishing gear may not increase the ability of a vessel to catch fish and would be difficult to implement without the risk of breaching state aid rules.<\/p><p>However, while constraints and considerations do exist, the Minister is actively endeavouring to get a full picture of the situation.  When that is to hand, he will be in a better position to inform Government and determine what responses are practical.  I spoke to him just before I came to this House and he stressed that he is intent on doing that and he wants to assure the Senator that he understands the difficulty and will do what is possible, within the law, to try to assist in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500043#CCC00800","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389813300,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for replying to my Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister.

This has been a catastrophe for many of the fishermen involved and we need to use whatever mechanisms we have to make the case with Europe.  I imagine Europe would be favourable, because the numbers are minuscule.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Minister will talk to industry groups in the coming days to endeavour to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.

The issue relates to retailers with sizeable buying power and their ability to compete unfairly against small individual retailers.  This issue was highlighted over Christmas in the case of below-cost selling of vegetables and fruits by some retailers.  Some retailers in my town point out that they cannot even buy at wholesale prices from suppliers for the same price at which multiple chain retailers can sell the same product.  This below-cost selling may sound like a good idea for consumers, but as we know from our experience of the below-cost sale of vegetables over the Christmas period, the multiples are able to sell below cost and squeeze small suppliers and retailers out of the market.  Then, when the multiples have got rid of the competition, they can charge whatever price they like.<\/p><p>This practice occurred many moons ago in regard to the sale of petrol and gasoline in the United States, to the point that monopolies were created.

However, the practice to which the Senator referred, of predatory pricing, as it is known, where dominant players seek to use price cuts to eliminate another competitor, is entirely illegal and would be in breach of our competition law.  This applies to a specific situation and requires us to establish dominance and the fact that it is predatory.  Much of what happens in the market is that opportunistic pricing strategies are pursued for a short period on a certain product.  This is not illegal and it would be difficult to see that it is damaging to consumers' interests.  Therefore, it is only if it becomes an anti-competitive instrument that there would be a question of assuming powers to deal with it.<\/p><p>There is a wider issue on which I am introducing legislation and this concerns fairness in the supply chain for the retail sector.  At times, suppliers feel they are in a weak position and that unfair conditions are applied or contracts are changed without notice.  I propose to use statutory powers to introduce regulations that will define what practices must be pursued.  The merged competition and consumer authority will be the enforcement agency in that regard.  Inevitably, one must prove that such breaches occurred and regulations still require the onus of proof.  Over the years, there has not been much evidence offered in this area and there have not been complaints of the practice of which the Senator complained, predatory pricing, brought to the Competition Authority.  <\/p><p>We propose to introduce fair rules in this area.  An attempt was made to introduce a voluntary code of practice, but it did not gain much support.  Under the programme for Government, we are bringing in statutory regulations and they will be enforceable.  This will come before the House shortly as we are finalising the drafting of the Bill.  Hopefully, it will be approved by the Government and brought to the House in the near future.  The issue covered in the Bill is slightly different to that of selling below cost.  In the case the Senator highlighted that occurred over the Christmas period, there was a dispute as to whether the retailers were absorbing all the costs themselves or putting a squeeze on their suppliers.  Putting the squeeze on suppliers is the area that will be regulated, but retailers can still choose to sell at whatever price they like, once they are not engaging in either predatory pricing as a dominant player, which would be illegal, or breaching the regulations we will introduce in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500043#DDD00800","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1389813300,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for not reading his entire speech.

We also believe there are question marks over the future development of local government in rural areas because many of its powers have been taken away and because of the drift of members from the west to the east.  The Minister has said it remains for future Governments to decide how they might adapt or change the legislation and I hope that is something that will be looked at in order that that imbalance will be corrected.<\/p><p>I wish all candidates who are gearing up for election to county councils well and commiserate with the many hundreds of excellent town councillors who will find themselves out of work and a job in June as a result of the Government's proposals.  In the context of the Minister's democratic aspirations which he has brought forward throughout the debate since he first initiated the legislation, when looks at comparisons between this country and similar countries, taking Denmark as an example, at local level it has town councils that have very real powers, yet this country which has already been criticised for having one of the most centralised administrations in central and western Europe now finds itself denuded of democracy at the very lowest level of the town council.

There has been a radical overhaul of the system.  As somebody who has been involved in local government for 20 years and in response to Senator Paschal Mooney's last statement that local councils have been denuded of their powers, massive power has been given to district councils, devolved from county council level to local district level, which town councils did not have.  That is a very positive aspect.  Naturally, every councillor, Senator, Deputy and even the Minister cannot do everything in one day.  He has only been in office a short time, but this has been a reforming Minister.  He has always said he has local government at heart and we will see an increase in funding this year during which there will be a boost in funding to local authorities of &euro;98 million, an increase of 11%.  Therefore, we cannot say the Minister does not have local government at heart; he does, as he has shown.  Some 44 functions have been transferred to district councils - that is democracy at local level.  For the first time consultation with communities is being provided for in legislative form.  We did have a consultation system in place in local government, but it was never written into legislation.  We now have it in legislation. <\/p><p>I thank the Minister.

I respect that this is a democracy and accept what has happened within my party and the Government in general with regard to the abolition of town councils, but it is important that the local elected representative is the person who represents local people.

At the same time, we must remain true to ourselves in what we have stated through Second, Committee and Report Stages.  I have real concerns about the Bill.  I do not believe the Minister is radically reforming the local government system at all.  In fact, what I think he has done is missed a big opportunity to genuinely reform it.  One of the core issues raised, if one goes back to the start of the debate on Second Stage, is that we have not devolved real powers from Departments to local government.  We  have not given it the powers it has in many other countries.  What the Minister has done is rearrange the deck chairs.  We are going down the same road the Government followed in the case of the Seanad, which was to reduce numbers.  Under the Bill town councils will be abolished and the number of councils and councillors will be reduced; they will be given no real powers.  There are also the concerns of the community and voluntary sector, the Leader programmes and councillors, especially town councillors, but there are concerns right across the board.  The Minister has missed an opportunity, whcih is unfortunate.  It will take a new Government involving parties which are genuinely committed to reforming local government to bring forward the type of local government system that I want to see, which is genuine, robust and has the power to deliver for communities to the extent that it should.

I will not second-guess the Minister's reply, but I do not imagine we will receive any great news this evening.<\/p> <p>The group is a parents' group and the Minister of State has met them in the past.  I do not need notes to speak about what the group does.  I am one of the people who raise &euro;250,000 a year to provide services for 350 children in County Clare.  The lady who set up the group, Ann Norton, will not mind me putting her name on record.  I remember having an argument with her eight years ago and I said the day would come when we were all older and unable to do it any more.  The children get older and require more support.  Without the Clare Federation in County Clare supplying those services, Clare Early Intervention Services provides only 5% of the services and supports in County Clare.<\/p><p>We talk about value for money, and I can guarantee that the Clare Crusaders are value for money.  We do not spend any money but fund-raise ourselves, so the group must be good value for money.  We do not get the same value for money from the Clare Early Intervention Services structure and we never will.  The model does not work and I said as much eight years ago when it was set up under Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  It was not going to work then and it will not work now.<\/p><p>I am very passionate about the children and the services they receive and the support we can give them.  Last Thursday, my 21-year-old child was swimming with the group in the Auburn Lodge Hotel.  There were children from 8 to 18 years and they have held onto our 21-year-old even though we said we would finish at 20 years of age.  One of the two issues is the core funding needed to keep the group ticking over, which does not amount to &euro;250,000.  Between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000 will get them through this year.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the new implementation framework and facilitate a meeting.  Deputy Michael McNamara attended a meeting in Ennis and Senator Conway is part of the same Clare group.  Local Deputies also attended.  We would like to look at the model in County Clare.  We do not want to turn it into the current service provider model.  The Minister of State knows my views on the matter, which are that the model is too expensive and does not work.  As parents, if we could set up a board of management and support the Government and the agencies and receive some support now, I would like us to be considered as a pilot group under the new implementation framework.  Perhaps we can meet with the Minister of State and the representatives of the bodies involved to explain what the Clare Crusaders do.<\/p><p>If we are not able to continue tomorrow morning, and if no one comes along to raise funds, Clare will become a disaster in respect of disability services.  Even though I have been involved with the group since its inception, I was not aware that a real problem is the failure of the HSE in County Clare to inform the HSE in Limerick and the HSE nationally that the Clare Crusaders exists and provides services.  Worst of all, the HSE refers clients to the Clare Crusaders, which is a voluntary group.  I do not want the standard HSE reply.  A root-and-branch investigation of the Clare Crusaders must be put in front of the Minister of State, the HSE and the steering group to show people what they do.  The Minister of State will see absolute value for money.  Perhaps Senator Martin Conway will add to that point.  I can only speak as a parent and as a representative of the group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500045#ZZ02400","speaker":"1134","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389815100,"counter":607,"content":"<p>There are a number of positive aspects.

The prepared answer goes into Government policy, which we all know, particularly Senators Conway and Mulcahy.  Some &euro;1.4 billion is spent on disability and 80% of it goes to non-statutory agencies that deliver disability services.  There are 300 agencies around the country.  My prepared answer is available to any Member who wants it and it provides worthwhile information.<\/p><p>  The big advantage we have this year is a director dealing specifically with disability and older people.  He is very familiar with the area, having been the regional director of operations for HSE south.  I know him well, although I was not part of the interview process and had nothing to do with it.  Everyone recognises that he has in-depth knowledge of the area.  His credentials are the fact that such difficulties or crises did not exist in HSE south, because Mr. Pat Healy is very capable of managing issues and is <i>au fait<\/i> with possible difficulties so that they can be dealt with as they arise.<\/p><p>  When we concluded budgetary negotiations, he managed to get &euro;4 million for those under 18 years of age.  That is where we need to be.  The issue involves the availability of a service when people need it rather than relying on a diagnosis of disability.  Legally, we are still obliged to carry out a diagnosis because it is part of the Disability Act.  We must also carry out an assessment of needs.  The difficulty is that I can afford to have my child diagnosed at an early age by paying &euro;600 or &euro;1,200, and the diagnosis gives me access to services.  This is unfair and unequal because some people cannot pay for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>  The &euro;4 million set aside for those under 18 will have a major impact on the service.  We must continue to deliver a service in the community as opposed to having the service tied up with service providers.  Senator Mulcahy will agree with that point and we must ensure it happens.  There are groups, maybe one or two or more, providing the types of service the Clare Crusaders provide.  I know about the Clare Crusaders.  They are providing the service on the basis that mainstreaming is what we all want to do.  It is about how people live their lives rather than how they interact with services.  A combination of elements coming together will make sure we deliver the service in the way groups such as the Clare Crusaders are delivering it.  Groups such as the Bray Lakers have a similar model.  The legislation, in terms of capacity, will change things fundamentally for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>We are going to start to do things differently.  I know the director has very clear ideas on how to change the service and his aim in life is to ensure that people live as normal a life as possible.  I will bring to his attention the fact that the likes of Clare Crusaders do not receive any funding.  I should say to both Senators that it is always tempting, when an organisation works extremely well without receiving State funding, providing a service with which everybody is happy, to tell the people involved they are doing a great job and leave it at that.  I very much take on board that the group that is there now will not always be there.  I suppose it needs to be more established.<\/p><p>I will bring the concerns of both Senators to Mr. Healy, the new director of social care, and I will ask him to look at these matters.  We are confined with regard to funding and it is not like the good old days when we could go back and get more.  That is not how it works any more.  I will consult with the director about having a serious look at the issue.  He knows the group involved.  The beauty of having a director with responsibility for the service in the entire country - along with planning and development of services - is that there is a degree of flexibility.  I thank the Senators for raising the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500046#AAA01100","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389815700,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for not reading the five-page reply that has been distributed to us but rather answering the questions.

He has stated that much more funding must be allocated.  I know the efforts that he and his Department are making to obtain further funds from Europe with regard to the disaster that struck in recent times, particularly in view of the fact that two storms occurred in quick succession and did major damage everywhere.  Although I am concerned about the effects everywhere, this matter relates to Rossbeigh, which was a fantastic expanse of sand dunes.  I spoke today to my colleague Senator Tom Sheahan, who was born and grew up in Glenbeigh, a neighbouring village, and he told me there were 375 acres of sand dunes there not long ago and that is now down to approximately 100 acres.  As the Minister of State probably knows, the gap between the dunes has extended to approximately a kilometre.<\/p><p>The concern must be for the back lands where the sea has invaded.

As he has highlighted, we had a very difficult week or two, with storms ravaging parts of the western counties, especially Galway, Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Cork and Mayo.  I know there is a Senator from Galway here and Waterford was also affected.<\/p><p>The Senator is aware that the Cabinet considered the matter yesterday and the initial assessment from the affected counties is that &euro;65 million will be needed to repair some of the damage, of which &euro;35 million relates to a variety of issues around coastal works.  My Department has written to all the city and county managers advising them of the minor works schemes that we run in our Department, with funding of up to &euro;500,000 provided for flood defence schemes of a minor nature.  Anything beyond that is clearly on a larger scale.  We have written to managers and changed some criteria to make it easier to make applications.  I publicly gave a commitment - which I repeat tonight in the House - that when we see those applications come in from local authorities we will prioritise the counties that have been worst affected and see if we can quickly get money to these areas.<\/p><p>The first priority for us is to repair damaged flood schemes, as many parts of the western counties had flood schemes in place that have been damaged.  The priority has to be to repair the damaged schemes as quickly as possible.  It is still relatively early in the winter and there are difficult weather days before us.  The &euro;45 million allocation is for the whole country and we must wait to see the full scale of applications that will come to us.  As I stated last week, it is inevitable that more funding will have to be found to deal with repairs.<\/p><p>The Senator raised the specific case of Rossbeigh.  Consideration must be given to the fact that coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process.  Although it may have an adverse impact on coastal communities and infrastructure, it can also have beneficial effects, such as providing natural nourishment and a supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.  Due to the considerable extent and nature of the Irish coastline affected by erosion and the fact that it is an ongoing natural process, it is clearly not feasible from an economic or practical viewpoint for the State to protect all of this coastline.  Any approach toward addressing problems of coastal erosion must be informed by an assessment of the risks involved.  The Government recognises this and is taking active measures to assess and monitor the risks of coastal erosion.<\/p><p>The Irish coastal protection strategy study, which is a major examination of this matter, is effectively complete, and this will provide invaluable and essential information.  That strategy is providing an entire mapping system for the national coastline, which is a very important element in the proper management of the coastline.  The Office of Public Works is currently undertaking a series of catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, studies, which also feed into the issue of coastal communities.  The CFRAM assessments are supported by the collection of data under the programme following flood events to identify areas and numbers of properties flooded, flood depths and mechanisms, etc.<\/p><p>There is a tendency sometimes to assume that problems such as coastal erosion require fixing, usually through engineered solutions.  These interventions are usually very costly in terms of both initial capital and ongoing maintenance costs.  However, it is important to stand back and look at the problem in the round.  For example, the European Commission study entitled Living with Coastal Erosion in Europe, completed in 2004, highlighted some important findings, including the fact that some previous interventions, while solving erosion problems locally, exacerbated coastal erosion at other locations.  This study also highlighted the concept of &quot;coastal squeeze&quot; which occurs in low-lying and intertidal areas which would otherwise naturally adjust to changes in sea level, storms and tides but cannot do so due to the construction of sea walls.  The outcome can often be a gradual loss of amenity beach and habitat.<\/p><p>To conclude, I assure the Senator that I am fully aware of the coastal erosion issues at Rossbeigh.  I was there some years ago with a colleague of the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500047#BBB00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1389815700,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Only a year ago, I would say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500047#BBB00600","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1389815700,"counter":624,"content":"<p>That is right.

The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, is very welcome.  I thank him for coming to the House.  We are following on the theme of the recent storms but focusing on a different element of what took place.<\/p><p>I spent much of the past week or so walking the highways and byways of Connemara and Galway looking at the damage, which in many cases was devastating.  One issue that came to light is the situation in which small fishermen find themselves.  I spoke to people who are in their 80s who said they had never seen anything like the damage that was done and the type of storm we saw in recent weeks.  Among the casualties were fishermen, some of whom had their boats and pots well away from the pier but they found that even that was not enough to protect them.  Their boats have been damaged, gear has been lost and engines have been damaged.  In a number of cases, slipways and piers have been badly damaged.  The extent of the damage to the infrastructure of the piers will not be apparent for a number of weeks or months.  Structural engineering audits of piers must be carried out to see whether damage has been done to their bases.<\/p><p>Much of the focus to date has been on the response of county councils, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the OPW among others.  Fishermen find themselves in a much more difficult situation.  Small fishermen in particular have been finding it hard to make ends meet.  A joint Oireachtas committee compiled a report on fishing and a group visited the island of Inis O&iacute;rr in County Galway.  One of the main findings of the report is that more support must be given to smaller inshore fishermen with boats under 10 m.  Many of those fishermen have found their livelihood is in serious jeopardy because of the damage done to boats and gear.  The gear of a small number of fishermen has been severely damaged and their livelihood is in jeopardy.<\/p><p>Could the Minister of State indicate whether an emergency fund is available to help reinstate the boats, gear and lost pots due to what has been described as a perfect storm?  The swell, full moon and spring tide all came together in conjunction with the wind to do untold damage.  In most cases the fishermen do not have the financial wherewithal to cover the cost of replacing their gear.  Last year when there was a fodder crisis the Government was rightly able to introduce measures to alleviate the pressure on farmers.  Small fishermen are in an equally bad position.  If they do not get help they will not be able to resume fishing.  That is the bottom line.  We need to keep as many men as possible fishing in their boats on the sea.  I hope the Minister of State will have positive news for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500048#CCC00700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1389816300,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue and giving me an opportunity to come to the House to discuss the matter.  At the outset, we must look at the variety of impacts the storms have had on the fishing industry and coastal communities.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, along with all his colleagues in government, are acutely aware of the ferocity of the recent storms combined with the exceptionally high tides which in combination have resulted in widespread damage right around the coast.  A critical impact of the storms for fishermen has been the damage to vital pier and harbour infrastructure, which the inshore fishing industry depend on to carry out their work safely and efficiently.<\/p><p>Since the storms occurred, the Minister has been actively assessing the damage to the many small local authority piers and harbours right around the coast.  He presented an assessment on the damage to fishery piers and harbours to Government at yesterday's meeting.  He is aware that serious damage was caused to vital public infrastructure in various small local authority piers and harbours and to various navigational lights and beacons around the coast.  He continues to assess the damage and to estimate the cost of repair and will feed the information into the Government's overall consideration of the issue.<\/p><p>The Government, in considering the totality of the impact of the storms yesterday, decided that local authorities need to carry out a full assessment of the damage and the costs involved and should revert to Government in the coming weeks.  The comprehensive assessment will then enable the Government to decide on a fully informed response to the damage that was wreaked on our coastal communities as a result of the exceptionally bad storms.  The Minister is aware of the critical importance of the local pier and harbour infrastructure to the 1,900 odd inshore fishing vessels that provide a backbone to our inshore fishing fleet.  He is anxious that damage to critical pier and harbour infrastructure is addressed as comprehensively as possible and will work through the Department and with the local authorities to achieve the objective.  The Minister is anxious that the repair of vital public infrastructure for the inshore fishing industry is a priority element in any overall Government response.<\/p><p>On the specific issue of Government support for inshore fishermen for losses of equipment or boats, it is useful to recall that there is a range of grant aid schemes already available to inshore fishermen administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  There have been some reports in the media about the loss by some inshore fishermen of their pots.  It is not unusual for inshore fishermen to experience some pot losses through the winter.  The Minister will talk to industry groups in the coming days and endeavour to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.<\/p><p>In deciding on an appropriate response to the situation that emerges, the Minister will have to take account of the fact that EU law limits the options.  The EU requires that any financial assistance provided by Government to the seafood sector must always be considered in terms of what is permissible under EU state aid rules.  It is clear that under state aid rules, no aid may be given for the replacement of any lost or damaged fishing boats.  Aid for the purchase of a fishing boat is only allowed for young fishermen under 40 years of age purchasing their first fishing boat, so no replacement boat is eligible for assistance.<\/p> <p> The European fisheries fund regulation does allow for financial assistance for purchase of pots, but only where the replacement pots provide for more selectivity in regard to by-catch and under size fish.  Any such assistance to purchase fishing gear may not increase the ability of a vessel to catch fish and would be difficult to implement without the risk of breaching state aid rules.<\/p><p>However, while constraints and considerations do exist, the Minister is actively endeavouring to get a full picture of the situation.  When that is to hand, he will be in a better position to inform Government and determine what responses are practical.  I spoke to him just before I came to this House and he stressed that he is intent on doing that and he wants to assure the Senator that he understands the difficulty and will do what is possible, within the law, to try to assist in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500048#CCC00800","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389816900,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for replying to my Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister.

I imagine Europe would be favourable, because the numbers are minuscule.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Minister will talk to industry groups in the coming days to endeavour to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.

The issue relates to retailers with sizeable buying power and their ability to compete unfairly against small individual retailers.  This issue was highlighted over Christmas in the case of below-cost selling of vegetables and fruits by some retailers.  Some retailers in my town point out that they cannot even buy at wholesale prices from suppliers for the same price at which multiple chain retailers can sell the same product.  This below-cost selling may sound like a good idea for consumers, but as we know from our experience of the below-cost sale of vegetables over the Christmas period, the multiples are able to sell below cost and squeeze small suppliers and retailers out of the market.  Then, when the multiples have got rid of the competition, they can charge whatever price they like.<\/p><p>This practice occurred many moons ago in regard to the sale of petrol and gasoline in the United States, to the point that monopolies were created.

However, the practice to which the Senator referred, of predatory pricing, as it is known, where dominant players seek to use price cuts to eliminate another competitor, is entirely illegal and would be in breach of our competition law.  This applies to a specific situation and requires us to establish dominance and the fact that it is predatory.  Much of what happens in the market is that opportunistic pricing strategies are pursued for a short period on a certain product.  This is not illegal and it would be difficult to see that it is damaging to consumers' interests.

At times, suppliers feel they are in a weak position and that unfair conditions are applied or contracts are changed without notice.  I propose to use statutory powers to introduce regulations that will define what practices must be pursued.  The merged competition and consumer authority will be the enforcement agency in that regard.  Inevitably, one must prove that such breaches occurred and regulations still require the onus of proof.  Over the years, there has not been much evidence offered in this area and there have not been complaints of the practice of which the Senator complained, predatory pricing, brought to the Competition Authority.  <\/p><p>We propose to introduce fair rules in this area.  An attempt was made to introduce a voluntary code of practice, but it did not gain much support.  Under the programme for Government, we are bringing in statutory regulations and they will be enforceable.  This will come before the House shortly as we are finalising the drafting of the Bill.  Hopefully, it will be approved by the Government and brought to the House in the near future.  The issue covered in the Bill is slightly different to that of selling below cost.  In the case the Senator highlighted that occurred over the Christmas period, there was a dispute as to whether the retailers were absorbing all the costs themselves or putting a squeeze on their suppliers.  Putting the squeeze on suppliers is the area that will be regulated, but retailers can still choose to sell at whatever price they like, once they are not engaging in either predatory pricing as a dominant player, which would be illegal, or breaching the regulations we will introduce in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011500049#DDD00800","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1389816900,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for not reading his entire speech.  The abridged version was more welcome and is appreciated.  I welcome the fact regulations are being introduced in regard to suppliers and protecting them.  My concern is that small retailers just cannot compete.  When a supermarket can sell a litre of coca cola at a price at which the local retailer cannot buy it, this is a problem.<\/p> <p>It is up to the industries themselves, the small retailers associations and the suppliers groups to encourage their members to use the instruments available to them when this law is introduced to tackle those uncompetitive and unfair practices.  If they do not blow the whistle on such practices, there is nothing the Minister or anyone else can do about it.
