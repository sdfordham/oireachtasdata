I appear before this committee on a purely voluntary basis.  I will, of course, co-operate fully with the inquiry in so far as it is legally possible for me to do so given the issues that have been the subject of correspondence between my solicitors and the committee.  I've already submitted a detailed witness statement which addresses the lines of inquiry as requested by the committee.  This opening statement deals with the issues set out in that written statement.  I prepared that statement on the basis of my recollection and the limited documentation available to me.  My statements were prepared without access to information and documentation from the society which has not been available to me since my retirement in April 2009.  I will confine my opening statement to a summary of some of the evidence given in my statement, together with some relevant comments.<\/p> <p>  The society's motivation for entering the commercial property market was the shortage of housing in Ireland in the early '90s following the extended downturn in that market in the '80s.  The explanatory memorandum issued with the Building Societies Act 1989 encouraged building societies to get involved in residential development and provided specifically that building societies should be a \"major source of funding for housing by investing directly in residential development\".  Following the entry of Bank of Scotland and the other foreign-owned banks into the market in 1999 it became increasingly difficult for the society to compete in the residential loans market.  Their entry resulted in a period of intense competition, with all major lenders taking steps to protect and increase their market share, sometimes irrespective of price considerations.  In addition, the brokers who controlled up to 50% of the market were predominantly aligned to the larger financial institutions.<\/p> <p>  It was decided by the society for good commercial reasons that it would off ... not offer 100% home loans as a matter of policy.  Such loans were only provided by the society in exceptional circumstances.  For the same commercial reasons, the society also refused to introduce tracker mortgages.  We did not engage in self-certification of income mortgages or expand into the sub-prime lending market, and for some time resisted the term extension of loans to 30 and 35 years.  The society also refused to lend at margins of 1%, which at that time was a prevalent practice in the market.  In this prevailing climate, it was difficult for the society to grow its residential loan book.  I would note that our fellow building society, the EBS, had 90% of its loan book in residential lending and it was not saved from the effects of the economic collapse as house prices fell nationally by up to 60% following the crash.<\/p> <p>  In 1995 the society came to the conclusion that building societies as stand-alone institutions had no long-term future and that the best option for the society was to seek a change in section 102 of the Building Societies Act 1989 which would enable it to effect a trade sale, thus realising the full value of the society for the shareholders.  The enabling legislation was finally passed in August 2006 after ten years of unnecessary and inexplicable delay.  The desired sale did not materialise for reasons detailed in my opening ... in my statement.  Once it became apparent that we would not effect a trade sale of the society in the short term, I reviewed the society's position in the market and decided to downsize its balance sheet, reducing its commercial loan book, and from September 2007 I began taking appropriate steps to do so.  I'd every expectation that this would achieve a significant reduction in the society's exposure based on the premise that in excess of &euro;5 billion of the loan book was due to mature in 2008.  At this time the society accepted the market consensus that in the event of a downturn in the property market, a soft landing scenario would apply.<\/p><p>Under this scenario, it was anticipated that a fall in real property values of around 20% would occur over an extended period.  The society would have, at this time, welcomed such a development on the basis that it was in the interests of a more stable market.  We were influenced in our views by the forecasts and commentaries arising from successive reports by the Central Bank, the IMF, the OECD, the EU, the ECB, the Department of Finance, the EIB, the World Bank, the ESRI and the NESC.  In addition, all the economists in the banks, stockbrokers and academia were of the same view.  Indeed, this consensus view appears to have been prevalent in every one of the 69 countries affected by the crash.  In addition, prior to the general election of May 2007, all major political parties were seeking to increase spending, and indeed some campaigned on the basis of a proposed reduction in taxation.  It was clear that parties on all sides of the House expected that the revenues from the property market would continue to accrue to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> The financial crisis which preceded the property crash originated in the US on the back of the sub-prime debacle which caused the banking crisis in which the rating agencies played a major role.  A range of powerful institutions which went bust or had to be rescued or nationalised, such as Washington Mutual, AIG, Merrill Lynch, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and, in April 2008, Bear Stearns.  On 26 September 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman's caused the collapse of the liquidity market in Europe and in the United States.  As David Doyle, former secretary of Finance, said in his evidence, and I quote: \"Lehman was the killer\".  If Lehman's and, to a lesser extent, Bear Stearns had not been allowed to fail in 2008, then things may have been different and the ultimate extent of the crash may have been somewhat moderated.<\/p><p> I reiterate, for the reasons outlined in my statement to the committee, that the society was not insolvent on the night of the guarantee.  No individual financial institution could have prevented the property bubble in Ireland.  The only entities that could have acted to prevent the property bubble were the regulator, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance or the Government.  The ECB, who had the powers to compel the Central Bank to take any necessary action - sorry, the ECB also had the powers to compel the Central Bank to take any necessary action.  However, none of them chose to do so.<\/p><p> The losses from property lending incurred by the banking sector in Ireland were not just confined to Irish institutions.  The foreign-owned banks, namely, Ulster Bank, Bank of Scotland Ireland Limited, ACC, Danske Bank and KBC, all incurred significant losses estimated to be collectively in the region of &euro;40 billion.  The Building Societies Act 1989 states that it shall be the duty of the auditors to carry out such investigations as will enable them to form an opinion on whether the society has kept proper accounting records and maintained satisfactory systems of control of its business and records and systems of inspection.  Where the auditors are of the opinion that the society has failed to keep proper accounting records or systems of control, they shall state so in their report.  The committee should note that since their appointment as auditors of the society, KPMG, in each and every year have expressed satisfaction that the financial statements of the society correctly showed the financial position of the society and that proper books of accounts and records have been kept and that the directors had established and maintained reliable systems of control and, accordingly, issued full audit reports - full unqualified audit reports.<\/p><p> I do not accept that the NAMA valuations provided an accurate assessment of the value of the society loans.  The extent of the losses attributable to the society on the back of the NAMA valuations of the society's commercial book is an issue which is in dispute.  It is, in my view, that NAMA exceptionally discounted the society's loans in the absence of any, or with little credible, challenge to their valuations.<\/p><p> On 23 May 2012, in its address to the chartered certified accountants in Galway, Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of NAMA, said that having completed the due diligence of the property portfolio and having assessed the property portfolio in more detail, NAMA's view was that the assets had more potential than they initially had reason to expect.  He went on to say, \"A high proportion of the property assets in Ireland ... are located in or close to counties with large urban centres of population (Dublin and neighbouring counties, Cork, Limerick and Galway) and the long-term prospects for much of this property will be better after the economic situation stabilises.\"  It is a matter of record and fact that the society's Irish commercial properties, including development lands, were located in precisely those locations - in Dublin, Wicklow, Meath, Kildare, Cork and Limerick.  A reference to that is KPMG due diligence report, June 2007.<\/p><p> In the United Kingdom, where the society had the majority of its commercial loan book, with 60% of its lending to the London market, I have identified profits that have accrued or will accrue to NAMA in the region of &euro;1 billion from sales relating to a relatively small number of borrowers.  I am awaiting the receipt of further information and documentation in relation to many other borrowers to enable me to conduct a similar evaluation.  I outline now examples relating to three properties to illustrate my point: property A - NAMA valuation &pound;18 million, realised &pound;200 million, excess &pound;182 million; property B - valuation ... NAMA valuation &pound;12 million, realised &pound;100 million, excess &pound;88 million; and property C - NAMA valuation &pound;165 million, realised &pound;250 million, excess, &pound;85 million.  The total accumulated profit in relation to those three properties amounted to &pound;355 million, equivalent to &euro;443 million.  It must also be noted that at the time when NAMA was calculating the discounts, UK property prices were already on the rise again, particularly in the London area.  The London property market has clearly performed strongly since this time.<\/p><p> I believe the society was a victim of the financial crisis which originated in the sub-prime market in the US, precipitated by the bankruptcy of Lehman's.  However, I accept that the society was a contributor to the resulting property crash that followed by being unable to sufficiently reduce its exposure to the commercially property market, despite having realistic expectations to do so, while the decision of the society to downsize its commercial loan book in September 2007 and despite having diversified geographically its market exposure.<\/p><p> The financial crisis which occurred was in the ... was an event, the occurrence, size and magnitude of which was unforeseen by even the most astute observers of financial markets.  As a result, the collateral damage caused by the collapse was immense for everybody concerned.  Almost all commentators, as already said, accept that the financial collapse was not foreseen and could not have been reasonably foreseen.  In my 30 years ... 38 years with the society, I had, prior to the economic collapse, gone through three recessions and downturns in the property market.  I did not expect the predicted slowdown to be any worse than any of those previous recessions and none of the other market participants did either.  Having built up the society in a competitive, innovative and cost-efficient manner over the years from a business with &euro;20,000 profit and five employees with one branch office to almost &euro;400 million profit and 455 employees with 50 full branch offices, it was an absolute shock and bitter disappointment to me that the society succumbed to such a cataclysmic financial crisis, a one-in-100-year event which caused such huge damage to every element of the nation, both corporate and personal.  I regret very much ... I have and I am continuing to pay the price, personally, as a result.<\/p><p>In particular, I regret it for the society's employees, shareholders and borrowers, who all became casualties of the crisis, and I regret it for the taxpayer and the State, who had to fund the deficit.<\/p><p> Thank you, Chairman.  I am happy now to take your questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Fingleton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Thank you again, Mr. Fingleton, for your co-operation with the direction by the committee to come before us here this morning.

I changed the name to Irish Nationwide and I was instrumental in the appointment of KPMG as auditors to the society.  Over the years, up to 1992, the society ... I built up that society, as CEO, with the full co-operation of our board and I always insisted that the board would be fully involved in the lending process, which was unique - and is unique - among financial institutions.  And during the '80s, we expanded, slowly and conservatively, the development of the society, particularly in the home loans market.  But in addition, we also did small ticket commercial loans for shops and individual offices, for farms and even for small developments and building construction.  I think we have ... we had about 10% of our book in that area of the market.  And in 1992, following the change in legislation, we took advantage, if you like, of the encouragement, as I've explained earlier, of the legislation which enabled the societies to engage in development and construction of housing.  And we were encouraged, as I said, to do it and I quote, \"[that] building societies should be a major source of funding for housing ... by investing directly in residential development\".  That was the purpose of the Act and the genesis of the Act in relation to that area.

In the early '90s, I think it was '91 or '92, I looked at my pension fund and the value that accrued on that fund.  It was managed by an outside insurance company - an outside fund - and I discovered that if I had invested all the contributions in the lowest deposit account or the lowest paying deposit account operated by the society at that time, that would have produced more than what was produced by the insurance company in the fund.  So I agreed with the society at that time that I would manage my own fund and I would invest the contributions that were provided by the society in that fund.  So I made the decisions from that time on what to invest in and the fund was, of course, administered by the trustees of that particular fund.  So that's the genesis of where it started and originated.  And over the years the fund built up to almost &euro;30 million based on my decisions on what to invest in.<\/p><p>And when the fund matured and when the retirement came, as I said, there was &euro;30 million in it, &euro;30 million in it.  Now the net cost of that, Deputy, to the society - booked it in a public document that doesn't appear to have got great circulation - was in my view almost nearer to &euro;3 million than what the experts said was nearer to &euro;4 million.

I know you're pressed for time so I'm not going to repeat my statement in full, but obviously I'm more than happy to cover any aspect of it.  As the Chairman has indicated, my career and background is in finance and public service.  In 2001, I agreed with the board and the Central Bank to become non-executive chairman.  The purpose of my appointment was to help the board oversee a sale of the society under legislation which was agreed by the authorities and which was to be implemented the following year.  Accordingly, I expected my role would be relatively short, circa two years.  When the authorities failed to deliver that legislation in 2002, the Central Bank and subsequently the Financial Regulator required that I stay <i>in situ<\/i>until the sale could be completed.<br\/><br\/>Every single year, the authorities, be they the Central Bank, the regulator, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment, and the relative Ministers, promised they would deliver the necessary legislation within the next 12 months.  They failed to do so.  As a result, instead of the expected two-year term, I actually served as non-executive director and non-executive chairman, in particular, for almost eight years, until I resigned in February 2009.  The planned sale of the society is not the focus of this committee.  However, the significant, avoidable delay in implementing the necessary legislation is and was very frustrating.  Implementing it earlier would have avoided any involvement by the society in the banking crisis.  This points to the enormous cost of inaction by the authorities and the policymakers alike, a theme that I will return to.<br\/><br\/>Chairman, I'd like to put on record my acknowledgement of the massive challenges that the collapse of the Irish banking system has imposed on the Government finances and the citizens of Ireland.  Many families have suffered from both the collapse in the property market and the era of austerity that has followed it.  Mistakes were made by all financial institutions.  Irish Nationwide was no exception.  However, in my view, by 2006-2007 it would have been impossible to completely avoid the damage from the global credit crisis.  While the damage could have been mitigated, we must recognise that the crisis was global; it was systemic.  None of the financial institutions, none of the authorities or the international or domestic economic advisers fully appreciated the significance of the global credit bubble, particularly as it related to property and indeed structured credit.  This was equally true in the US, where both of the quasi-Government finance agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, failed.  The Fed models didn't adequately capture the events and 12 of the top institutions required support.<br\/><br\/>My greatest regret is that we didn't recognise sooner the convergence of factors that led to this global financial collapse and the devastating series of interrelated knock-on impacts for the Irish property sector, the financial institutions and the public purse.  Some of the criticism levied at the Irish financial institutions, including the society, is warranted.  That said, I cannot concede all the points made by those who have criticised the society, often without any real understanding of its model and, furthermore, based on 20:20 hindsight.<br\/><br\/>From the inquiry's perspective, I am deeply concerned that the popular, but erroneous, depiction of the society as being in the poorest financial health of all institutions at the time may hinder both the inquiry and, indeed, the public understanding of the real issues at play.<\/p><p>For example, when the downturn hit, the society had the highest percentage capital of all Irish guaranteed institutions.  Equally, at no stage did the society advocate a guarantee for bondholders.  Because of the society's liquidity position, the society wasn't reliant on future bond issues.<br\/><br\/>You have heard from the managing director, later you'll hear from the finance director - the two key executive directors.  My perspective is that of a non-executive director and I'd like to focus on a few key areas in my opening remarks: firstly, the society's model; secondly, the society's awareness to the changing environment and its actions in the period from December 2007; thirdly, the regulatory authorities - the interaction between the society and them and their powers; and, finally, I'll turn to liquidity and solvency.  I'm going to spend most of my time discussing the society's model, so do not be too concerned if that takes a bit more time.<br\/><br\/>The society's model was different to that of other institutions but it was carefully considered.  Notwithstanding the comments made to date, I believe it was more prudent than that adopted by many of its competitors.  Though it may jar with the popular narrative, the society had a prudent financial model.  Its loan book was much shorter than others, with many of its loans, particularly in the UK, being for less than 18 months.  This was clearly not understood by some of your witnesses.  In the absence of the global crisis, the society would have been expected to be able to realise half its commercial book in 2009.  The average loan duration in September 2008 was 30 months.  Obviously, in perspective, bond issues were typically for five years.  Secondly, the society was very different in terms of liquidity.  It was a net supplier of funds to the interbank market, both before and after the liquidity squeeze caused by the Reuters story.<br\/><br\/>On the night of the guarantee the society had over &euro;3 billion of cash on deposit with other banks.  Unlike others, the society didn't require emergency liquidity or funding and that position should be contrasted with both ILP and Anglo who, as you've been told on a number of occasions, were both about to run out of funds and, in ILP's case, had been requiring ECB funding for about a year.  The society was also different in not competing for unprofitable mortgage business.  Again, as a number of witnesses have testified, a small institution competing for this, at best marginal mortgage business, was ultimately going to have too much gearing and too little capital.  By way of direct comparison, there was only one other stand-alone building society, EBS.  In the period 2003 to 2008, INBS maintained its loan-to-capital ratio always between 10% and 13%.  In contrast in EBS, by 2008 that ratio had fallen to just over 3%.<br\/><br\/>I have just noted - at a balance sheet level - INBS had a strong capital base and its gearing was less than half its peers.  Despite what you might think, it had more conservative lending growth rates than many of its competitors.  In the five years to the end of 2008, the society had a significantly lower lending growth rate than AIB, than Anglo, than Bank of Scotland Ireland and Ulster if you focus on the combined property, construction and mortgage areas, all of which became highly correlated due to the credit bubble and the crisis.<br\/><br\/>In summary, Chairman, the society stuck to its strengths, it focused on its key areas of competitive advantage.  It didn't seek to turn treasury into a profit centre.  There were no exotics, no structured products and money was placed with board-approved institutions.  As a result, in early September 2008 the society had sufficient liquidity to meet all its bond repayment obligations through to the beginning of 2010.  Indeed, but for the global credit crisis, the society would have been sold in late 2007, probably at a valuation between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;2 billion.<br\/><br\/>The society's core business was funding property - its area of expertise.  Ultimately, with the gradual decline in property values, by 2010 many of these loans were non-performing.  However, as is evident from the NAMA transfers, there was no significant difference between the discounts applied to AIB, to Anglo, to EBS and to the society.  In your deliberations, Chairman, you may also want to consider that, for a true comparison and to get a full picture across institutions, you need to examine what would have happened if a policy similar to NAMA had been taken in relation to other categories of loans and not just commercial loans.  For example, in 2009 the mark-to-market loss on much of the new mortgage business which was entered by various institutions in 2006 and 2007 ... the loss on that group of loans would have been similar to the levels experienced in commercial property.  In other words, about 60%.<br\/><br\/>The society failed as, with all others, it didn't anticipate the impact of the global credit squeeze sufficiently early.  This made the refinancing of its short-duration loans impossible.  However, the society wasn't asleep.  It did monitor the economic development and took steps to adapt the business model accordingly.  The society was the first of all Irish lending institutions to anticipate and respond to the changed market circumstances in late 2007.  As non-executive chairman, I believed the Irish banking system was over-exposed and immediate retrenchment was required.  The board agreed and in December 2007 the board decided to reverse engines, cancel the trade sale, decided to minimise lending and to build liquidity.  Immediately after the board took that decision, my first port of call was the regulator.  I was anxious to share both my analysis and the society's actions.  In my analysis, the emerging threats to the banking system in Ireland and elsewhere should have caused concern.  The society was willingly ceding market share to its direct competitors who were, in many cases, also under the control of the regulator.  The decision by the society was taken over nine months before the State guarantee.  Months later, the bank ... the Central Bank and the ESRI were still forecasting significant economic growth for 2008 and 2009.  Indeed, internationally, in June .... July 2008, sorry, the ECB even raised interest rates.  However, despite prompting, the leadership that I felt was required from the regulator never came.  I took the opportunity of a meeting, in early May 2008, with the regulator and his senior staff to relay, both orally and in writing, the need for urgent leadership and, indeed, action to save the Irish financial system.<br\/><br\/>In summary, Chairman, my key messages were, and I quote them directly:<\/p><blockquote>\t[One,] Leadership is required from the Financial Regulator\/Central Bank.  Because of the differing competitive positions between the institutions no consensus will be achieved without the leadership of the Financial Regulator\/Central Bank.<br \/><br \/>[The second key message was on similar enough lines] In the absence of intervention, problems are inevitable as the Irish growth story has been funded by the capital markets and these are no longer available to meet redemptions.  The sooner the intervention the lower the cost. <\/blockquote><p>To this day, I cannot understand why the authorities did not intervene in the markets before the financial crisis broke months later.  The inquiry has heard that the authorities were working on contingency plans but didn't activate those plans until the crisis broke and by then it was too late.  Indeed, I was surprised to hear evidence from a senior Department of Finance witness that the Department appears to have welcomed the immediate crisis caused by the false Reuters story as it gave them, finally, the impetus necessary to begin to take action.<br\/><br\/>I'd like to talk briefly about the society and its relationship with the Central Bank and the regulator.  During my time as non-executive chairman, the Central Bank raised routine issues with the society.  The board took all issues raised by the Central Bank or the Financial Regulator very seriously and I and the other directors - and one in particular, along with myself - maintained very close relationships with the Central Bank and sought to get management to continually enhance systems.  The Central Bank became the society's regulator in 1990.  Under the building society legislation, the Central Bank had much more power in relation to building societies than in relation to banks.  The legislation specifically conferred a duty on the Central Bank to protect both depositors and to protect the stability of the societies.  Commensurate with that duty, the legislation gave the Central Bank the power to do whatever the Central Bank deemed necessary to comply with its duty.<\/p><p>Those powers existed from 1990, and in my experience the Central Bank had no hesitation in using its powers where it deemed necessary.  For example, in 2006 the Central Bank-regulator threatened to remove the society&rsquo;s licence if the society didn't hold an election for a non-executive position on the board.  This threat wasn't made to protect depositors.  It wasn't made to ensure stability.  It was not made in relation to lending.  It wasn't made in relation to controls or indeed any prudential issue.  This threat was to facilitate an individual who wished once again to go forward as a non-executive board candidate.  I believed then - I believe now - that threat was irresponsible, but none the less a clear indication of the powers of the Central Bank and the regulator and its willingness to use them.  At no stage after 2004 did the CB-FR seek to take any meaningful action in relation to lending or lending-related issues.  On the contrary, the regulator approved a reduction in the society&rsquo;s deposit ratio in June 2007, which would have facilitated substantial further lending growth if the society, without any prompting, had not decided to reverse engines.  In summary, contrary to what some have suggested, from 1990 the Central Bank and the regulator had extensive legal supervisory powers to do whatever it deemed necessary to protect depositors and the stability of the societies.  Through their expert inspection teams they had direct access to and detailed knowledge of the inner workings of the society and indeed every institution.<\/p><p> Finally, if I just briefly turn to the liquidity and solvency debate.  Within my statement I have dealt with the issues raised by the banking inquiry in relation to liquidity and solvency.  The society was solvent in September 2008 and there is contemporaneous e-mail traffic which confirms this.  Furthermore, I have attached key minutes of society meetings which took place in March 2009, some time after I had resigned.  The minutes of those meetings record the views in March 2009 of the society's auditors, the society's legal advisers.  Even more importantly those minutes in particular reference the attitude of the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance at the time.  Whatever the situation in September 2008, by March 2009 the authorities had full detail on each organisation, and in aggregate certainly more than any non-executive director in any one institution.  In March 2009, following full consideration, the new INBS board confirmed that the society was solvent.  Chairman, members, thank you for your time.  As I said earlier, I deeply regret that we didn't foresee the market instability at a much earlier stage, which would have resulted in earlier action by the society and potentially other institutions, and a situation where perhaps at least the society, due to the short duration of its loan book, its high liquidity and strong capital base, could have avoided being a cost to the Irish taxpayer.  Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#MM00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for your opening statement, Mr. Walsh.

And what wasn't disclosed in those stability tests, which is actually in his report, that under the stress test No. 2, 88% of the Irish system collapsed.

I think, you know, the unfortunate reality is ... I mean I had believed - and I think I included a paper in part of my statement - I had believed really from, for all practical purposes, the early '90s that small institutions like the society, like EBS, like First Active, could not hope to survive in the long term, given the way the markets were evolving.  So I was clearly of the view that the society should be sold to a larger institution and, you know, my deep regret, that did not happen.  But the only way it could happen was on the basis of legislation.  Now, when I agreed to take on the role in 2001, legislation had, supposedly, been agreed by the Central Bank, by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment.  That legislation should have been implemented then; it wasn't for whatever reason and, unfortunately, the rest is history.  Every single year ... I mean, when that didn't happen in 2002, the Central Bank said they were going to try and put it in as part of the 2003 Central Bank Bill.  In 2003 they said, \"Well, we didn't get it in there but there is a working party now; it's going to get agreement in terms of how things are going to be set up.\"<\/p> <p>  So, I believe the society would have been sold much earlier.  Clearly, the society was going to continue to run its business properly and efficiently over the time period but I think both the board and the management would have expected that it would have been sold much earlier than that.  I think Dr. Nyberg, whoever briefed him, didn't really get a proper understanding.  The society was absolutely focused on getting a sale of the society done, obviously at the best price possible at the earliest opportunity, because that's what it believed was right from the point of view of the society, the point of view of the members and the long-term structure of the markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#RR00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>Mr. Walsh, just on another issue, towards the end of 2009, according to Mr. Stanley Purcell, who comes later in the afternoon, Ernst and Young began an investigation into legacy issues at INBS.

There was also a detailed evaluation done by the regulator in terms of the capital needs.  And on the basis of that and, you know, to use their words, they actually evaluated all of the loans on a cash-flow basis.  So here we have a board saying in, I think it was probably, kind of, April 2010, you know, we have evaluated the cash flows associated with every single major loan that we actually have and, you know, for right or wrong due to the concentration in the book that should have been easy to do.  They came to a view as to what the necessary write-down was.  Now, for some peculiar reason and, you know, I have no idea what it was, the amount of the write-down actually almost doubled between April 2010 and September 2007, or September 2010, sorry, I get my years confused sometimes.  Now, I don't know what actually happened over that five-month period for the board to actually agree to accept prices which were effectively 40% below what they had done as valuations.  I mean, I have looked, obviously, at the NAMA reports, and if I look at say, tranche 1, I see that the society uniquely accepted a valuation which was below the market value of the underlying properties.  I can't understand that, I can't rationalise that but that's what they actually did.  I think it is fair to say that I did talk to my successor on one occasion in relation to a particular project, which probably should remain nameless, but it's actually the largest in terms of what's defined as the spec projects, and his view at the time was that they had an offer which was more than double the price they could actually convince NAMA to accept the transfer at.  Now, I don't know, but I think the view of the board, and I can understand exactly where they were coming from, was, you know, NAMA had been set up, it was Government policy that everything would be transferred to NAMA, and I suspect that the board saw themselves as price takers but, as I say, I'm not an expert on property, I wasn't there at the time, so it is entirely supposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#UU03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1310,"content":"<p>Okay.

The society actually had a very simple model.  You know, it wasn't, you know, a complicated business like, you know, the high street banks - the pillar banks, as we describe them today.  It, you know, was, for all practical purposes, a small building society.  It wasn't trying to offer complicated products.  It was focused on a particular area where it had its expertise.  You know, it didn't have a whole series of, kind of, treasury risk issues, which would have been, you know, potentially, kind of, an issue in some situations.  You know, it was not trying to develop an esoteric set of products to market to its members.  You know, its mortgages were completely plain vanilla.  It was very straightforward and very simple.  I think the point that KPMG are actually making there, which is a completely valid point, is if the buyer who took over the society wanted to actually build, you know, the equivalent of, you know, a high street bank or a pillar bank, then they would obviously have to change the systems to cater for that.  So, while the systems were appropriate for the society, you know, it was clearly recognised that, in the context of an organisation where somebody was going to develop the retail side as opposed to the commercial side, that investment would be required both in the systems and, indeed, in the branch system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#XX00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1380,"content":"<p>We've had witnesses and with ... in documents about who saw this happening and you said that many people didn't.

We recognised the implications of it but it was also clear that there were competitive pressures still going on around the place.  People were trying to actually suggest there was instability around and they were doing that obviously for competitive advantage because if money left the society, it was going to go to one of the larger institutions, but ... or, indeed, Northern Rock, which was actually seen as guaranteed by the UK Government at the time.  But the only way you were going to stamp that out or really get ahead of the curve was actually by the regulator - or not necessarily the regulator; the regulator, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, whoever - actually taking a real role in terms of trying to deal with the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#DDD00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1426,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Walsh.

You know, clearly, the performance of Anglo, which was very public, very successful, but was actually a very different model to the society.  I mean, Anglo was entirely focused on commercial lending from day one.  It had no natural deposit base.  It was highly dependent on, you know, both the commercial deposit base, it was highly dependent on the interbank market, it was highly dependent on corporate bond issues.  So, you know, the society was in a much different situation.  It was much more liquid and had much less gearing.  I mean, the gearing ratio in Anglo is over twice the level it was in the society.  When I talk about gearing, I'm talk about loans to actual capital.  So, you know, they were very different.  But to go back to your original question is, you know, by definition, no one institution can create a bubble.  I think, you know, some institutions have said \"Well, we were out there playing follow the leader, we weren&rsquo;t thinking for ourselves\".  Certainly, nobody was playing follow the leader with us.  The society was, as I say, the minnow.  Over the period, you know ... and the worst of the property crisis obviously was in Ireland ... over the period 2003-2008, I think the society lent a total of about &euro;2.5 billion into the Irish market.

Second thing I am saying to you is if the Financial Regulator or, indeed, the Central Bank had serious concerns in relation to the lending, lending practices or the governance, then instead of actually approving something which would facilitate additional lending, they should have actually rejected it.

In the context of the society, the society was even smaller than First Active, I mean, substantially smaller than First Active.  My view is that if the society had gone out, it would not have really captured any sort of shareholder demand or shareholder interest and it would have been potentially destabilising so I would have thought it was an absolute mistake to actually go out as a small institution into the markets.

The first one is from Vol. 2, page 93, the KPMG report on review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function, \"The existing internal audit function is not best practice ... In particular it lacks the depth of experience necessary to challenge the areas of key risk which include Treasury and Commercial Lending.\"<\/p> <p>  And then in Vol. 1, at page 163, I think, there is a letter from the regulator.  It says that \"the Society's internal audit department needs to build up its experience and training in order to perform reviews of key risk areas which are currently outsourced to a third party service provider.\"  And then similar concerns are raised in a letter from the regulator in 2004.  That is at Vol. 1, page 171, I think.  The quote is, \"The level of resources in this area are deemed to be inadequate ... The FSR has concerns with regard to the level of expertise and experience which exists in the IA function.\"<\/p> <p>  The Financial Regulator also expressed concerns in 2007 echoing, I suppose, their earlier expressed concerns.  Can you explain how in this period, which stretches over exclusively - it's five years when you would have been the chairman of Irish Nationwide - that no apparent success at least appears to have occurred in addressing the issues that were raised by your external auditor, KPMG, and the Financial Regulator with regard to the internal audit function of the building society?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#KKK02100","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1570,"content":"<p>Mr. Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#LLL00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441148400,"counter":1571,"content":"<p>Thank you.  I think, first of all, there were concerns about the internal audit, you know, going way back, which is why all of the non-executive directors actually participated in the audit committee.  There was a letter, which is part of the books there, I think, on 9 December 2004, which actually specifically raises questions in relation to internal audit and actually requires that the society actually outsource the internal audit.  What did the society do when it got that letter?  Obviously, it reviewed it - reviewed it with the board, reviewed it with the executive, also reviewed it with KPMG.  Based on the work that the society did with KPMG in 2005, the society actually developed a risk metrics, audit risk programme and also a, shall we say, decision matrix in terms of what work would be done internally and what work would actually be outsourced.  I think the concern, you know, with Dr. O'Reilly in 2004 initially was that he was concerned that the individual that the society decided to appoint as the internal auditor didn't have enough background or experience, despite that fact that, I think, he had worked with PwC or Craigs or whatever it was in those days for about six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#LLL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1572,"content":"<p>My time is short, and I'm not trying to cut across you, but, in 2008, KPMG were still raising this concern.

I'm going to move to wrap things up.  I just have one question to ask that remains outstanding.  I'll just wrap up with another question and then I'll invite the two final ... the leads in finally, Mr. Walsh, after which if there's any closing comments or remarks that you want to make yourself.<\/p><p>Mr. Walsh, did the level and tone of engagement with the Financial Regulator over the period of 2002 to 2008 cause any concerns at board level?  And I'll just go through just a sample of this.  March 2008, a letter from the regulator.  These are all section 33AK documents, so they won't be coming up on the screen.  Corporate governance arrangements in the society - this is on the first page of it.  Moving on to the next page - I'm just going to give an aggregate of these, okay - concerns raised related to the growth in the commercial loan book.  Then going on to 2004, another letter from the Financial Regulator - the Financial Services Regulator - stressed the need for an increase in the size of the board.  The same report goes on ... the Financial Services Regulator &quot;had concerns for some time with regard to the level of expertise and experience within INBS's Internal Audit function.&quot;  It then goes on as well with regard to the regulatory follow-up and capital adequacy requirements &quot;a significant shift in the nature and risk profile of INBS's business, particularly in the last couple of years.  INBS has moved from being a predominantly and broadly based residential mortgage lender to a commercial property lender.&quot;  And, then, going on to a ... even as far back as April 2002, another letter from the Central Bank talks about corporate governance once more, talks about the audit committee, seven meetings scheduled were adjourned due to pressure of time.  Also, &quot;There are no terms of reference in place for the committee.&quot; ... that's the ALCO committee.  Concerns with regard, again, to commercial lending &quot;that a substantial number of loans represented 100% loan to value[s].&quot;.  That's in the commercial lending.  In home loans, &quot;There was no evidence of stress testing on five of the files examined.&quot;  The same correspondence again talks about &quot;There has been a lack of progress made in implementing a risk-based methodology.&quot;  Then, returning back to 2006, another letter from the Financial Regulator, it talks about &quot;The Society should demonstrate how it [has] satisfied the Internal Audit function&quot; or:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Society should demonstrate how it is satisfied the Internal Audit function now has the expertise to perform its audit of [treasuries].  The Society should consider requesting an external audit [form] to oversee the Treasury Audit. <\/blockquote> <p>It then talks about minutes of close out meetings with auditors and auditees, &quot;The Head of [the] Internal Audit advised that [no] audit close out meetings [were] minuted.&quot;<\/p><p>And Irish Nationwide, again it talks about the inspectors noting that while some basic information in relation to Irish Nationwide Limited is contained in certain monthly reports, such as inflows and outflows, and in the management of accounts, there appears to be no specific discussions of its activities during the period reviewed by the inspectors.  This relates to minutes between May 2005 and April 2006.<\/p><p> Once again - I'll just conclude, there are more pages I could be going through - the terms of reference ... this is to do with the credit committee.  The terms of reference of the credit committee on page 2 need to be amended as they state that the committee can approve exposures up to &euro;500,000.  However, it is noted that the amounts approved were up to &euro;635,000 and the inspectors were informed that the terms of reference to the credit committee were being amended accordingly.<\/p><p> Mr. Walsh, were the changes proposed at board level to address these concerns of the regulator ... were the changes actually made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#PPP00900","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441148400,"counter":1659,"content":"<p>Were changes made?

You know, the board got permission from the regulator to actually approach Mr. Barron, former director general of the Central Bank, to come on the board.  Now, if one really believes that you are going to invite the Central Bank or the regulator on to the board in situations where they're not happy or you're not happy, or trying to keep anything from them, that would absolutely not be the case.  The society ran with absolute and complete transparency with the Central Bank, with the regulator, and always had a good relationship.  I mean, it was very disappointing when Mr. Barron decided he wasn't going to come on to the board but that was his choice.  The practical reality is if we were trying to fight against the regulator or the Central Bank, we wouldn't have done it.  And just to put the thing in context, when Dr. Power resigned, the regulator got in touch to thank him for all his work and efforts.  When I resigned, they did the same.  So people are beginning to rewrite the history for whatever purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#QQQ00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1664,"content":"<p>Mr. Walsh, this is my wrap-up question to you and then I'll invite Senator O'Keeffe and Deputy Higgins to come in.  Mr. Walsh, this inquiry, in preparing for its public hearings, gathered hundreds of thousands of documents.  For today's hearings regarding INBS, documents from the Financial Regulator's office consistently and repetitively over many years expressed concerns regarding corporate governance, senior management resources, lending expertise appropriate to your business strategy, issues on regulatory reporting and control, lack of experience in the quality of internal auditor resources and so on and so forth.

I mean, from the society's point of view and from the board's point of view, if you get correspondence from the regulator, you actually see it as a menu that you are going to actually use almost as a checklist for things that are going to be done.  Now, you don't take it absolutely on the basis of they're 100% right, you're 100% wrong.  That's not the way life actually works.  You know, there were practical difficulties in some areas and, you know, where there were practical difficulties, you'd actually end up discussing them with ... in my case, I would've primarily been ... kind of, Maurice O'Connell in the early days, or Dr. Reilly or Mr. Neary in the later days.  But you would actually recognise what needed to be done, what could be done.  You also had to recognise where the society was at any point in time.  I mean, I think there was one particular letter that came in, was it March 2007, which was all about, you know, you need to increase your board and your management.  Now, you know, in March 2007, where was the society?  It was actually in the process of being sold.

Anglo Irish, Walsh said, already knew many of Irish Nationwide's clients and had the expertise to manage them.

Having completely failed to prevent the society going mad during the boom, Walsh was now proposing that the state should be prepared to accept every risk taken not only by Irish Nationwide but also by Anglo Irish.

What actually happened, and you know I have actually touched on it already, on the Sunday evening of 7 September I got a phone call from Con Horan.  As I say, I was in the society that evening because of the situation and the fragility of the markets.  Basically, I was meeting at that time with Goldman Sachs and the clear direction from the regulator was that I should organise to meet with Anglo Irish.  That was a direction that I got.  When I say \"direction\", it was a phone conversation; it wasn't a written direction, obviously.  Basically, the reason he was telling me to do that was because they had been looking at a contingency plan, as you know, with AIB and Bank of Ireland that hadn't operated.  Apparently, Anglo had contacted the regulator to say that they might represent a solution.  I was slightly surprised, but nonetheless the regulator wanted me to meet them.  I accordingly organised to meet them the next morning.  Having met them, I did a briefing paper for the regulator setting out the options as I saw them at that point in time.  I met the regulator, discussed that options paper.  I then revised and adjusted that at the regulator's request and submitted it to the Department of Finance.  That paper is in the public domain.  It was released I think at some stage as part of some of - I think - the disclosures in relation to the month of September and the night of the guarantee.  I did not advocate the merger with Anglo.  I certainly didn't advocate any situation where, shall we say, the State would take on the combined liability.  That is a complete misrepresentation of the situation.  What I actually advocated was that the society would continue as an independent entity with whatever changes the Government obviously wanted to make and to continue to operate the policy it had adopted the previous December, which was to wind down the society in a gradual and controlled fashion, which was what I felt was best for the society and best from a national point of view.<\/p><p>Anglo had a different agenda clearly.  They wanted to be seen as the people who were rescuing the system because they had a belief that if they were seen to take over the society that they would be viewed as being systemic.  They were very different to Nationwide; they didn't have depositors.  You know, we had, I think, 180,000 depositors made up of residential, business as well as the commercial.  They were purely commercial.  We obviously had a large deposit book; they didn't have the deposit book.  We had a large amount of liquidity; they were out of cash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#TTT02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1740,"content":"<p>Okay, thank you, Mr. Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#UUU00200","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1741,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

You know, just to reiterate, I do deeply regret the events that occurred and their impact on Ireland but I think the purpose of this committee is for you to actually consider what to do going forward.  Key groups in Ireland saw the problems or foresaw the problems that were coming about.  The stress tests in the Central Bank, you had the NTMA expressing views, even Irish Nationwide was expressing a view in December '07.  The domestic standing group started working in January 2008 to actually generate solutions, possible solutions, etc.  But as everybody here now knows, we ended up in September 2008 without really a clear view of where we were actually going.  And I think, Chairman, you've got to consider what would have happened if we avoided the growth that took place in 2007, even if we only saw the problems at the end of 2006.<\/p> <p>  As a minimum, there'd have been &euro;70 billion less money lent into the Irish market.  I think there was about 100,000 additional mortgages taken out, so additional families actually probably in negative equity today.  Given the results of the stress tests, you would have required every institution, or should have required every institution, to get more capital.  I think you've heard from the former Attorney General, there was no bank resolution legislation actually in place.  That could have been put in place.  It could have helped Europe in place, whatever.  Now, who knows if that action had been taken at the end of 2006 how much less damage could have been done?  And I think that in terms of your recommendations, what you have to think about is how do you actually remove the silo mentality that exists.  I think one of your witnesses said we weren't prepared to share information until September - it took the Reuters story.  I have no idea what the correct solution is but you have to recognise that there would be a very different situation if, at the end of 2006, you had brought together the key players in the public sector and the private sector and actually tried to find out what was the best thing to do for the country.<\/p> <p>  So I think, in terms of you framing your views, your recommendations, you have to think about that.  I said I deeply regret I didn't see the problems much earlier.  If I had, hopefully, I would have taken the right decisions earlier but I didn't.  I apologise unreservedly for that but I think if we want to avoid the same problems occurring again, you've got to think about how you actually avoid that, sort of, silo-type thinking.

I wish to begin by thanking the committee for inviting me to attend to give evidence at the inquiry.  I also wanted to express my sincere regret to everyone who suffered as a result of the demise of INBS.<\/p> <p>  My role in INBS was very diverse and I was engaged in a wide variety of functions on a daily basis.  Whilst I was heavily involved in reporting, treasury, retail deposits, IT systems and compliance, I was not involved in the lending function outside my role on the board.<\/p> <p>  Up to the crisis, INBS was successful.  Profits increased year on year and the society grew accordingly.  During the period leading up to the crash, much of the focus of the society and a huge amount of my time was taken up with demutualisation.  The members hoped to gain a windfall profit from the demutualisation and sale of the society and the board worked extremely hard to put the apparatus in place for demutualisation.  This involved the production, in 2007, by KPMG of a vendor's due diligence report which provided a detailed snapshot of INBS at that time.  The report was provided to the Central Bank.<\/p> <p>  The strategy of the society, including demutualisation, developed over a long period of time.  In terms of lending, as time progressed it became apparent that the residential market was overly competitive and margins were diminishing.  Tracker mortgages, which INBS did not market, were commonplace.  During the years 2004 to 2007, INBS, AIB, Anglo Irish, Bank of Ireland, Bank of Scotland, EBS, Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank lent heavily in the commercial-residential sectors.  All of the institutions suffered extraordinary losses as a result of that lending.  A combination of the availability of funding, low interest rates, increased competition, Government policy - including tax incentives for development - and rising property prices caused a surge in lending.<\/p> <p>  INBS's strategy was to increase lending in the UK.  The UK property market did not collapse in the same way as the Irish market and the London market improved in the aftermath of the economic crisis.  Over 50% of the loan book which transferred to NAMA related to assets outside Ireland.  Consequently, I believe that the INBS assets transferred to NAMA were significantly undervalued.<\/p> <p>  INBS developed a strategy over time which involved lending to clients who had a proven track record.<\/p><p>Towards the end of 2007, it became clear that liquidity was tightening.  The board decided to cease new lending in December 2007 when other institutions continued to lend anew, and this was the right strategy at that time.<\/p><p> By September 2008, INBS's liquidity was coming under pressure due to a credit rating downgrade and an inaccurate report on INBS by Reuters.  The regulator arranged, at short notice, a meeting on Sunday, 7 September 2008 with AIB and BOI to discuss the possibility of the provision by AIB and BOI of a standby facility for INBS.  INBS's liquidity on 7 September was about &euro;3.5 billion and information was provided to the meeting at short notice on liquidity, funding liabilities and the maturity of funding liabilities.  The meeting concluded without any agreement to progress the provision of a standby facility.  Had the matter progressed, any additional information required not brought to the \"at short notice meeting\" would have been provided.<\/p><p> Towards the end of 2009, Ernst and Young began an investigation into legacy issues at INBS.  I gave Ernst and Young every assistance required.  The investigation ultimately led to the initiation of legal proceedings against the \"old board\" for the losses of the society.  IBRC and INBS formally accepted in the pleadings in the proceedings that there was no dishonesty whatsoever on my part.<\/p><p> The proceedings represented an attempt by IBRC to make the directors personally liable for the losses of the society.  A central plank of the claim was the allegation by the plaintiffs that the delegation of powers by the board of the society to Michael Fingleton was excessive.  On legal advice, I joined the Central Bank to the proceedings as a third party because they had approved the delegation of powers to Mr. Fingleton.<\/p><p> Given the extraordinary magnitude of the claim - for up to &euro;6 billion - I entered into a confidential settlement with the special liquidators after a mediation process.  The terms of the settlement are confidential.  I can say that the settlement involved no admission of liability on my part.  I paid a sum personally to the plaintiffs for the benefit of the State.<\/p><p> Separately, the E and Y investigation led to administrative sanctions proceedings being initiated against me by the Central Bank as far back as 2011.  A notice of inquiry was issued on 9 July 2015 and I would ask the committee to be cognisant of the fact that I am the subject of that inquiry, pursuant to which punitive sanctions could be imposed on me by the Central Bank.  I really can&rsquo;t understand how the Central Bank can purport to investigate me in relation to events for which they bear responsibility.  That is the subject of legal proceedings.<\/p><p> I am not aware of any civil proceedings or any administrative sanctions having been initiated against the management of any other bank or building society as a result of the crash.  I can't see how there is any benefit to the public in INBS being investigated and pursued on the double, when institutions which subsist have not been the subject of any serious investigation, inquiry or proceedings.<\/p><p> I will now address areas I have been asked to consider.<\/p><p> Financial reporting and accounting rules.  INBS&rsquo;s financial reporting system was designed to meet regulatory and management information needs.  The system was developed over the years to accommodate new accounting standards and additional reporting requirements.<\/p><p> The new accounting standards reduced INBS's loan loss provisions in 2005, and resulted in low provisioning while the property market remained strong.  In addition, the solvency ratio was boosted by unrealised surpluses in good economic times and then reduced sharply in the downturn.<\/p><p> INBS's business model was commercial and residential property lending to experienced people in Ireland and the UK.  The model evolved over time due to competitive pressures and lower margins in the residential lending market.  INBS's loan book was concentrated and significant amounts of new lending was repeat business with existing customers.  <\/p><p> INBS was funded in equal amounts from customer accounts and the wholesale market.  INBS's treasury function was operated in a risk-averse manner with the emphasis on maintaining safe, readily available liquid assets.  The funds raised on the wholesale market extended the maturity profile of borrowings.  INBS sought to eliminate interest rate and exchange rate risk through swap agreements.  <\/p><p> INBS had sought to enhance the effectiveness of internal audit by recruiting more staff, together with training and improvements to internal audit systems.  KPMG carried out a report on internal audit in 2005.  KPMG also produced a strategic performance review of internal audit in 2008.  INBS engaged Deloitte to carry out internal audits on the IT function, treasury and commercial lending.  Internal audit had a direct reporting line to the chair of the audit committee.  The internal auditor met non-executive directors without executives being present.  Internal audit had a documented internal audit charter which set out the purpose of internal audit, the scope of internal audit work, reporting lines, responsibility, standards and authority.  Internal audit had a documented internal audit policies and procedures manual.  That, Chairman, concludes my address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#GGGG00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Stanley Purcell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1756,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Purcell, for your opening comments and if I can commence questioning and in doing so invite Senator Marc MacSharry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090200002#JJJJ00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1441148400,"counter":1757,"content":"<p>Thanks very much and welcome, Mr. Purcell.
