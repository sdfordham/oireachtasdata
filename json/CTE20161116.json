Project Eagle was the code name given to the sale of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  To date, we have met with representatives of NAMA, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan and his officials, and Mr. Brian Rowntree, a former member of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC.  We have also met three members of the current board and other senior NAMA officials.  We are joined the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as permanent witness and he is accompanied by Mr. John Riordan, deputy director.<\/p><p>Our main witness today is deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA.  Mr. McGuinness has been in his current role since 2007.  His communications regarding NAMA's sale of its Northern Ireland portfolio are of particular interest to us.  He is accompanied by Mr. Mark Mullan.  I welcome the deputy First Minister to the Houses and to thank him for making himself available to the Committee of Public Accounts to assist in its examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off all mobile phones, not just to silence them.  They must be on aeroplane mode, otherwise they interfere with our recording facilities.

As deputy First Minister, my only involvement was a conference call, on 14 January 2014, with the then First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the Minister for Finance in the South, Deputy Michael Noonan, during which Deputy Noonan informed us of his intention to put NAMA&rsquo;s Northern portfolio on the open market as part of a competitive process.  I also attended a courtesy meeting with Mr. Dan Quayle, a former Vice President of the United States, and a Cerberus delegation on 24 September 2014.  This was after the sale.  On 4 June 2015, I submitted an information request to the then Northern Ireland Minister for Finance, Ms Arlene Foster, MLA, seeking detail on how Cerberus, which had acquired the Project Eagle portfolio, was engaging with local businesses and whether the Executive could regulate the approach taken by the firm.  Ms Foster responded to say her officials met Cerberus on a regular basis to emphasise her expectation that borrowers are treated in a balanced, fair and transparent manner.<\/p> <p>  As far back as 2010 the Executive was aware of, and supportive of, the intent to appoint Northern advisers to the NAMA advisory committee but there was no involvement by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minster, OFMDFM, in the individuals appointed, Mr. Brian Rowntree and Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  There was a process in place to take forward the sale.  This process was under the stewardship of NAMA and the Minister for Finance in the South, not the Executive.  Since then, we have all become aware that a number of other meetings and engagements took place involving various combinations of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, Northern Ministers from the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and representatives of NAMA, Cerberus and PIMCO.  I was not aware of any of these engagements.  I learned in the media that Dan Quayle had met with Mr. Peter Robinson, Mr. Simon Hamilton, MLA, Mr. Ian Coulter and others at Stormont Castle on 25 March 2014.  I was also concerned to learn that Deputy Noonan had met with Mr. Robinson and Mr. Hamilton on 27 September 2013 at Stormont, again without my knowledge.  The meeting, which PIMCO confirmed to the committee just last week, involving PIMCO, Mr. Robinson and Mr. Sammy Wilson, MP, in May 2013, also happened without my knowledge or approval.  Similarly, the memorandum of understanding which Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s private office sent to NAMA in January 2014 did not have my consent or approval.  A draft  memorandum of understanding was emailed to my adviser, Ms Dara O&rsquo;Hagan, but I was not made aware of this due to the fact that it was still a draft document with no status.  Had a formal submission been received from the Department of Finance, it would have been subjected to detailed scrutiny by departmental officials.<\/p><p>Economists would have assessed it and legal advice would have been obtained from the departmental solicitor&rsquo;s office and, possibly, the Attorney General given the significance of the matter.  Only when such a document had passed through all these scrutiny and accountability processes would it have been presented to me for consideration.  None of this happened, as no formal submission was received from DFP and the matter was not pursued.  Therefore, the memorandum of understanding, MOU, as sent to NAMA did not represent the Executive&rsquo;s position.  It had never been formally submitted or considered and it was not an Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, OFMDFM, document because it did not have the required joint approval.  It had no status and, frankly, it is not worth the paper it was written on.<\/p><p> It is my view that all of these contacts raise legitimate questions about how the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, NAMA and others were handling the situation, but those are concerns that would need to be put to them.  At the heart of this issue are the allegations made by Deputy Mick Wallace and the claim that the Irish taxpayer was massively short-changed in the Project Eagle sale.  There are very serious questions which need to be answered and I am as interested as anyone in hearing the answers.  I happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111600002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479299400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>We will try to complete this meeting in approximately two hours.

I have no desire to rehash the questions and answers session which took place in the Assembly, the report of which is available for everybody to see.  I would like to focus my remarks on the operations of the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which Mr. McGuinness has occupied for eight years alongside the First Minister, in respect of which some questions have arisen both in terms of what went on in Northern Ireland and in regard to other documentation regarding text messages and so on provided to the committee.<\/p> <p>  My first question for Mr. McGuinness is one already asked of him in Northern Ireland.  Who is Dara O'Hagan?  As I understand it Dara O'Hagan is a former officeholder who I believe works for Mr. McGuinness and has done so for some time.  I think Mr. McGuinness described Dara O'Hagan as an experienced political operative.  Although Mr. McGuinness referred earlier to the MOU document being one that did not have standing and to it being only a draft, it is an important document in the context of what was going on in the Project Eagle process at a particular time and the involvement of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister or, rather, the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  I appreciate the duality in that regard.  I find it difficult to believe that a political party like Sinn F&eacute;in, in which Mr. McGuinness has been involved for 40 years or more, would not be in a position to recognise an important document and disseminate it appropriately.  In regard to it not having come across Mr. McGuinness's desk, I can only take his word for that.  I find it hard to believe that it was not disseminated for assessment to others within the political party of which he is a member with a view to it being brought to his attention because it was a significant document.<\/p> <p>  According to the Hansard transcript Mr. McGuinness said that he pressed the Taoiseach for a dedicated representative on the NAMA board to raise and highlight issues of concern to the Executive and Assembly and that he was presented with information by the Ministers, Deputy Michael Noonan and Sammy Wilson MLA, at bilateral meetings thereafter.  What correspondence or discussion did Mr. McGuinness's office have with the Northern Ireland advisory board of NAMA, individuals in Dublin or the offices of An Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, with regard to the process that was transpiring at that particular time and subsequent to the sale going through?  What was Mr. McGuinness's involvement by way of notification given the opening line of his statement, which I appreciate, was to the effect that he had no involvement in this process other than a phone call?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to a conversation between two staff members in Mr. McGuinness's office with regard to communications between the Offices of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  There was some interesting correspondence, as provided by Deputy Connolly, in terms of communications between both of those offices.  Although the First Minister is not accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, which is not in question, this loan portfolio would have a significant impact on Northern Ireland and the property market there.  Notwithstanding what Mr. Robinson had to say about not receiving an invitation, which I cannot question, I find it difficult to accept, and would welcome Mr. McGuinness's view on this, that the previous First Minister would not submit to attending the Committee of Public Accounts given the importance of this transaction in Northern Ireland, never mind that the discussion is taking place in the Republic.  Perhaps Mr. McGuinness would respond first to my last question and work his way back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111600002#B00300","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479299400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Deputy might need to refresh my memory on some of the questions.  On the Deputy's first question, Dara O'Hagan was a Member of the Legislative Assembly.  She became an adviser in the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  She is a very experienced member of Sinn F&eacute;in.  She is also a doctor and she is very well versed in economics.  It was her view that the memorandum of understanding, MOU, was not something that I as deputy First Minister should sign up to.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has to remember the context of all of this and how we were dealing with it in the North.  The year 2013, when all of this began with a letter from Mr. Sammy Wilson to the Minister, was a very difficult year in the life of the Northern Executive.  The reason for that was because prior to Mr. Peter Robinson going off on his holidays to Florida, I had a very serious conversation with him about moving forward decisively with the Maze-Long Kesh site.  Maze-Long Kesh was to be, probably, one of the finest real estate areas in the whole of western Europe, one that obviously attracted a tremendous amount of attention because of the fact that Long Kesh prison was on it.  The hospital where the hunger strikers died is there as well.  We had an agreement that we would pursue, with the help of funds from the European Union to the tune of &pound;80 million, the construction of a peace building-conflict resolution centre on that site.  My side of the bargain was that I would agree to the move from the Kings Hall of the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society to Maze-Long Kesh.  I kept my side of the bargain.<\/p><p>Mr. Robinson agreed, before he went off on his holidays, that he would go ahead with the construction of the peace building-conflict resolution centre.  After he had been some days and even weeks in Florida, he sent a letter to his MLAs but not to me.  I did not receive a phone call or message to my office.  According to his letter, which found its way to the <i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>, he was effectively reneging on the agreement made prior to him leaving.  That brought about a very bad, even appalling, situation in terms of relationships because it was a gross act of bad faith on behalf of the DUP as a party.  That presented massive difficulties for me, which lasted for a considerable period.<br\/><br\/>The question regarding this process starts with Sammy Wilson, the then Minister of Finance and Personnel.  He never communicated with me at any stage anything to do with the sale of Project Eagle.  In my view, all of his communications were through Peter Robinson.  Sammy Wilson and Peter Robinson are members of the DUP so this was something they kept to themselves very closely.  As a result of that, I found myself at a considerable disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111600002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479299400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Can I interrupt Mr. McGuinness for a second?

I might add that I am not going down the same lines as one of Mr. McGuinness's colleagues in Northern Ireland where the question-and-answer session was not really a question-and-answer session but political point scoring.  I am far more interested in the breakdown in communication and the fact that between the personnel that both he and Mr. Robinson employ, there seemed to be a lack of recognition that notwithstanding what Mr. McGuinness said, this was an important document.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McGuinness said something interesting.  He said that it was not something that was important enough to be brought to his attention.  He said throughout that it was not brought to his attention.  What Mr. McGuinness is effectively suggesting now - perhaps he suggested it previously but not in my presence - is that Dara O'Hagan made a decision that the document, although quite significant, was not important enough to be brought to Mr. McGuinness's attention and that, at the same time, there was a discussion going on in Peter Robinson's office and elsewhere within the DUP effectively to exclude Mr. McGuinness from any discussion of the process, thereby putting Mr. McGuinness in what I would conclude was a very difficult position in the context of the information flow between NAMA, the Department of Finance and the Northern Ireland Assembly.

There are even communications from the Department of Finance and Personnel through Peter Robinson's office that talk about meetings with him.  That does present problems.  We are all here with the benefit of hindsight and thanks to the massive contribution made by Deputy Wallace in making all this public last year.<\/p> <p>  At that stage of the process, there was nothing in my mind apart from the irregularity with which this was being handled due to the bad relationship as a result of the reneging on the agreement and the meetings that were being established.  There was nothing in my head that suggested that there was wrongdoing by anybody regarding what has since transpired - the allegation that &pound;16 million was demanded of PIMCO or indeed the &pound;7 million that ended up in a bank account in the Isle of Man.  All of this was as much of a surprise to me as it was to anybody else.  There were no bad thoughts in my head at the time of this business other than I thought it was highly irregular that the meetings that had taken place were handled in the fashion they were.  I understood it from the DUP's point of view.  Relationships were appalling, which presented a massive difficulty that lasted for quite some time until we reached the achievement of the Fresh Start agreement at the end of last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111600002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1479299400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>In the context of that communication I referenced earlier between Mr. McGuinness's staff and that of Peter Robinson, in September 2013, there was communication between Richard Bullock and Vincent Parker relating to communications between Mr. McGuinness and the First Minister regarding PIMCO.

In his office's dealings with NAMA, its Northern Ireland advisory committee and other individuals, Mr. McGuinness expressed a preference previously for a certain purchaser of the portfolio, which unfortunately fell through.

There could have been a fire sale which could have had a dramatic impact on our economic situation in the North.  From my perspective, whenever we have dealt with this situation in the way we have, all I can do is express my total dissatisfaction with how it was handled.  Quite clearly, if we had been as involved in the process as others were, we would have been more able to have come to our own conclusions about all of that.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the issues raised by the committee that money was lost, I am not making the allegations.  I am quoting an allegation made by Deputy Mick Wallace.  I am not going to get involved in the debate between the Comptroller and Auditor General and NAMA.

Looking at the note of the conference call between Peter Robinson, me and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, it can be seen that I was very circumspect during the course of the meeting due to the fact that I had not been involved in conversations that I knew had to be going on in the background but of which I was not being made aware.  The phone call was one I approached with caution due to a lack of knowledge.  It is not due to any concern about Michael Noonan being involved in wrongdoing or even Peter Robinson being involved in wrongdoing or even Frank Cushnahan or others.  It was just from the perspective of not having the knowledge.  Never at that stage did I cast any aspersions on anybody on that and certainly not on Michael Noonan.

It is like a parallel with his hands-off approach to the sale of Project Eagle.  I find that very incongruent with the role of the deputy First Minister.  With respect to Sinn F&eacute;in, among all the titles that are given to the role of deputy First Minister, in which I am interested, is joint First Minister with Mr. Robinson.  However, this statement takes a very hands-off approach.  I appreciate the difficulties that Mr. McGuinness has had with the DUP and the acrimony that is there, but the gap between the first paragraph in his opening statement and the second one struck me very strongly.  It is a case of his stating that this was nothing to do with him, and throughout the statement he states that it was not his responsibility.  There is an element of cherry-picking in this regard.  On the one hand, he says he knew there were conversations going on and on the other hand, he did not seem to think that it was incumbent upon him to inform himself as to what was going on.  I understand that there were biweekly meetings of the Executive and I do not understand why he did not inform himself at that stage or further question the DUP as to what was going on.  I do not really accept that and I do not think it is responsible for the deputy First Minister, with respect to him, after getting a phone call on 14 January 2014, to have done absolutely nothing, as far as I can see, until 24 September 2014, when he says there was a cursory meeting with Dan Quayle and the Cerberus delegation.  That is not good enough.  I may not be correct but I do not think this hands-off approach helped anybody, least of all the taxpayer, and I think to put the responsibility solely on Peter Robinson is egregious and erroneous.<\/p> <p>  May I ask Mr. McGuinness-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111600002#F01900","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479299400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>May I respond to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111600002#F02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1479299400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111600002#F02100","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479299400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I did not say that it had nothing to with me.

He said:<\/p><blockquote>[...] removing Mr. Cushnahan from the committee before his resignation in November 2013 would have been seen as a very significant and controversial move and one that would have caused tensions in the positive cross-Border political engagement that has served the island of Ireland so well over recent decades.

From being worried about a fire sale, it was suddenly the case - perhaps across the political spectrum, but certainly on behalf of a number of politicians, including the Minister of Finance, the First Minister, etc. - that the Executive was a big advocate of the process that eventually materialised.

I am proposing an amendment to the definition of \"relevant non-guardian\" in section 3 of this Bill, which replaces section 3 of the Adoption Act 2010.  The intention behind this amendment is to ensure grandparents, siblings and others who have played a significant role in the life of a child will be in a position to be considered if that child is being adopted.  It is not difficult to imagine the kind of people who might be affected by this measure.  I am making this proposal because, in some circumstances, the child might have had a better relationship with \"a birth grandparent, siblings, or other blood relative\".  The child's relationship with his or her parents might have been more difficult or potentially abusive.<\/p><p>In such circumstances, the relationship with the grandparent, sibling or other relative may not have been difficult and the relative may have raised the child for a period in his or her young life.<\/p><p>  The amendment does not provide that every person who is a relative should be considered a relevant non-guardian.  I underline that the proposal is very much qualified and an additional three-part test would apply.  The person must be considered to have played a \"formative\", \"active\" and \"beneficial\" role in the life of the child and it is at the discretion of the Adoption Authority of Ireland to make this determination.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that all persons who have had a significant role in a child's life, in accordance with the definition set out in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d), will be considered relevant non-guardians and consulted appropriately. <\/p><p> Amendment No. 2 is related, while amendments Nos. 3 and 11 are consequential.  Amendment No. 2 is relevant because it is important that where consultation does not take place, reasons should be given outlining why a person who could be considered a relevant non-guardian has not been consulted.  It is not necessary to provide a detailed statement.  The reason for the amendments is to ensure that persons who have played a significant role in the life of the child, were part of his or her family and were actively, formatively, positively or beneficially involved in raising him or her would be consulted.  Such consultation can be set aside or not factored in by the authority as it sees fit but such persons should at least be provided with an opportunity to engage in consultation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2016111600002#A01000","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>The Deputy's amendments appear to be reasonable.

I would like to clarify for the Deputy that where such a person has guardianship rights in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) of the definition of \"relevant non-guardian\", they are already encompassed within the definition, and the Bill provides that they must be consulted on the proposed adoption of a child.  Alternatively, these persons may have been appointed as a guardian under the Guardianship of Infants Act and in those circumstances their consent to the adoption must be obtained.<\/p> <p>  Where such a person does not have guardianship rights and responsibilities in respect of the child, he or she may, nevertheless, be entitled to be heard by the authority in the context of an application for an adoption order in respect of the child.  Section 43 of the Adoption Act 2010 Act provides for the hearing of applications for an adoption order and sets out the persons who are entitled to be heard at such a hearing.  The persons entitled to be heard include a relative and any another person whom the authority, in its discretion, decides to hear.

The use of the phrase \"In so far as practicable\" in subsection (2) is not necessary in the sense that the paragraph reads perfectly well without its inclusion.  As such, the inclusion of these five words amounts to an unnecessary qualification of the right of a child who is capable of formulating views to have those views given due weight.  There is no basis for making this right dependent on whether it is practicable.  Usually, this phrase is used in respect of budgetary constraints or administrative difficulties.  In this instance, it is being inserted to qualify what should be considered a fundamental right, namely, the right of a child, where he or she is capable of forming a view and a court is capable of ascertaining what the child's views are, to have his or her view given weight.

The amendments are related.  There is somewhat of a difficulty in having such a sharp cut-off at the age of 18 in terms of whether somebody can be adopted.  The amendment I propose would give the person who would be the subject of the adoption, and the family, some leeway in that regard and that would be at the discretion of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  I do not ask that the removal of the upper age should be considered, although certain provisions to that effect exist in some jurisdictions, for example, France.  It probably seems counter-intuitive to some that adoption should be possible after the age of 18 but it is a long process and in the 2010 Act and some of these provisions there are timeframes involved that result in a situation whereby it might not be possible to conclude the process.  For example, a child could be brought into a family at the age of 15, 16 or 17 and due to the timeframes involved and administrative delays the process might not be concluded by the time the child reaches 18.  That is relevant and important for a variety of reasons, in particular property rights.  If what might otherwise be an adoptive parent were to die intestate that would have serious implications for what an individual might otherwise be entitled to inherit.  Even if the person were to die testate it would mean that the young person would be entitled to much lower tax relief on any inheritance he or she would receive.  It would also make a difference in relation to dependent child allowances and other social welfare payments.  There must be some flexibility.  The sharp cut-off of 18 years potentially creates difficulty for families and individuals who would otherwise be the subject of an adoption.  There must be flexibility to allow for the fact that there might have been some difficulty or delay in processing an adoption after the age of 18 is reached.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2016111600002#C01000","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Adoption is a means of alternative care for a child where his or her family is unable to provide such care.  There are no proposals to extend adoption to persons other than children, that is, to persons over 18 years of age.  Such a policy change would require careful consideration, legal advice and Government approval.  The primary purpose of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill is to give effect to Article 42A of the Constitution in so far as it relates to adoption and the Bill provides for the adoption of any child, regardless of the marital status of his or her parents and that in any matter, application or proceedings under the Adoption Act 2010, before the Adoption Authority or any court, the court or the authority as the case may be, shall regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration in the resolution of such matter, and in respect of any child who is capable of forming his or her own views, ascertain the child&rsquo;s views and such views shall be given due weight having regard to the age and the maturity of the child.  Adoption is a child protection intervention.  The focus of it is to protect a child by providing a secure and stable environment and to provide for the child&rsquo;s safety and well-being during childhood.

The concern does not relate to child welfare or safety.  That is a paramount consideration but it does not mean property rights or entitlements they might enjoy otherwise, on reaching the age of 18, should be set aside.  There is clear potential for that to happen.  The Bill&rsquo;s provisions set out the timeframe involved.  I agree that adoption should not be a simple or quick process but it is entirely possible - I am sure it does happen - that it can be delayed until after the child reaches the age of 18.  In that context there are rights and entitlements to which that adult would otherwise have benefitted if the adoption had been processed and I do not think they should be set aside.  That would potentially make a significant difference to their lives in terms of inheritance, social protection payments, grants and other issues and the situation also has implications for the parents.

It is similar to the first amendment in some respects.  A child may have had good relationships with other members of a family with which he or she previously resided.  In most situations, an adoptive family will probably allow and facilitate access to a previous family, such as the parents themselves, where appropriate and where monitored and managed as appropriate, or grandparents, aunts, brothers or sisters.  That will largely be the case but there does not appear to be any statutory basis for that child to have such access where he or she so desires.  Obviously, this is the entire focus of this amendment and the legislation generally is based on the best interests of the child and the decisions and voice of the child.  What I propose to do is ensure there is some statutory basis so that where it is in the best interests of the child and where that child so desires, he or she can continue to have access to his or her previous family, the family with which he or she lived or grandparents, brothers or sisters and that there is a statutory basis to ensure such children cannot be prevented from accessing those people who are so important in their lives by their adoptive parents who might not know their grandparents or brother or sister.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2016111600002#D03200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I appreciate very much the rationale and concern behind his proposal.  What he says is true.  I will outline why.  Where a child has been adopted, he or she is considered with regard to the rights and duties of parents and children regarding each other as the child of the adopter or adopters.  With respect to the child, the mother or guardian of the child and every relevant non-guardian of the child loses all parental rights and is freed from all parental duties in respect of the child.  That is the law or statutory basis.  Under current practice, however, there are often arrangements in place for ongoing contact between birth parents and adoptive parents and their families where there is agreement among the relevant parties.  In addition, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill will provide that the birth parent and adopted person can enter into arrangements regarding the sharing of information between both parties.

I recognise that the birth parents no longer have any parental rights or duties but I am focusing on the rights of the child.  The child has a past that cannot just be set aside.  The fact that there appears to be no statutory right for the child is an issue.  I am not necessarily thinking of the birth parents but other relatives with whom the child might have enjoyed a better relationship.  If there is no statutory basis for the child to have access, we are relying entirely on good practice and, to an extent, the goodwill of the adoptive parents.  Such goodwill probably exists in most circumstances but it does not necessarily exist.  The adoptive parents may have legitimate fears, concerns and a sense of uncertainty over a person the child might be visiting or a person to whom the child is seeking to have access.  What I propose would have to be managed in consultation with the family and social workers.  The child should have a statutory right, where he or she so desires, to visit or gain access to the family with whom he or she lived previously or relatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2016111600002#E00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":577,"content":"<p>As the Deputy identified, there is no legal entitlement, for the reasons I have already identified.

She has told us repeatedly that another Bill, on information and tracing, is due to be published quite soon.  I tabled the amendment to continue to apply pressure and to ensure the legislation is published, as promised.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide an enabling clause to allow the Minister to develop an information and tracing scheme.  It is not detailed in the way primary legislation would be detailed.  It is primarily designed to ensure that we continue to make the case for something that has long been called for by adopted persons.  I refer in particular to their wish and, I believe, their right to have access to their birth certificates and other information with regard to their birth circumstances and family.<\/p><p>In proposing the amendment, I recognise that the Minister is likely to tell me she will publish the information and tracing Bill soon.  If so, I welcome it.

Their experience should be taken into account in the drafting of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2016111600002#E01500","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan.  I understand and respect her reasons for tabling the amendment.  It is important that she do so.  In light of that, I will give a full response on her amendment proposing an information and tracing scheme.<\/p><p>In response to the Deputy's amendment on an information and tracing scheme, I will say a little about the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill which was circulated to Departments on Friday, 11 November, and will provide a statutory basis for the provision of information on both past and future adoptions.  The Bill is intended to facilitate access to adoption information and operate on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as it is legally and constitutionally possible to do so.  It will provide clarity on the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided.<\/p><p> The development of the Bill has presented complex constitutional and policy challenges in the delicate balancing of the right of an adopted person to his or her identity information, on the one hand, and the right to privacy of his or her birth parent, on the other.  The Bill will provide that the Adoption Authority of Ireland will have overall responsibility for the safeguarding of adoption records, including information on informal adoptions and persons whose birth was incorrectly registered.  All adoption records, currently held in a number of locations, will be transferred to the custody of the authority.  The Bill will provide that the records are to be indexed and a searchable electronic database of the records will be created.  The authority is to ensure all adoption records will be kept in a suitable and secure location, with access to be provided for a person to view his or her own records, where he or she has an entitlement under the Bill.  The Bill will also provides that the concealment, destruction or falsification of a record will be an offence.<\/p><p> The Bill will provide for the Child and Family Agency to operate an information and tracing service.  Where both parties consent, the agency will facilitate contact between the two parties.  It will provide for structured and regulated access to information and tracing services for those affected by adoption, subject to informal arrangements or wrongful registrations.<\/p><p> The Bill will set out the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided for adopted persons, birth parents, adoptive parents on behalf on an adopted child and relatives.  It will also make provision for the release of information to persons who were subject to informal arrangements or wrongful registrations.  A key provision of the Bill is to provide for a scheme under which the information required to obtain a birth certificate may be provided for an adopted person, subject to certain conditions.  A copy of an adopted person's adoption order will also be provided, subject to the same conditions.<\/p><p> The Bill will also provide for information sharing between birth parents and adoptive parents in the case of a child who was adopted where both parties agree.  It was originally intended to include provisions in the Bill for an information and tracing service to be provided for persons who were subject to an intercountry adoption.  However, as work on the Bill progressed, a significant number of policy questions arose.  They require careful consideration in the context of the 1993 Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption.  A detailed analysis of the differing systems operating in sending countries is required.  In addition, it is noted that in many such cases there is little additional information for persons subject to intercountry adoption over and above that in the possession of adoptive parents.  Consequently, the provisions on the provision of information for persons subject to intercountry adoption were removed from the Bill.  I am committed to developing policy and introducing legislation on this discrete matter as soon as possible.<\/p><p> The Joint Committee on Health and Children, in its pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill, examined the heads of the Bill in November 2015.  Following this examination, the committee indicated that there was a strong consensus among committee members that \"the heads of Bill contain a considerable number of positive measures\" and that the Bill would represent an \"important milestone in adoption reform\".  In these circumstances, I respectfully believe the Deputy's concerns can be addressed most effectively by the pending legislation.  A draft of the Bill was circulated to Departments on Friday last, 11 November, for observations.  It is hoped to submit the Bill to the Government on 22 November to seek its approval to publish it.  It will be published on 25 November, subject to Government approval.  For these reasons, I do not intend to accept the proposed amendment.<\/p><p> The Deputy's final point was that representatives of adoptive persons had been invited to express their views during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill undertaken by the committee.  The report put together by the committee made a number of recommendations which had been put forward by stakeholders.  It informed amendments to the general scheme of the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2016111600002#E01600","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I take it the Bill will be published on Friday week, which is not too far away.

As requested I will be brief and stick to the five minutes allocation.<\/p> <p>  The RCSI Hospital Group comprises seven hospitals, Beaumont hospital, Cavan hospital, Monaghan hospital, Rotunda hospital, Louth hospital, Connolly hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes hospital.  It is a single governance construct with five HSE hospitals and two voluntary hospitals incorporated.  The position of the chief executive officer of the hospital group and the chief executive officer of Beaumont hospital are both held simultaneously by me.<\/p> <p>  The RCSI Hospital Group serves a population base of 800,000.  In terms of service provision, the group provides all secondary care services, a designated cancer centre and is also the national centre for neurosurgery and renal transplantation.  <\/p> <p>  I will not dwell on the performance metrics as they are self evident but every single patient modality in terms of activity is increasing.  On every single metric we are looking at about a 10% increase in activity on last year's figures across both inpatients and the emergency department.  The focus for the group this year has been on trying to secure performance improvements in respect of access to the emergency departments.  The metrics are very clear and to date this year we have been able to secure an overall significant volume reduction in the number of patients presenting to emergency departments waiting for beds.  That is continuing as we speak.<\/p> <p>  In terms of elective access, as our emergency department performance has improved, we are in a position as a group to increase the number of patients waiting for elective treatment to be brought in and treated and the figures to date compared with those for last year, show an increase of 2,500 in the number of elective treatments.<\/p> <p>  Our core budget is &euro;676 million and we have a workforce of just over 8,000.  We will break even in terms of our budget.  Our workforce is broadly static in comparison to the end of last year.<\/p> <p>  We have six key objectives as a group.  We want to improve access performance in terms of both emergency and elective access, doing no preventable harm to patients.  We want to operate fiscal prudence and to work in terms of integration in two paradigms - the concept of a single control hospital facility spread across six sites, migrating the capability and capacity demands across the six sites and working strongly to integrate with the community, with particular focus on chronic disease.  <\/p> <p>  The main action of the group beyond improving access has been its ability to treat more patients.  This year the group has been able to treat more patients across the six sites.  We are matching capability with capacity.  A series of initiatives whereby patients waiting in Beaumont hospital for elective surgery are now routinely being treated in Cavan hospital.  Patients waiting for endoscopy are routinely treated in Cavan or Connolly hospitals.  With an ambulatory gynaecology unit on the Connolly campus, there is no longer a need to require patients to attend Beaumont or the Rotunda hospitals.  With the creation of plastic surgery services on Connolly hospital campus, patients therefore do not  need to attend Beaumont hospital.  The concept is to provide an integrated site, whereby Beaumont's role is as a complex provider and Connolly is able to provide a stronger service in terms of simple or non-cancerous surgery.  <\/p> <p>  Likewise we have migrated services to the Louth campus.  The aim is similar to the role of the small hospitals, to ensure we have productive units that are able to undertake simple surgery.  On the flipside, we have moved complex upper gastrointestinal surgery to Beaumont, following in line with the national cancer strategy.  The idea is to transfer patients requiring complex upper gastrointestinal, GI, surgery or cancer treatments to the level 4 hospitals.  <\/p> <p> I will outline the key challenges for the group as we face into 2017.  We face the ongoing difficulty of recruiting and retaining nursing staff.  We have a workforce of just under 3,000 nurses and on average the vacancy rate is 16%.  We have a less than optimal reliance on agency staff.  Also, for the smaller hospitals we have difficulty retaining or recruiting consultant and junior hospital staff, particularly for levels 2 and 3 hospitals.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of integration, we are working in a very hospital centric model.  One broadly has two ports of call for a hospital, either through the outpatient department or the accident and emergency department.  If we look at the fact that of the patients presenting to a hospital, 85% of them will have some form of exacerbation of chronic disease.  We have an overly hospital centric model, whereby more care could be delivered in the community, but the current structure means more care is delivered in the hospital.<\/p> <p>  While there is a good working relationship with community services in terms of the integrated pathway, we have a mismatch in terms of supply and demand, particularly when it comes to community support, which means that at any one time across the whole group, between 10% to 15% of our bed occupancy will be filled by elderly patients predominantly who are waiting discharge to either community homes or needing home care support.  At present about 170 beds are inappropriately occupied.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of funding we face challenges in meeting the income target set by the HSE which will not be achievable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Carter"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carter.

I thank the Committee for the opportunity to speak today.  I am joined by, Dr Pat Nash, group chief clinical director.<\/p><p> The Saolta University Health Care Group was established in August 2013 and comprises one model 4 hospital, Galway University Hospital, UHG, four model 3 hospitals at Mayo, Portiuncula, Sligo and Letterkenny, and one model 2 hospital in Roscommon.  The group has 1,750 beds, employs over 9,700 staff and has a budget of &euro;700 million for 2016. <\/p><p> We are unique in a number of aspects.  We were one of the first hospital groups established originally in 2012.  We are comprised only of statutory hospitals and we provide care to a clearly defined geographical population, that is, over a quarter of the country from Galway to Donegal, a population of 830,000.  We have a strong relationship with our key academic partner, National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, and have recently opened medical academies in Letterkenny, Sligo and Mayo.  The recently opened clinical research facility in UHG is a critical piece of infrastructure which provides the platform to develop new and innovative treatments, therapies and technologies.  We work closely with our community colleagues in the west and north west.  We have close links with Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry and this has delivered tangible benefits to our patients.  The primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, service is now operational and the new radiotherapy service is due to open later this year.  The Saolta group provides a comprehensive programme of cancer care and we work collaboratively with the national cancer control programme, NCCP.  The cancer programme is delivered through the clinical structures from Letterkenny down to Galway. <\/p><p> The basis for the establishment of hospital groups was to facilitate improved patient care pathways by integrating hospitals into cohesive networks.  Our principal objective in the Saolta group is to provide timely access for all our patients to high quality, standardised, safe, sustainable and adequately staffed services in hospitals as close to patients' homes as is clinically appropriate.  To maximise all our hospital sites, we are currently developing an integrated group clinical strategy which will be completed next year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but there is phone close to the microphone which is causing interference.

To enhance our governance structures, we are developing a clinically led cross-site governance structure which will improve patient care and outcomes.  A non-statutory board, which had been in place for the past four years, has recently come to the end of its term.  A process is ongoing to appoint a new chairman and board.  Although non-statutory, the board took responsibility for ensuring that the group was achieving its objectives and effectively managing its resources and maintained a strong emphasis on patient care and safety.<\/p> <p>  As a group, we face a number of key and inter-related challenges.  Access is the single biggest challenge in our group, especially in UHG where our emergency department is not fit for purpose.  It is too small and outdated and it is an ongoing challenge to manage the large numbers attending daily.  Attendance at the department averages 180 per day and up to 240 on some days, making it one of the two busiest emergency departments in the country.  This results in unacceptable delays for patients. <\/p> <p>  The development of the hospital group has added to capacity challenges in Galway due to the change in the referral flow patterns from other hospitals in the group to Galway.  A key element of our clinical strategy will be ensuring the bidirectional flow of patients.  This will involve the transfer of non-tertiary care from the Galway site to other sites in the group which will free up capacity on the Galway site.  This is currently happening in plastic surgery and endoscopy in Roscommon and in other surgery services at Portiuncula.  We are also actively working to implement the clinical care programme pathways and have seen significant benefits from an investment earlier this year in a new acute medical unit in Galway.  There are also developments required in other sites particularly in Sligo, Mayo and Portiuncula.  Further investment in infrastructure will ensure that we can sustainably address the unacceptable delays in access to urgent inpatient and outpatient care. <\/p> <p>  Galway also requires additional inpatient bed capacity to meet its dual requirement to provide timely access to tertiary services for the group while providing secondary care to the people of Galway and Roscommon.  A new 75 bed ward block is due to open in 2017.  This comprises mostly much needed modern replacement beds, but will provide 15 new beds and additional surge capacity in the vacated older wards.  Galway urgently needs a new emergency department but there is also a requirement to look at a long-term solution for acute hospital services in Galway and consider the future development of the hospital.  Ultimately, the physical constraints presented by the UHG site mean that plans for developments into the future must include a new hospital on a site such as Merlin Park. <\/p> <p>  Our inpatient, day case and outpatient waiting lists present an ongoing significant challenge for the group across a number of specialties and sites.  Galway University Hospital, GUH, accounts for approximately half of the group&rsquo;s waiting lists.  We are implementing a variety of measures to reduce the numbers of patients waiting and the length of time they wait, including validating existing lists, moving activity between hospitals, running additional clinics, new appointments to key specialties and the development of health and social care professionals and nurse-led clinics. <\/p> <p>  The recruitment and retention of skilled nurses, particularly theatre nurses, remains a challenge for all our hospitals and is currently significantly reducing our theatre capacity, especially in Galway.  The recruitment of consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, remains a challenge mainly in Letterkenny and to a lesser extent in Sligo and Portiuncula.  We face a number of information technology, IT, challenges and we currently do not have an integrated patient administration system, PAS, or integrated patient care record across our hospitals.  This is key to facilitating safe and effective care.  We have developed an IT strategy to address this which will require significant investment.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, the Saolta group is well established with a strong governance structure.  Our hospitals work closely together and there is an eagerness to fully integrate our services.  Our clinical strategy will help facilitate this together with the implementation of our integrated clinical governance structure and an integrated IT platform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Power.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Paul Burke, chief clinical director of UL Hospitals Group.  I will confine my opening remarks to the following themes: positives of groups; governance and organisational reform; vision; the integrated model of care; quality and safety; and the future of health.<\/p> <p>  UL Hospitals Group was one of the only two hospital groups to be put in place with a functioning board.  We support the concept of a network of hospitals working together as one virtual delivery model for the population of the mid-west, an arrangement that has worked with increasing success.  We have robust governance structures and a defined policy on safe care in the correct settings, underpinned by the smaller hospitals framework.  We also have close and strong links with the University of Limerick driving medical, nursing and health and social care education as well as a fertile research agenda which will be further enhanced by our new clinical education research centre on the University Hospital Limerick site. <\/p> <p>  For four years we have worked closely with our board which has brought valuable and enthusiastic expertise, oversight, vision and advice on the UL hospitals development and plans.  We are coterminous with our community health organisation, CHO, and engage continually with the CHO to improve patient care and outcomes.  The fact that the geographical area  covered by the CHO and UL Hospitals Group is identical provides an ideal basis for implementing policy and procedure. <\/p> <p>  The future of health care requires a governance model and leadership approach to deliver collectively on organisational reform.  The fundamental question in the hospital service is the optimal numbers and configuration required to develop an efficient and effective service.  The smaller hospitals framework has clearly defined model 2 services, but model 3 hospitals would benefit from a similar framework to ensure the range of services for acutely presenting patients is defined and supported. <\/p> <p>  The governance structure at UL Hospitals Group is unique and is based on a small management team in four directorates responsible for all sites rather than hospital specific managers.  This single clinical governance across all sites is key to providing operational expertise and guidance on service delivery and has been shown to be highly satisfactory in terms of increasing efficiency, improving services to individual patients and reducing delays.  Performance measured against quality, access, finance and resources is driven via directorate structures managing vertically across six sites.  Our structure fits neatly with the Department of Health and the HSE&rsquo;s accountability framework. <\/p> <p>  Our vision for future health is articulated in our submission paper but I will outline some priority areas now.  We must define funding models to develop CHO areas to create hospital avoidance strategies because community delivered care is more beneficial to patients who do not require expensive hi-tech, high speciality hospital settings.<\/p><p>We must extend clinical care programmes and tight communication systems to include formal dialogue with general practitioners, GPs, on opportunities and protocols.  We must progress the commissioner provider model and base decisions on service delivery relating to demographics and population health.  We must continue to increase IT funding to address the gap currently in the HSE service.  We must also establish bed capacity to inform ten year development plans. <\/p><p> The hub and spoke structure of the UL hospitals network, along with an identical catchment area for community health services, means that the UL Hospitals Group is in a unique position to provide an integrated model of care between our acute service and the community.  That parallels the continual improvement of our specialist and emergency services at our model 4 hospital, University Hospital Limerick, UHL.<\/p><p> Clearly, the relationship with GPs is critical in determining how this integrated model of care continues to develop.  We believe our model 2 hospitals in Limerick city, Ennis and Nenagh must provide support to our GPs at a local level, while helping to avoid admissions to UHL for less complex conditions.  Increasing professional dialogue and communications with our GPs are among our top priorities.  We are trying to ensure that GPs would have easy access to diagnostics and specialist outpatient department, OPD, services in the local hospital, which would link closely with the specialist supports in the community.  In this co-ordinated way, people can receive the care they need in the most appropriate place, be it at home, in the community, at the local model 2 hospital and, hopefully, less often at the model 4 hospital.  This is consistent with the HSE&rsquo;s policy on prevention and management of chronic disease within an integrated care programme. <\/p><p> In using this local model, we are not only avoiding prolonged travel and access difficulties to our larger hospital but we are also reducing the burden on relatives and others, entrusted with the care of elderly patients.  This model has huge social and economic benefits to the community.  Additional medical specialty development at UHL in areas such as dermatology, rheumatology and neurology has meant more of these services being provided at the local hospitals, something that many would not have envisaged ten years ago. <\/p><p> Quality and safety was the driving force behind the centralisation of acute surgery, critical care and cardiology services six years ago, and all our clinical data is now processed through NOCA, the National Office of Clinical Audit.  Our model of care for acute surgery was one of the first recommended by the national clinical programmes.  Our cardiology service provides one sixth of the national PCI service for acute heart attack and we are also providing an acute stroke service through a newly built stroke unit, developed incidentally with the support of a number of voluntary agencies in the region. <\/p><p> Looking to the future, we envisage that with centralisation of our maternity services onto the main university hospital campus and with our favourable road infrastructure the UL Hospitals Group is likely to find itself serving more of the surrounding north Munster region. We undoubtedly need urgent expansion of our hospital bed capacity to cope not only with current demand, but with the change in hospital demographics that will inevitably evolve in the surrounding regions over the next decade <\/p><p> Our close relationship with the University of Limerick is of huge importance in improving standards of care, fostering education, clinical research and innovation so that the hospital complex is rapidly developing to become a major national centre for high quality as well as a major educational resource for the people of the region that we serve.  That concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Cowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cowan and all the witnesses for their presentations and for their brevity.

I would like to direct my questions to Dr. Pat Nash, clinical director of the Saolta group.  University Hospital Galway has been frequently on code black and a maximum capacity protocol has been implemented on a number of occasions recently.  As stated by Mr. Power in his opening statement, the Saolta group provides care for 830,000 people within the catchment area.  Will Dr. Nash advise how the designation of University Hospital Galway as a centre of excellence has affected the hospital?  It is the only model 4 hospital in the stretch of area from Donegal down to Limerick.  I am shocked in that I believe it has had an adverse effect on capacity at that hospital, notwithstanding the exceptional expertise of the staff working there.  Will Dr. Nash comment on the average length or rate of stay at the University Hospital Galway compared to other model 4 hospitals across the country?  I understand it is better than most, which would be a positive reflection on the hospital's doctors, nurses and other staff, and would prove to me that there is a capacity issue.<\/p> <p>  An amount of &euro;109 million has been spent on capital investment at University Hospital Galway during the past ten years but it has led to a reduction of approximately 157 beds in that period.  As a clinician working at coalface, can Dr. Nash advise how that has impacted on the day to day running of the hospital from the point of view of the patient and his colleagues?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Power referred to the Merlin Park site and need for a new acute hospital in Galway.  This is a site of approximately 150 acres of State-owned land.  I am aware that over the years beds have been moved from Merlin Park Hospital to University Hospital Galway, and some have disappeared altogether.  In hindsight, does Dr. Nash believe that has been a retrograde step?  Does a new acute hospital have the support of senior clinicians at University Hospital Galway?<\/p> <p>  Over recent weeks and months, this committee has had many discussions on community care, the need for primary care centres and how that would take pressure off hospitals across the country.  It would be important to get the Dr. Nash's view on that in regard to the Saolta hospital group, the catchment area it serves, and whether that would make a huge difference regarding the need for extra bed capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#E00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.  The Chairman is cracking the whip so I will just fire out the questions because we are under time constraints.  Do the witnesses believe the group structures within the HSE are working?  Could they be improved?  Obviously, they are not perfect and if they can be improved, how can that be done?  How big an issue is the fact that they do not align with the community structures?  It is certainly an issue and we should not fool ourselves that it is not.  How big an issue is that for the witnesses in their day to day work?  Is the fact that each of the witnesses has different structures as regards boards, management teams, etc., and alignment of hospitals under those headings a major issue for them?  Should it be consistent?  That is my first set of questions.<\/p> <p>  With regard to workforce planning, we had a very good presentation on that from somebody here.  Recruitment is a huge issue across the board.  How is it affecting the witnesses' planning their operations across their hospitals?<\/p> <p>  Regarding community care, I was very much taken by a number of references, particularly with respect to the mid-west.  Would all the witnesses agree that it would make more sense to take a quantity of funding out of the acute space and put it into the community space in order to ensure they do not have the demands they have in the first place coming into the hospitals in which they operate?  That came across in the presentation covering the mid-west in particular.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding patient pathways care, what are the issues with moving patients across the witnesses' hospital network post-care, pre-care and so on?  What are the real issues in that regard, particularly issues relating to delayed discharges, staffing and transport?<\/p> <p>  On the use of private hospitals, how will that fit in with regard to helping out the witnesses with their workload?  We are facing into winter and in a number of the locations private hospitals are advertising their emergency departments for patients while some of the accident and emergency departments they run are jammers, which is insane.<\/p> <p>  We have a major issue in Ireland with the provision of doctors, particularly in many rural areas.  Every member of this committee knows that.  Is there real concern about that in that if it gets worse, demand for their services will increase again over the coming winter period?<\/p><p>That will leave the services in an even worse situation than they were in previously.<\/p><p> I have two final questions.  With regard to IT, there is a great deal of different commentary on IT provision.  Obviously, it is not up to speed.  What do the witnesses consider to be the best developments they have seen over the last year or so in IT provision?  It is incredible that in 2016 we are not managing patients and their details in an IT-efficient fashion and still are using old ways to do it.<\/p><p> Finally, have the witnesses any comments or what did they feel personally - this question is particularly directed to the CEOs - in response to the letter from the chief executive of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, a number of months ago which commented on their performance?  How did they react to it?  What did they take from it?  Did they consider it necessary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#E00400","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I have some general and specific questions, and I will try to be brief.  With regard to recruitment plans, it is fair to say that whatever the witnesses are doing at present is not working and it is reasonable to ask them what they plan to do in the future.  Clearly, one cannot run a health service without staff.  It is a serious problem.<\/p> <p>  Regarding bed capacity, to what extent do the problems relate to physical capacity, that is, physical beds and bed space, as opposed to staffing problems?  If the staffing problem was solved in the morning how many beds could we put back into the system?<\/p> <p>  There is much talk in this committee and elsewhere about primary care.  Clearly, there is a blockage in that area.  In particular, I wish to hear the views of the CEOs on what causes that blockage in the patient journey.  Is it to do with staff or lack of capacity in primary care, or is it related to systems?<\/p> <p>  I have specific questions for the representatives of the Saolta group.  Sligo, Letterkenny and Portiuncula hospitals were consistently among the top four hospitals during 2013, 2014 and 2015 that were the highest spenders on private ambulance services.  People know my views on private health care and the poor value for money it represents.  Why does that happen and are there any plans to phase it out?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Nash mentioned a significant IT investment in his presentation.  How much is that and how many years are involved?  What is it hoped to achieve?<\/p> <p>  The RCSI mentions targets in its presentation.  If it does not hit those targets, what services will it cut first and how will it select them?<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms Cowen on the UL group.  I am very familiar with that group, as she is aware.  Morale among the staff in the group is at an all-time low.  She will be aware of that too.  To what extent are there specific plans regarding accident and emergency services in the UL group?  It is constantly in the headlines.  I am sure that does not please Ms Cowen, no more than it pleases the poor people waiting.  What will be done in the short term in that regard?  She also mentioned that liaising with GPs is one of her top priorities.  Perhaps she would expand on that and give the committee an insight into what the group does in terms of how that liaison works and whether there are plans to expand on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#F00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":627,"content":"<p>There is a wide range of questions.

From that point on there was an immediate change in referral patterns for tertiary services, particularly from the north west.  Traditionally, the west and the north west had different health boards and were quite distinct areas.  That had a significant impact on capacity problems in Galway.  There are no unopened beds on the Galway site.

It was the first group formed in August 2013.  There was no time to do the strategic planning to be able to effect that.  We are back to what Deputy Naughton highlighted.  The Galway hospital site is currently overwhelmed.  There is no additional capacity that can be turned on as all beds are open.  I agree with Maurice Power that Galway needs a new emergency department but, ultimately, it needs a planned new hospital to be able to serve the six counties of the west and north west.<\/p> <p>  Integration with the community is a critical issue.  Saolta has two community health organisations, CHO one and CHO two.  The geographical boundaries are not the same.  That is a big issue because we are looking after the same people and patients and we have different accountabilities.  Regarding the proper and full integration of services, I fully agree with everybody who says that the key to addressing part of the overcrowding in hospitals is looking at chronic disease and elderly patients.  However, that requires integrated governance to be able to manage them because they are separate governance structures.  I agree that we need an integrated structure, but I would not necessarily agree to it in the short term.  If one tries to move funding from the acute settings to the community without having a single governance, that will have a huge adverse effect on the acute hospital sector.<\/p> <p>  The other comment was about private ambulance use.  Yes, it is a necessity.  Given the geography there is a four-hour transfer between Letterkenny and Galway.  To transfer a single patient and cardiologist from Letterkenny to Galway for an angiogram requires an ambulance for a full day.  From Letterkenny to Galway and back is a four-hour round trip and that happens every day of the week.  There is no capacity in the national ambulance service to be able to provide that in a timely fashion so, unfortunately, we end up being dependent on the private ambulance services for the non-emergency but urgent inter-hospital transfers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Nash"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":633,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Nash not think there is a better way to plan that so there would not be such reliance on the private ambulance service?

The Merlin Park site is a large one.  The profile of care delivered on the site has changed in the past four years because it was not felt appropriate for acute care on selected medicine to be admitted there so that put on additional pressure.  We opened some capacity in Galway in 2012, and it was necessary to ensure and maintain the safety of care there.

We have teams of people from the CHO working on the campus of University Hospital Limerick to assist us and families with discharges.  That is an example of how it works.  In our view, a lot of funding comes in for transitional care and home care packages to help patients come out of hospital but we do not have delayed discharges in the UL Hospitals Group.  The numbers are quite small.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see funding put into the CHO to develop services for hospital in the home and preventative medicine to keep patients out of hospital because we seem to be the first port of call when we should be the last through the emergency department.  There are opportunities there for nursing, including advanced nurse practitioners, in the development of that role in the community.  The only way to do that is to co-appoint.  Nurses are mainly interested in working in hospitals when they come out of college.  If there was creative contract with them so they could work or be required to work in the community on a sessional basis, there would probably be more nurses applying for those jobs.  There are real opportunities there which we can stream and work towards.  In my view, it works well to have one chief officer to talk to every day rather than several.  While several different people will all be very expert in their area, having to deal with them takes a lot of time out of a CEO's day just to keep the show on the road.

While there can be changes in control - there are enough international models that have multiple or senior - the main piece that needs to be moved forward is an agreed pathway for how we manage patients nationally and locally.<\/p> <p>  In respect of moving funding from the hospitals to the community, 85% of what comes to our hospital is an exacerbation of chronic disease, ergo, in the majority of cases, the treatment should happen at an earlier stage with the hospital being the last bastion as opposed to the first.  The key problem is the fact that whether we like it or not, if one is going to build a new house, one must leave the roof on the old house while one builds the new one.  If we are going to develop community services capacity capability, we must maintain the existing system.  If we just move things in the space of a year, we will automatically have immediate problems.  It will take time to develop community services and during that time, we will still need to continue funding the hospital system.<\/p><p> Reference was made to private hospitals helping out.  Again, the issue is that the majority of patients in our emergency departments are medical patients with acute exacerbation of disease.  The majority of the private hospitals are treating elective surgical patients.  Therefore, while they are of some use to maintain elective treatment capacity, they are not the main solution.  The main thing for our group, specifically, is the ability to successfully discharge patients to the community.  As it stands across our group, 151 patients are waiting for community placement.  The greatest capacity gain for us in the winter would be the ability to move those patients successfully to the community.<\/p><p> Information technology is another issue.  It is well recognised nationally that we have limited isolated poorly developed IT systems.  The two key requirements from a hospital dinosaur perspective are the electronic patient record coupled with the national patient identifier.  The benefits are significant.  There are small isolated models in small isolated hospitals, but we are well behind and we do not have a national scheme either and consequently, our ability to talk across hospitals is further limited.<\/p><p> I was asked a specific question about targets and what I would cut if I did not achieve them.

The service plan for 2016 recognised that there was a stretch target.  It also recognised that private activity in public hospitals is primarily coming through the emergency departments.  The income is not under the direct control of the hospital.  It recognises a risk in that regard.  In going through this year, provision is made for it.

I am interested in the exploring the targets in the context of the comments of Mr. Carter that the stretch income targets are unrealistic.  For example, the RSCI Hospitals Group submission states that the population in its catchment area has increased from 640,000 in 2002 to 817,522 in 2011 and it is projected to reach 875,000 by 2021.

At the same time, only three smaller hospitals are model 2 hospitals.  Part of the negotiations at the time very much focused from the GPs' point of view on the awareness that they felt they would lose many of the services in small hospitals when they were centralised.  Our purpose was to persuade them that we just wanted to deal with the acute services problems centrally.  While we always want to look after all the issues relating to chronic disease, ultimately, we have to deal with an acute problem when it arises.  As Mr. Carter said earlier, one has to keep the roof on top of the house while everything is changing.<\/p> <p>  To attract highly specialised people home from abroad, they must brought in the system through a model 4 hospital but all of them are still generalists.  In other words, they all still have basic training.  The key is to tell them they will be able to do robotic surgery and all sorts of sophisticated work but that we want to them to do basic surgery in the smaller hospitals.  Our road system and geography within the mid-west region allows us in the UL Hospitals Group to do that and that has worked well because no one is more than a half an hour from Ennis or Nenagh and the other smaller hospital in Limerick city is ten minutes down the road.  That can sometimes be a challenge in terms of the concept but when people realise that when they come home, as Mr. Broe said earlier, they cannot access theatres, etc., in the bigger hospitals but they can use their skills in the smaller hospitals, it should be a win for everybody.  It is an easier model to put in place for surgery because surgeons are task driven and when they are told they can do these operations in the smaller hospitals, they will usually do that and they are quite delighted to do it.  It is planned surgery in the smaller hospital and it will not be interfered with by an unanticipated massive number of emergencies coming into the bigger hospital, which take up beds.  Separating the two in that way works well.<\/p> <p>  The aspect of it that has been a challenge demonstrates how the Carlow-Kilkenny model comes into play.  It is a unique scenario in that Kilkenny is a model 3 hospital but, traditionally, in Carlow-Kilkenny - it started with overcrowding more than 20 years ago - the GP has always had direct access to the hospital.  The GP could send a patient in and he or she would arrive on the ward without having to ask anybody.  That has evolved over the years into a more sophisticated model at that level.  That is not overly practical in Beaumont Hospital or in UHL but it is possible in the model 2 hospitals.  The challenge has come from the point of view that when we reconfigured the hospitals, our physician colleagues, in particular, were concerned about unanticipated emergencies and deaths, etc., and when the anaesthetic services moved from the model 2 hospitals into the model 4 hospitals and there was no anaesthetic back up at night, etc., there was a great concern about unanticipated deaths.  In our area, in particular, we had a challenge in persuading our physicians to still invest in smaller hospitals at a local level and it was also a concern of our GP colleagues.  As a result of that, we found that many of our semi-acute, chronic disease, exacerbation patients inevitably started coming into Limerick and, therefore, our challenge has been to try to get them to go back out again.<\/p> <p>  One of the ways we do it is simply to transfer them out quickly when they come into the emergency department but one of the problems we have had over the years is that this has coincided with the downturn in the economy and the difficulty of attracting back newly qualified personnel, etc.  If we try to bring back a new consultant physician with an interest in respiratory medicine from Harvard Medical School and say we will base him, with all due respect, in one of the model 2 hospitals, it will be challenging.  A number of years ago, we asked these physicians to come to Limerick and told them we wanted them to go outside.  They find lots of things to do in Limerick and sometimes it is difficult to persuade them to go out but if the jobs were attractive and the salaries and the circumstances were better, many people would apply for them, as happened 15 or 20 years ago when 40 people applied for a job in Cavan.  For example, if they had a job in Cavan but were based in Beaumont Hospital three days a week, many people would apply for it.  That is where we must move to in terms of the integration of model 2 and model 4 hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Harty asked about interaction with GPs.  As we have managed with procedures such as endoscopy, minor surgery, etc., we are improving at providing the service at that level but the key is the management of chronic disease.  Those pathways are well defined and they should be able to be integrated in the vast majority of cases through the model 2 hospitals with the physicians.  In that scenario, we hope there would be greater interaction and that GPs would come into the hospitals more.  That is the model we would like to explore.  There is a resource issue at every level, including general practice.  When we broached this subject a few years ago, some people suggested we put this forward in an attempt to use GPs to shore up the deficits in the model 2 hospitals where recruiting junior staff is difficult and expensive.  Currently, we often have to use agency processes, etc.<\/p><p>One of the issues is to get the support from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in terms of training models for junior doctors.  We want them to include model 2 hospitals in their training programmes.  If we get recognition from the colleges at that level then it will allow us to put our good quality junior staff in model 2 hospitals.  That initiative will, in turn, encourage everybody to refer more to the model 2 hospitals and, in turn, bring general practitioners into the situation.<\/p><p> Even though we are in the hospital it must be said that there is a resource issue in terms of support in general practice.  That is reflected in the fact that 50% of the patients that present to our emergency department do not have a GP letter.  That is a big challenge for us at the moment as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":705,"content":"<p>Does the RCSI delegation wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#L00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":706,"content":"<p>The use of levels 3 and 2 makes eminent sense.  As I said in my presentation, we apply the capability of the surgeon to the capacity of level 2 and a classic example is Louth.  The hospital in Louth is totally suitable for simple elective surgery and outpatients.  We have started but not fully rolled out a service whereby vascular surgery is now routinely undertaken in Louth.  The location has several other benefits.  There is no emergency department competing for space and the site has the appropriate infrastructure.  The earlier witness is right.  As services are further rolled out we will consider the outpatient specialties as well so that is just a continuation.<\/p> <p>  In terms in making this attractive from a recruitment point of view, we have found that the best way, as has been alluded to, is to appoint a consultant to two sites.  The aim is for him or her to do his or her specialist interest, if he or she has one, in the centre that has the specialist and the more general aspects of his or her service is normally in the level 2 or level 3 hospitals.  The scheme works well.<\/p> <p>  As was said earlier, not all consultants want to be experts.  A large number of consultants are general medical or general surgical.  Let us remember that over 50% of the work that is done in the health care system is done in level 3 or lower hospitals.  A relatively small amount of specialist work is done in level 4 hospitals.  The recruitment of split posts works very well.<\/p> <p>  There are other reasons staff are not attracted to some of the smaller hospitals.

There is the issue of private health care funding and targets being set.  Will the witnesses elaborate on that, although it has been discussed already in terms of targets?  Deputy O'Reilly referred to this.  If the hospitals are full and running a big budget deficit, to be honest any accountant would say they should be filled with people who will pay for that bed through private health insurance.  Where is the incentive not to do so?  In other words, where is the incentive to treat people purely on a list basis?  To be honest, no list comes through to an accident and emergency department and it is just about who presents there.  I am quite sure decisions can be made as to whether these people should be referred further up the hospital or back to the community.  Is there any incentive to refer people who may potentially contribute to the hospital through payment by private health insurance?  Does it exist at that point to divert people to the hospital or send them home?  There have been cases of people being questioned in accident and emergency departments about private health insurance and I have documentary evidence on that.  I also have some of that from insurance companies which have informed me that people are being questioned in accident and emergency departments, leading to people being corralled up the hospital if they are private and, more than likely, home if they are not.<\/p> <p>  There is the broader issue of hospital groups.  I have been the spokesperson for my party for six years on health and I am still unsure what hospital groups are and where we are going.  If anybody around the table could tell me, I would be delighted.  We were to establish a hospital group system and move to trusts that would compete with one another.  This was based on the principle of the universal health insurance model, and although that has been scrapped, we have hospital groups up and running and in some cases boards are telling me they have some form of authority while others tell me there is no authority and they run, cap in hand, to the HSE the whole time.  Are there varying degrees of autonomy between the various hospital groups?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Power referred to information technology, IT, systems.  These are observations as opposed to criticisms.  We have not exactly covered ourselves in glory with IT systems in this country, to be upfront about it.  That is not just in the health area but across broader systems.  While we have a wonderful software and IT industry, we seem to be incapable of transferring that as efficiently as we should into the Civil Service and public service.  Who oversees the IT roll-out in the various hospital groups?  Is it fully centralised?  Mr. Power indicated there was a design for an IT system in the Saolta group but why is it not being designed for every other group if it is that good?<\/p> <p>  Neither the HSE nor the groups can borrow.  Is all the equipment in every hospital owned by the HSE?  I am referring to the likes of MRI, PET and CT scanners, which are high-tech equipment.  Would a leasing system not be much better?  Could we lease the equipment like any functioning commercial body?  We could lease them from Siemens or other manufacturers.  There could be contracts in place regarding replacements, repairs and maintenance.  That just does not seem to be the case.  I know a hospital waiting for a part costing &euro;1.3 million but it cannot be purchased because the money is not available.  Women have to travel from Cork to Dublin as a result for treatment because the piece of equipment is broken.<\/p><p>Could we be in any way imaginative on that?  What are the views of the witnesses as representatives of hospital groups in terms of at least having the autonomy to enter into long-term lease arrangements with hi-tech equipment suppliers on a commercial basis, including maintenance and replacement?<\/p><p> If somebody mentions Beaumont to me, I think of a fine hospital but also of seven ambulances outside the door.  When I hear \"Our Lady of Lourdes\", I think of queues and when I hear \"Limerick\", I think of chaos in the emergency department.  It is the same in Galway.  Let us be honest; that is what the public thinks.  While it is sometimes propagated for political purposes, it is the factual reality for patients every day.  What supports are the groups getting from the HSE nationally to assess the types of patients that are presenting?  We have had evidence from Mr. O'Brien himself pointing out that a lot of those who present at emergency departments should not be there in the first place.  Are the witnesses getting any support from the HSE nationally to address that particular deficiency in community services and the primary care setting, to assess what patients are coming in, why they are coming in, who should not be there in the first place and what service deficiencies force them to end up in acute hospital emergency department settings?  While the witnesses have probably discussed it already, I would like to hear some views on that.<\/p><p> We have always criticised the HSE nationally for its silo thinking.  There is primary care, community care, acute hospitals and all the various silos in it.  I am beginning to detect that this is symptomatic of problems within some of the groups as well.  There is too much silo thinking funnelling down from the same sort of structure at national level and there is no clear co-operation between acute hospitals and community care, primary care or step-down facilities to work that in a basic, coherent way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#M02100","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in.  I will cut to the chase as I am sure they are beaten down with questions at this stage.  I was struck listening to Ms Cowan's presentation in particular when she said that single clinical governance across all areas was the key to providing operational expertise.  That is the key to me also.  I am not sure about the different groups.  If we take recruitment for example, do any of the parties here recruit as a group?  One has category 4, 3 and 2 hospitals.  Graduates look for the category 4 hospital because that is where the most activity is going on and where they will learn the most.  That is at the expense, however, of category 3 and 2 hospitals, which we need as much as we need category 4 hospitals.  If a consultant, SHO or nurse is being recruited, he or she should be recruited for the group.  The group should say to an applicant that he or she may be in Limerick or Ennis and the person can then go to wherever he or she is directed to go.  That way, one will not get all the cream in one area and the rest left struggling.  I do not know if that system operates in any of the groups.  If not, it should.  It would be a huge benefit.  The situation in Kerry is the one with which I am most familiar and we will be dealing with it in the next session.  There is one geriatric consultant in Kerry whereas there are 14 in Cork.  It makes no sense that one or two of those cannot be seconded to Kerry on a six-monthly or 12-monthly basis to help out.  It would provide great relief in the system if that was done.<\/p> <p>  I saw in the presentation the consideration of day surgeries in model 2 hospitals to relieve pressure so that an accident and emergency or trolley crisis does not mean having to cancel procedures.  That is fantastic and a progressive way to maximise the use of model 2 hospitals and avoid impacts on model 4 hospitals.  I would like to see that replicated.  Perhaps the fact that only one CEO has to be dealt with is the reason it is possible to get all these things in place.  It might be the model of best practice to which we should all aspire.  I hope there is a capacity within groups to do these types of things.  That is my next question.  Is that capacity there?  If a hospital group decided in the morning that it wanted to go along with recruitment suggestion I made, could it or would there be obstacles in the form of unions or people refusing and an absence of the power to make it happen?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Nash spoke about how the hospital group was put together and what it has being what it has.  Is the make-up as it stands correct or are there discussions among the groups where they say that Tipperary should be in with one or another?  I am not asking the witnesses to make suggestions on the spot, but they might come back to us with suggestions in written form because we need to know these things.  If there are one or two hospitals that are outside the group within which it would be better for them to be, we should be told.  If we can make it happen, we will.  This is an opportunity.  There is no point in saying, \"We should have\".  We should be told now because the witnesses are in position and know the workings.  If there are positive changes that could be made, we should by all means be told what they are.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher mentioned information technology and Mr. Power said there was currently no IT link between the hospitals in his group.  How difficult is that to achieve given that it is critical?  It would save so much time and effort and the technology to do it is certainly there.  How do we make that happen?  The witnesses should tell us and we will do our best to try to get it delivered.<\/p> <p>  A comment was made that morale was at an all-time low in UL.  Certainly, I have not found that in my experience.  I live not too far away and I feel the morale in the group is good.  I have no difficulty in saying that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#N00200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":757,"content":"<p>To conclude on this session I have a few quick questions to add.

I note the point made that only two of the hospital groups, UL and Saolta, have actual boards in place at this stage.  Why does the RCSI group not have a board?  I will be asking the other groups the same question when they come to the meeting.

These people are doing it voluntarily so we give them the courtesy of performance details.  Regarding autonomy, as CEOs we are key decision makers.  We are the accountable officers for everything that happens in our hospital group.  We are held to account through a very strong performance accountability framework.  There are areas that we have to account up to.  Mr. Liam Woods is our national director.  Sometimes, we would like more of the decision making to be with us at the front line.  We are not anywhere near moving to a trust status.  We support a network of hospitals working together and that has played out with some of the positives around reconfiguration which predates groups.  In UL that was driven by this gentleman here beside me, Dr. Paul Burke.  We have to train our people to understand how to work like private sector business model units.  We are public servants and we are here to serve the patients.  I suggest that groups evolve as networks of hospitals working together, moving surgery out to the sites and moving work around rather than moving very quickly into a trust style model where we will not be able to account for every last detail.  That is my suggestion on it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding IT systems we have just rolled out a patient master index across six hospital sites which is the first in the country.  That was managed centrally through the office of the CIO, chief information officer.  He got funding and has continued to get funding for IT services, which has been very effective because we can transfer patients now across the six sites and everybody can look in and see what that looks like.  It was managed centrally but we had teams of project people on the ground delivering that.  Mr. Maurice Power might want to talk a bit about his electronic patient record.  He is trying to look at rolling that out and we would copy the system rather than every group trying to do something different.  That is under way.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding equipment and purchasing, we hold an asset register so all equipment belongs to the HSE.  The leasing model is in place in small areas.  The vascular team have leased equipment and sometimes that works.

Much of that has to do with social situations and people coming out of hours and not going to general practitioners etc.  There is the economic story with that as well.  People are aware that if they come into hospital and wait 36 hours they will end up having had their CT scan and go out again.  There is patient choice in much of this and much of it is the way our social infrastructure is affecting it.  The vast majority of conditions that people come with are acute conditions.

There used to be a situation where there was a particular number of named beds, which I think the Chairman was referring to.  In any hospital, there might be 100 beds of a specific designation which are identified as private beds and if private patients are in them, the hospital can charge.  The law changed in the last three years to a situation where patients who are admitted and elect to be treated privately can be charged.  What Ms Cowan has referred to as an assistance to the insurers to understand that a patient was treated in a bed or in a treatment location - it is not all bed based - is a bed database which is maintained as part of an MOU of them.  The control is actually in the Act.  That has seen a significant growth in income because there were always patients presenting who were private, who would have elected to go private and could not be charged.  Over the last few years that has been amended.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on the managed equipment, perhaps Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman will talk more about it on the children's hospital side in the next session.

There is a lack of integration across the Saolta group in terms of patient administration systems, financial systems and HR systems.  As part of our ICT strategy, we are working with the HSE chief information officer to put in place some of those systems.  For example, one of the projects in respect of which we propose to seek immediate funding is a group patient administration system which will tie in with the unique patient identifier.  This will allow us to track any patient in any hospital.  There is a piece of work to be done on that and in respect of the appropriate funding for it.  We are also working on the introduction of a document management system which will involve the conversion of physical charts to electronic charts.  Work on this system has commenced.  Ultimately, the key ICT development will be in the area of electronic patient records, EPR, so that from the point of entry into hospital of a patient his or her full record will be available electronically to anybody who needs it.  The critical issue in this regard will be integration of this system with general practitioners and the community care sector so that we have an overall patient record available to all staff.  I understand that Mr. Richard Corbridge, chief information officer, has made a submission on the cost of an electronic patient record, EPR, system for the Republic of Ireland and that a significant capital investment will be required.  This system is critical to the integration of services between GPs, communities and ourselves.<\/p> <p>  In regard to ED analysis, there is also a project under way, in respect of which Saolta is taking the lead, on the implementation of what is known as an unscheduled care information system.  As stated by Members critical to this will be information on the reason patients are attending emergency departments.  As I said, work on this project has commenced, with a view to implementation of the system in 2017.  Saolta is the pilot site in this regard.  In regard to purchasing, I agree with the Deputy that we need to look at managed equipment services.  In terms of capital spend, we do not have the necessary money to invest in equipment requirements and so we need to look at levelling off in this area over a period.  Managed equipment services is the way forward in terms of delivery in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Brassil's questions, we do recruit locally.  We are currently facing challenges recruiting people to work in Galway and in Donegal.  They are two difficult locations to recruit but in terms of Portiuncula and Roscommon hospitals we do recruit locally.  In regard to the overall funding situation and targets, the current income deficit for Saolta is approximately &euro;8 million, which is less than 1% of our overall budget.  The priority for me as chief executive officer is to ensure that patients are admitted based on their acuity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":804,"content":"<p>I will allow a brief question from Deputy Louise O'Reilly specifically on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#P00500","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":805,"content":"<p>With regard to recruitment and contracts, are the limits on movement applicable under the Lansdowne Road agreement, which if memory serves me correctly is no more than 50 km in terms of a round-trip, being adhered to?

I am CEO of the Ireland East hospital group.  I am joined by the clinical director for the Group, Mr. Kevin O'Malley.<\/p> <p>  The establishment of hospital groups provides a unique opportunity to deliver integrated models of care and to bring research and innovation to the core of the clinical service delivery model.  The Ireland East hospital group, IEHG, was established in January 2015 and is the largest and most complex of the hospital groups.  Comprising 11 hospitals, six of which are voluntary and the remaining five of which are statutory, the Ireland East hospital group spans eight counties and four community health organisations and has a gross annual expenditure of in excess of &euro;1 billion.<\/p> <p>  The Ireland East hospital group's ambition is \"to be the national leader in healthcare delivery, with a strong international reputation, improving the quality of healthcare and better patient outcomes through education, training, research and innovation for the 1.1 million people we serve\".  To achieve this ambition, we have developed a ten-point framework programme, which will see the IEHG established as an independent hospital group, with an academic health sciences centre as its core.<\/p> <p>  Over the past two years, the group has established a management team to run the largest hospital group; prioritised developing integrated pathways across the continuum of care between the acute, primary, community and continuing care services; focused on developing a robust quality and patient safety function to ensure high quality safe care is delivered; developed our first clinical academic directorate in cancer as a move towards an academic health sciences centre model; introduced an unscheduled care transformation programme to improve patient throughput in our emergency departments, EDs, and enhance patient experience; and created additional surgical and outpatient capacity in the group by ensuring model 2 hospitals carry out higher volumes of low acuity work, thereby freeing up capacity in the model 4 hospitals.<\/p> <p>  We now want to build on the positive start and make meaningful changes to the delivery of care in order that every patient within the IEHG can receive the same access to high quality safe care, regardless of where he or she lives.  To develop and fulfil our ambition further, we need to have primary legislation which will enable the IEHG to become an independent hospital group with its own board operating under the HSE's commissioning arm and with fully accountability to the Oireachtas.  Hospital groups, if properly constituted, will enable the acute hospital sector to integrate with the primary, continuing and community care sectors in a manner not previously achieved; ensure that we can meet the needs of the local population within a quality and safety framework that delivers high quality safe care; develop operating models that ensure smaller hospitals are aligned with academic teaching hospitals, thereby improving the quality of care to all our patients; optimise the use of resources, by ensuring care is delivered in the most appropriate location; and bring research and innovation to the core of service delivery, ensuring bench-to-bedside developments become a reality.  Our link with University College Dublin is also vitally important to our work with generations of doctors, nurses and other health professionals who are graduates of UCD providing excellent services in our hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Patient care is at the centre of everything we do.  To that end, the IEHG has developed a quality risk and patient safety directorate, which will develop a comprehensive risk management system which incorporates clinical and non-clinical risks.  Another key element of our quality framework is to conduct a safety survey to enable us to assess comprehensively the practices and procedures behind the numbers.<\/p> <p>  A core objective of the IEHG is to develop an academic health sciences centre, where education and research contribute to patient care and well-being.  Internationally, such centres have scored well ahead of non-academic centres for patient outcomes and safety and improved staff recruitment and retention.<\/p> <p>  In delivering this objective we have developed a clinical academic cancer care directorate, which allows us to combine the strength and scale of our clinical cancer services at the Mater and St Vincent's hospital along with the cutting edge research of UCD to enhance the care given to cancer patients, to improve their life expectancy, and to deepen our understanding of cancer.  This will be the largest cancer care centre in the country, caring for more cancer patients than any other hospital group.<\/p> <p>  To meet the needs of the patients we serve, it is vital that primary care and acute hospitals work closely together.  We have a GP on the group management team and we have endorsed the concept of local integrated care committees to improve the links between hospitals, community and primary care sectors.  Such committees have already been established in Kilkenny, Wexford, Mullingar and Loughlinstown in Dublin, and work is under way in Navan.<\/p> <p>  Clinical integration with the communities we serve is also vital.  The IEHG has a dedicated work programme on integration with primary, community, continuing and home care entities.  The main aim of this is to ensure the needs of patients are aligned as seamlessly as possible across the continuum of care, with a special emphasis on managing the frail elderly patient pathway.<\/p> <p>  My opening statement is just a snapshot of who we are, what we do and what our ambitions are in the Ireland East hospital group.  The written submission we made to the committee gives a much broader overview, including our work in unscheduled and scheduled care, genetics, human imaging and education and training.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its time this morning.  Mr. O'Malley and I would be happy to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Day"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Day.

I will focus a little on the future.  I would like to introduce my clinical director, Mr. Martin Feeley.<\/p> <p>  Our group began less than two years ago and, like Mary Day's group, is a young group in evolution.  We serve a population base of 800,000, our expenditure this year will be close to &euro;1 billion and we have approximately 10,000 employees.  It is a busy group.  In the interests of time, I will not go through all the numbers.  They are in the submission.<\/p> <p>  We have a distinguishing feature from some of the other groups in that 70% of our revenue goes into three large voluntary hospitals: St. James's, Tallaght and the Coombe Women's and Infants University Hospital.  We have three general hospitals, Naas, Tullamore and Portlaoise, and we have the specialty three radiation oncology centres in Dublin - the St. Luke's radiation oncology network.<\/p> <p>  The two big general hospitals, Tallaght and St. James's, have both national and regional programmes.  We are the national centre for burns and the national centre for stem cell transplantation.  We have some of the national leadership roles in elements of oesophageal cancer, lung cancer, genetics, family cancers, etc.  We have regional services for nephrology, renal dialysis, infectious diseases and ageing as key pillars.<\/p><p>Those two hospitals both offer broad general services as well.  All five of our general hospitals include emergency department services, general surgery and general medicine.  There are challenges.  Our governance model is good in that we work collaboratively with voluntary hospitals by means of service level agreements and we directly manage statutory hospitals.  However, all hospitals struggle with trolleys and waiting lists for elective procedures.  We have a capacity problem that is universal across the country and it needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>In order to add value, a group needs regional leadership and management in order to progress.  There have always been regional models, whether it was the old health boards or the RDOs.  Some of them were integrated with the community and some were not.  However, we work very closely with our hospitals, and particularly with their clinical leaders, in order to develop clinical networks for patient flow and optimal patient pathways.  A very good example of that is the Coombe-Portlaoise maternity and neonatology network, which developed after we arrived as a group and which has been very successful in smoothing out where care is delivered.  We are very appreciative that this has been such a success.  We collaborate very closely with the two community health areas with which we work.  Not only do our hospitals collaborate closely but we, the group, meet them very regularly &ndash; at least twice a month - to address admission avoidance and also to reduce delayed discharges.  With their assistance, there have been very substantial improvements this year in how we manage delayed discharges but it is by no means close to perfect.  It remains a problem in terms of bed utilisation.<br\/><br\/>Our future focus will be on integrated care with the community, with GPs, in particular, and with hospital consultants having more joint appointments.  There are a few joint appointments currently and the CHOs in terms of their broad spectrum of activity are part of that plan.  However, that is contingent on things we do not directly control.  There needs to be a new GP contract, there need to be more GPs and there need to be more resources.  I fully endorse comments made earlier to the effect that one cannot simply switch off spend in a hospital and transfer it to the community, one needs a very comprehensive plan that is graduated in order to get to the point where one shifts work and resources.  Nobody would argue with that.<br\/><br\/>For general hospitals, for local reasons of need in the past - historical reasons - five of them are offering 24-hour emergency department, general surgery and general medicine.  We have identified significant challenges through the work that we have been doing to show that low volume complex patient services are profoundly difficult to deliver in small level 3 hospitals.  In particular, as members have already heard, recruitment is an issue.  It is not even a matter of whether there are people or where there is money available.  The jobs are profoundly unattractive if there is very little work to be done at the complex level and if there is very great difficulty for people to maintain their skills over time.  We are very focused on having sustainable safe models for patients.<br\/><br\/>The group has been charged by HIQA, as a consequence of its report on Portlaoise hospital last year, and is expected to develop an action plan.  We have put a huge amount of work into how we are going to ensure that we are providing safe care for patients in both general and maternity services.  I wish to talk a little bit about how we are setting about doing that because it is still a work in progress within the HSE and the Dublin Midlands hospital group.  It is not policy as yet.  We are approaching the conclusion of all our work, which is being done in a very comprehensive fashion with eight national clinical programme leaders across the spectrum of all surgery, medicine, maternity and infant services in our group.  Transportation is also an issue and the National Ambulance Service is involved and the acute hospitals division is very actively involved in co-chairing the process.  It is very evident to us that, as members have heard from other speakers, we need to focus on providing complex, low volume but vital services that save lives in big hospitals and we need to focus on providing an increased volume and scope of elective high volume, lower acuity services in model 2 or model 3 hospitals.<br\/><br\/>That is part of a significant plan that is linked to an implementation plan we have developed, which is largely based on a very effective policy document that already exists, which is the Securing the Future of Smaller Hospitals: A Framework for Development.  Implementation planning takes multiple years and capacity development is key.  As members are aware, there are national and international shortages across all doctor appointments, junior and senior, and specialised nurses in particular.  We need capacity for facilities and equipment to replace small, old unfit facilities.  There is a massive shortage of capital at the moment.  This will take some time but we will get there eventually.  We have to reflect that front-line staff have performed heroically during the recession and the moratorium but we must ensure that for them to deliver services well, and for the staff to grow, they must have thoughtful planning, both in the community and in the hospitals to deliver a new model of care.  Some of the models will make some members, individually, uncomfortable, but we must endorse change in order to be able to achieve that.  The entire focus is on quality and safety for patients and I should add too, for our staff.  We need to be able to give them an environment where they can do their jobs well.<br\/><br\/>Briefly, what will work is regional leadership and management.  I endorse Ms Day's comment that we would need legislative authority and a model extremely similar to the very effective voluntary hospitals.  It is a type of accountable autonomy whereby one is accountable but one has flexibility in how one develops one's programmes and one can be engaged and active in being as creative and productive as possible.  It is not only a question of capacity, it is streaming patients around the clinical networks and pathways.  Clinical leadership is vital at all levels.  This was only formalised eight years ago.  It has bedded in well and it is something we strongly endorse.  Clinical networks and pathways are the <i>sine qua non<\/i>across community and hospital care and between hospitals.  That is what we bring, because even the most effective, successful voluntary hospitals struggle to get the networking done in a comprehensive way without regional planning and leadership at the level we are doing it.  Consultant-delivered services is the goal, as the national cancer control programme has pushed to deliver.  We have evidence-based guidance from our 32 excellent national clinical programmes and the national cancer control programme.  We must link to them for design advice and we will do the service delivery.  The smaller hospitals framework models provide a very good underpinning.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, 21st century medicine takes longer to achieve than a single Government term.  My remarks are all based on a ten-year timeframe looking ahead.  Change must be planned, agreed and resourced in order to provide staff, equipment and facilities, and implemented.  It must not be all talk and then a case of individuals not wanting to go there.  That is a challenge we must overcome as we move to get into the 21st century for all of our services.  The committee has a great opportunity to do that.  We want to be able to brief and encourage the committee whenever we possibly can to achieve that.<br\/><br\/>I strongly endorse the advice of my predecessor in leading the national cancer control programme - my previous job - Dr. Tom Keane, a colleague and friend, stated that we need collective political support to see our job through.  In particular, I strongly endorse the Canadian public health care system which provides public universal access as an excellent model.  We are nowhere near to that today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of the South\/South West hospital group.  I am. Gerard O'Callaghan, and with me is my colleague Dr. Orla Healy.  The South\/South West hospital group delivers care for a population of approximately 895,222 people across the counties of Cork, Kerry, Waterford and south Tipperary, with gross expenditure this year of more than &euro;927 million.  It is one of seven hospital groups serving 19% of the population of the State.  We provide the full suite of acute hospital services across nine hospital sites.  We have model 4 hospitals in Cork and Waterford, model 3 hospitals in Cork, Kerry and Clonmel, model 2 hospitals in Mallow and Bantry and exclusively elective hospitals in Cork and Kilcreene in Kilkenny.  Emergency services are provided at seven of the nine sites in compliance with acute medicine programme and emergency medicine programme requirements.  Cork University Hospital is the only acute hospital in the country providing the full range of trauma specialties.  We expect that will secure its status as one of two major trauma centres for the country in the upcoming report on trauma centres.<\/p> <p>  We have reconfigured the hospitals in Cork and Kerry, in particular between 2010 and 2014.  That included the closure and reorganisation of a number of emergency departments, which was challenging.  We are continuing with the reconfiguration process.  At this point, acute and complex work has been centralised and non-complex day-case work has been decentralised.  We have now moved on from Cork and Kerry and we are commencing a process of service realignment across the entire hospital group.  Since the establishment of the group in the past three years, the leadership team has been embedding a new governance and management structure.  One of the key actions in the past year has been to meet the 40 clinical specialties across the group to assess their current state and develop the working of cross-group specialties.  To that end, we are developing a clinical directorate structure and have just appointed a group clinical director for women and children as the first directorate in the group.<\/p><p>We are actively integrating care delivery with our colleagues in the community.  We work with two community health care organisations, CHOs.  We have an unscheduled care steering group as well as access, throughput and egress subgroups established with them.  We also have multilayered collaboration across all hospitals with community service, including regular meetings at senior management level.<\/p><p> The leadership team is co-located with the management team of the College of Medicine and Health for the primary academic partner, University College Cork, UCC.  Important progress has been made in building this collaboration such as, working with UCC to attract and rotate non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, to all nine hospitals through a range of joint initiatives and establishing international working relationship with the Erasmus academic health centre, Rotterdam.  Achievements include establishing a master of science, MSc, programme in physiotherapy with UCC and establishing a MSc in health care leadership in UCC, which commenced in September 2016.  We are also examining a postgraduate radiography programme that we hope to get off the ground in the next two years with UCC.<\/p><p> The overarching strategic goal of the group is to achieve independent status with the imminent appointment of a board and the establishment of an academic health centre, in partnership with UCC.  The best hospitals in the world are academic health centres and this model will attract the highest calibre graduates to work in Ireland.  We are actively fostering our relationship with industry, especially the multinational pharmaceutical companies based in Cork to develop our services and realise the economic benefit for our population.  To that end we are working with the Health Innovation Hub, which is based in UCC.<\/p><p> We share many of the same challenges as other groups that the committee is already aware of, such as staff recruitment and retention and cost control.  However, we as a group face a particular challenge because of the ageing infrastructure of our hospitals.  We need urgent capital investment to expand services at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, and University Hospital Kerry, UHK.  Major infrastructural investment at South Tipperary General Hospital, STGH, in Clonmel.  Consideration will be given to the complete rebuilding of that hospital but in the interim planned capital projects must proceed with full funding if the provision of services is to be retained there.  The construction of a new hospital site for Cork city is critical.  This hospital would see amalgamation of the two voluntary hospitals in collaboration with UCC.  The range of services and facilities to be located at this site would include services currently provided at the two voluntary hospitals; a dental hospital; mental health services; ambulatory care; expanded diagnostics, a clinical research facility; a health innovation hub; and sub-acute rehabilitation.<\/p><p> To conclude, the delivery of high quality sustainable health services is dependent on strategic configuration and integration of hospital and community services.  At regional level this translates to the requirement for evidence-based, well-articulated plans that are consistent with national policy but tailored to local context and it is possible to deliver this objective through the development of a hospital group and academic health centre organisational structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard O'Callaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":854,"content":"<p>Where is the group's chief executive officer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#T00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":855,"content":"<p>He is out of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard O'Callaghan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting the Children's Hospital Group to attend the committee to outline plans for children's health care.  I am joined by Dr. Ciara Martin, one of our clinical directors.  Our group clinical director is on leave this week.<\/p> <p>  The Children's Hospital Group consists of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Temple Street Children's University Hospital and the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght Hospital.  Academic arrangements exist with all universities providing paediatric education and research.  Collectively, these three hospitals have 443 beds and 2,865 whole-time staff delivering services to 25,000 inpatients, 27,800 day cases, over 153,000 outpatients and 118,000 emergency department attendances annually with an expenditure of &euro;300 million.  All national paediatric specialties are in the group, some with an all-island remit.  We have specific access and capacity challenges for some paediatric services but in general, the three children's hospitals and their staff are held in high regard for the services they deliver despite these challenges.<\/p> <p>  A total of 23% of our population are children less than 16 years of age.  The majority are healthy, but one-quarter of three year olds are obese; 16% of our children have a chronic disease such as diabetes, allergies and asthma and this is increasing and 2% are acutely ill, some with very complex care needs.  Currently, there is an over-reliance on hospital-based care, with many services accommodated in facilities that are not fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>  The plan for children's health care is the integrated programme for child health, involving acute paediatrics, social, community, primary care and mental health services.  This cross divisional programme rightly reflects a population focused, integrated and multidisciplinary approach to children's health care and the resources required to support parents, families, children and young people in achieving healthier outcomes and will take ten years to implement.<\/p> <p>  The plan for the acute paediatric services element of this integrated programme is the national model of care for paediatrics and neonatology, developed over four years through extensive engagement with parents' representatives, general practitioners, GPs, community colleagues and hospital staff in all acute paediatric and neonatal services.  This plan outlines where and how acute paediatric services are best provided across the health system, with the new children's hospital designated as the central component of an integrated clinical network for acute paediatrics.  The primary principle of this network is to conveniently deliver most paediatric services locally, with regional units clearly identified and supported from the centre and all highly specialised and national services consolidated in one children's hospital.  Multiple health policy reports exist to support this service configuration for contemporary and sustainable paediatric services, and reflect how acute hospital services are developing in other countries.<\/p> <p>  The 12 member Children's Hospital Group board, chaired by Dr. James Browne of National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, was established in August 2013 as an administrative board with specific remits to integrate the three children's hospitals, develop a single clinical and corporate governance for paediatric services and act as client for the new children's hospital capital project and information and communication technology, ICT, programme collectively referred to as the children's hospital programme.  The three independently governed children&rsquo;s hospitals in the group have voluntarily agreed to merge into a new single legal entity before moving to the new facilities.  The Minister plans to bring primary legislation for enactment in 2017 to establish this single entity and the Children's Hospital Group board.<\/p> <p>  The children's hospital programme will successfully merge these three hospitals into a new single organisation.  It needs to transform general paediatric and emergency care in the greater Dublin area with the opening of the new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals in 2018, implement an integrated clinical network for paediatrics across the health system and move services into the new children's hospital by mid-2021, the largest capital investment in the public system.  In line with the Government's digital first public service ICT strategy, the new hospital is planned as the first \"digital hospital\" in the system with the implementation of an electronic health care record, as well as other evidence-based standards, such as 100% single rooms.<\/p> <p>  A decade after the first health policy position on acute paediatric services, the McKinsey report in 2006, last April An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the new children's hospital to be built on a campus shared with St. James's Hospital as well as the new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  The new hospital will provide national paediatric tertiary services, 22% of activity and secondary paediatric care for children in the greater Dublin area, 78% of activity. <\/p> <p>  In summary, the Children's Hospital Group's ten year vision for acute children's health care is to establish a national children's health care organisation that puts children's health first and foremost in its decision making; an integrated care programme for child health, with the new children&rsquo;s hospital central to a clinical network of acute paediatric services in regional and local units and by using technology, to reach out to GPs and into children's homes; to reconfigure paediatric services within the other hospital groups to reflect the paediatric population served, keeping appropriate services local and supported by outreach from the new children's hospital; a 24 hour national paediatric and neonatal retrieval transport service to ensure timely transfer of the sickest babies and children to the most appropriate hospital; successful integration of the three children's hospitals into a state-of-the-art digital hospital, providing both national specialist services and a local paediatric service to the greater Dublin area that our valued staff are proud to work in; and progress a paediatric academic health sciences network with academic partners and industry to enhance paediatric education, research and innovation.  These developments, which will positively affect one quarter of our population need to be considered not just in terms of how they will enhance health care for children but also how this integrated plan for acute paediatrics can demonstrate that the Irish health system can be reformed to deliver better, safer and more sustainable health care.<\/p> <p>  I thank the members of the committee for their attention.

I have some general questions and some that are area-specific.  I will start with the general questions.  In the last session we discussed the income targets in the generation of private income for public hospitals.  I ask the delegates to outline the contingency arrangements if they do not hit these targets.  If they find themselves short, what services will be cut and how will it be determined?<\/p> <p>  Earlier I asked whether bed capacity was a physical or a staffing issue.  If hospitals had the required staff in the morning, how many beds would there be?  From the hospital groups that gave evidence previously, I totted up the numbers.  They indicated that they had a total of 29 hospital beds closed, which would probably leave the hospitals represented here with more than 600 beds closed.  The figure we received for the number of bed closed was well over 600.  I ask the delegates to comment on the number of beds that are closed within the system which could easily be opened.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that recruitment presents a challenge for every facility.  As I said previously, whatever is being done clearly is not working.  It would be helpful if the delegates could provide an insight on innovations or different practices in recruitment.<\/p> <p>  What are the delegates' views on primary care services?  We all know that the patient journey from primary care to acute hospital care is not smooth.  Where are the blockages?  Does the issue relate to staffing in community care settings or do the systems and structures in place prevent patient flow?<\/p> <p>  I am sure none of these questions comes as a surprise to the delegates.  What is the relationship between the CHOs and the hospital groups?  Some of them match, while some do not.  Where they do match, one person deals with one person, but it could be problematic where they do not match.  Deputy Catherine O'Connell asked this question previously.  We are aware that legislation is to be introduced to underpin the boards.  Could that legislation be tweaked to ensure the CHOs and the hospital groups aligned with each other which would be more efficient?  They are the general questions I wanted to ask.<\/p> <p>  The presentation by the Dublin-midlands hospital group made reference to a plan.

When will a planning application be made for the location of the maternity hospital on the St. James's Hospital site?  Ms Hardiman referred to it as the biggest capital investment; therefore, we need to get it right.

Mr. O'Callaghan managed to get through his presentation without mentioning the Herrity report.  It is a very contentious issue, as I am sure he is aware.  I know that my colleague, Deputy David Cullinane, has done extensive work on it.

If they were observing on the monitor, they may notice that some of the questions are being repeated.  My first question to the last group was related to recruitment.  Does each of the groups represented have a group recruitment policy, whereby it can recruit and then send the expert in whatever discipline to the area in which the need is greatest?<\/p> <p>  I might be specific about the Cork and Kerry group as it is the area I know best.  Does each individual department have a common governance structure?  For example, for cardiology, geriatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, is there a common governance structure across each of the hospitals in order that they can integrate and share information?  If there is a shortage in one area, can it then be dealt with through the group structure?  I regard the need to share expertise as critical for any group to work efficiently, particularly the grade 4 hospitals in Cork and Waterford and grade 3 hospitals elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  The IT question keeps coming up.  What progress has been made in having shared IT across each of the hospital groups?  Is this an issue for all of them?  It is critical in order to progress services.<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question for Mr. O'Callaghan.

I have three questions, the first of which relates to the issue of centralisation of emergency department trauma services.  I direct the question specifically to Mr. O'Callaghan who made reference to it.  I think he expressed a degree of confidence that CUH would be chosen to have one of the two key trauma centres in the State.  I understand it will also involve the closure of the emergency department at the Mercy University Hospital and the centralisation of services at CUH.<\/p> <p>  Will a trauma steering group look at the issue on paper to see the advantages, but in dealing with the reality of overcrowding will we get the opposite result?  For example, anyone who visits the emergency department in CUH, particularly on a Friday or a Saturday night, will know that it experiences overcrowding which sometimes is severe.  With the potential closure of the emergency department in a nearby hospital and the centralisation of services without massive extra resources being provided at CUH in this case, it seems to be a recipe for disimprovement rather than improvement.  Rather than asking it as a parochial question, I ask Mr. O'Callaghan to generalise because I understand the trauma steering group is considering the closure of nine emergency departments and the centralisation of services.  The result could end up being negative rather than positive, unless massive resources are put in place.<\/p><p>My second question is on pharma and is to the south-south west group but perhaps Dr. Healy might be interested in taking this question.  The group's opening statement states, &quot;We are actively fostering our relationship with industry especially the multinational pharma companies based in Cork to develop our services and realise the economic benefit for our population&quot;.  Can the witnesses elaborate on that? Does the hospital group receive funding from the pharma industry? There was an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post <\/i>two weeks ago about pharma funding for hospitals and the health services generally.  If funding is received, to what extent and how much money is involved and what is the money for?  Has the pharma industry paid for job positions?  Do clinical leads in the hospitals receive payment from pharma companies? I would like more precise information about the relationship with the pharma industry in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I have a question that may be a bit parochial.  Reference was made to a new hospital site in Cork city - an amalgamation of the South Infirmary Victoria University and the Mercy University hospitals.  That has been talked about for some time.  Can the witnesses give the committee an update on that situation?  In order to make it less parochial and more of a general point, maybe some comment could be made around the type of timescale for these changes in the health service.  Are things going more quickly or more slowly than had been anticipated originally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#U00700","speaker":"1281","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

This is part of the overarching funding model that currently exists.  About two years ago there was a change where patients who have private insurance and who are admitted to public beds - principally through the accident and emergency department - can be charged for to their insurance companies.  There are issues about this model because patients often fear that giving their insurance numbers means their premium would go up - like a car accident claim can affect premiums.  Globally, premiums will go up if we get more money off the insurance companies so some of the insurance companies are fostering the practice of not giving out this information.  We are in a slightly bizarre model.  It is not a model I would like but it is the one we have got.  There is no impact on delivery of services if we fall below these income targets.  As the chief executive officer of a group, and I suspect my other colleagues are likely to agree, we would not be cutting back on services if we do not reach stretch targets generating private income and other revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":868,"content":"<p>Could Dr. O'Reilly explain how that works?

The reason for having a stretch target is that for the last two years there has been an opportunity to be consistent about requesting people's insurance coverage, as they come in through the accident and emergency department or through any referral or outpatient visit, and not necessarily a private referral.   Patients are asked for that information.  The reason we are being tasked to do this better is to make sure hospitals have processes in place where they very consistently, and invariably, request this information as they would request medical card information.  The information goes in onto the admission form.  That is the stretch target.  The reality is that if people come in and they do not have insurance or do not give their numbers, there is nothing we can do about that.  As a leader and deliverer of health services, to be put in a position that suddenly one should rush and cut back on the acute or elective services because of an estimate - based on gleaning all the information that might be out there about a yield of a certain amount of money - is somewhat difficult to deliver on.

It could be that the budget deficit carries forward to the next year and then the group starts off at a disadvantage which, if it happens, is a very difficult thing to deal with.  We are incentivised to do the best we can but we can only do the best we can; we cannot actually magically produce more money than the insurance held by these individuals.

As for whether it is due to physical or staffing causes, I would argue that when we look at bed capacity it is about having the right bed in the right place for the appropriate patient.  We have done a lot of work in recent years on reducing the length of stay in acute hospitals.  We need to look at having sufficient rehabilitation, reablement, step-down and transition beds.  We need to see patients being taken from the acute system into appropriate beds.  This is not just looking at how we develop our bed capacity but also our processes.  In 2016 no patient should be signing a fair deal application form in an acute bed.  Going into a nursing home is one of the most important decisions an elderly patient will make in his or her lifetime.  With regard to looking at bed capacity modelling, we need to examine length of stay, processes, having the right beds in the right place for the appropriate patient and pathways to deliver this.<\/p> <p>  The recruitment issue also involves retention and workforce planning.  One of the first things we need to do is look at workforce analysis throughout the group and whether it has the right number of people to meet the service delivery.  In Wexford we have begun work on a very thorough workforce analysis in the hospital, which will be rolled out to our level 3 hospitals and then into levels 2 and 4 hospitals.  Over the years we have not been that good on having the right numbers to deliver the services.  From a nursing home point of view, the Department of Health is doing very thorough research on having the right skill mix.  Retention is very important, and this is where the groups can deliver good strong initiatives.  In the Ireland east hospital group the universities play a big part in training and education.  In the Mater hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital we want to deliver two academic hubs, which will link in with level 3 hospitals and deliver education and training to staff delivering care at the bed side.<\/p> <p>  As is the case with Dr. O'Reilly's hospital group, ours has a mix of statutory and voluntary hospitals.  It would be helpful if we had a single recruitment entity in the group as we could recruit for the group.  This should be part and parcel of future legislation.  At present, statutory hospitals recruit under the HSE arm.  We have six voluntary hospitals with their own boards which recruit.  Of course as a group we have an employment control framework, but a single recruitment entity would give us flexibility.  We are looking at developing a nursing bank throughout the group.  If we had this, a nurse living in Wexford working in St. Vincent's University Hospital could take a shift in Wexford on his or her day off.  This is the type of flexibility we would look at.  It is all about having a single employment authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#W01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Day"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":916,"content":"<p>What about primary care structures generally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#W01900","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":917,"content":"<p>We have really embraced primary care.

We have a primary care physician, Dr. Ronan Fawsitt, who not only chairs the process but also sits on our Ireland East Hospital Group executive team.

I refer not only to private health care services, but also to road traffic accidents and ED cards.  Going purely electronic has actually generated better income for us than in the past, certainly this year.<\/p> <p>  With regard to bed capacity, we have 17 beds at the moment that are not in operation but I heavily caveat that.  Fourteen of them are of very limited use.  They are in the basement in Temple Street and there is no lift.  We tend to open them up on a temporary basis as a discharge lounge during the winter when have peaks in emergency department activity.  We have three in Crumlin.  These are very small, cubicle-type beds.  We tend to use them.  We have very little capacity to open up new beds within the children's hospital.<\/p> <p>  With regard to ICT, I have stated very clearly that the hospital is identified to be open as a digital hospital.  It is planned that way, as are the workforce and patient flows.  The hospital is designed that way.  We have a burning platform as a health system to identify when we will make decisions about the electronic health care record, in particular, in addition to other electronic systems.  That is coming very close because the business case identifies, for the children's hospital, the need to have the electronic health care system in place.  It can take three to four years to implement that type of system.<\/p> <p>  It is critical for the network that we plan.  Already, our consultants in Temple Street and Crumlin go to Cork, Limerick and Letterkenny with patients.  It involves charts in cars and it is not the way to deliver services.  We need to move to having one system, with data available in the right place so the right people can be supported to deliver the right care locally.  That needs to go right out to GPs.  As a strategic direction for the next ten years, it is a critical enabler to allow us to become more sustainable.  There are huge inefficiencies in the system purely because of paper records.<\/p> <p>  With regard to working with community services, we work with all the community health care organisations in Dublin, but also nationally.  Our long-stay issues pertain to children with complex care needs.  We have very small numbers but they can remain in our hospitals for a really long period.  One may have heard parents talking about this issue.<\/p> <p>  What we have developed with our community and social care personnel, and sometimes with Tusla, is a pathway for complex care needs children.  Each time, it goes out to whatever community it is based in.  It is usually about transferring children with tracheostomy and very complex care needs requiring 24-hour services care in the community.  In recent years, it has not been a funding issue.  It was perhaps two years ago but there seems to have been progress on this, which is positive.  The community services do find it a challenge to get staff on a 24-hour basis to manage very complex care needs.  We work closely with them and train them.  We sent our nurses out to train them and to try, as much as possible, to move the children out of the acute hospitals in Dublin, mainly to locations outside Dublin.<\/p> <p>  On recruitment, I will give Dr. Martin an opportunity to talk about what we do from a consultant's perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#X01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":932,"content":"<p>From 2009, we have had a common contract such that any hospital consultant appointed in one of the three children's hospitals is appointed to the future children's hospital also.

We are recruiting but people are leaving as quickly as we are getting them in, which has been our problem.  There are a couple of issues in regard to medical group recruitment.  In our big geographical area the somewhat peripheral hospitals, namely, Kerry, Clonmel and, to some extent, Waterford are having difficulty recruiting consultants in certain areas.  The cost of locums is twice that of hiring someone normally, so we are working hard to improve the situation.  If we do not get permanent consultants, it becomes more difficult to recruit junior doctors, who do not want to work with these people.  In addition, one needs accreditation for training but one cannot get that without a consultant.  It is a catch-22 situation but we can address the financial issues by recruiting consultants to some of these hospitals.  We are doing a lot of work behind the scenes in this regard.

One was on catchment, one was on governance arrangements and the third was on the academic health centre and the research and innovation environment.<\/p> <p>  Hospital groups were set up with a governance and management structure and did not prescribe catchments, nor have we have prescribed catchments for our area.  We have looked at population bases and at where people go to hospital and people generally use their local hospital.  As a group we are self-sufficient and provide over 95% of the care for our population.  Waterford is a model 4 hospital providing tertiary level services across a range of specialties.  There are particular specialties such as nephrology, which operates across the entire former south-east region, and orthopaedics, which also operates across the entire former south-east region and draws from outside the region, as does the national cancer control platform, NCCP.  The population base has not been interfered with by the establishment of hospital groups.  The county populations are calculated at more than 800,000 but the catchment extends beyond that.  The methodology used by Herity involved looking at the actual cardiology activity in the hospital and where patients came from and he extrapolated from that, which is legitimate for him to do.  The remainder of specialties are drawn from the wider south east.<\/p> <p>  The point about pharma and academic health centres is part of the wider issue about developing an academic health centre model and fostering an environment of research and innovation within the hospital group.  We do not receive direct funding from the pharma industry but we are working with our partner in UCC to develop an academic health centre model and we are looking at the health innovation hub and the clerical research facility.  This point came up at the time of the development of the reconfiguration roadmap for Cork and Kerry.  We have a very important pharma industry in the region which is a major source of employment in the region.  It was suggested the industry use Cork for research and development and it was noted that, for clinical trials and research at the next stage up, the industry goes outside the region, back to the United States or elsewhere where it has access to wider patient bodies and patient populations.  A group would have to offer a wider population and patient base to further that agenda.  We are working towards that with our academic partner but it is not something we would do ourselves  It is a matter for UCC through the health innovation hub and the clinical research facility.  The question was not specific to pharma and another example from the reconfiguration of the health innovation hub, which was its predecessor, was the development of an electronic GP to outpatients referral system, which we piloted in Cork and Kerry and was subsequently taken up and rolled out nationally.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brassil asked about cross-group governance arrangements and cross-group specialty working.

I accept that the emergency department at Cork University Hospital is busy.  It has problems with trolleys.  However, it gets through the patients and meets its nine-hour patient experience time targets.  Despite the high attendance at the department, virtually no patients have to wait longer than nine hours.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry also asked about the closure of a second emergency department in the city.  We have already closed one emergency department in the city and activity has been transferred as part of that process.  The emergency department at Mallow General Hospital has been converted into a local injury and medical assessment unit.  The throughput in those units is now at the level it was at prior to the closure of the two departments.  The level of activity is more or less exactly the same.  The same cohort of patients is being seen through a different model.  The same is true of Bantry General Hospital.<\/p> <p>  The original reconfiguration plan for Mercy University Hospital in Cork provided for a move to a 12-hour model.

I reiterate that the creation of an elective hospital in Cork has made a significant difference for people on waiting lists, etc.  There are no cancellations.  All the orthopaedic work and all the ear, nose, throat, head and neck surgery is being done at the elective hospital.  Between 8,000 and 9,000 day cases were being done at this hospital ten years ago, but over 30,000 day cases are being done there now.  The creation of an elective hospital has been a huge success.  When we moved the orthopaedic service from its previous location, the average length of stay for someone having a hip or knee procedure was ten or 11 days.

I raised some of my questions with the other hospital groups earlier.  It is not that I have less interest in the groups that are before the committee now; it is just that the previous groups responded to my questions and I do not think the answers of the groups before us now would be very different.  I would like to put my first question to Ms Day and her colleagues from the Ireland East Hospital Group.  If they were given a pen and a map of Ireland, would they draw the Ireland East hospital group as it currently stands?  I suggest that Our Lady's Hospital in Navan, which is north of Dublin, has just been thrown in there.  It is probably more suited to the RCSI Hospital Group or the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, but it is in the Ireland East Hospital Group.<\/p> <p>  Issues with other hospital groups arise in this context.  I assume the strategic drafting and planning of the groups was done without any medical snobbery or interference or anything.  Are all the hospital groups strategically drawn to ensure they are capable of delivering care at the most appropriate point?  In my view, some geographical definitions that would have been considered more logical have been frayed away.  I know we are not completely bound by geographical definitions, but it seems to me that there are outliers in some parts of the hospital groups.  I can say honestly that the South\/South West Hospital Group, which includes Cork, is a case in point.  It was originally proposed that University Hospital Waterford would be a model 4 centre for the south east.  That is a fact.  Others then decided to plump for the Mater hospital and other hospitals.  We now have University Hospital Waterford included in the South\/South West Hospital Group and St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny and other hospitals included in the Mater group.  We have to be honest with ourselves as well.  The hospital groups have to work with what they are given.  I am asking about the delivery of services in the specific case of Navan.  Mr. O'Callaghan might refer to Waterford as well, now that I have raised the issues there.<\/p> <p>  National plans involving the reconfiguration of services are published from time to time.  Examples include the national maternity strategy and the trauma report.  Do the hospital groups have the flexibility to be creative and imaginative in such circumstances?  Do they always have to be prompted by the overseer of the national reconfiguration, as set out in national reports from time to time?  What level of flexibility do the hospital groups have in that area?<\/p> <p>  I intend to raise the issue of recruitment and planning of personnel with Ms Hardiman in the context of the children's hospital.  When a farmer ploughs a field, he knows he will sow it, tend it and reap it.  In the health sector, we tend to build theatres and expand services only to realise we have no staff.<\/p><p>We must then run around half the world trying to find staff.  Why is there not a seamless process in place for the conception, creation and delivery of the service?  It is currently done in a stop-start fashion.  At Cork University Hospital, for example, psychiatric services were moved without personnel being available.  Why is such an irrational approach taken?  Perhaps there is a logical reason for doing so but I cannot get my head around it.<\/p><p> What is the reason for the serious difficulties being experienced in recruiting theatre nurses?  Is it that we are not producing sufficient numbers of theatre nurses, having lost many of them in recent years, or is there a global shortage of theatre nurses?  What are the various hospital groups doing to expand training capacity or is this a matter exclusively for the relevant national bodies?<\/p><p> The Children's hospital group will clearly face major challenges in trying to bring together the three children's hospitals in the years ahead.  The building of a new children's hospital is another exciting challenge.  Should we be worried about the delivery of hospital services for children in the period before the new national children's hospital is completed?  I refer, for example, to the issue of scoliosis.  I recently met some of the families involved and some of the stories I heard were deeply troubling.  Ms Hardiman is aware of these issues and I am not arguing that the Children's hospital group is not sensitive to them.  Families have indicated that a theatre was commissioned but there is now a shortage of theatre nurses, which means the theatre is opened as a general theatre.  What problems will the Children's hospital group face in the period before it achieves its goal of having a beautiful children's hospital on the St. James's site?  Is it being squeezed a little more in terms of the delivery of services than would be the case if the new hospital were not being built?<\/p><p> Deputy Mick Barry referred to Waterford Regional Hospital and the fact that it is a model 4 facility.  People in the area are concerned not only about the cath laboratory at the hospital but also the possibility that the hospital will lose services to the other model 4 facility in the region, Cork University Hospital.  They are concerned that it may be run down as opposed to enhanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#Z01500","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":959,"content":"<p>Obviously, having hospital groups delivers significant added value.

I have a major concern that the hospital groups are not aligned with community health organisations and that we may be spawning mini-HSEs.  When I hear that recruitment takes place in one way in voluntary hospitals and in another way in other hospitals, I wonder why there are no streamlined, comparable and replicable models available for all the groups?  It seems astounding, given the population base, that this is not the case.  Is there a reason we cannot have a set menu of services for each of the seven hospital groups?  While I understand that Beaumont Hospital will continue to specialise in neurosurgery and that not every group can provide neurosurgery, I cannot understand the reason for the profound differences between each of the groups.

We are providing for the greater Dublin area, which is across all of the community health organisations and nationally for almost a quarter of our services.  We have to function across whatever structures are put in place.  For us, it was about developing pathways around complex care where we need to reach out.  I have discussed this issue with my group CEO colleagues, whereby instructing their services within their regions, we work collaboratively.  This means, for example, that our clinical lead would work with the clinical director for women and children in Cork on how to develop services collectively.<\/p> <p>  One of the fears that we have in the Children's hospital group is that if we do not work collaboratively to support services locally, parents will believe, on the basis of the good road infrastructure, that they have to come to Dublin for paediatric services.  This is not the case because the vast majority of services are delivered locally.  However, there is considerable inconsistency in this regard.  If one takes emergency department attendances in paediatrics, which we have measured, the difference in admission rates varies from 8% of those who attend being admitted in two of our hospitals to 48% of attendances being admitted in another hospital.  I have been quoted on this previously but children do not fall out of trees differently in Dublin than they do in other areas.  We must work collectively on why such a variation is in place.<\/p> <p>  We have an over-reliance on the acute hospital system.  In the next year, as we roll out the model of care, we expect to work with our colleagues in the other hospital groups to reconfigure services in order that they are less dependent on inpatient beds.  Resources should be realigned around consultant delivered services to achieve more effective decision making and keep patients outside hospital and supported.<\/p><p>Regarding the flexibility to configure, there is flexibility to work within that because there is consideration of how to make one's existing resources work better.  However, this takes time to plan, and some of it requires investment in capital structure to bring it to fruition.<\/p><p> Regarding recruitment and workforce planning and retention, we have developed a workforce plan for the next five years up to 2021.  It is a challenge, but we have identified in the plan the supply elements we need to put in place and the changes in roles and positions which heretofore may not have existed in the system but which in five years one would expect to be in place.  The changed roles and positions replicate very well-established posts in contemporary health care systems.  For example, nursing being an area of common concern, a nursing workforce planner is coming onto our team and we have developed a paper with the nursing policy unit to work with all the universities on increasing the number of nurses going through children's nursing.  We are producing nurses, they are all getting permanent contracts with the children's hospitals, and our colleagues in Cork can get permanent contracts with us, but we are not producing enough.  During the 12 years in which we have been moved to the degree system for paediatrics, we have not increased the number of students on these courses, so we will present a plan of how and what we need to develop.<\/p><p> I think my colleagues would agree that the other issue is theatres.  We see new roles such as an operating theatre department developing.  We must create these new roles.  They sometimes can be seen by some other colleagues in the system as a challenge, but they are well-established in contemporary systems and are already in place in the private sector in Ireland.  They must be introduced as a way of relieving the pressures we find.  Nurses generally want to go out and work, but some of these theatre-type roles are very repetitive, so there needs to be consideration of roles in which staff are specifically trained to deliver these services but in a safe way.<\/p><p> We have a huge challenge in the children's hospital in that much of the emphasis has been on the building and too much on the issue of its location.  We know and understand the concerns and we would like to work with the families raising them to address them because we believe we can and we know we have a responsibility to do so.  However, our focus within the children's hospital group is now increasingly on successfully merging the services.  We work very well with the boards.  We meet every fortnight with the four CEOs, the four clinical directors and the group management team.  We have a structure in place and a plan for our staffing, a plan for engagement and a plan for how we will move from where we are now over the next five years.  However, this is resulting in pressure and it requires resources.  One does not introduce a change as significant as this, that is, a 473-bed hospital with two new paediatric outpatient urgent care centres in the periphery and a digital hospital, without having resources to implement the change.  All our colleagues would probably concur on that.  We must keep the ship going.  At the same time, many people need to be employed.  This week 200 of our staff in the children's hospitals are engaged in designing the 6,000 roles.  They are coming out of those services and we are trying to make sure that the work is carried out at a convenient time in order not to impact services.  The potential to impact services will only increase when we move to the really hard work, namely, standardising how we deliver services across the system.  This requires resourcing, which we have included in the building of this project.<\/p><p> Scoliosis services are a long-standing issue in children's health.  I heard about it before I came into my post.  We have managed to secure funding to address it.  Our challenge is that while we have the consultants in post, nurses for the ward areas and anaesthetists, we have seen a huge turnaround in our theatre nurses.  Some of them moved out of Dublin when posts were offered in the rest of the country, but we had as much as a 25% turnaround in nurses in our theatres, which has resulted in rolling theatre closures and the inability to open the new theatre.  Our plan is international recruitment because there is not a resource available within Ireland to address this.  Our directors of nursing are going out next week and we have lined them up with a plan to have recruitment open by the second quarter of next year.  In the meantime, we have an opportunity to consider what services in the old theatre could open up into the new theatre so that the staff and patients would at least be in new theatres.  The new theatre should not be left sitting there as it is fully commissioned.  We will be outsourcing some of our services between now and the year end with the funding that has been provided for waiting lists to address this.  Probably more importantly, we have engaged with the three advocacy groups and they have committed to come on board with us to co-design the services.  We want the same as what they want.  We do not wish to be seen on opposite sides.  Our consultant staff are meeting with us to identify consultants, nurses and people with process and lean experience to work with the advocacy groups to design how to work around this challenging issue.  It will take us about a year to get this into a better spot from its present position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":964,"content":"<p>I ask the other witnesses to pick up very briefly on the outstanding issues such as the question of voluntary hospitals and how they work and the role of private hospitals within their group area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#BB00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":965,"content":"<p>I was astonished when I landed in Ireland six and a half years ago by the complexity of hospital governance.  Even in the public sector, between voluntaries and statutories there is a two-tier system.  The voluntaries have been very effective over many years with their boards in building the resources they need to get the jobs done.  As a consequence, there is a balancing act here.  Having said that, our voluntaries are highly effective.  They have strong legislative authority and strong boards, and I support their carrying on in that role for now.  I am not in the business of asking for the decommissioning of that approach because one would have to be 100% confident that what one will do in the future would be better and stronger.  One must be very thoughtful about that.  We have worked very effectively in collaborating in governance structures with the voluntaries, particularly around elements of policy and patient safety, instead of imposing certain governance structures to try to interact with them.  That has been a win.<\/p> <p>  Recruitment is a huge challenge.  We have lost hundreds of thousands of hours, weeks, months and years of experienced nurses from the country and we have lost younger nurses.  Now that we are beginning to recruit effectively, both directly through the HSE for the statutories and through the voluntaries that are assisting us - and this is where we are collaborating very well - we find very young nurses coming in who have much less experience, need more training and take a lot of maternity leave.  We have a challenge at one of our hospitals now that 20% of our midwives at any one time are on maternity leave.  We cannot backfill them from agencies.  This is a huge issue and it concerns recovering from almost eight to ten years of being in a very difficult recruitment position.  The same goes for consultants.  I think consultants will be attracted to work in highly functional environments in which they can do the job well.  It is not all about pay, although pay does matter.  It is about the environment, the team, the capacity, the career development and the opportunities for research and teaching, being part of an academic teaching unit, which is what we are.  There are excellent strengths in St. James's, Tallaght and the Coombe in particular, together with Trinity College Dublin, and these are key to bringing people back on board.  They do not only want to care for patients; they want to do many other things too.  We are now in a position that we know full well that one will not get the best permanent staffing competing on extremely low-volume jobs on the periphery.  One must either move that complex low-volume patient population to where they can get the care or build joint appointments, particularly for surgery, where people can attend for a certain number of days a week.  It is a complex process.  I do not find the voluntary approach in the mix in our group particularly difficult.  I love what is happening in the children's hospital.  It is a model for the future in that there is a goal and a direction around legislative authority.

We do not control it and it is not in our budget but we know how many patients go out.  We have a general sense of what is spent, but what comes to us is more in the line of national data.  There are some creative ideas, one of which we are considering with Tallaght hospital.

The Ireland East hospital group is in a unique position in that it has two large teaching hospitals, three model 3 hospitals, two model 2 hospitals and a number of key voluntary specialty models.  To answer the specific question about Navan, we talk about how smaller hospitals need larger hospitals for safer patient care and the right patient in the right place at the right time, which is true.  Likewise, larger hospitals need smaller hospitals to deliver the appropriate care.  The Mater hospital never had the opportunity it has now in relation to Navan where we can deliver elective, non-complex surgery within Our Lady's Hospital in Navan because we never had that construct until now.  We are doing that in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan.  We are looking at surgeons from the Mater hospital going to Our Lady's Hospital in Navan and delivering surgery there.  Not only does it provide that connectivity, it also gives a boost to Our Lady's Hospital where expertise can be seen coming down that connects them to a much larger connectivity model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Day"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":971,"content":"<p>The point is that in sending patients to Navan, the hospital group is passing Beaumont Hospital.

I would suggest that there is strategic intent in the Ireland East hospital group because long before the hospital group structure was created, the Mater hospital, St. Vincent's hospital and UCD had come together to look at forming an academic health science model.

It is a tripartite grouping of UCD, the Mater hospital and St. Vincent's hospital that has been in place since 2007.  It is an incorporated institution.  As regards Navan, to me, it is all about the clinical links.  There have been significant clinical links and referral pathways over the years between Navan and the Mater hospital.  Being a bit presumptuous or greedy, I would have said we were a little surprised we did not get Cavan included in our group as well because of our joint appointments between the Mater hospital and Cavan.  We were not surprised by the inclusion of Navan.<\/p> <p>  I will say a few more things about academia and the chief academic officer, CAO, a point raised by Deputy O'Connell.  I do not think any of our groups feel that the academic part of it is anything other than highly important.  In our submission, we stressed our ambitions to set up an academic health centre.  We cannot do that without an ambitious third level institution behind us.  Our CAO has been integral to everything we have done so far and is embedded in the management of our group on a daily and weekly basis.  Unfortunately, we are going to lose him as he is about to become president of the University of Limerick.  For us, the appointment of his successor will be critical to how the university and the hospital group go forward.  Trying to get the governance between the hospital group and the university right is very difficult, but to us it is critical.<\/p> <p>  I will make one last remark about medical recruitment, which is a recurring theme.  Nationally, the squeeze is on model 3 hospitals.  I am happy to say that within our group, competition for the model 4 consultant appointments has been relatively robust - maybe not quite as good as it has been in the past but relatively robust.  If we can get the linkages between the model 3 hospitals and the model 4 hospitals properly organised, and we have already appointed about half a dozen different people with joint appointments between the Mater hospital or St. Vincent's hospital and a peripheral hospital, it will make the consultant appointments in the model 3 hospitals far more attractive.  There is a consultant appointment committee in our group.  Every new and replacement appointment goes through that committee and is looked at from a group point of view as to whether the sessions should be reconstructed a little, so a Mater job might give up a quarter of its time to Mullingar and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#CC02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":988,"content":"<p>Could someone respond to Deputy Kelleher's question about the status of Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016111600002#CC02100","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":989,"content":"<p>The hospital group's report reiterates that Waterford is a model 4 hospital.

We have been working with undocumented migrants from our inception and we work with very vulnerable sectors of the labour market, that is, restaurants, agriculture, fishermen and domestic work.  These are at risk sectors where undocumented migrants are working.<br\/><br\/>This is the third time we have come before the committee to discuss this issue.  Last year, the committee made a recommendation on regularisation.  The then Chairman of the committee, who is now the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, stated:<\/p><blockquote>The Joint Committee has held meetings this year relating to both the migrant crisis and the issue of undocumented migrants in Ireland... The committee was told that the current situation could be addressed through a once-off, time bound regularisation scheme which would give undocumented migrants an opportunity to regularise their situation... The committee believes that these are reasonable recommendations and strongly recommends their introduction.  We have written to the Minister for Justice and Equality this week outlining same and we look forward to her response.<\/blockquote> <p>There was no response to this recommendation.  The D&aacute;il was dissolved in February 2016 and the matter did not progress.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child reviewed Ireland's progress in respect of its international commitments and it recommended to the State that all children are entitled to the full protection and implementation of the convention, irrespective of their parents' legal status.  It recommended that Ireland &quot;Expeditiously adopt a comprehensive legal framework which is in accordance with international human rights standards&quot;  and that it provide for &quot;formal procedures for conferring immigration status on children and their families who are in irregular migration situations&quot;.  That was a key recommendation of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child earlier this year.<br\/><br\/>As the Thirty-first D&aacute;il rose, there was cross party support for this issue.  We have the support of more than 50 bodies, including business, trade unions, civil society and political organisations, on this issue.  There is broad support for this issue both in the House and in the broader civil society.<br\/><br\/>We have been working with undocumented migrants for a very long time and have worked with more than 6,000 undocumented migrants since our inception, and 700 this year.  Our economy is improving and our growth projections are healthy.  There is falling unemployment and identifiable labour and skills shortages are beginning to appear in the labour market.  This year, for the first time, we have returned to positive net inward migration, that is more people coming to Ireland than have left.  It is in that context that we are discussing the issue because we need to put in place transitional measures which will help respond to this labour and skills shortages.  My colleague Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari will explain that people are doing jobs.  It is important that we address this burning issue now. <br\/><br\/>What we have learned in the past number of years is that undocumented migrants are more vulnerable to exploitation, poverty and social exclusion.  They encounter significant barriers in terms of accessing services.  It is not possible to accurately determine the number of undocumented people in the State, but it is possible to make an informed estimate.  Members will see at the end of the presentation that we have given a footnote on how we came to these particular numbers.  We estimate there are between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented migrants in the State and of that between 2,000 and 6,000 are undocumented children.  That is untenable.  Many people have been here a very long time, working, living, contributing to the economy and supporting themselves and their families.<\/p><p>They encounter significant barriers in terms of accessing services.  They are also fearful of reporting to the authorities.  We know of people who have had break-ins or burglaries which they have not reported because they are afraid of being detected.  <\/p><p> The people we are talking about here are just the same as the undocumented Irish in the United States.  Obviously this is an issue that is in the news at the moment, particularly in the context of recent developments in the US and I know it is something about which Members of the Houses and the Government are concerned.  We would argue that the Government also needs to be concerned about undocumented people here which would demonstrate a commitment to the issue and add strength to its representations in the United States.<\/p><p> I will now hand over to Priya who will tell us about her situation here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>Good morning.

I lost my visa.  When my children joined me here it was hard.  I was juggling lots of things and trying to get back into the system but I could not do so.  I tried everything.  <\/p> <p>  For four years I was legal but after that, because I failed my exams, I could not get a visa and became undocumented.  Since then, I have tried everything to get back into the system.  My children are doing well in school.  They have friends here and do not want to go back to Mauritius.  Everything I do is for my children.  I am trying hard for them.  My daughter is 16 and is in transition year.  Her teachers and friends do not know that she is undocumented.  She cannot tell them because she is afraid they might talk.  She keeps quiet.  It is a big secret.  We know many children like her who need to hide their true situation.  It is stressful for them, mentally and physically.  They are young but they worry about their future and whether they will be able to move forward.

We do not know if he will be given the right to work in Ireland but we can fix that if this committee helps us.  He is worried.  He is not talking about it because he is a man.

After eight years, we are rooted here.  When we were preparing this speech we were laughing because my daughter is a true Dub.  She speaks like a true Dub.  She does not feel like a Mauritian.

I want to secure my kids' future and continue to contribute to Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  We are the same as the undocumented Irish in the United States and are asking for the same thing.  I am here on behalf of the thousands of undocumented migrants in Ireland.  We ask the members of this committee to write to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on our behalf seeking the introduction of a regularisation process.  We cannot fix this problem without this committee.  Its members must be our voice and must speak up for us.  We are paying tax and are part of the community.  We are just asking to be recognised.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Priya"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>Thank you Priya.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#B00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>I would like to introduce the main findings of our research paper entitled Ireland is Home which is the second wave of research considering the issue of irregular migration in Ireland.  I believe all committee members have received the infographic that we have produced.  I have met a number of members of the committee in recent months but if anyone requires further clarification, the footnote at the end of our submission contains my contact details.<\/p> <p>  Our findings are based on a survey of more than 1,008 undocumented migrants.  The sample is as representative as possible, given that the exact number of such migrants is not known.  Our research found that undocumented migrants have been in Ireland for a long time.  Over 20% have been here for more than ten years, while more than 84% have been here for at least five years.  Obviously, the average length of stay has been extended since we conducted our survey.  A full 89% of those surveyed are working and 66% of them have been in the same job for more than two years, showing a long established connection with their employers.  We found that 69% of them are in full-time employment and are mainly working areas such as food, accommodation, domestic and care work, cleaning and maintenance.  They are working in really valuable areas of the services sector which allows our economy to grow.<\/p><p>On the basis of our research and our work, we have introduced a proposal for a regularisation scheme in the State.  It is important to note that currently there is no legal process for undocumented migrants to gain status in the country.  If somebody is undocumented, there is no legal procedure under which he or she can apply to come forward and ask for their case to be considered.  The only process in place is through an appeal of a deportation order.  The committee will agree that a deportation order entails a very high risk, so it does not facilitate the process of gaining status.<\/p><p> We believe the best solution for undocumented migrants living in Ireland is the introduction of a policy measure or an administrative scheme which will allow for undocumented migrants living here for over four years to have their case heard on a case-by-case basis to secure legal status.  Committee members have the details of our proposal in our submission.  There are two types of applicants, children and families who have been residing here for three years or longer and what we call ordinary applicants who have been residing here for over four years.  There is a serious criminal bar excluding people from the scheme.  The outcome of the scheme is a residency permit, or stamp 4, which is valid for three years and renewable.  In terms of the administration and cost of this scheme, we estimate that failure to regularise undocumented migrants in the State is currently costing approximately &euro;41 million annually.  This is on the basis of unpaid pay related social insurance, PRSI, contributions from those workers and employers each year.  The scheme could be income generating.  A once-off administrative fee together with immigration registration costs and other visa costs could generate approximately &euro;5 million annually.  This is in stark contrast to the &euro;100 million it would cost to deport every undocumented migrant, using the lowest rate cost of deportation.  In summary, the scheme would generate over 12 times more than it would cost over the time of implementation.<\/p><p> Aside from the economic benefits of the scheme, we believe it would be in the interest of the Government to know who is resident in the country and to provide for them.  It will also put the Government in a stronger position when it is negotiating for immigration and common travel arrangements in the context of Brexit.  We also believe we have an obligation to respond to our international commitments, particularly under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to keep up with best practice across countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  We must recognise that Ireland has returned to positive net migration this year and that there are growth projections both for the economy and for the population and migration trends.  Regularising people who are living in the country is a labour market policy tool.  We believe this is a humanitarian response for undocumented individuals, and particularly children, who are living here under constant fears and threats and with the impact of that on their mental health.  The situation of undocumented migrants must be considered in tandem with the current migration and refugee crisis.  Overall, we believe regularising undocumented migrants will benefit not only the migrants, but also the overall cohesion of society, and will address barriers to integration for all.<\/p><p> To conclude, we ask the committee to renew its commitment to the introduction of a regularisation scheme, to produce a report and to make its recommendation available to the Minister for Justice and Equality, along with a recommendation on implementation.  Finally, we call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to respect our international commitments and obligations and to introduce a regularisation scheme as recommended by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Failing to do so will make us lose credibility on the international scene, particularly as we advocate for the rights of undocumented rights in the US.  The solution we are proposing is fair, pragmatic and can benefit all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>Before calling on members, I wish to advise the witnesses that it was the committee who made the decision, reflective of our individual and collective intent, on producing a report and building on the case already made.

It is difficult to see people, particularly children, live in that cycle of fear, where they cannot look beyond the next week.  Hopefully, this committee can continue the work of the previous committee and progress this matter.  The witnesses gave a broad outline and the infographic is very useful, but what has been their interaction with this and the previous Ministers to date?  What have the Ministers said to the witnesses in their engagements with them?  What do the witnesses believe is stopping the Minister progressing this properly?  Have they intensified their engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, the previous chairman of this committee, to press the importance of this matter?

We also sought meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, but we have not secured any either.

That has always been the communication to us.  There has been communication around case-by-case regularisation and this is what we are proposing.  I suppose we really need support from this committee, with the Minister.  We also know there is a good deal of support at Cabinet level on the issue.  It is just about moving it forward in a practical and pragmatic way over the next few months.  We must bring this in within the next six months and there is a time-sensitive aspect to this and its implementation.  We are proposing a fair and pragmatic approach and it is not very burdensome from an administrative perspective.

I do not need to introduce myself as I have met the witnesses on this issue, which is a good sign for Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, as it is a very effective campaigner on the matter.  The witnesses may have the impression that this is a bit like groundhog day.  They have been before the committee on three occasions, although it is the first time I have been here to meet them.

I am fairly satisfied that we will endorse that but we must do more than simply repeating the same report that was issued before.  What more should be in it?  Fianna F&aacute;il previously introduced a legislative proposal in respect of an earned regularisation scheme.  Why would an administrative executive regularisation scheme be preferable to a legislative scheme?  Ms McGinley indicated her belief that this would be a time-sensitive issue and I agree with her about that.  Am I correct in stating her reason for seeing this as time-sensitive is because March will bring Brexit and issues in respect of that?  Is it her fear that Brexit will become an issue as to why this should not be done and we have a window of opportunity to do it now?<\/p> <p>  I very much support the cause being advocated by Ms McGinley and the Irish public in general supports it.  It will very much support it when it is brought to its attention that the kids in the local GAA club or school face some possibility that they could be put out of the country.  They regard these people as Irish and part of the community, like any other kid in the school or club.

What was the methodology of the calculation?  There is a significant gap between 2,000 and 6,000.  Is there a more exact way of determining how many children we are talking about?  Priya talks about the big secret.  It is terribly weighty stuff for any child to have to bear.  Confiding with peers is part of growing up and to have a big secret is a tremendous weight on any child.  Most, perhaps all, of us can empathise with this because we have family or friends who are undocumented in the United States and for whom, after the most recent election, there is increased concern and uncertainty.  We can understand exactly what the witnesses are imparting to us.  Priya talked about her son and said he worries about his position.  We do not want young people to worry in this way because there is already such a weight on them in terms of all the challenges of third level education, as in this case, and everything else besides.  I have not known the isolation associated with living undocumented but I have friends who have and are living it.  I know the huge hurt this causes in their personal lives as a result of the disconnect with family, family events and the tragedy of losing a family member and not being able to be a part of that collective grieving.  All of these things are well documented - no pun intended.  I expect that our committee will reflect, as the previous committee has done, positively on the recommendations the witnesses have offered.<\/p> <p>  I invite, as a closing comment, any reflection specifically on children and how we might get a sharper picture of the numbers we are talking about.             <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#E00900","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>I would like to say something in response to what was said about young children.

I will explain the reason for that.  We have already addressed this issue.  For reasons that are obvious, it is impossible to calculate accurately the number of irregular migrants in this State.  We have calculated three different estimates.  We calculate those estimates by using the only data available from the State, which relate to the number of people who are irregular and are apprehended by the State.  Such people may be asked about their intention to leave the State and issued with deportation orders on that basis, others may be issued with voluntary return orders and others may be given leave to remain.  We have calculated a number by examining the percentages of those who are apprehended and eventually choose one of the three options.  This is supplemented by something called the residual method, which uses a coefficient to determine that a certain percentage of those who are issued permissions to stay here will remain here undetected when they no longer have permission to be here.  We can come up with a broader figure out of that.  We are aware that a certain percentage of these people will have children.  This is the hardest group to gauge because children do not feature anywhere in the immigration system.  Children under the age of 16 do not have to be registered.  Children are born here as well.  We calculate that a percentage of those who are undocumented here will have children over a certain period of time.  We have said that the figure ranges from 2,500 to 6,000 because we have three different estimates.<\/p> <p>  I would like to say two things in conclusion.  We are making a presentation to the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on 30 November next.  We feel it would be useful if both committees could speak to each other about their recommendations.  We will notify the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs that we have been here today.  Ireland was instrumental in drafting the New York declaration, which was the outcome of the UN summit on migrants and refugees.  We pride ourselves on having contributed to that and on taking the presidency of the UN Human Rights Council.  I think it should be mentioned that by failing to act on recommendations from the international community and failing to address human rights issues in this State, we discredit ourselves in front of the international community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I thank Mr. Rojas Coppari, Priya and Ms McGinley for putting their evidence before us this morning and helping us through this process.

My name is Fiona Finn and I am the chief executive officer of NASC.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Jennifer DeWan.<\/p> <p>  NASC is the Irish word for link.  NASC is an NGO based in Cork.  Since 2000 NASC has worked to link migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and ethnic minorities with their rights. <\/p> <p>  One of the key issues that NASC works on is family reunification.  Over the past 16 years NASC has worked with thousands of migrants who sought to bring their family members to Ireland.  In the past two years we have helped reunite 137 families, some of which were refugee families.  Some of the families fled war, conflict and persecution.  As a result, we have a huge amount of expertise in this area.  We have a strong knowledge of the issues and barriers people must face when seeking to bring family members to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As everyone will know, one of the largest humanitarian crisis is taking place since the Second World War.  Our thinking and approach to the problem is that family reunification can form part of Ireland's solution and answer to the crisis.  We have all seen the horrific images on our television screens.  We have seen images of people in rickety boats desperately trying to reach the safety of Europe's shores.  We have also seen families, women and children located on the borders of Europe, living in makeshift tents, freezing and starving while waiting for Europe to do something to protect them.  We have seen countless images of drowned, injured and starving children.  We have been horrified by the images and rightly so.  It is testament to our humanity, goodness and belief that we believe we can make a difference.  It is a tribute to who we are and to the Ireland that our ancestors fought to make a reality a century ago.  <\/p> <p>  The migrant crisis seems enormous to everybody.  People are left feeling helpless and they do not know where to start.  The Government has offered to bring 4,000 people here under a resettlement and relocation programme, which is a positive step.  Recently agreement was reached to bring 200 children from Calais to Ireland, which is highly commendable.<\/p> <p>  From our experience of working with refugees and people already settled in Ireland, we know such measures are not enough.  Every day Syrians and naturalised citizens who live in Ireland can see what is happening in their countries on a screen.  They have seen images of their homeland lying in ruins.  They have families living in the region.  Some of them have immediate family members there while others have extended family members there.  Their parents, brothers, sisters, cousins, nephews and nieces are fighting for survival and their families here are desperate to bring them here to safety.  The families here have told us that they can support, provide for, house and look after their people and all they need is an opportunity to bring their family members here.  We have worked with families with some degree of success.  From our experience of the system for non-refugee family reunification, we believe there has been a failure on behalf of the Government to exercise what we call positive discretion.<\/p><p>Matters are remarkably difficult, for example, for Syrians who are naturalised Irish citizens living here and looking to bring in elderly parents.  It is becoming extraordinarily difficult for them to do that.  I will set out an example involving one gentleman.  He is a professional and a naturalised Irish citizen.  He earned the requisite amount of money, that is, &euro;70,000 per year, required to bring his elderly parents to Ireland.  He was refused because both his parents suffer from a degenerative disease.  The view was that the area where the family was living was relatively unscathed by the war.  This is the response Irish citizens are getting from the Department.  They are rather disillusioned and it seems to them that Ireland is not supporting them as it should.<br\/><br\/>Under immigration provisions, an element of discretion can be exercised.  However, our experience is that this discretion is not being exercised at present.  This is a critical moment for us in that the International Protection Act is about to come into force.  This Act removes the right for refugees to apply for extended family members to come to Ireland.  Once the International Protection Act comes into place, refugees in Ireland can only apply for spouses and children under the age of 18 years.  There is no way they can apply for parents, siblings or any other family members.  That door will be permanently shut within the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>We are looking for a safety net.  A safety net is required.  We have a pragmatic and practical solution to provide a humanitarian safety net to bring families together in a safe and legal way.  We are removing the need for people's families to make dangerous land and sea crossings and we are seeking to stop the traffickers who are profiting from this human misery.  This provides us with an opportunity to support Irish communities and to finally do something practical for those fleeing conflict.  We are asking for sponsorship for family reunification applications.  We are calling on the Government to grant safe passage to reunite families by way of three simple measures.  The first is to introduce a humanitarian admission programme.  Such a programme was in place in 2014 and it was specifically tailored for Syrians.  Our idea is for the Government to look at the programme that was developed in 2014 and build on it.  We are asking it to consider a greater humanitarian response in its decision-making for non-refugee family reunification applications.  We are also asking the Government for the introduction of a sponsorship scheme to allow Irish people who are willing and able to sponsor applicants to do so.  Irish people have come to us and said that they want to be able to sponsor families to come to Ireland.  The idea is to develop a clear sponsorship scheme to enable Irish people to support Syrians who are living in Syria and the surrounding territories to come to Ireland.  We are seeking something along the lines of the Canadian and German programmes.<br\/><br\/>Given the current global climate, including the rise of extremism and of the right, we have to take every opportunity to do what is right, not simply what is politically expedient.  We are calling on the State not to react with passion or <i>ad hoc<\/i>solutions.  There is a requirement for us to act positively and decisively to deliver stable, sustainable and durable solutions.  We need to deliver actions that will mark Ireland out as a leader in championing inclusion when all about us want exclusion, tolerance when people want hatred and human rights when people want authoritarianism.  This is our chance to do something.  It would be a small measure and no great burden on the public purse.  This is our opportunity to do something to bring families together, in safety, out of the current conflict, not only now but in future.<br\/><br\/>We are open to answering any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>Does Ms DeWan wish to comment at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#H00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":1057,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer DeWan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I am going to open the discussion up to members.

To be fair, the Department is taking a fairly positive view when it comes to extended family members seeking refugee family unification.  Again, it very much depends on income and dependency.

Some of the decisions coming back are puzzling and there seems to be no consistency in the decision-making.<\/p> <p>  In the case of non-refugee family reunification or people who are applying for visas, the refusal rate is high.  The relevant policy document basically states that the position of the Department is that an applicant will be refused unless she can prove otherwise.  It is a particularly high barrier to overcome.  The need for favourable decisions is even more critical now given the coming into force of the International Protection Act.  The Act will mean that many refugees are going to have to move from the refugee family reunification process to the immigration framework.

Some of the Palestinians living in Cork have been here for a long time.  Since the conflict in Syria began, we have seen a number of Syrian Palestinians arrive, but they are in the minority.  I agree, however, that it is a significant issue.  In Greece and Italy there is an issue with registration and how the relocation process is working.  The problem is supposed to have been sorted in Greece, but it is a Europe-wide issue.  We have said we will take 2,000 refugees from Greece and Italy.  There was an issue with how the Greek authorities were administrating the process and registering individuals.  No funding or additional resources have been given to Greece where refugees are living in dire circumstances and want to move on, but they are getting stuck at the border.  There is a problem in funding the process.<\/p> <p>  Ireland could be more proactive.  We have been told that people do not want to come to here, but I find that hard to believe.  If a family living in a camp on the Macedonian border were asked if they would like to have safe passage to Ireland, I think they would come.  I question how proactive we are in identifying people in the field and bringing them to Ireland.  The numbers relocating to other European countries have increased.  As Deputy Mick Wallace highlighted, there is an underlying resistance to the relocation of Afghans.  There is an underlying security concern that is beginning to come to the surface.  There is a perception that older Afghan children pose a security risk.  We refute this, but security concerns are influencing how we are responding to the crisis.  That is my view based on some of the feedback we have been getting.  It is much easier for us to get a positive decision for a female, particularly a female Christian, but males are more challenging and the majority of the decisions on young Muslim males are negative.  It is never overt, but it is covert.  That needs to be said and the issue needs to be tackled.  We are working with a man who wishes to bring his two older brothers here, but he has more or less been told that security is the issue.  This will not be stated in the letter of refusal, but we know that security is the issue.  Both of his brothers are unmarried; one is in his 40s, while the other is in his 50s.  They are both willing to undergo any security check required.  They are willing to be held until it is established that they are not terrorists.  If they had wanted to join a terrorist group, they could have done so before now, but that is a factor that is coming into play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Finn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>There is definitely rhetoric about bringing the right sort of person here and it comes into the security discussion.

I do not know how the needs of a 16 year old differ greatly from that of a 17 year old.  The level of support the younger child needs may be greater but supports should be based on the individual as opposed to the individual's age profile.  In law, an unaccompanied minor is defined as someone travelling alone under the age of 18.  The recognised age is 18 and making any other distinctions below that is questionable.

By pushing for younger minors, 15 or younger, we are not acknowledging the longer-term care needs of aged out minors.<br\/><br\/>I am not sure if the question emanates from concerns about the situation in the UK.  Questions have been asked about how we determine a person's age and newspapers like the <i>Daily Mail <\/i>have published articles about minors at Calais claiming that some are not minors but are, in some cases, in their 30s.  The fact that the consent of an adult is required before a medical examination can be carried out on a minor to determine his or her age is having a negative impact on unaccompanied minors because there is a push to accept only those who look quite young.  We have seen cases, in the Irish context, where people are age disputed.  They come in and say they are 16 but that is disputed and they end up in direct provision at 16, on their own.  We have seen that happen in a number of cases and it can be very traumatic for the young person in question.  <br\/><br\/>There are lots of issues surrounding the identification of unaccompanied minors which must be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016111600002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer DeWan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>Thank you for that.

The Republic of Ireland has a public road network of more than 99,000 km, some 5,400 km of which comprises national roads with the remainder comprising regional or local roads.  The chief executive of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Mr. Michael Nolan, is here today to address issues relating to national roads.  My colleague and I hope to address matters pertaining to regional and local roads.  Expenditure on regional and local roads has decreased from more than &euro;600 million in 2008 to less than &euro;300 million in recent years.  Unfortunately, the latter amount falls well short of what is required to maintain the network as estimated under the strategic framework for investment in land transport.  A recent survey, which was based on limited data, suggested that the backlog of repairs increased from &euro;3 billion in 2005 to more than &euro;10 billion in 2016.<br\/><br\/>The Department has two main grant programmes to cater for major schemes separately from maintenance.  The specific grant programme covers projects costing &euro;5 million or less and the strategic grant programme covers projects costing more than &euro;5 million.  To maximise the moneys available for maintenance, a limited fund of just over &euro;10 million is available this year for these two grant programmes.  This represents a decrease on the &euro;170 million that was available for them in 2008.  While the capital plan allows for investment of &euro;140 million in such programmes over the period from 2016 to 2022, much of this money is being provided in the later years of the plan.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has indicated that he intends to make a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector under the upcoming review of the capital plan.  Local improvement schemes relate to works on private roads, while community involvement schemes relate to works on public roads.  It is still possible for local authorities to undertake both types of scheme, but such a decision needs to be made at local level because money is no longer ring-fenced for such works.  The programme for Government indicates that as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for regional and local roads.  The Minister has indicated that the issue of increased funding will be raised in the context of the capital plan review.<br\/><br\/>The committee asked us to speak about the impact of Brexit on cross-Border projects.  Commitments regarding the A5 are governed by the Stormont House agreement and implementation plan, known as the Fresh Start agreement, which reaffirms the Government's commitment to provide funding of &pound;50 million for the A5 project and an additional &pound;25 million to ensure the first phase of the project, from Newbuildings to north of Strabane, can commence as soon as the necessary planning issues have been resolved by the authorities in Northern Ireland.  Options for the proposed Narrow Water Bridge are under discussion by a group of senior officials.  An update in respect of both projects will be presented to the upcoming plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which is scheduled for 18 December.  I will be happy to address any questions from members of the committee.<br\/><br\/>The committee also asked us to comment on the national mitigation plan, which is very distinct from the roads topics we are discussing today.  At the moment, there is no transport element of the plan <i>per se<\/i>, although there will be in due course.  Therefore, it might be more fruitful for the committee to consider the issue at a later stage when the draft national mitigation plan is out for consultation and we have a document about which to talk.  I am always happy to help the committee and I can refer the matter to my colleagues from our climate change division who are present if the committee wishes, but I suggest it might be a more fruitful use of the committee's time to leave the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>What is the anticipated timeframe for the national mitigation plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#B00300","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>A draft plan will be produced for consultation before the end of the year.

Before I move on to the matters the committee has asked us to address, I would like to make some introductory remarks about Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  It was established under the Roads Act 2015, which provided for the merger of the staff and functions of the Railway Procurement Agency with those of the National Roads Authority.  The name Transport Infrastructure Ireland was specified by the Minister as the name by which the NRA may describe itself for operational purposes. TII is a non-commercial semi-State body that operates under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Its primary purpose is to provide an integrated approach to the development, maintenance and operation of the national road network and light rail infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  I will now address specific matters of interest which come under the remit of TII.  Funding for national road maintenance and renewal has reduced severely since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008.  Maintenance funding decreased by approximately 35% between 2008 and 2016 against a background of significant additional commitments in the maintenance of the new motorway network and more costly winter operations.  The costs associated with the safe and effective operation of the motorway network are significantly higher than those for other road types.  Although modernised roads are much safer for road users, we have to ensure levels of safety and operational efficiency are maintained.  Road pavement, which constitutes a substantial portion of the road asset, is valued at approximately &euro;30 billion.  We estimate that the current level of investment in pavement renewals is less than one third of that required to sustain the pavement condition in the long term.  We should be replacing approximately 400 km of road pavement annually, but we are not doing so.  If we continue to defer essential renewals, the cost will ultimately exceed significantly what would be incurred if the works were carried out in a timely manner.<\/p> <p>  TII's strategy for the improvement of the national road network is determined with regard to three strategic priorities: asset management, network rehabilitation and operations; minor and safety works; and major improvement projects.  This approach is consistent with the priorities for future investment outlined in the strategic investment framework for land transport, published by the Department last year.  As I have mentioned, a key consideration is to achieve steady state maintenance of the road network by allocating available funding to priority needs.  This prevents the degradation of the asset and ensures the benefits of the road infrastructure are realised.  The second priority relates to minor improvement works, the benefits of which relate to the safety and efficiency of the road network.  Minor works are typically short realignments or safety improvements.  The current construction programme of realignments will end soon.  While approximately 50 other schemes of this nature are at various stages of planning, none of them can proceed to construction in the short term.  Major schemes are considered in the context of the funding needs for the first two priorities and the infrastructure and capital investment plan.  TII considers the future needs of the national roads network in the context of the anticipated demand associated with economic and population growth, road safety, improvements in accessibility to the regions and integration with other policies.<\/p> <p>  The capital investment plan provides for the construction of eight major national road projects and identifies five other projects to be progressed to construction subject to planning.  The total investment is &euro;730 million, with 90% of this spread over the last three years of the seven-year plan.  This funding profile dictates the date on which construction will start.  Most projects will start construction after 2019, with the exception of the widening of the M7 at Naas.  TII's strategy is to advance enabling works during the early years of the seven-year plan.<\/p><p>Under the public private partnerships, PPP, programme three new roads are being delivered.  These are the M17 Gort to Tuam motorway, the N25 New Ross bypass and the M11 Gorey to Enniscorthy motorway.  While these schemes are on target and are set to deliver significant benefits and value for money, roads are not included in the next phase of the PPP programme. <br\/><br\/>Should additional funding be allocated following the mid-term review of the plan TII will look at the potential to accelerate certain projects, the construction of additional projects and the planning of others, including the upgrade of the strategic connection between Cork and Limerick.  As it can take five years to achieve planning approval for a major roads project we risk having a shortage of approved projects for inclusion in any new capital investment plan.  Failure to respond to future needs will lead to increased congestion, longer and less reliable journey times, less safe roads, higher costs and suppressed economic activity.<br\/><br\/><b><i><\/i><\/b>I wish to refer to the North-South transport infrastructure area.  The only cross-Border national route planned at the moment is the link crossing the River Foyle between Lifford and Strabane.  The construction of the link is conditional on the construction of the A5 at Strabane.  At the southern end of the A5 there will be a need to agree details where the new A5 meets the N2.  As that section of the A5 will not be built for some years, neither Monaghan County Council nor the TII is actively engaged with Transport Northern Ireland on the crossing. <br\/><br\/>There are other national road initiatives in the Border area that do not involve a crossing.  Donegal County Council is commencing the preparation of the design of a number of priority schemes.  It is also progressing the construction of a number of minor realignment projects.  Leitrim County Council will shortly open another realigned section of the N16 at Cornacloy.  Monaghan County Council has completed a number of short upgrade schemes on the N2.  In County Louth, land for the N52 Ardee link road has been purchased but funding is not available for construction.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I have kept my opening remarks brief.  We are happy to answer questions on any scheme and matters of interest.  If we do not have the information requested to hand we will follow up with a written statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan and call Deputy Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#C00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan for his presentation.  He has stated that all the lands have been purchased for the N52 bypass in Ardee.  Can he outline when this badly needed bypass will be started?  I have stated many times previously the need for Ardee to have the bypass.  The town comes to a standstill on a daily basis due to the high level of traffic and the situation is getting worse.  It is vital for Ardee's town centre that the bypass is completed in the near future.  Mr. Nolan stated in his opening remarks that \"we risk having a shortage of approved projects for inclusion in any new capital investment plan.\"  I urge his organisation to include the Ardee bypass as a priority project.<\/p> <p>  I would appreciate if Mr. Nolan would give me an update on the Narrow Water Bridge project.  I would also like an update on the funding promised by the Irish Government towards the A45 motorway in Northern Ireland, particularly in the light of the UK's decision to withdraw from the EU.  Should circumstances for the A5 change and our commitment to provide funding no longer be required, am I right in saying that the &euro;75 million promised by the Irish Government can be used on projects in the South?  <\/p> <p>  Figures show that the national roads are comprised of only 6% of the total network yet carry 45% of all traffic; regional roads account for 13% of the total network and carry 30% of all traffic; and local roads account for 81% of the total network.  As the delegations will know, funding for local roads has been slashed dramatically over the past number of years.  In my own county of Louth the current state of the local roads network is a matter of great concern.  In my opinion the local improvements scheme was worthwhile and allowed for investment in these roads.  The majority of local authorities have opted not to allocate funding for the schemes and instead concentrate on funding public roads.

I missed Mr. O'Leary's statement but heard Mr. Nolan's statement, which makes for a depressing read.  I made a few notes about the TII's statement.<\/p><p>My first concern is about where the A5 meets the N2.  Mr. Nolan has said that the TII is not actively engaged with Transport Northern Ireland.  Why?  Mr. Chris Hazzard is the Minister for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.  He has given a commitment that the A5 project will proceed.  In the original St. Andrews Agreement a sum of &pound;400 million was committed to the project by the Northern Ireland Government and Department at the time.  I do not know whether the TII has requested a meeting with the Minister for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.  If not, why not?  He has actively sought a meeting with his counterpart in the Republic but to no avail.  I seek an update on the A5 project.  Can a commitment be given that the project will be included in the mid-term review?  <\/p><p>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I wish to refer to the land purchased for the Ardee bypass.  Why has the project been delayed?  A delay makes no sense.  Can the project be included in the mid-term review?  Can it be progressed to the next stage?  One often hears that a project has been delayed because the land has yet to be purchased or the project is only at the planning stage.  It makes no sense to have the land sitting idle and waiting for the project to proceed.<\/p><p>I wish to highlight the minuscule additional funding provided for the regional and local roads issue.  Such minuscule funding will ensure the continued deterioration of our roads.  An additional &euro;25 million is less then &euro;1 million per local authority.  I remember the Chief Executive of Louth County Council said two years ago that funding was so dire that the local authority had to prioritise which potholes to fill.  The amount of additional funding does not give us hope.  If one does not maintain roads it costs more in the long term.  Inadequate funding has a knock-on effect on everything else, not just the upkeep and maintenance of roads but safety measures and realignment projects, etc. fall by the wayside.  <\/p><p>Mr. Nolan said that 90% of capital funding would arrive in the latter years.  There is nothing new in his statement but I do not blame him personally.  Its a complete and utter farce that we must accept a lack of funding and the dire state of national, regional and local roads.  Unfortunately, the <i>status quo<\/i>will remain for the foreseeable future.  Can the witnesses guarantee there will be increased funding for all of these projects in the mid-term review?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#C00400","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses have a set of multipliers that show the impact of not investing in the roads network?  Is it staggered over one year, three years and five years, for example?  Obviously it costs more to carry out significant pieces of work.<\/p> <p>   A lack of funding will also have an impact on the capital plan.  I presume that the European Investment Bank will be one of the funding sources.  The money will have to be paid back but it is quite cheap to borrow at the moment.<\/p><p>Is it more likely an argument could be made to exceed the amount we are permitted to borrow if it assisted with climate change mitigation?  Would it be  more likely to be permitted if we were borrowing for, for example, rail development, particularly in urban centres?  I am thinking of the DART underground project which would result in a significant volume of traffic being taken off the roads and which would also address the congestion issue, insurance costs and go some way towards meeting our climate change targets.<\/p><p> I am surprised to hear the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is not doing a sectoral plan in its own right because I had understood that it was going to do so but now it is going to be reflected in the national plan.  Given transport is one of the three big areas in terms of climate change targets, I would have thought it required that attention in its own right.  We could take action on the area of transport but it would be more difficult to make progress on agriculture.  The witnesses might reflect on that.<\/p><p> Funding for the A5 road project was committed in the context of us being part of the Single Market and in the context of the peace process.  It would be strange if we made that investment and then found there to be a Border post at the end of that road towards the cost of which we had made a contribution.  That aspect would be quite useful in terms of hearing what the attitude is or if there are discussions taking place on that.  Clearly, we are now in a very changed environment from the one that prevailed when the commitment to that funding was made.  Normalisation of movement between the North and the South is terrific and we do not want to see that damaged.  The lack of focus on that normalisation of movement during the Brexit campaign was quite disrespectful.

We appear to be contributing to creating a hard Border under Brexit rather than anything else. That is through no fault of anybody around this table, rather it is because we do not have the resources for it.  Therefore, we need to expand our resources.  My first question relates to how are we utilising our existing resources.  How do the witnesses assess and decide what money goes where?

I am looking forward to it.  That compliment was a gift from him.<\/p> <p>  I left Boyle, which is in the north west, at 5.30 this morning.  If I drive from Galway, Belfast or from any other part of the island, there is access to a motorway or a dual carriageway. In the case of the N4, N5, N3 and N2 there is no motorway extending beyond Mullingar or Kinnegad.  What will be done about that?  There is a dual carriageway in Leitrim but we want to open up the north west, especially in the context of cross-Border co-operation.  I welcome the funding for the A5.  When I left Boyle at 5.30 a.m. the traffic was not bad, but if one travels that road after 7 a.m. or 8 a.m., it takes more than an hour to travel from Boyle to Mullingar.  It is an issue if we want to open up access to the west.  What is happening about that?<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about cross-Border routes and I want to focus on the N16 between the west and Belfast.  Other speakers mentioned other routes which are also important.  The N16 routes comprises 10 km in Sligo, 30 km in Leitrim and 7 km in Cavan.  Some work has been done on it but it needs to be upgraded in the context of cross-Border co-operation.  I am concerned that no works are taking place on the A4 between Belcoo and Enniskillen.  It could take an hour to drive through Enniskillen. <\/p> <p>  I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and, with respect to the Good Friday Agreement and cross-Border co-operation, it involves not only the North and the South but also the east and the west.  More needs to be done there.  I am not blaming the witnesses but I am seeking their views on this and it probably also would involve a political decision on both sides.<\/p> <p>  We need to consider the upgrading of national secondary routes.  No money has been spent on national secondary routes during the past 25 years.  I can understand that the focus was on upgrading all the national primary routes.  Many of those have been upgraded and we now need to consider the national secondary routes.  I will be parochial again and point to some works that have been done on the N61 between Boyle and the county town of Roscommon.  It links the N4 to the N5 and to the N6.  It makes sense to link Roscommon town with Athlone and to link Boyle with Roscommon town.  It makes sense to have that arterial link from the north west to the south east.  The witnesses may contradict me on that, and I do not mind if they do, but it is an aspect we need examine.  Instead of a few million euro being provided to remove one or two bends, we need to consider upgrading the national secondary routes.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about a bypass project.  There is major traffic congestion in Carrick-on-Shannon, the county town in Leitrim, at the weekends with people travelling from Sligo to Dublin on a Friday.  It could take 45 to 50 minutes to get through Carrick-on-Shannon.  With all the rivers and lakes in the area, there is only one route through it.  How long will it take for the completion of the proposed bypass around Carrick-on-Shannon, a project which I know is not shovel ready?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#D00400","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Sherlock to be followed by Senator Kieran O'Donnell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#D00500","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>I note with interest Mr. Nolan's submission, especially where he refers to the capital investment programme, saying, \"Should additional funding be allocated following the mid-term review of the plan, TII will look at the potential to accelerate certain projects, the construction of additional projects and the planning of others, including the upgrade of the strategic connection between Cork and Limerick.\"  In the context of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and regional economic growth and development, the Cork to Limerick corridor, or the Atlantic corridor as it was known previously, is a vital link because there are more than 300,000 jobs earmarked for that region in the action plan.<\/p><p>The Cork to Limerick corridor or the Atlantic corridor as it was known previously, is a vital link because more than 300,000 jobs are earmarked in the Action Plan for Jobs for that region.  Is the M20 being actively considered in discussions between Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister in terms of ensuring that the project, which is so vital to the economic and social interests of the people in the south, south west and west, is progressed?  Is there any potential for money to be made available on the basis of the submission that has been made to this committee?  The witnesses have said that it can take five years to achieve planning approval for major roads projects.  They also said that we risk having a shortage of approved projects for inclusion in any new capital investment plan.  Failure to respond to future needs will lead to increased congestion.  Reading between the lines, TII is sending a signal that this project is vital and that funding is required to get it through planning or at least to the first phase.  I am not talking about an entire package of funding for absolute completion but funding to at least progress the project.  Is there a funding line for that project?  <\/p><p> Under the previous capital investment plan announced by the last Government there was a specific reference to the relief road for Mallow.  As everyone knows, Mallow forms part of the M20 corridor.  The people of Mallow and north Cork want to know when they can expect to see that work starting.  They also want to know if TII, the Department and the Minister are considering the question of dovetailing the two projects.  How will the two projects coalesce?  <\/p><p> There is an understanding on all sides of the need for the M20 Cork to Limerick project.  That is understood by everybody in an apolitical sense but the question is, \"When?\".  The submission to the committee today suggests that a political decision on funding will be vital in order to get the project off the starting blocks.  <\/p><p> I want to acknowledge the constructive engagement I have had with TII on national secondary roads.  Notwithstanding the dearth of funding that is available for such roads there have been some improvements to the N72 and the N73  in the north Cork area of late.  However, further funding is required for these roads.  There is a serious public safety issue, particularly with regard to the Mallow to Mitchelstown link which serves as a corridor west of Mallow for connectivity onward to Dublin.  It is a vital transport corridor but there are parts of that national secondary road that are so narrow that two lorries trying to pass each other would have to slow down to 5 kmph to do so safely.  I am making the case for further investment from a road safety point of view and ask that this be actively considered and prioritised in the TII budget line in co-operation with Cork County Council.  <\/p><p> To reiterate my earlier point, if it takes five years to achieve planning approval for major road projects such as the M20 then we need a signal now from TII that it is engaging with the Department on the Cork to Limerick section of the route.

I wish to deal specifically with the upgrade of the Limerick to Cork motorway, the M20.  In his submission, Mr. Nolan referred to \"the construction of additional projects and the planning of others, including the upgrade of the strategic connection between Cork and Limerick\".  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions in the Seanad with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  As recently as 6 October I asked that the Minister would engage with Mr. Michael Nolan of TII to determine what work had been done on the previous M20 project which was suspended in November 2011.  I wish to compliment the Minister and his officials, particularly Mr. Dominic Mullaney and Mr. Nolan from TII for their work in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the Minister has given approval to reactivate the planning process on the M20.  In that context, I ask Mr. Nolan to elaborate on how the process will be reactivated, the various stages involved and the cost.  My understanding is that it will cost in the order of &euro;1 million.  I very much welcome this initiative because the project was suspended for five years.  It has now been given the green light and it is important that it gets moving prior to the mid-term review of the capital programme so that no time is lost.  Over the next few months there will be re-engagement on the planning process to determine what was done up to November 2011 and work will begin on preparing a brief for the appointment of strategic consultants.  I seek details from Mr. Nolan and from Mr. Mullaney and his departmental colleague Mr. O'Leary on how this process will work.  I am delighted for Limerick and Cork that the M20 motorway is back on the live agenda again with TII and the Department.  I am particularly interested in the timeframe involved.  How long will it take to re-engage in the planning process and how much work will be done prior to the aforementioned mid-term review?  What are the costs involved?  I ask the witnesses to give an outline of how long a project like the M20 will take.  Reference was made in communications to me to five stages, the first of which is the approval to commence the early planning activity, which will run to &euro;1 million.  The second is the approval to commence planning and design, which will run to between &euro;12 million and &euro;15 million.  Next is the business case by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and then the approval to submit to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and purchase the land, which is estimated to cost &euro;150 million to &euro;180 million.  The final stage is construction, which will cost in the region of &euro;600 million.  <\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to give the committee an outline of where we are at.  This is very positive for the M20 project, which I have been working on for a long time with the Minister, the Department and Mr. Nolan from TII.

The first is specific to the Department and TII.  I am not sure if other members have encountered this, but when we table parliamentary questions to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and they are referred to TII for reply, increasingly, and particularly of late, I have noticed that we tend to receive very much a copy-and-paste response in which even the specific question is no longer referred to.  At the very least, I expect that there should be a reference to the question that was asked in the response we get in the letters sent back to us.  This is quite important for the sake of housekeeping.  For the sake of parliamentary accountability, responses should come directly from the Minister.  For that matter, there is far too much delegation in this regard.  We have the same issue with responses from the Department of Health and the HSE.  We are where we are, as the saying goes, but I expect at least when answers are sought that the responses sent to Deputies should be a little more detailed and should at least refer to the questions asked so that we know in our offices which questions are being responded to.  I ask that this happen.<\/p> <p>  Another matter I would like to raise regarding accident data is how TII decides what is and is not a priority project.  It is a very reactive system.  I am sure most of the members here can recall cases in which public representatives, whether councillors, Deputies, Senators or MEPs, have raised with TII cases of specific concern that they have heard of on the ground, but \"the computer says no\" because the data or the number of accidents is not high enough.  Then an accident occurs at the particular location and all the public representatives say \"we told you so\".  There is an over-reliance on the data.  Cognisance needs to be taken of public representatives' continual and repeated calls for action in certain areas.  There is not enough listening in this regard.  A revert to process is the default response.  There needs to be a little give and take.  Not to be parochial, but I will point to examples in Kerry.  The Killarney bypass junctions with Lewis Road and Madam's Hill and the Tralee-Killarney road are just two examples in very close proximity to each other that public representatives constantly raise, but the TII and the Department respond that they are not an issue.  These are examples where the process needs to be tweaked.  I would like to know the witnesses' views on them.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise another issue that causes much ill-will on the ground, namely, the fact that TII takes successful applications to local authorities for planning permission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la because of planning applications on national secondary routes or other roads under TII's remit.  There needs to be a more common sense approach to this, and each case needs to be treated on its individual merits.  Again, I know of cases - for example, on the N72 east of Killarney, a wide, straight section of road - in which family members are seeking to use existing entrances.  One case concerns the relative of an elderly farmer who has inherited a farm and who wants to live on the farm, keep the community alive and look after that elderly person.  Their case has been frustrated for years because of NRA and TII objections.  I have been to the area in question to examine the situation and the logistics.  TII's actions make no sense in this case.  As a result of the blanket approach to it, real people are being victimised and their lives are being put on hold.  I would like to know the witnesses' views on this.  Will they engage with people in a more constructive way as distinct from the default response to the effect that local authorities have the discretion to make allowances for such cases?  That is not working on the ground for people, and this needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I also add my voice of support to what is a very important regional project, namely, the M20, which needs to be examined.  Regarding the choice of preferred routes, if one looks at the map of the plans, there is the possible M20 route, but is the M8 and its proximity to Limerick also an option?  There are always local concerns about areas being far away from the proposed motorway and so on, but are all options being considered?  What is the current situation?  We have seen cases in the past number of years in which motorways were built parallel to each other where mathematically it might have been more affordable to choose a different route and have one motorway instead of two running parallel in relative proximity to each other.<\/p> <p>  Why did we not see any significant increase in the Department's allocation in this year's budget?  What efforts were made at departmental level to increase the Department's allocation for 2017?  Much of the feedback I have received since the budget has centred on a sense of disappointment that other Departments scored much higher and more strongly than the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is an issue of concern among many representatives.  What is the situation in this regard?  One of the issues being conveyed from the ground up to representatives is that of the real schemes such as local improvement schemes.  We are told no funding is available for the last kilometre to many people's homes in rural communities in particular.  What is the situation in this regard?<\/p> <p>  The N22 Ballyvourney-Macroom bypass is in the capital plan, which is a huge step forward.  The matter had been neglected for many years by successive Governments.  My understanding now is that a recent tender has issued for the fencing off of the corridor for the road.  Could the witnesses confirm if this is the case?  This is a massively important project for the region.  As a Kerry Deputy, I would say it could be the greatest socio-economic development for us for many decades.  I see it as a priority and hope that the mid-term review will see an acceleration of the project, which is nearly shovel-ready, as the witnesses will be aware.<\/p> <p>  I also ask for an update on the N69 and the Dingle relief road, which are also in the capital plan.  My colleague, councillor S&eacute;amus Cosa&iacute; Fitzgerald, has been constantly lobbying on the issue of the Dingle relief road, as the witnesses will be aware, and he is very anxious for news on it.  The road is now on the Wild Atlantic Way and therefore, like many towns along the western seaboard, flooded with traffic.  Dingle in particular is choked with traffic.  The relief road would not only take traffic related to heavy fishing industry out of the town, but also provide additional parking, which has become a huge issue in Dingle and, I am sure, in other towns throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Leary to respond first and Mr. Nolan after him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#F00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":1161,"content":"<p>The committee has raised a wide range of issues.

I will try to address the questions that relate to regional and local roads and perhaps some of the more general operational policies that apply.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the Narrow Water bridge.  As noted in my opening statement, the two relevant Departments continue to engage with each other to develop options for the development of the project and are also engaging very closely with local stakeholders, North and South.<\/p><p>Following the last meeting with the local stakeholders it was agreed that the two Departments would develop criteria to assess the options that might be available.  The Deputy will be aware that a specific option was developed previously.  However, when it went to tender it was found that the cost was significantly in excess of the funding available at the time.  The important point is to produce options aimed at addressing the priorities of local communities in terms of developing tourism and some of the specific traffic-related issues around Newry.  We hope to come back to the local stakeholders in the new year with criteria that could be used to evaluate the various options.<\/p><p> Deputy Munster raised the question of the Narrow Water Bridge.  There is a wider funding issue.  The principal challenge continues to be the fiscal constraints faced by the Government and the many competing resources.  The work of the Department in preparing the strategic framework on investment was critical to providing an evidence base for putting the case for increased investment.  A number of Deputies and Senators have made points about the value of maintaining the asset base we have.  It has been the experience globally that many countries which would be perceived as having gold-standard infrastructure have not continued to invest in its maintenance and now face significant challenges and competitive disadvantages because of this.  One of the questions raised related to the priorities in terms of national, regional and local roads.  Our priority is to get back to a position, as early as possible, in the capital plan whereby we do not face a deteriorating national infrastructure with the associated implications for national competitiveness, regional development and safety.  It is critical to maintain the asset base we have and then to add some of the key or critical links that I referred to in the capital plan.  They will serve similar objectives.<\/p><p> Sometimes I suffer from being unable to read my own handwriting.

Irrespective of the source of funding, the basic elements of the fiscal framework remain in place at European level.  The committee will have to forgive me because this is outside the general area of roads, but my understanding is that the European Investment Bank has environmentally-related goals among its priorities in the context of various projects, including those related to climate change.  Although that may be the case, we will be constrained by the overall level of borrowing available, irrespective of the source.<\/p> <p>  It has been the experience that apparently clever ways of getting off-balance-sheet seldom turn out to be that clever in the long run.  The key criteria for decisions on investment will remain the same.  We continue to work closely with the European Investment Bank to identify opportunities where the bank can assist in appropriate investments.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy also referred to the national mitigation plan.  It is a national mitigation plan that will include agricultural sectoral elements, as well as transport.  The framework set by the legislation is for a national mitigation plan, but with the sectoral elements put together.  Clearly, when we are considering the question of emissions, it is the overall impact of emissions that is most important.  We are working on making our contribution to that plan.  The consultation process will be critical.  We hope to have it published before the end of the year as a draft.  The Government is committed to publication of the draft before Christmas.  Separate inputs are being prepared by those in the agriculture, built environment and power generation sectors.  The process is being led by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Clearly, this is challenging.  We continue to work on the preparation of the transport contribution to be put together with the rest.<\/p> <p>  There are some ancillary initiatives.  The Minister launched a public consultation initiative last week to develop a draft national policy framework on alternative fuels infrastructure with a view to removing barriers that exist towards greater uptake of low-emissions vehicles.  Profound changes to transport systems will be required if we are to contribute to our national policy vision of a low-carbon economy.  Indeed, it is fair to say that may of the possible tools to support that goal are not necessarily at the disposal of the Department.  This will require a whole-of-Government effort and will require looking at it from a fiscal and economic framework.  This will not only be about transport.  Land use and planning will contribute to a low-carbon future in the transport sector as well.  These are significant challenges and we are trying to be part of it at national level.<\/p> <p>  Some general points were made.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh mentioned the framework for investment.  I have referred to that.  Our first priority is to ensure that we do not lose the infrastructure we have, although I have noted that there are gaps.  Deputies and Senators have referred to several of these gaps.  A point was made about finance as well.  I will leave it to my colleagues to discuss national roads.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the mid-term review of the capital plan.  It is not possible to give guarantees at this point, simply because the process is really only starting next year.  The process will be led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The terms of the capital plan have not yet been set, never mind the position relating to the kind of resources that might be available.  There continue to be many competing resources.<\/p> <p>  The committee members will be aware of the increased level of global economic uncertainty.  It is not only a question of resources in terms of capital expenditure.  Current expenditure is relevant as well, especially in light of the completing demands around social services like health and education, as well as the challenging situation in respect of housing.  We will be making a robust case.  We will highlight the critical nature of transport infrastructure to our national competitiveness in a more challenging economic environment.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the additional resources made available this year.  Ultimately, decisions on allocations to Departments are a matter for Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While it is not possible for me to comment on the priorities, clearly, a range of other national priorities exist.  Additional funding has been made available to the Department.  We have been a strong Department in case-making for additional resources if they become available over the course of the year.  Significant additional resources were secured earlier this year to address storm damage.  We always end up looking as if we have done worse when comparing the allocation for the year coming to the out-turn for the current year.  That is because we have been strong in making the case to get additional resources in the current year.  Clearly, it is challenging.  Equally, there are many competing, critical and important demands within the transport Vote relating to public transport and the tourism and sports sector.  These are is smaller in scale but equally of value, as committee members are aware.<\/p> <p>  I suspect I may have missed some of the points.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>We can go back to anything that was left unanswered.

It is the only scheme on our books at the moment that is shovel-ready but not included in the capital investment plan published last year.  The cost of construction of the scheme is of the order of &euro;15 million.  It is a fairly straightforward scheme.  As mentioned previously, the land has been purchased and the associated costs have already been dealt with.

These are the most important asset that we have within the national roads network.  We measure the performance and undertake a condition survey of the network each year in order that we know exactly what the trends are in terms of condition.  We also know how different pavement types perform.  We are in a position to take the existing condition and previous condition and predict the future condition based on different funding scenarios.  Looking forward to a horizon of approximately 20 years, we can tell that at the current levels of funding, we may not be in a situation that we are going to go off a cliff.  However, in the longer term and particularly post-2020, if current levels of funding continue, we are going to inevitably encounter significant reductions in the condition of our pavements.  The consequences of that on a 20-year horizon would be very significant in terms of the extra expenditure that would be required to bring the condition of the pavements back up to the standard they are at now.  That is something that we have modelled.<\/p> <p>  It aligns with the strategic framework for investment in land transport, SFILT, which indicated the need for a level of investment in pavement renewals of approximately &euro;140 million.  We are running at approximately one third of that at present.  We can see that about six, seven or eight years out, the conditions start to diminish significantly.  We absolutely prioritise the funding that we have to where it is most needed.  That ensures that we do the best that we can.  However, it will inevitably get a point at which the condition of the network will diminish significancy unless there is an increase in funding.  In 20 years' time, were we to look to bring the condition of the network back up to current condition, we would be paying up to twice what it would cost if we maintain a consistent level of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Maher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>Deputy Murphy also asked about the peace process and cross-Border investment in light of the impacts of Brexit on our future plans for infrastructure.

We would like to progress that at some stage if funding will allow it.<\/p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh mentioned the criteria by which we assess how we spend the limited amount of funding that we do receive.  We have very detailed assessment criteria.  I mentioned them in broad terms earlier as part of my opening statement.

We have invested &euro;15 billion over the last 15 years or so in the network and are getting benefits from that investment.  Keeping the network safe, efficient and open for business is our first priority.  Most of the money goes in that direction.  Some of the money goes to some minor schemes.  As I mentioned earlier, in our current programme of construction of minor projects, there are 20 active projects this year, some of which will run into next year.  That programme of minor schemes will end next year.  We have some schemes in the planning process but no scheme looks set for construction by the end of 2017.

That road has very poor safety aspects and there will be huge safety dividends to come from that scheme.  There is a scheme to join Mullingar with the Drumod-Roosky bypass.  That was a 50 km scheme for a dual carriageway-standard route from Mullingar up to the split of the N4 and N5 at Longford.  We went through the process for that scheme with Westmeath County Council as the lead authority to select a preferred route corridor for that project.  Unfortunately, due to the onset of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, that scheme was shelved.  To give a sense of the scale of the scheme, it is 50 km long and would require an investment of about &euro;400 million investment to open.

Given the impact of the financial crisis and the downturn in our funding levels, we have reverted to carrying out a series of small low-cost but high-value and high-impact schemes.

We have full approval from An Bord Plean&aacute;la for that.  What we are doing is taking off bite-sized chunks.  We are taking 4 km sections at a time.  By Christmas, we will have completed the second phase of those works.  There will be five or six phases in total.  We are preparing tender documentation for phase three.  As funding allows, we will keep chipping away at those sections.<\/p> <p>  I refer to two sections of the N56 in Donegal, Dungloe to Glenties and Mountcharles to Inver.

In the Government's Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020, one of the targets given to TII was to progress 150 minor projects over the life of that plan.  The best we will do in that period given the funding constraints is 50.  We have another 50 of those minor schemes, most of which are secondary routes, in some stage of planning and design.  We will bring them to a point where we will have them tender ready, and if funding conditions change, we can react quickly and move those small schemes onto site.  We have another 100 minor schemes in the wings on which there is no action at present.  They are on our books but we are not progressing them because we cannot overload the system.  It is too much to buy the land and go through An Bord Plean&aacute;la with too many schemes at present.<\/p> <p>  Mention was made of the considerable delays on the Carrick-on-Shannon bypass.  I am well aware of that.  We brought the scheme to the stage of having the statutory orders, the environmental impact statement and the preferred route ready, but that is where it is at.  It is quite a big scheme.  It is a tricky scheme in terms of the environment.  We are crossing the Shannon callows north of Carrick-on-Shannon.  That would pick up a lot of the regional roads radiating out of Carrick-on-Shannon and bring relief to the old bridge in Carrick.  We have done as much work as we can but we are constrained by the lack of funding.  It is on our books.  There are 50 major schemes that we have suspended at present and, unfortunately, Carrick-on-Shannon is one of those.<\/p> <p>  Senator Feighan asked how long it would take to bring a major scheme to planning.  Typically, it would take between two and four years to bring a scheme to planning.  That is if nothing goes wrong with regard to judicial reviews.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned the mid-term review and adding schemes to that, and the M20 featured in that.  Senator O'Donnell asked a number of questions about the current state of progress on the M20.  We have approval from the Department now to commence some early activities on that project and we split the scheme into five decision points.  The first decision was to do some early activities in advance of the mid-term review of the capital investment plan next year.  There are some matters we are getting along with and we will have more information over the next nine months.<\/p> <p>  The second decision point is to approve the formal commencement of the planning and design and statutory order stage.  That stage will cost between &euro;12 million and &euro;15 million.  That means procuring engineering firms and environmental consultants to prepare an environmental impact statement, EIS, and bring the scheme in a state that we can bring it back to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and prepare to procure and prepare a business case for that scheme.  That will take three to three and a half years.  The third decision point is the approval of the business case by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, DTTS, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, and ourselves, and then Government.  It is a massive scheme and we need Government approval for it.<\/p> <p>  The fourth decision point is to approve to submit that scheme to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Once one goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it consents to the scheme, one is committing at some stage to buy the land and that brings the State a commitment of between &euro;100 million and &euro;180 million in 2016 prices.  That is quite a big decision point.<\/p> <p>  The final decision, decision No. 5, is Government approval to proceed to commence construction.  At that point, that would commit the Government to an investment of approximately &euro;600 million in today's money.  The construction could be phased over a number of years.  It could be done in two phases.  It could be done in four phases.  It depends on what route we choose, how we can break it up and where the logical places are where we would break the scheme.  We have to go An Bord Plean&aacute;la with a full scheme, and whether it is the full 80 km depends on which route it takes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>Is it appropriate for me to seek clarification?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#J00800","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1188,"content":"<p>Briefly, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#J00900","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1479286800,"counter":1189,"content":"<p>Effectively, Mr. Nolan is saying that this progressed significantly in that resources have been made available to get the M20, Cork to Limerick, back on the planning agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016111600002#J01000","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479286800,"counter":1190,"content":"<p>We have approval.

We identify about 200 locations annually, where we see clusters of incidents above the normal.  Following an appraisal it is decided whether an engineering, enforcement or education solution is required.  We work with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local authorities on the issue.  Of the 200 locations we identify on an annual basis, between 40 and 60 locations might require an engineering solution.  We then start working with the local authorities to consider what the solution might be.  This is how we identify issues.  We get calls from local authorities.  We may be working off Garda accident records that are two years old.  At present we have validated data up to 2014.  We have data that has not been validated for the years of 2015 and 2016.  We rely on local authorities and public representation to identify the location of the recent spate of incidents.

It remains a political commitment, however, in terms of the overall settlement framework.  I cannot comment much more than that because of the nature of the commitment.  Deputy Catherine Murphy also raised the same issue and it is part of a higher-level political commitment.<\/p> <p>  In terms of local improvement schemes and community improvement schemes, we will come back to Deputy Fitzpatrick with a detailed note as he was asking for figures about which local authorities are making allocations in those area.  <\/p> <p>  Let me reiterate again the local improvement scheme does not apply to 83% of the road network because it is an allocation for private roads.  The position remains that local authorities can make allocations for the community improvement schemes and local improvement schemes, but the difficulty is that at national level, if we had kept a specified pot for either we would simply have had to cut the overall road maintenance budget.  The overall restriction that was there was the framework within which we had to make those allocations.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on the future of PPP projects.  The position under the current capital plan is that there are no additional road PPP projects, that was a policy decision at Government level.  What might happen in the context of a mid-term review will be a policy decision at Government level.<\/p> <p>  In looking at the priorities, we will be keeping an eye on the emerging national planning framework as well in trying to identify how we should prioritise our investment.  If I can add a note of caution, members spoke about a great many good projects this morning.  Even in the context of the mid-term capital review, we will have many good projects which were highlighted by the committee and for which there will be a case made by TII.  However, they will all see the scope to accelerate some of the existing projects under the capital plan.  Unless we are very lucky in the capital plan, it will be difficult to do them all.  We will be working with TII to see what the best phasing is for any additional resources we get.<\/p><p>Mr. Michael Nolan has spoken several times about the many projects ranging from very large to small ones that are at various levels of development that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, could valuably do.

The witnesses might recall that the money to fund the upgrade of the N73 at Kildorrery was put in a dormant account.  I do not want to be parochial but no major shovel-ready project has been completed in the past five years.  The flyover project at Bishopstown in Cork city was started but that was agreed more than six or seven years ago.  I have not seen anything positive being done for the greater Cork area.  It was mentioned today that some progress might be made on the M20 but we are still years behind on that.  We have still not had good news on the Ballyvourney motorway project.  We are just getting press releases about projects.  A member asked how quick could work on the Jack Lynch Tunnel be brought on stream?  That improvement would be good news for the greater Cork area.  The current congestion there is a nightmare.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the M20, people travel from Cork to Limerick via Mitchelstown to avoid congestion at Buttevant, Mallow and Charleville.

The witnesses should knock harder on Deputy Ross's door.  He does not seem to be focused on the issue of transport, and that is a concern.  We read in the newspaper headlines that as every day passes he is more and more caught up with judicial appointments and so on.  How quickly will the work on the Jack Lynch Tunnel be brought on stream?  <\/p> <p>  I would say in support of Deputy Fitzpatrick's point that I know the witnesses have not written off the local improvement schemes rather they have left the ball in the court of the local authorities.  A minority of people benefit from local improvement schemes.  When one goes to a local authority meeting and voices one's support for a local improvement scheme planned for down the road, and there actually is a place called Ballymagash, the engineer will say that 40 people need to have a footpath alongside the road into Mitchelstown.  That is the reason the local improvement scheme will not be given priority.
