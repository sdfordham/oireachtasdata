Some &euro;40 million has been budgeted for by way of collection of local property tax for 2014 but not one cent of that money will go to the local authority.  In addition, there have been cuts to the Government subvention.  This is not a local property tax and people are not paying for local services.

I welcome the Government's announcement regarding the provision of &euro;15 million for emergency flood relief.  It is clear that more long-term flood prevention measures must be considered, particularly in Cork city.  Some places were not as badly hit during this round of flooding but with further storms forecast, concern is high among those who live in the areas that have already been affected.<\/p><p>Will the Leader arrange a debate on an issue that is being considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality - it was mentioned in the House by a number of colleagues last week - namely, community courts.  The joint committee is currently conducting an investigation into the possibility of adopting a community court system in Ireland that would be modelled on the system which obtains in New York city.  It heard from a range of experts last week, including some individuals from the US who described their experience of the operation of community courts.  As the Leader noted previously, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was present for the full two hours of the joint committee's debate.  I would really like the Seanad to debate the report of the joint committee as soon as it is published.  In that context, I welcome the Government's proposal to scrap the court poor box scheme, which has come in for huge criticism as a result of the inconsistency of its operation.  That is another matter in respect of which the Seanad might engage in a debate.<\/p><p>Many colleagues have commented on the amount of time for which the Seanad is sitting this week.  The Leader provided a robust response and referred to the difficulty involved in having business sent here from the D&aacute;il.  As soon as it becomes available, we should debate the Constitutional Convention's report on D&aacute;il reform.  The convention spent the weekend considering that matter and the very issue to which I refer, namely, the difficulties involved in getting business onto the floor of the D&aacute;il and the subsequent logjam which results in problems with such business being referred on to the Seanad.  The convention has made three key recommendations in respect of the following: granting the Opposition more power to introduce legislation, which would immediately result in increased throughput; ensuring greater independence of committees - this really relates to accountability but it is important that the committees should be mentioned in the Constitution, which is not currently the case; and introducing measures to increase the independence of the Ceann Comhairle - again this would involve changing the way in which the Ceann Comhairle is referred to in the Constitution - and ensure that he or she will be elected by secret ballot of the Members of the D&aacute;il and that he or she will have greater powers in the context of the setting of business in the Lower House.

Ms D'Arcy will start the fourth week of a three-month sentence on Friday.  I understand she might be transferred to the D&oacute;chas Centre in Mountjoy in the coming week.  Ms D'Arcy is 79 years of age and has serious medical problems, including Parkinson's disease and cancer.

I remind the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs under a previous Government secured written assurances from the United States Administration that persons who were subject to extraordinary rendition, as the practice was known, were not being transported through Shannon Airport and nothing illegal was taking place at the facility.  Notwithstanding this assurance, the controversy remains a live issue.  It is incumbent, therefore, on the Government to clarify precisely the current position regarding the allegations being made by those who are protesting at Shannon Airport.<\/p><p>Will the Leader ask the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to come to the House to clarify the Government's intentions in respect of the flooding crisis?

These issues should be examined side by side.   Who better to debate these issues with the House than the T&aacute;naiste, who is a member of the Economic Management Council and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade?  The Department of Finance issued a document recently entitled, Ireland's International Taxation Strategy, in which it argued that we should adopt a whole-of-government and coherent approach to the two policy arenas of taxation strategy and development policy.  This means supporting taxation strategies that do not result in a reduction in taxation benefits that countries in the developing world would enjoy if multinational corporations were not avoiding some of the taxation implications of their presence in those countries.  An Irish Aid document published recently under the title, One World, One Future, also argues that we should take a coherent approach to international taxation and aid policy.

In a 12 month period, the woman was due to pay more than &euro;800 in interest on this loan.  The judge asked her what was the logic of a person with her means borrowing &euro;1,500, to which she replied that she either borrowed the money or her children would have gone without.  Every one of us consistently and regularly encounters people who are in similar circumstances.  I am meeting people who are in rent arrears and are borrowing from moneylenders to ensure they are not evicted from their homes. <\/p><p>I was shocked to learn from a recent Central Bank report on licensed moneylenders that it is perfectly legitimate to charge interest rates of 300%.  The justification made for this practice was the high risk attached to this type of debt, despite evidence showing that the default rate on this type of debt is very low.  The reason for the low risk is partly that these debts are repeatedly rolled over, loan after loan, in what effectively amounts to a life sentence to moneylenders.  People also borrow from unlicensed moneylenders and many have been subjected to violence and various threats.  I ask for a debate on the issue of access to credit for people on low incomes or social welfare.  The debate should include a discussion on the remit of the credit union movement, especially in respect of people on low incomes.

It is to be welcomed that people who exercise a great deal of control over the spending of various organisations have such an optimistic outlook.  Despite the rebound in confidence, Irish business remains concerned about the tight credit situation, which is continuing to restrict business growth.  Some 19% of the chief financial officers believe new credit is difficult to obtain from Irish banks.  Some 33% of them believe it is difficult to obtain credit from foreign banks.

Perhaps the Minister could be briefed that we will be raising these issues when he comes to this House to discuss the flooding issue.

In total, we have 15 Ministers and a plethora of Ministers of State.  Debates in this House are often attended by a Minister or Minister of State whose brief has absolutely nothing to do with the issue in question.  The Government needs to hear the message from the Seanad that we should be sitting tomorrow and every Thursday.  We are here to do a job.  It is simply not acceptable that Ministers and Ministers of State are not coming in for the debates that the people of this country are asking us to have on issues that are very serious to them.

The system in question, which has been in operation since before the foundation of this State, operates at the discretion of judges.  In 2012, over &euro;2 million was allocated to various charities at the discretion of judges.  The Law Reform Commission recommended in 2005 that this system should be placed on a statutory basis.  It has taken nine years for that to happen.  Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness has made the same recommendation.<\/p> <p>The Law Reform Commission recommended it.  It is a good fund but it is necessary for it to be put on a statutory basis.  I am asking the Leader to arrange a debate on it because one of the recommendations in 2005 was that a committee be set up to advise on how this fund is operated.  It is necessary and very many good charities have benefited from it although retired Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness said some of them were questionable.  A committee should be set up, as was recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  I compliment the Minister for Justice and Equality for putting it on a statutory basis but I do not want to see it go into a central administrative fund and be added on to the lottery or something like that because it is a good fund.

Given the torrent of issues that arose, it was one that was somehow skipped over but I would like to remind the Leader of it.  A medical journalist and practitioner contacted me to state that following a piece he had written in a national newspaper in which he was, as are many people - I understand there are two sides to the argument - critical of the apparent policy of the HSE to alter its practices with respect to the issuing of medical cards, although I know it is denied that there is such a policy, he received a legally threatening letter from a public relations spokesman of the HSE.  This is entirely inappropriate.  There should never be a situation where lawyers or public relations people acting on behalf of a publicly funded body that is answerable to the public as individuals and through the press and Parliament can state that the reputation of that body is such that it would need to be defended by legal means or legal threats.  I do not believe anybody should be forced to back down from a position they have taken against the corporate body under such a threat.  It is entirely different if a named individual has his or her reputation in some way sullied.  They have appropriate means of redress available to them.  It may be appropriate that such redress in circumstances where they have been acting on behalf of their public body is funded by the public.  However, the body itself should not be immune from criticism.  The way for a body to deal with criticism is to set the facts out as it sees them and let the public decide in a democracy or if the criticism is valid, act on it and make the necessary corrections in public policy.<\/p><p>I am very troubled by this development.  In previous contributions here, I have said that I believe there should be no public relations companies working anywhere in the public service.  The public servants should do their own public relations and act on their own record.  Their record should speak for itself.  Senior public servants, civil servants and officials of Government agencies should in rotation have responsibility for dealing with queries from the press and the public.  It is singularly inappropriate that public money is spent in this way.  <\/p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ask one of the many very honourable Members for Mayo, the Taoiseach, to attend the Chamber today to clarify his intentions with respect to Seanad reform.  I found myself in a welter of confusion when I read the contents of the various contributions made in the D&aacute;il during Leaders' Questions yesterday.  It appears the Taoiseach is telling us that the Government deserves praise for being the first Government to implement the seventh amendment to the Constitution voted for by the people in 1979.  I remind him that he never intended to implement the seventh amendment.  He intended to abolish the entire institution.  He was given what all of us believe was a resounding mandate, not a walloping, to reform the Seanad to make it a Chamber based on universal suffrage.  I formally propose an amendment to the Order of Business to extend to him a very polite invitation to come in today and perhaps clarify some of the issues he brought up yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500006#E00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1391598000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Senator Bacik raised two very interesting and important items this morning.

The Leader has promised a debate, which is warranted under the circumstances.  My prime issue, which was touched upon by Senator Colm Burke yesterday, is that of the availability of insurance for those whose properties have been flooded, an issue I have raised here before.  As we speak, there are huge tracts of commercial premises and estates in certain towns and cities, regardless of whether they are in Clonmel, Skibbereen, Bantry, Cork city or Limerick, that cannot and will not get insurance in the future.  That is most regrettable.<\/p><p>  This is above politics.  Whatever debate we have here, we must address the situation regarding these people getting insurance.  They are paying commercial rates and water charges and are tax-compliant, yet because an event happens once or twice a year through no fault of their own, they cannot get insurance in the future.  When the debate takes place, I ask the Leader to include the issue of where these people are to go.  The fact that insurance companies close the door because one is flooded once or twice is most annoying and frustrating, be it in Cork city, Bandon, Clonmel or Sligo.  The insurance industry must not be allowed to get away with it.  Politically, we have been allowing it to get away with it for the past ten or 15 years so it is about time this House cried &quot;Stop&quot;.  The Leader has promised a debate and I respect his intention but if progress is not made in this regard, I will call for a vote on this and raise it in future.   The insurance companies are effectively saying in these instances, &quot;In <i>saecula saeculorum<\/i>, forget about these premises, they will never again be insured&quot;.  After the flood relief efforts are undertaken and the barriers are put in, be they in Fermoy, Mallow or Bandon, will they be able to get insurance?  I doubt it.  This is a significant and thorny issue and I will certainly not let it go away.  Could the Leader ensure that this is at least included when we are debating the issue of flooding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500006#E00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1391598000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I concur with what Senators O'Neill, Keane and Mullins said regarding the night club referred to.

I ask the Leader when it will be before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is clear this House has the capacity to debate it.  The rate of 1% tax being suggested is minimal, considering the significant profits made by the likes of Paddy Power and Boyle Sports.  Paddy Power currently generates three quarters of its profits online and the Exchequer is not getting any cut of those profits.  Approximately &euro;1.6 billion per year is gambled online in Ireland which suggests that the Exchequer could be in receipt of &euro;16 million every year.  This income would be very welcome.  It would not be desirable to see these companies moving out of the jurisdiction but there is scope for a larger percentage and a rate of 2% tax should be considered for online gambling in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500006#E00500","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391598600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>It is reported that this week the IMF will declare that the Central Bank is, \"materially non-compliant in its supervision of foreign banks\".

It is important for the Government to give an account of its stewardship in the area and outline how well we are doing in drawing down all possible resources, particularly those that can stimulate growth and investment in rural areas.  I come from a rural area and go home to poor quality Internet services.  It is a critical issue and one the Government has not taken sufficiently seriously over the years.  It is not possible to talk about stimulating investment and growth in rural areas without also talking about the need to improve broadband services.<\/p><p>  I welcome the debate to which Senator Walsh has most recently contributed.

We should consider how far we have come, while remaining cognisant of how much more needs to be done and the journey that remains to be completed in the European Union and among its member states.  It was not long ago that debates were taking place on the airwaves and elsewhere on whether the eurozone would break up.  It was suggested that certain countries would leave the euro and we heard about the impact this would have on countries that remained in the eurozone.  I recall being contacted by constituents 12 or 18 months ago asking where they should put their money and if they should invest in other currencies or metals. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500012#M00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1391601000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Can we have copies of the Minister of State's speech?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500012#M00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1391601000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I understood they had been circulated.  If Senators have not received a copy, I apologise and will ensure they receive one immediately.<\/p><p>As I stated, I was contacted 12 or 18 months by constituents asking how best they could protect their money and ensure their wealth would be preserved in the event of the eurozone breaking up.  A number of prominent economists and commentators spoke about a eurozone break-up at the time.  One economist predicted it would break up in a matter of days or weeks, while others argued that only months were left to save the eurozone.  The economic apocalypse that would have ensued has been averted through strong decisions that were made to ensure the euro remained secure and the eurozone survived and prospered.  People believed that many of the changes made in that period would be virtually impossible to implement.  The European Stability Mechanism offers support to member states and other new machinery was created and retrofitted to the currency to ensure it would be able to square up and meet the challenges it faced at that time. <\/p><p>While the worst of our fears did not come to pass, the European recovery is still at a fragile stage.  Senators are familiar with the challenges faced by Europe and Ireland, the most important of which is the unacceptably high level of unemployment.  As we seek to manage the consequences of the deep crisis, it is worth emphasising that the European Union has enlarged with the accession of Croatia as its 28th member state.  This was a gigantic achievement on the part of Croatia given the scale of the difficulties and challenges it had to manage.  I am pleased to note that Ireland will shortly open an embassy in Zagreb to deepen our relationships and working arrangements with the newest member of the European Union. <\/p><p>I referred to the difficulties faced by the eurozone and the deep challenges we continue to face.  Last month, Latvia became the 18th member of the eurozone.  This illustrates the faith the newer EU member states have in the ability of the euro to assist them in meeting the aspiration of their citizens to have sustainable and functioning economies.  The European Union and eurozone are larger now than they were when we were in the depths of crisis.  This gives us a degree of confidence about the challenges we need to navigate and the opportunities we need to grasp.  <\/p><p>For Ireland, 2013 was an extraordinary year in that we completed another successful Presidency of the European Council and became the first eurozone country to successfully exit an EU-IMF programme.  The work in recent years, in particular in the past 12 months, has done much to rebuild Ireland's image and profile in Europe and restore confidence in our economy and the wider European system.  While much work remains to be done, we can take some pride in our achievements. <\/p><p>Against this backdrop, our colleagues in Greece have assumed the Presidency of the European Council.  Late last year, I travelled to Athens to meet the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Antonis Samaras, and EU Affairs Minister, Mr. Kourkoulas, to discuss the Greek priorities for the Presidency.  I shared our experiences of the Presidency, outlining our preparations for the six-month term and the lessons we learned from it.  I also described the work we had done to develop our relationships with the institutions and the intensive efforts we made to make progress on particular priorities and files with the Commission, Parliament and other member states.  I heard about the significant challenges Greece faces as a country and during its Presidency.  I also observed the tremendous efforts it is making to rise to these challenges.<\/p><p>The Greek Presidency is now five weeks old and it is apparent already that Greece is committed to delivering a successful Presidency which will contribute to a European and Greek recovery.  Greece has set out a number of priorities on which it wishes to deliver.<\/p> <p>Its first priority is growth, jobs and cohesion; its second priority is further integration within the EU and the eurozone; its third priority is progress on migration, borders and mobility; and its final priority is progress on maritime policy.  Ireland welcomes these priorities.  We are actively working with the Presidency to secure progress in each area.<\/p><p>From Ireland's perspective, ensuring the stability of the eurozone and consolidating economic growth remain the most important priorities on our agenda.  The start of our recovery can be traced to the June 2012 European Council, at which agreement was reached to break the link between sovereign and banking debt.  If the recovery we have set in train is to be consolidated, it is absolutely imperative that European leaders continue to follow through on this commitment in full.  It is clear that banking union will do much to ensure the stability of the economic and monetary union which is necessary for lasting prosperity.  The finalisation of agreement on the single resolution mechanism and the single resolution fund is a key priority for Ireland.  We welcome the priority that the Greek Presidency has accorded to the development of both of these priorities.<\/p><p>Further measures are required to bolster economic growth and create employment in the short and longer terms.  The enhanced Stability and Growth Pact and the Europe 2020 strategy form the blueprints in this regard.  The European Council will consider an interim assessment of Europe 2020 when it meets in March.  This presents an opportunity to focus on the jobs and growth agenda and to consider how efforts to address youth unemployment and support the financing of small and medium sized enterprises through the European Investment Bank can be refined and improved.  I will give an example of the progress the European Investment Bank is making in this regard.  The lending it is making available to Ireland is a multiple of the kind of lending we got from that institution in the past.  That is already leading to practical results.  I refer, for example, to the progress that is being made with the construction of the new DIT campus at Grangegorman, which is being enabled by support from the European Investment Bank.  Similar work is taking place on the Luas BXD line, which will run through Dublin.  This is a practical example of the kind of support the European Investment Bank is enabling in member states by means of investment.<\/p><p>The European semester is at the heart of the EU's stronger post-crisis economic governance arrangements.  Following the completion of the EU-IMF programme, Ireland will participate fully in the semester this year.  National parliaments have an important role to play in this process, for example, by explaining it to the public.  That responsibility is particularly relevant for Ireland, given that this will be our first experience of the semester.  Many other countries are now moving into their fourth period of operation of the semester.  Following our exit from the programme, we are now going into our first period of operation.<\/p><p>I welcome the recent engagement of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs with the Secretary General of the European Commission, Catherine Day, to discuss parliamentary engagement in the European semester.  This theme arose when I attended a meeting of the joint committee this morning before I came to this House.  Senator Noone, who was also in attendance, raised issues with me at that meeting.  One of the points I made at the meeting was that it is important for the Oireachtas, including the Seanad and the committees, to take time to decide what role it should have in the work that will take place as part of the semester process.  A great deal of work will place at Government level in the coming period, particularly in the run-up to the summer, regarding how we want to make an input into and work with that process.  It is very important for Members of the Oireachtas, across all political parties, to understand the nature of this work.  It will be a new experience for this country.  Members of the Oireachtas should also avail of the opportunity to make an input into that process so that their views can be made known.<\/p><p>The objective of this process is to deliver stronger economic governance.  Ireland will continue to follow up on some important priorities alongside that.  We will focus on the deepening of the European Single Market and on steps to enhance business access to credit and stimulate external trade.  The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which was launched under the auspices of the Irish Presidency, is a very important example of an area in which we want to continue to make progress.  We support the Greek Presidency's work on the priority actions under the Single Market Act.  We continue to support the European Commission in pursuing ambitious free trade agreements with key partners.  I am sure Senator Leyden will respond to some of the comments I am making.  I recall a number of occasions on which he made reference to the support he gave to Irish investment abroad when he served as Minister of State.  He always acknowledged the role of bodies like the EU in driving investment and emphasised the need for Ireland to be represented on such bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500012#M00500","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391601600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500013#N00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1391601600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which will be a huge trade arrangement between the US and the EU, could create an extraordinary opportunity for a diverse range of companies in Ireland to perform even better in the US.  It is incredibly important to us that such trading relationships should deepen in a rules-based environment.  That is what the negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership are focusing on.<\/p><p>I would like to speak about the institutional agenda and the significant transitions and leadership changes which lie ahead this year.  When I mention the &quot;institutional agenda&quot;, I am referring to the Parliament and the European Commission.  As many Senators will be aware, a new European Parliament will be elected in May.  A new President of the European Commission is due to be appointed in the summer.  Consequently, a new college of Commissioners will be appointed in the autumn. There will also be a new President of the European Council, a successor to Catherine Ashton as high representative, and a new chair of the Eurogroup.  These elections will be the first European elections to be held under the Lisbon treaty.  Our experience during Ireland's Presidency of the EU reminded us how significantly the treaty has expanded the power of the European Parliament.  Its role in shaping and determining European policy, as co-legislator with the Council, has never been stronger.  It matters like never before.<\/p><p>I will give a practical example in this regard.  Senators will be aware that all Members of the European Parliament come together in plenary session every month to vote on the initiatives and proposals in front of them.  We ensure an Irish Minister is present at each plenary session to meet all the Irish MEPs and engage directly with MEPs from other countries who are voting on legislative initiatives or proposals that matter to us.  We repeatedly see practical examples of the European Parliament's role in affecting things that matter here at home.  I will mention two such examples.  Senators will be aware of the debate that is taking place at present about the role of plain cigarette packages.  As this will be a Europe-wide initiative, in order for it to be developed it had to be voted on directly and agreed by the European Parliament.  It is a growing sign of the significance of the European Parliament that a debate at that forum yesterday on a Commission document was reported on by RTE news.  The comments of various MEPs were given particular relevance and prominence in the report.<\/p><p>Following the implementation in full of the Lisbon treaty, and in light of its role in initiating and strongly influencing legislation, the European Parliament is now an incredibly important forum for our country.  Another example of that can be seen in the case of the banking union, which I referred to earlier in this speech.  The next phase of the agreement of the European banking union will take place within the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>There will be Members of the European Parliament within the committee of the Parliament and then within the plenary of the Parliament who will be voting on concepts and initiatives that have a material impact on something that is in our national interest.  May's elections will provide the public in Ireland and across the EU with the chance to influence this direction.  A total of 751 MEPs will be elected, more than half of them new MEPs.  MEPs have more power than ever to make a positive difference in Europe.  If there are any Senators present who are considering the European Parliament as another forum within which to make their views known and influence the development of legislation, I assure them that if they consider this move and are successful, they will find it is a forum and Parliament in which issues and legislation are debated that will have a very important impact on our country and the people we all represent.  It is a forum that will play an increasing role in Ireland.  Each time a Minister travels to the plenary session in Strasbourg, which happens every month, we make a point of meeting all the Irish MEPs to discuss issues that matter to us.  I acknowledge that every MEP from every party and none will turn up to participate in those discussions because of their desire to understand what we are trying to progress within Government and to be constructive on behalf of our country.<\/p><p> I will now address external relations and touch on some topics I know are of interest to colleagues and that have been raised in this House in recent months.  I will touch on developments with Ukraine.  Despite the difficulty we have within the EU, many of the countries I visit that are outside the EU look at the way we govern ourselves nationally and the arrangements in place across the Union as something they want to join.  They see this as a huge source of support for their people in trying to develop their prosperity and security and in trying to meet the aspirations of their citizens.  On those visits, I have also become extremely aware of the challenges that many of these countries are facing.  I will touch on what is perhaps the most prominent of them, which is that relating to Ukraine.  I had the privilege of representing our country, along with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, at the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius in November.  While we saw Georgia and Moldova agree new association agreements with the EU, we saw Ukraine decide not to participate in that arrangement and decide instead to find alternate ways of developing its economy, society and country.<\/p><p> It was clear even when I was at that summit and the meetings that happened around it that this decision would have very profound and historic consequences for that country and region.  That then became very clear to me a number of weeks later when I had the opportunity to visit Kiev when I represented Ireland at the OSCE ministerial meeting.  During that visit, I took the opportunity to go down to Independence Square where I spent nearly two hours meeting the people down there.  I did this as Minister of State representing the country but I did not really make any attempt to draw any attention to what I was doing because I wanted to talk to people who were out on the streets and see why they were there.  Why did they feel like this?  To touch on a point I mentioned earlier, it became extremely clear to me that what they were looking for was a relationship with the Union to develop their country and deal with some of the difficulties they face.  It also became very clear that this was something about which they felt extremely strongly and for which they were determined to continue to campaign and agitate within their society.  When I arrived at Independence Square that night - I did not have the opportunity to get down there until around midnight because we had such a full day - it was below freezing and there were tens of thousands of people there when the focus on it was just starting to develop to the levels we have seen.<\/p><p> This is something in which the EU has continued to be very engaged.  The Irish Government has communicated directly to the Government of Ukraine via our ambassador our very strong message that restraint must be exercised on both sides, particularly from the side of Government given the role it plays in all of this.  As members of the Foreign Affairs Council, we have continued to call on all individuals and actors involved in this to find some way of coming together through inclusive dialogue to agree a democratic solution to the crisis.  High Representative Ashton who is a member of the Commission who looks to represent Europe in certain areas has played a very significant role in Ukraine and in Kiev in trying to move forward.  We believe these efforts would be greatly assisted if the authorities were to launch a credible and urgent investigation into the many reports of violence and intimidation by security services.  There can be no impunity for anybody playing a role in that kind of alleged violence and the alleged crimes perpetrated on people there.<\/p><p> Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the city of Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  All will be aware that this is a country scarred by serious and horrific violence in its recent past but which, with the support of the EU, is attempting to forge a better future.  I was very much aware of the fact that when I flew into Sarajevo last week, I was flying into a city that, just over 20 years ago, had endured the longest siege in the history of modern warfare and a country where, less than 20 years ago, many large parts were no-fly zones because of the scale of the war that took place in the aftermath of the break-up of Yugoslavia.   During my visit, I had the opportunity to meet Bosnia-Herzegovina's equivalent of prime minister, who is the chairman of the council of ministers, the foreign minister and the committee of European Union affairs.  I also addressed a public meeting that took place in Sarajevo on what happened to Ireland in recent years and the learning and experience that may be of relevance to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In December, the EU reiterated our unequivocal support for Bosnia-Herzegovina's EU path.  It also highlighted our concern at the limited progress to date in meeting key conditions and the responsibility of its leaders to resolve these issues.  During my visit to Sarajevo, I reaffirmed these messages in respect of the need for the country, government and leaders to make progress on the Sejdi\u0107 and Finci <i>v.<\/i>Bosnia and Herzegovina ruling.  This ruling looks to ensure that any member of the communities within Bosnia-Herzegovina has the opportunity to stand for public office and participate in public life.  I also emphasised the need for a very strong co-ordinating mechanism to be put in place to enable and allow that country to deal with the EU.<\/p><p> Earlier in the year, I was the first European minister to visit Albania following the decision of the European Council in December to grant candidate status to the country in June on the understanding that it continues to build on the encouraging progress made so far.  There, too, I brought a message of support and encouragement.  I met the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and representatives from all of the political parties.  It became clear that there is strong willingness on behalf of the Government and the public to hear that message.  There is a clear commitment to the reform agenda, which demonstrates the very positive role the EU can play in that neighbourhood.<\/p> <p>I emphasise some of the recent broader historical developments in that region.  I refer to the role of the European Union in brokering an agreement between Serbia and Kosovo and dealing with many issues which appeared gravely difficult.  I refer to the courage of the governments of both countries in making progress and the pivotal role of the European Commission represented by the EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton.  I refer to the progress being achieved by Serbia in developing its relationship with the EU.  In the months ahead I hope to have further opportunities to engage with eastern and southern neighbour countries to help them to deepen their links with the European Union.<\/p><p>I continue to invest significant time in developing our bilateral relationships.  Tomorrow afternoon I will travel to Berlin to meet my new counterpart, Minister Roth, the recently appointed Minister for European affairs.  I will also visit Warsaw to meet the Polish Government.  In between I will visit Strasbourg to continue the engagement with the European Parliament.  Between the end of August and December I made more than 20 different visits to countries or institutions to further develop our EU Presidency profile.  To name but a small number I visited Italy and Greece.  When visiting Brussels and Luxembourg I took the opportunity to engage with the institutions.  I have spent a significant amount of time explaining the Irish priorities for the European Union, including making this clear in the current UK debate-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500013#N00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391602800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is a very busy man.

I believe we continue to make progress in many areas but I am aware of how much more needs to be done and developed.  I am aware of the work we need to do to ensure that banking union comes about and in such a way as to enable our own banking system to develop in the way required and allows us to tackle many of the issues.  I am also aware of the priority and importance of initiatives such as TTIP.  I refer to the European Parliament elections and changes in the European Commission.  I am aware of the need for Ireland to develop and maintain its voice during this period of change.  What gives me great encouragement in my work is my understanding of how the Irish public is aware of the role Europe can play and its willingness to debate it and to be informed about it.  A tangible example was evident in my visits to two Irish universities last Monday.  I will be visiting all our universities in the coming weeks to discuss opportunities in the European Commission and to discuss Ireland's role in Europe.  For each of those visits hundreds of students turned up to hear about those opportunities and to be informed about them.

I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  He was a very good Senator who worked hard.  He probably honed his political ability in this House.  I always thought he was a very fair-minded, non-political type person.  I congratulate him on being made a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  I know he is working very hard in that role.  I note that the Minister of State did not mention that his predecessor, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, was the Minister of State during the Irish Presidency.  I know she has been air brushed out of Fine Gael politics and it is pretty obvious.  There is no mention in the Minister of State's contribution of her work.  She performed extremely well during the Irish Presidency.  She led the Presidency in Europe and was ably assisted by our ambassador in Brussels and the staff seconded to the Presidency for that period of six months and the advance three months preparation period.  It was a very successful Presidency, as have all the Irish Presidencies.  Our public service contains the most talented representatives.  As a former trade Minister I worked in Europe and I know their ability.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has outlined very well the role of the Greek Presidency.  He referred to the situation in the Ukraine.  I commend his courage in visiting the square in Kiev at this time.  I believe Baroness Catherine Ashton that Europe was too heavy-handed with regard to Ukraine.  It had been an integral part of the Soviet Union and it relied on Russia for its gas supplies.  We moved too far too fast in my opinion.  The Minister of State will have a role in a resolution of the issue.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister of State's work with regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina and his efforts in resolving issues in that region.  That country's integration into the European Union should be fully supported and it is hoped that it will become a member in time.  He did not refer to the Council of Europe even though he is the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and assigned to the Council of Europe.  Ireland as a founder member of the Council of Europe is in a position of some influence.  Deputy Joe O'Reilly is the Fine Gael leader of the delegation to the Council of Europe.  Last week we elected a new president of the delegation who is a member of the liberals and democrats group.  Peter Gunning is our excellent ambassador.  I hope the Minister of State will take an interest in the Council of Europe.  The European Union takes priority in policy matters but the EU Court of Human Rights made a very important decision in the O'Keeffe case.<\/p> <p>It acts as a very good sounding board because countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Albania are members of the Council of Europe.  I invite the Minister of State to address the Council of Europe on issues pertaining to the European Union.  It is an important area and one that may have been neglected to some extent.<\/p><p>The European Parliament elections will take place on 23 May and the number of MEPs from this State has been reduced from 12 to 11, which makes it very difficult.  When Croatia joined, we lost a seat and when the next country joins we will lose another seat.  We could be down to six seats in the next ten years.  While there is a limit of 751 seats in the Parliament why can we not extend it slightly to allow countries such as Ireland to have representation?  We have ended up with unwieldy constituencies meaning it will be very difficult for candidates to campaign and for those elected to represent those areas.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is very busy and is travelling everywhere.  I advise him not to neglect the home patch, including Drumcondra, as Mr. Bertie Ahern did every weekend.  I assure him that his constituents will not be too impressed by his travels to Kiev, Bosnia Herzegovina or Greece; they will be looking to see if he is available to meet them and make representations.  I wish him well in his job, which he is doing very well.  I commend him on going out to the universities to meet young people and discuss European affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500015#P00700","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391603400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am glad he is doing his duty for the country in representing us very well.  He seems to be very and is hard working.  It comes as no surprise that he is taking such a serious approach to his representation of the country at European level.<\/p><p>Having recently assumed the portfolio of Seanad spokesperson on European affairs, I have spent the past few months sitting on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, representing Ireland at COSAC and raising European issues regularly in the Seanad in the media.  As we are now in a post-EU Presidency stage I am glad that the Government is still displaying such a healthy commitment to fostering strong, working relationships throughout Europe.  The Minister of State also mentioned bilateral relationships, which are very important.  The creation of the portfolio of Seanad spokesperson on European affairs is an indicator of the Government's attention to Europe in the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Three witnesses appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs yesterday and Dr. O'Brennan, in particular, mentioned how much we need to up our game in the Houses of the Oireachtas when it comes to scrutiny of European legislation.  The upcoming European Parliament elections can play a role in cementing a positive, constructive relationship with the Parliament, as was mentioned at the committee meeting already this morning.  There is a danger of repetition for the Minister of State who has the two engagements so close together.<\/p><p>As we know, Greece started its fifth Presidency of the Council of the European Union on 1 January.  Its four priorities are very appropriate to us.  They are growth, jobs and cohesion; further integration of the EU and eurozone; migration, borders and mobility; and maritime policies.  As we discussed earlier in the committee, the Greek Presidency is under pressure to deliver on a wide range of outstanding legislation before the elections in May.<\/p><p>The EU is facing many challenges on a number of fronts - politically, economically and perhaps socially.  The accession of Croatia has taken place successfully, but work remains to be done with Bosnia Herzegovina.  On the Eastern border the strife in Ukraine poses many dilemmas.  The UK &quot;in-out&quot; referendum poses a significant challenge and would have a detrimental effect on Ireland if it comes to pass.  Portugal is moving in a direction that we have moved in and we are seen as leaders in this regard.  Our reputation, according to the guests at the committee yesterday, has very much been restored at a European and international level.<\/p><p>In March Dublin will host the congress of the European People's Party of which Fine Gael is a member.  It is an honour that will see several Heads of State and Government coming to Dublin to meet, to debate and to work on a number of issues which face the EU.  This will be the backdrop for a ten-week national conversation on Europe, Ireland and our relationship.  People often ask what Europe does for them and often feel disconnected from Europe, as we discussed at this morning's committee meeting.  However, on the whole Ireland is very much pro-Europe, and the people realise the role the EU has played in the past and continues to play in our daily lives.<\/p><p>The Minister of State recently said:  &quot;Ireland is an integrated and committed member of the EU and, with the consent of our people, will remain so.  With all of its imperfections, difficulties and frustrations, however, it still offers the best platform for our country to represent and advance what is in our national interest&quot;.  I could not agree more.  People can be frustrated by EU decision-making and its perceived remoteness, a matter the Minister of State mentioned at this morning's committee meeting.  It is a perceived remoteness when we think of some of the examples the Minister of State mentioned, such as roaming charges and plain tobacco packaging.  It is clear that the EU gets credit for some things, but considerable work remains.<\/p><p>The number of Google employees in Dublin recently passed the 2,000 mark.  We can be in no doubt that if Ireland were not a member of the EU, Google would not have that number of employees.  In the months ahead, we will see the phased abolition of mobile telephone roaming rates, which is solely down to the EU, for which I hope it gets credit.<\/p><p>The upcoming European Parliament elections will result in Ireland having 11 out of 751 members.  We need to ensure we have people of calibre, as are most of the candidates of which I have heard.  It is all the more important for us to have people to represent us very well in Europe.  As I mentioned at the committee meeting, there is a role for our national broadcaster in communicating to the people the achievements of the EU as well as its agenda and other issues with which it deals.<\/p><p>One of the witnesses at yesterday's committee meeting - I cannot remember if it was Dr. O'Brennan or Mr. Connelly from RTE - mentioned Ireland's role during the EU Presidency in the negotiation of the trade agreements with the US.  While we have a very well established relationship with the US, it has been suggested that whoever is negotiating at present may be struggling and the Irish might need to play a fuller role in that regard.<\/p><p>Ukraine is of great interest to people.  Based on its population and land mass, the country offers great potential.  At the moment it seems to be suffering from Russian oppression.  While there seems to be a major focus on it, I hope it will continue.  I again thank the Minister of State for coming to the House today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500016#Q00200","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1391603400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I call Senator Reilly, who has a maximum of five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500016#Q00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1391603400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.<\/p> <p>I refer in particular to the conclusions of the last European Council summit on Common Foreign and Security Policy, the need to enhance its development capabilities and strengthen Europe's defence industry, which essentially amounts to increasing spending on weapons and military technology.  Let us couple this with the comments from the Minister of Defence to a NATO publication last year to the effect that neutrality is an outdated concept as well as a comment made at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to the effect that foreign policy should be a blend of force, development aid and diplomacy.  What are the implications of these in terms of our charity and foreign and security policies?<\/p><p>The European Commission has issued a communication on the voting rights of EU citizens.  Article 2 of our Constitution asserts the right of Irish citizens, whether at home or abroad, to play an active role in their country.  To comply with international human rights standards, any restrictions on the right to vote should be reasonable, proportionate and necessary for a legitimate public purpose.  This is the background to the comments made by the Commission against five European Union countries, namely, Ireland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta and the United Kingdom.  Complete voting disenfranchisement of citizens outside the state is mostly the exception rather than the rule for countries throughout the world.  This is evident given that the five countries named have been addressed on the matter.  I call on the Minister of State to comment on the recommendations the Commission has made and the Government's response.<\/p><p>The Minister of State commented on the interim assessment of the Europe 2020 strategy.  When Catherine Day came to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs it was noted that the consultation period would run from April to September.  She remarked that it was an important opportunity to influence EU policy.  How will the Government be engaging with that process?  How does the Minister of State believe the Oireachtas should engage with the process?<\/p><p>The Minister of State is in a unique position in that he has sat in both Houses of the Oireachtas, he is a Minister of State and he has sat on the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  I have been privileged to be on the committee with the Minister of State and to have had the benefit of his experience.  It is great to see that he is a Minister of State now.  He is articulate about his portfolio.<\/p><p>When discussing the European semester process, Senator Noone noted the comments of Dr. John O'Brennan, who referred to a greater role for the Oireachtas.  He suggested the Executive should not have all the power in setting the agenda on the European Union, what is being discussed and how it is discussed.  The Minister of State referred to the European semester process, how the Oireachtas should provide input and that we should think about what we want to see in the process.  During the summer the work on the input will be done by the Government.  How will the Government work with the Oireachtas?  The Minister of State is in a unique position in that he has sat in the Seanad, the D&aacute;il and the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  How can the Government work with the Oireachtas and how can we work with the Government?  What processes could be improved?  How does the Minister of State envisage that we can all work together on the country-specific recommendations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500016#Q00400","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391604000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him and the Government on the highly productive and successful way in which we are currently managing our relationship with the European Union.  Not only have we successfully exited the bailout programme but we have achieved critical concessions along the way, such as the terms under which we were able to deal with the vast liabilities of Anglo Irish Bank.  Our handling of the European Union Presidency ensured great progress in building a stronger economic and banking framework for the future.  However, everyone should acknowledge that this work is by no means over.<\/p><p>Perhaps the most important point is the way our representatives have gone about doing this work on a range of policy fronts.  The reputation of Ireland throughout Europe and the world has been greatly strengthened after a period of neglect, complacency and arrogance during the latter years of the Celtic tiger.  One of the key outcomes of the Irish EU Presidency was the launch of the youth guarantee scheme throughout Europe.  I applaud the work of Labour Party MEP, Ms Emer Costello, on the issue in the European Parliament.<\/p><p>We should approach the implementation of the guarantee with missionary zeal.  As some countries have demonstrated, particularly in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, if training supports are properly applied and we do not simply sit back waiting for people to show up at the doors, then the results can be excellent.<\/p><p>I wish to raise an issue relating to our future relationship within the European Union.  I do not believe we are short of fundamental and serious issues to discuss, but within the coming years there is a distinct possibility that Scotland may withdraw from the United Kingdom and that the loss of Scottish votes, in turn, could ratchet up the chances of a referendum, leading to the rest of Britain pulling out of the European Union.  If Britain were to leave the European Union it would have a major impact on Irish trade and on our relationship with Northern Ireland as well as a host of other issues.  Not every impact would be negative, since some multinational companies might decide to relocate their activity from Britain to Ireland to stay within the EU.  However, either way the issues are real.  I wonder what thinking is under way in government about how we would manage such a scenario.  For the sake of argument, would we support an independent Scotland's application for EU membership?  Have we considered the implications for other older democracies with large populations which have aspirations for a separate identity?  How would this tie in with the current enlargement of the European Union?  Would these countries which would have to apply for membership again stack up behind Serbia?<\/p><p>We have seen some positive issues such as the emergence of the multi-annual financial framework to 2020.  This framework provides great advantages in terms of certainty on the level of funding that is likely to be available over time for critical projects like the youth guarantee scheme.  There is a good deal for us to learn nationally.  Instead of spending all our budget in one year we will be allowed to move it into the following year.<\/p><p>At the same time I wish to exercise a note of caution.  I am not necessarily convinced that the collective sense of EU governments along with the Commission has been sufficiently proactive in responding to the dangers of deflation and insufficient demand.  Let us consider some of the dialogue at European level.  We have heard a flavour of it in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have been struck by the emphasis on budgetary discipline and the apparent assumption that it was a lack of discipline by governments that has been the cause of the current recession.  In reality, it was the collapse of key parts of the private sector that resulted in the previous balanced government budgets going drastically into deficit.<\/p><p>Is enough attention being paid within the EU and among the EU leadership to agreeing indicators on private borrowing, as opposed to government borrowing, and to when it is getting dangerously out of control?  What collective action should be taken to moderate that, when necessary?  Setting solvency ratios for individual lending institutions under the Basel accords are not sufficient.  We need to have a clear systematic view at sectoral level of relevant danger signals as well as the capacity to act on them.<\/p><p>In respect of the capacity to act, I am concerned that the German constitution has been changed to significantly constrain the ability of the German Government to borrow from 2016.  We face a major challenge, therefore, in building the collective will at European level to confront our economic challenges as effectively as possible.  I do not envy the Government's task and the challenge that this presents.  It is important for all of us to build up within the European Union the capacity to act, to build alliances and to persuade others throughout the entire front of action.<\/p><p>The growing level of inequality in the western world and Europe is of concern.  This has been raised in the US Congress by President Obama and it has been put to the centre of the agenda.  Many people support the deregulation of markets as far as possible on the basis that markets are a force of nature best left to themselves.  However, the reality is that markets are social institutions and if they are to work there must be rules to address them.  Professor Joseph Stiglitz has referred to the fact that the wealth amassed by the top 1% has been due to their ability to influence how those rules are written.<\/p><p>I will finish by referring to the citizens' Europe and promoting equality.  This issue has been raised by several others.  There has been a breakdown.  It is clear from attitude surveys throughout Europe that support within member states has weakened for the citizens' Europe.  We cannot afford to be complacent about this.  One of the factors that has been influential in weakening popular identification with Europe - the Minister of State raised this in the context of enlargement and I note he takes a positive attitude towards enlargement - has been the extent and the speed of enlargement that has taken place within the past decade.  I am not at all against enlargement.  I can see why it is a necessary thing.  However, we should be conscious of how our citizens experience it.  For example, people in Ireland were once able to name all the members of the European Union but few of them can do so today.  It is tempting for the Government and all governments to try to win friends by telling other applicant states that they support their admission to the European Union, but that is not sufficient.<\/p> <p>There needs to be a clearer understanding of where Europe begins and ends.  The Union must be based on a broad sense of identity, founded on some form of common historical experience, or else it is simply an abstract set of criteria with which people will not identify sufficiently.<\/p><p>Ireland and the world in general needs a healthy and positive EU working cohesively and effectively to build a more prosperous, equal and sustainable future.  Much has been achieved, but as has been said on many occasions, a lot remains to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500017#R00200","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391604600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>We are up against the clock, but I will give Senator Clune a couple of minutes.

I wish the Minister of State well.  I appreciate the importance of the work he is doing.<\/p><p>One point I would like to raise is the European Regional Development Fund and funding for urban renewal projects, which we hear may be excluded this time around.  Cities like Cork, Dublin, Waterford and Galway, and probably Limerick as well, would not receive funding under this round, but it is important that they would.  They are major cities, with many people living there.  We need to work with what we have in renewing our urban facilities.  I cannot stress how important that is.  The Minister of State is nodding as if he is aware of it, but it is something I wanted to raise directly with him.<\/p><p>There are many other issues I would like to raise with him, but the situation in Ukraine is very sad.  I would like him to encourage dialogue at all levels, which I think is very important.  It is distressing to see scenes on our televisions of people being kicked and batoned by their own police force.  This is a force that is supposed to protect citizens, but unfortunately that is not happening.  I have visited Ukraine myself and it is divided between the EU and the west.  The young people there want to move towards the EU.  The protests there are peaceful at the moment, and I hope it stays like that.  It is a very important conflict and I urge the Minister of State to maintain dialogue when and wherever he can on that issue.<\/p><p>I would also like to speak about the situation in Syria and its refugees.  Senator Leyden and I are members of the Council of Europe.  Last week we had a representation from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees who stated there 2.2 million refugees who have gone to neighbouring countries, and 1.1 million of those are children.  There are 4.25 million internally displaced persons.  The special rapporteur on human rights has called on the parties involved in the conflict to ensure international organisations and NGOs would be allowed to access and help refugees, especially those who are internally displaced in their country, particularly women and children, who represent the bulk of the affected people.  Most of the refugees have gone to Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq.  Those countries have taken on an enormous burden, even though they are developing countries themselves.  Lebanon does not have the infrastructure to host such a large number of refugees, and this is causing tension in the host countries.  I know they are outside the EU, but member states such as Austria, Bulgaria, France, Germany and Luxembourg have accepted some refugees.  Have we a strategy on this?  We need to keep working on it.  The children have no education and are forced to work under conditions that are contrary to the international convention on human rights.  There is sexual and gender-based violence, rape, forced marriage and prostitution.  There is a real issue here.  Is the European Union doing enough to support these people, who may never be repatriated to their own country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500018#S00300","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1391604600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I let in Senator Clune with great reluctance because we are out of time, but I will also allow Senator Mullen a couple of minutes.

I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his speech.  What is the Government's intention on protecting farmers the context of his reference to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership?  In light of the recent trade deal with Canada, there is significant concern that the EU's trade agreements with the US may very well leave Irish farmers in a worse position.  I can see the positive aspects of promoting trade, and the Minister of State mentioned the billions of euro in value to the EU, but it is also important to remember Ireland's particular local interests.  I would have been grateful for a specific reference to a commitment to protecting the interests of our farmers.<\/p><p>We saw the best and the worst of the European Union and the European Parliament in recent days.  Today we have the good news about the European Parliament adopting updated rules on the protection of consumer rights for air passengers, including compensation, relaxation of baggage rules when there are long delays or cancellations, allowing passengers to use the return part of their ticket even if they did not use the outward leg of their journey and so on.  I welcome the EU's initiatives in this area.  The EU does seek to protect consumers, often in the face of unscrupulous practices of big business.  The European Parliament has indeed been a forum for such considerations.  As an island nation, Irish citizens are particularly vulnerable to sharp practice by certain airlines, and I would like to know if the Government is supportive of such initiatives at EU level on the side of the consumer.<\/p><p>On the negative side, we saw the Lunacek report which came out today.  The EU rightly has set out to combat intolerance and homophobia, although I do not think the intolerance and homophobia party would get many votes anyway, nor should it deserve to do so.  However, under the guise of promoting common values, the EU often undermines - in the Lunacek report it proposes undermining - member state autonomy in areas that are of member state competence.  An example is education, where the report proposes the mutual recognition of civil papers and education programmes, which perhaps could be better described as re-education programmes.  This runs the risk of the likes of well funded organisations like ILGA Europe and other well researched insiders on the NGO scene getting money from the EU in the first instance, then making recommendations back to the EU.  Where is the EU money for organisations that would try to promote the cause of marriage as necessary for the upbringing of children?  In setting out to protect minorities, the EU often ends up running the risk of discriminating against other minorities and closing down free speech.  That is a very relevant consideration in recent days here in Ireland, given the discussion we have had about allegations of homophobia being thrown around the place.  I am concerned about the insiders in the EU who tend to be well funded, who adopt bogus methodologies and who seek to undermine member states' competence in areas like education, which ought to be sovereign matters for member states.  That is a big concern I have about the EU, and I would like to see the Government and Irish MEPs taking a much stronger stand in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500018#S00500","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1391604600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I call on the Minister of State to reply.

I should have made clear in my contribution that I am always available to come to the House to discuss matters in respect of Europe in any sphere.  If I have missed out on any of the points raised, I would be happy to come back again, but I will do my best to go through all of them in turn.<\/p><p>Senator Leyden expressed the view that Europe may have moved too strongly in respect of Ukraine.  I would contend that the negotiations which took place between the European Union and Ukraine were always very respectful of the right of the Ukrainian Government to determine its own course of action to make a decision on behalf of its own people.  Even when the negotiations broke down during the partnership summit, the Commission and all the Heads of State always emphasised that it was the legitimate right of the Ukrainian Government to decide what course of action it wanted to take on its future and on the future of its people.  The challenge now is to come up with a relationship between Ukraine and the European Union that can coexist with other kinds of relationships that the Ukrainian Government might want to develop.  As Senator Clune mentioned when she spoke about her visit there, it is a massive country both physically and in terms of its population.  It is directly in the interests of Europe that we enable a very peaceful and credible resolution to difficulties that are taking place there at the moment.<\/p><p>After my visit to Bosnia Herzegovina, I am very aware of the difficulties to which the Senator alluded.  However, I also believe that the EU can continue to play a constructive and positive role in dealing with its resolution through the offices of Mr. Peter S&oslash;renson, who is the High Representative of the European Union in that country.<\/p> <p> With regard to comments made about the Council of Europe, I have met the Irish ambassador to the Council of Europe and I share the words that Senator Leyden expressed about him.  If the opportunity were ever to develop for me to speak to the Council or its members, I would be delighted to do so.  I am well aware, just like the Senator, of the long-standing role played by Ireland and, as he said, that Ireland is a founder country.<\/p><p>I will move on to discuss the contribution made by Senator Noone and thank her for her questions and comments.  She made a point about Dr. John O'Brennan, National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  He is one of the leading figures who understands the level of engagement the Oireachtas has with the European Union and he has made constructive proposals.  At present all of the engagement takes place, as the Senator will be aware, through our committee system.  Some committees are doing the work very well, but other committees handle it in a different manner.  I have written to all the committees asking them to assess how they are dealing with European scrutiny and to supply me with the information.  I have asked for the task to be completed by the end of January.  I intend, on receipt of the information, to make constructive and practical proposals on what we can do to change how we conduct our business.  In fairness to members on all sides of the House, we are doing an incomparably better job on it now than we did a number of years ago.  However, we can do even better in a few areas.<\/p><p>With regard to the forthcoming European Parliament elections, I entirely agree with Senator Noone on their importance.  She was correct when she said their timing will mean a smaller window of opportunity for the Greek Presidency because the European Parliament must be dissolved more than half-way through its presidency.<\/p><p>The Senator was also correct with her comments on Portugal.  The Portuguese Government, with which I am lucky to work closely in a number of areas, has made extraordinary efforts to respond to its difficulties.  I hope the way Ireland has exited its external aid programme will be of help to the Portuguese Government.  Only two weeks ago Portugal successfully sold a large amount of its government debt at an interest rate that I hope will play a role in ensuring its exit from its programme.  We all hope that happens very soon.<\/p><p>The Senator also commented on the Ukraine, which I touched on earlier in answer to Senator Leyden's comments.  I agree with her comments on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, and Senator Mullen also made a fair point on the matter.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Reilly for her contribution and understand her concerns about the defence policy.  The same concerns were articulated by Deputy Crowe during the debate that took place in the D&aacute;il after the European Council meeting to which she referred.  I must emphasise that policy discussions must take place within the framework of the Lisbon treaty.  The treaty and its protocols specifically reflect Ireland's stance on the issues.  We are a neutral country, a stance I believe is of huge benefit to Ireland.  We may be neutral but we also have security concerns as a country and we have a duty to our people to uphold them.  It is purely within that spirit that we engage with other member states on this point.  I am happy to return to the House to address the matter in greater length.<\/p><p>With regard to the Senator's comment on voting rights, like the Senator I am aware of the Commission's communication on the matter.  The Constitutional Convention has made proposals on the area to which the Government will respond.<\/p><p>With regard to the Senator's two comments on the 2020 strategy and the semester process, the broad heading of both of the questions was how the Oireachtas can engage constructively with them.  There is a great opportunity for the Oireachtas to do two things, the first of which is to understand as well as possible the nature of the work.  The second thing is that individual Members must make their views clear on the content of the work.  It is clear to me how the work should be done.  Up to this point I would have said that it should be through the sectoral committees, and I encourage them to take the lead.  However, as a Minister with some responsibility in the area, I think our committees can play an even more important role in the area.  Perhaps the Leader of the Seanad and its parties will consider what role to play in the run-up to the preparation of the national reform plan and the interaction that will take place with the Commission.<\/p><p>With regard to the different points touched on by Senator Hayden, I agree with her on the role of the youth guarantee scheme.  As members will know, the way in which the scheme will be rolled out was made clearer by the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and included the development of the Pathways to Work scheme and the work that is taking place in the area.  Like the Senator, I acknowledge the work done by Ms Emer Costello, MEP, and compliment her on leading the initiative and on doing such work.<\/p><p>With regard to the point made about Scottish independence and what might happen with the UK, the Senator wryly and accurately made the point that we are, unfortunately, not low on things on our horizon that could have a very great impact on us.  The debate that is taking place in the United Kingdom is one matter.  I have contributed publicly on a number of occasions to the debate on our principles regarding the United Kingdom issue.  Senator Noone has quoted one of my contributions and I might have an opportunity to allude to the matter when discussing another point.  I strongly believe that the overriding framework is as follows, subject to the consent of the Irish people.  There should be no ambiguity whatsoever regarding the view of the Government, and I hope future governments, that the European Union is the best vehicle for us to progress our national interests, and that we are and will continue to be positive members.  I strongly believe that a continued strong dimension to our future will be as successful as it has been in our past.  Given the kind of uncertainty alluded to by the Senator, it is in our interest to make that clear.<\/p><p>The referendum on membership that may take place in the United Kingdom is first and foremost a British debate, but one that could have an Irish consequence.  If and when the debate regarding the referendum is clearer, it is important that we continue to emphasise the kind of principles I have spelled out to date.<\/p><p>I agree with the point made about the causes of the economic difficulty.  Yes, the decisions made by national governments on their budgets, structure and sustainability played a role in the crisis, but it was not the only role.  It is correct to say that the role of collapsing banking systems and how the consequences were managed were decisive as well.  It is on that note that I agree with the point about the risks that deflation poses to a fragile recovery.  We are so used to dealing with the consequences of inflation in this part of the world that it is quite difficult for us to grasp the concept that people feeling that their money will be worth less in the future can have equally damaging effects on the current economic recovery.  That is something of which I am very much aware and it is a risk on which I know the European Central Bank, in particular, has commented.<\/p><p>I have touched on the point Senator Clune made about the Ukraine.  She also touched on the subject of the European Regional Development Fund.  I am aware of the important role the fund can play in urban regeneration.  I know that to be the case in Waterford, as mentioned by Senator Cummins, and it is the case for Senator Clune regarding Cork.  The same also applies to many parts of Dublin, including some parts of Dublin that I represent.  I will get back to Senator Clune at an early point to update her on the matter and on what work will be done.<\/p> <p>It is an important area and I am eager to ensure the proposals in our last budget are implemented in order that people can see the benefit.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of Syrian refugees.  It is a staggering humanitarian crisis.  We have to acknowledge the extraordinary burden taken on by many countries as a result.  Countries such as Turkey have hundreds of thousands of refugees inside their borders.  The Senator mentioned Lebanon, a country that was not free of difficulty before this happened.  It is also bearing an incredible burden.  Member states are involved through the Geneva process that is under way to try to stem the flow of people out of Syria and to try to create better conditions for them in the country.  I acknowledge the agreement in place for the city of Homs but that needs to be implemented.  During December's European Council, the Union put in place a number of short-term measures to better and more fairly manage the situation across all member states.  However, there will be a more substantive discussion on this at next June's Council meeting.  I assure the Senator that it is being discussed in the manner he would want.<\/p><p>I am not cheerleading regarding the TTIP but it could deliver broad wins for our economy, particularly as the agreement is with the second most globalised country in the world, which has either been the first or second most globalised country for many years.  I agree with him regarding the need to be aware of the concerns of our agricultural sector, which exported &euro;10 billion worth of food and drink last year.  The industry has been the backbone of the economy during the recent collapse.  I assure the Senator regarding our continued focus on the concerns of those in the sector.  At each stage of the negotiations led by the Commission, member states receive an update and we then engage with stakeholders regarding where they stand.  We are very much aware of the perspective of the farming community in this regard.  We have done this in other areas such as the recent Commission proposal on climate change and energy policy.  It clearly recognised the role of the agricultural community and the Government was active in ensuring due recognition of this was given by the Commission for the reasons the Senator described.<\/p><p>He also referred to the undermining of national competencies.  I am a strong supporter of the EU project and the role it can play in allowing countries such as ours to manage the difficulties we face and grasp opportunities that are available.  I will communicate strongly that many areas come within national competence.  Europe can play a role in allowing us to understand what other countries do that we might be able to learn from.  However, there are areas that are the prerogative of national governments and I assure the Senator that I am sensitive to that.

Their legal context has been considered in detail and they have been discussed and approved by the D&aacute;il and are now before the Seanad for consideration by this House.<\/p><p>Enhancing the role and powers of Oireachtas committees is at the heart of the Government's reform agenda.  Since taking office less than three years ago, the Government has established a new Oireachtas committee structure, encouraging more public involvement in law-making by introducing the pre-legislative stage at committee and giving committees additional roles in the budget process and with a post-enactment review of legislation.<\/p><p>The Standing Orders before the Seanad today make provisions in four areas, namely, the replacement of a chair of an inquiry committee, bias in regard to the subject matter of an inquiry, expanded terms of reference of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and a gateway mechanism which includes provisions on the consideration of inquiry reports.<\/p><p>The first change is to provide that where the chair of an inquiry committee is to be replaced, the House, not the members of the committee, will appoint the chair.  The next change relates to the concept of objective bias.  Addressing the issue of bias is vital to the functioning, fairness and public perception of any Oireachtas inquiry system.  The CPP can consider any issue of bias and make a recommendation as to whether bias exists or not.  The third change to Standing Orders expands the remit of the CPP, in line with provisions of the Act.  The CPP will have responsibility for evaluating inquiry proposals and making recommendations to the House.<\/p><p>The CPP will act as an oversight committee where an inquiry is undertaken, including regulating issues of bias, approving requests for compellability and providing guidelines on conducting inquiries and other committee business where compellability is involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500021#V02300","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1391606100,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Is the Minister of State referring to the CPP of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or the CPP of Seanad &Eacute;ireann?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500021#V02400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1391606100,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I will deal with that when I get to it.<\/p><p>The final proposed change to Standing Orders outlines how the gateway system will work.

This inquiry must be free from all outside interference and already the fact that the Chief Whip is announcing this debate breaches that constitutional requirement and the Seanad is allowing that to happen.  It also creates difficulties further on.  It is ludicrous in the extreme that after the referendum, when there is an independent Seanad, subject to the Constitution, the Minister of State comes in to talk about the CPP and it does not even relate to this House.

We are not allowed to subjugate ourselves to Government.  We must carry out our functions in accordance with the Constitution and the powers therein and we must do so independently.  That is even more necessary in light of the referendum because the people said they want to keep the Seanad as a check on the Government but the Government is here telling us how to conduct our affairs on a very serious matter of public importance.<\/p><p>It is really important that the Oireachtas gets this right.  We have got off on the wrong footing here.  There is a very significant judgment in the Abbeylara case.  That decision was not just a check on the Oireachtas.  It was a criticism of certain Members of the Oireachtas who went beyond their powers at the time.<\/p> <p>It places a significant check on the D&aacute;il in the context of the latter overstepping its powers.  The Abbeylara decision cannot be ignored and neither can concerns in respect of people's constitutional right to due process.  Concerns were expressed across the board, including by those in government, about the conduct of certain members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was no wrongdoing on the part of any member of that committee but some individuals were more than willing to milk the media circus for all it was worth.  That is the danger which exists and I know everyone is conscious of it.<\/p><p>The Seanad has its own Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP.  That committee should exercise its powers under the Constitution and the Standing Orders of the House.  I do not believe we have any authority to delegate its powers to the CPP of the D&aacute;il.  Standing Orders allow the CPP of the D&aacute;il to consider any issue of bias.  The Minister of State confirmed that and I would be grateful if the Chief Whip on the Government side in this House could also confirm it.  Any issue of bias will, following consideration by the D&aacute;il CPP, be put to a vote.  Essentially, therefore, it is a political decision as to whether someone is biased.<\/p><p>That gives rise to a difficulty.  Fianna F&aacute;il has continually sought that someone from outside the political system, or even from outside the country, carry out a comprehensive and televised investigation into all aspects of this matter, be it in the context of political, banking or accounting decisions or in respect of the conduct of individuals in the banking sector.  Of course, this was all done in the past.  The only difference was that it was not done in public.  There were a number of inquiries into the banking system and the recommendations and findings that emerged from them were extremely stark.  They certainly did not flatter the previous Administration and were quite critical of the decisions that were made.  The reports to which I refer have been allowed to gather dust.  In fairness, however, there is a desire for this matter to be investigated in public.  It is a pity the commission of investigation did not carry out its deliberations in public.  Had it done so, many problems would have been solved.  The commission met a large number of people and considered many documents.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has stated that it will take part in whatever inquiry is carried out and I certainly have no difficulty being involved.  However, any inquiry must be fair.  The inquiry will involve more than just those in politics.  It will also involve civil servants, those whose names are well known, regulators and people in the banks whose names are not well known but which may come to public attention on foot of this inquiry.<\/p><p>I must restate my objection to the effect that the House is required, under the Constitution, to regulate its own affairs without interference.  Unfortunately, the Government is essentially giving us our marching orders today.  That is a clear breach of the Constitution and it will give rise to difficulties.  I am of the view that the Government Chief Whip should check the position with the Attorney General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500021#V03000","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391606700,"counter":169,"content":"<p>For clarification, I wish to state that these amendments are being made to the Standing Orders of Seanad &Eacute;ireann relative to public business.

I wish to point out to my learned colleague opposite, Senator Byrne, that we are completely free of any outside interference.  The CPP of the Seanad met - a gathering at which I was present - and recommended these new Standing Orders as being necessary.  The most senior official of the Houses of the Oireachtas, another official and a legal adviser were all present and the members of CPP were able to question them before arriving at an agreement to put forward the proposals which are before the House.<\/p><p>The Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 makes provision for an Oireachtas inquiry to function within our political system.  I am of the view that the Seanad will play an active part in the Oireachtas inquiries that will emerge as a result of the Act.  The proposed new Standing Orders will present a framework for the forthcoming Oireachtas inquiry.  The new system to which they will give rise will allow the Oireachtas to investigate issues of concern to the Irish public.  The Standing Orders before the House relate to four areas already outlined by the Minister of State, namely, the replacement of a chair of an inquiry, the question of bias and how to deal with it, the expanded terms of reference of the CPP and the introduction of a system under which the CPP can review proposals and establish inquiries.<\/p><p>The first Oireachtas inquiry to be established will likely be that relating to the banking sector.  Such an inquiry is long overdue.  I would welcome a banking inquiry because it is time that the people who helped cause the economic collapse were brought before a committee of the Irish Parliament to explain their actions.  There are many questions in respect of the economic collapse which remain unanswered.  Government policy in the years before the economic collapse is one of the matters which should be assessed by the committee tasked with carrying out the inquiry.  There can be no doubt that the mismanagement of our economy at Government level was a factor in the disaster that befell our country.  The failure of regulation in the banking sector has had dire consequences and should also be considered by any banking inquiry.<\/p><p>Representatives from the banks should also be brought before the committee - along with the relevant accountants and auditors - in order that we might discover how and why the financial position in which those institutions found themselves at the time was not identified sooner.  The events that occurred on the night of the bank guarantee are the darkest in recent Irish political life.  Many people do not fully understand what happened on that night.  It is time that this matter was brought before an Oireachtas inquiry in order that the true position in respect of the decisions taken on that night is fully outlined to the public.  For over five years, members of the public have lived with the consequences of the actions and decisions taken at that time.<\/p><p>I welcome the new Standing Orders as the next step towards establishing Oireachtas inquiries, which are absolutely necessary.  I am of the view that this is the best system to uncover the truth about issues of public concern.  I hope that we, as Members of the Seanad, we will give these Standing Orders our unanimous support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500022#W00500","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1391606700,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  I am glad that the position regarding the two CPPs has been clarified.  Should the Oireachtas, in its wisdom, decide that this House and its Members should have a role to play in respect of this matter, then I would welcome that.<\/p><p>  I appreciate what Senator Byrne, who is a person with legal training, said.  The Senator always places his experience in the legal field at the disposal of the House.  I asked some friends with experience in legal matters to comment on the new Standing Orders and they indicated that they set a very high standard.  For example, they stated that the standard is higher than that relating to members of the Judiciary being obliged to recuse themselves from cases, people on the boards of companies who might be obliged to absent themselves from meetings or university staff being obliged to absent themselves from examination boards if their sons or daughters were sitting particular examinations.  The bar has been set extremely high as there would be concerns with regard to how the new system will operate.  As the Minister of State indicated, we are learning as we proceed.<\/p><p>  The new Standing Order 85A refers to circumstances where a &quot;member is aware of anything in his or her own behalf which might lead to a perception of bias arising&quot;.  It is suggested that we might consider those with a fair mind and informed perception in this regard because it will be very difficult to find individuals who, as Senator Paul Coghlan indicated, do not have some perception about what happened to the country.  People have either spoken or written about this subject and it should be understood that individuals are fair-minded and have an informed perception.  The new Standing Order 85C(1)(<i>b<\/i>) states, &quot;The Committee on Procedure and Privileges shall, as soon as is practicable, consider the submission under paragraph (<i>a<\/i>), and give the member in question the opportunity to make a submission to the Committee in defence of his or her position, in such form as the Committee sees fit.&quot;  I propose that in doing so, the CPP should have due regard to the seriousness of any allegation made under paragraph (<i>a<\/i>).<\/p><p>  In the context of the proposed changes to Standing Order 90, subparagraph (<i>f<\/i>) suggests the insertion of the phrase &quot;as part of its responsibility for overseeing procedure in Committees, consider matters relating to perception of bias in respect of a Part 2 inquiry, for the purpose of preserving the integrity of the Part 2 inquiry as it is being conducted by the inquiry Committee&quot;.<\/p> <p>This relates to the perception of bias and what we may consider to be fair-minded and informed in that regard.  I put the document to some learned legal friends. <\/p><p>We must try to avoid replicating some of the unsatisfactory events that have arisen in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It would be better if members chose not to give interviews on matters that are still in progress.  That is a matter of general agreement between me and the Minister of State.  It is, as Senator Paul Coghlan stated, a most important issue.<\/p><p>Ireland did not have proper procedures in place for the regulation of banks.  The regulators were extremely slow to wake up to this and they, too, have a duty to face inquiries.  What exactly were those employed by the State to regulate banks doing?<\/p><p>The case of DEPFA, a German bank operating in the IFSC, should be part of the investigation.  This was the first event in the banking crisis and one which appears to have cost &euro;100 billion, a much higher sum than the &euro;64 billion we paid for the banking crisis.  We did not have an early warning system in place.  Germany paid the bills arising from the DEPFA case because it was a foreign bank.  The case did not do our reputation any good, however, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has been trying to correct this.  The DEPFA case should form part of the general inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500022#W00600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391607300,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to debate these draft Standing Orders.  As colleagues will be aware, we had a full debate when the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill came before the House.  Senator Susan O'Keeffe spoke for the Labour Party group on that occasion and we had a full debate on the mechanisms for inquiry.  The Standing Orders before us were debated and adopted at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Senator Paul Coghlan outlined how the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges dealt with them last week.  The Minister of State is before this House because the committee requested that we debate the draft Standing Orders on the floor of the House, which is welcome.  We need to be clear about the reason we are debating the Standing Orders with the Minister of State.  If this debate had not been sought, this matter would have been for the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges to deal with.<\/p><p>As the Chair confirmed and as is clear from a reading of the text, Standing Orders relate to the Seanad and its Members.  All of us accept the context in which a banking inquiry is being established, the importance of ensuring the mechanism for conducting inquiries is clearly set out and the need to provide clear guidelines on important issues such as allegations of bias in the conduct of inquiries.  The Minister of State noted the importance of people hearing directly from those who made the decisions that brought about the economic collapse.  All Members of the Houses should agree that an Oireachtas inquiry, held in public, is the most appropriate mechanism for achieving this objective.  I regret that the referendum on the powers of committees was not passed as it would have enabled an even more comprehensive inquiry to take place.  Notwithstanding the result of the referendum, the relevant legislation and these Standing Orders were passed to ensure the most comprehensive inquiry possible could be carried out. <\/p><p>On the substance of the draft Standing Orders, which make provision in four areas, it is eminently sensible to set out clearly how the chair of an inquiry committee would be replaced.  It is appropriate that this would be done by resolution of the House rather than simply by the relevant committee.  This is important in terms of perceptions of the status of the chair of such an important inquiry.<\/p><p>On the issue of bias, Senator Barrett correctly noted how difficult it will be to find Members of either House who have never expressed a view on matters relating to banking.  The Senator also made a good point on the importance of members of committees that are undertaking investigations declining to give interviews that may appear to prejudge issues. <\/p><p>I welcome the decision to set out clearly a step-by-step procedure to be adopted in circumstances where a member of a committee of inquiry believes himself or herself to be biased in the conduct of an inquiry or where any other member believes that a member who has not recused himself or herself may be biased or there may be a perception of bias.  I welcome the clear guidance that has been given in this regard.  The issue of bias has arisen in committees on which I sit and it is important that members know how it will be dealt with. <\/p><p>In respect of Standing Orders generally, I hope Senators will sit on the banking inquiry.  I understand no decision has been made on the composition of the committee for the banking inquiry.  I hope the House will adopt the Standing Orders adopted by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as they envisage Senators taking part in committees of inquiry.  I hope the banking inquiry will be the first inquiry on which Senators sit.  Will the Minister of State confirm that Senators will be included on the committee?<\/p><p>The Constitutional Convention considered the issue of D&aacute;il reform at the weekend.  Many of the issues that arose were related to accountability and how the Houses of the Oireachtas can hold Ministers, public officials and private individuals to account.  Some of the recommendations made by the convention are interesting in that regard.  We recommended, for example, that committees be given constitutional status in recognition of the important role they have in holding people to account.  We also recommended greater independence for the Ceann Comhairle and that the Ceann Comhairle be elected by secret ballot and have the power to set business in the D&aacute;il.  The Seanad had a particular difficulty with a logjam of legislation - the Minister of State will be aware of the problem - and in getting business into the House.  Some of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention would free up and facilitate an easier flow of legislation in both Houses.  This would be of benefit to the democratic process. <\/p><p>It is important to stress that this issue relates to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges and Seanad procedures.  The D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges tried to make rules for the Seanad in terms of access to the audiovisual room and we resisted them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500023#X00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1391607300,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  I also welcome the legal clarification provided by Senator Bacik because it is important to ensure we get this issue right in as far as it is legally possible to do so.  There is a strong prospect of a legal challenge being mounted to any banking inquiry.  For this reason, we must seek to ensure there are no doubts or blemishes in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Thomas Byrne raised some pertinent questions which have been partially answered and I am sure the Minister of State will confirm the legal position in that regard.  <\/p><p>Some weeks ago, I expressed a view, which was brought to the attention of the Minister of State, that Senators should sit on any proposed inquiry.  As the Minister of State noted, the Standing Orders relate to a banking inquiry of the Oireachtas.  According to the constitutional definition of the word, &quot;Oireachtas&quot; means the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  It is important for taxpayers that the inquiry will be conducted fairly and impartially in the cold light of day by people who are not permanently looking over their shoulders to ascertain what is or is not popular.  I am not canvassing for a place on the committee that will conduct the banking inquiry but, to use Senator Coghlan's phrase, many of my colleagues would be eminently suitable for such a role, having proved that both inside and outside the House over many years.  <\/p><p>Taxpayers are funding the bailout and have suffered as a result of the problems into which we propose to inquire.  We owe it to them to present the best possible inquiry team.  The electorate has voted confidence in the Seanad.  We have never had such a vote in respect of the D&aacute;il.  If Senators are not part of the inquiry team, it would make a mockery of the Government's intentions and the Minister of State's words that the enhancing of the roles and powers of Oireachtas committees is at the heart of the Government's reform agenda.  While I presume the Minister of State will not be the final adjudicator on that issue, I ask him, on behalf of all Senators, to ensure the elected second House of the Oireachtas is allowed to play a full and constructive role in the banking inquiry. <\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State's presentation to us.  I welcome the required change in the Standing Orders.  We have all been here before when Standing Orders were challenged and perhaps ended up needing to be amended further.  Nobody ever has the perfect answer.  Today, we are laying part of the foundation block for the banking inquiry.  We must do it properly.  We must try to get answers to the questions raised here today as fully and as quickly as possible.  Senator Byrne advised the Government to seek the advice of the Attorney General.  We are often politically fearful of double-checking such matters.  If Senator Byrne feels that the Attorney General should provide a quick response to the questions he has raised, I do not think it would cause much political turmoil or upheaval to get any clarification that might be required.  I suppose Senator Bacik is the nearest thing we have to an Attorney General in the House at the moment.  Her welcome intervention, in which she provided some legal clarification, was helpful in that regard.  I wish the Minister of State well as he tries to make progress with this matter.  I ask him to give serious consideration to the constructive role that the Seanad and Senators could play in the proposed inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500023#X00300","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391607900,"counter":178,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is always welcome to the House.  It is good to see him.  The changes to Standing Orders that have been presented are probably appropriate.  One of the issues I have is that we are doing this half-blind.  While we have heard certain comments, we do not have the full details of the composition or terms of reference of the proposed banking inquiry, which needs to happen.  It seems from the Government's public comments that the remit of the inquiry will not extend beyond the night of the guarantee itself and will not include any reference to Anglo Irish Bank because of a court case that is in train as we speak.  Can the Minister of State comment on that?  I suggest it is nearly akin to having \"Hamlet\" without the prince.<\/p><p>We do not know how many politicians - certainly Deputies and possibly Senators as well - will be ratified by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on foot of these proposals.  We do not know what quarter they will come from.  I understand the issue with regard to bias that concerns those who have previously made comments on the banks.  As Senator Barrett has said, it will be incredibly difficult to select people who have the requisite experience and knowledge to participate in this inquiry, but who have not commented in some kind of negative way on this country's banking system.<\/p><p>I would like to comment further on the whole issue of Anglo Irish Bank.  I do not understand why one would want to pursue a banking inquiry without discussing Anglo Irish Bank, on the basis that the court case could take four or five months and further investigations will also take place.  We will not be able to ask questions about the level of contact between the Minister of State's party leader - the current Taoiseach - and Matt Moran.  We will not be able to ask why Matt Moran has been granted immunity from prosecution in the current investigations and the current court case.  Questions need to be asked about the Taoiseach's level of contact with and knowledge of certain individuals.  Previous Taoisigh also need to answer questions at the banking inquiry.  I would like to know why Anglo Irish Bank, according to what I have heard, is being left out of this.  Why are we stopping on the night of the guarantee?  I suggest that the review and renewal of the guarantee 12 months later should also be looked into.  It is crucial for this aspect of the matter to be considered, particularly in the context of the input made by the European Central Bank and the European Commission when we sought to review the bank guarantee.  Such points are crucial.<\/p><p>I have no interest in the establishment of a banking inquiry that will be a political witch-hunt.  The timing of this move is also curious.  As this process moves forward, it could very well coincide with the next general election.  It smacks of what it really is.  Do we actually want to get to the truth, or do we want to have a Salem witch trial?  I want to get to the truth of it, as I think all of us do.  We are entitled to the truth.  The Seanad should have a part in this process.  Is it the case that Senators will serve on the banking inquiry?  I cannot understand what relevance the banking inquiry will have if Anglo Irish Bank is left out.<\/p><p>Many questions need to be asked of the current Administration and its predecessor in relation to Anglo Irish Bank.  I would like to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions some questions about the granting of immunity to a former senior official in Anglo Irish Bank who is well known to be well known to the current Taoiseach.  Was there any political interference in that decision?  These questions need to be answered.  While we will support the proposals before the House, we would like to know more about the composition of the inquiry, its terms of reference, how long it will serve and what type of legal advice the inquiry members will get.  Is it the case that the witnesses who will be brought in front of the inquiry will be allowed to avail of the services of lawyers but the members of the committee will not?<\/p><p>I will give these proposals as guarded a welcome as I can.  Many questions remain unanswered.  I suggest that we are getting no more than a piecemeal view of what the Government really wants to do on foot of these changes.  I want to know whether this House of the Oireachtas - the Seanad - will be included.  Regardless of whether it will be, the more important questions in this regard relate to what the members of the committee will be investigating, who will be called, what period of time will be covered and why the inquiry will not deal with events that took place after the night of the bank guarantee.  I believe the first review of the bank guarantee is also crucially important.  Anyone who was involved in the initial bank guarantee, including the current leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il and former Taoisigh, will have questions to answer at the banking inquiry.  My party has put it on the record that it will ask anyone to co-operate with the inquiry.  We want to make sure it is fair and it will get to the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500024#Y00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1391607900,"counter":179,"content":"<p>These proposals relate only to Standing Orders and not to anything else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500024#Y00300","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1391607900,"counter":180,"content":"<p>The Standing Orders are about the establishment of the banking inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500024#Y00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1391607900,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I agree with the view that has been expressed in this House regarding the composition of the proposed committee of inquiry.

Nothing that has been said up to now by the Minister of State or any other member of the Government to give us an indication of how this will play out.  I believe that following the experience of the tribunals of inquiry, there is no public appetite for a continuing inquiry process.  I have had a look at the Act under which these inquiries will be set up.  It is astonishing that, as I understand it, nothing in the Act in question imposes a time limit.  I cannot remember whether the question of providing for a time limit was discussed in this House or the other House during the debate on that legislation.  The imposition of a time limit will be vitally important when the Government is introducing specific proposals to set out the composition of the committee and its terms of reference, etc.  If we are to narrow the focus of this debate to the night of the bank guarantee, how long will it take to keep asking the same questions?  The reports of two inquiries that have covered this specific incident are already in the public domain.<\/p><p>I would like to comment briefly on the issue of bias.  What will happen if members are obliged to excuse themselves because they believe they would be biased in their approach to the committee?  I assume it would be a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or, more pertinently, for that committee's legal advisers.  What will happen if, subsequent to the appointment of the committee, a lawyer is sitting beside a witness who points out that a member of an inquiry made a statement or an utterance or said something that suggests he or she is biased in some way?  That member will have to be replaced.  A succession of allegations could be made at the committee after the appointment of its members.  This could lead to a change in membership.  I agree with the analysis of Senator Darragh O'Brien and some political commentators that this is nothing more than a witch-hunt.  It suits the Government that it involves nothing more than dumping on Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>In fact, it would have suited it if it could have got this inquiry up and running before the local elections.  However, I understand from explanations and clarifications given by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission that it is most unlikely that the hearings will take place before autumn at the earliest because of the terms of reference involved, the composition of the committee and the issue of bias, which is very important and relevant.  Therefore, the Minister of State will not get his way on this one.  It will not be an issue surrounding the local or European elections.  However, there is a real danger that unless a time limit is placed on it, the Government could spin this out for as long as it wants and bring it forward into the advent of the general election if the motivation is political rather than finding the truth.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500024#Y00700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391608500,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I wish to correct the record of the House.

I assure Members that had it been passed, the banking inquiry would have been well underway at this stage.  This is no witch-hunt on behalf of anyone.

I hope he is in one of these humours which means we will make good law today by improving this Bill further.  The amendment takes a little explanation.  The first part of the amendment aims to ensure some checks and balances for the customer, the person whose vehicle is insured.  When penalty points are erased from a driver's account - 12 points after three years - I am not sure that the record of the penalty points is completely erased.  I do not think that the old penalty points simply disappear into thin air three years to the day after they were received.  I know this is the intention but I wish to ensure they do not come back.  I do not think that a vehicle insurer should have the right to pry into a person's old records which could be used to load a person's insurance.  We all know about the large degree of speculation and theories tied to vehicle insurance.  If the Minister is going to allow insurance companies to request records then there should be some parameters on such a request.  This may seem to be technical or even excessive but I would like the Minister to accept this amendment as there is a duty on us as legislators to protect the citizen who is the customer.<\/p><p>  In my view, a person has the fundamental right to know if a private company is prying into his or her private business.  To allow private companies to pry into a person's private business concerns me and should concern all of us.  At the very least, this amendment would ensure that the person concerned knows that a company is looking into his or her business.  At the same time it may dissuade insurers from making so many requests.  The intention is that penalty points would be dropped after a certain period of years.  I do not like the thought that an insurance company could look up those records many years later.  This amendment is designed to copper-fasten the intention of the law as it stands.  I urge the Minister to consider the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500026#AA00600","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1391609100,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500026#AA00700","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1391609100,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the amendment.  Section 5 of the Bill will allow vehicle insurers to access certain information such as endorsements on individual licence records.  This replaces similar provisions in the 2010 Act which turned out to have been poorly drafted and in need of revision.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn has proposed two amendments to section 5.  The first would limit access by insurers to data from the three previous years while the second would provide a right on behalf of the driver to know that the information has been accessed by the insurer.  I have looked at both these proposals with interest and in my view they have merit.  I am inclined to agree in principle with the suggestion that access to insurance records would go back only three years, as this is the time frame within which penalty points count down. It is a logical cut off point and it seems there is no reason for details beyond that limit to be made available to insurance companies.  However, I want some more time to consider the implications and in particular whether there would be any consequences or legal implications for similar situations.  I would prefer, therefore, to consider this amendment in the context of the next road traffic Bill which will come later this year or early next year.  <\/p><p>On the question of the records relating to the individual's licence, I agree it is reasonable that individuals should know that their records have been accessed by an insurance company.  Under the proposal in the Bill, vehicle insurers seeking to access information relating to endorsements on a driver's record will have to reach a service level agreement with my Department specifying the terms and conditions under which they will have access to these records.  These terms will specify the conditions under which the information is provided and the way in which it can be used.  Therefore, on foot of the Senator's suggestion, I propose in these service level agreements to limit any information to records going back three years.  This will be written into the service level agreement.<\/p> <p>As this will be written into the service-level agreement, the aim of the amendment is achieved by this proposal.  The insurer will be required to inform its customer that the records have been checked and therefore the cost of the administrative burden will fall on the insurer.<\/p><p>I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment on the basis that we will incorporate both requirements in the service-level agreements to be agreed with the insurers.

On the last occasion the Minister was here I believe he said he had accepted amendments in the D&aacute;il on four occasions.  We are all on the one side in this.  I share the Minister's concern over the increase in road deaths from 163 to 190 after several years of very dramatic improvement in road safety statistics.  That is the spirit in which the amendments are proposed and if they are useful to the Minister on Report Stage or in the next Bill, that is fine and will show that the House is working together.  This is a problem we all wish to address.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Minister on &quot;N&quot; drivers and testing later on.  However, what about somebody who is not in the system and does not have a driving licence?  The first relevant legislation I could find was the Road Traffic Act 1961, which states in the driving licence section that a person who contravenes the Act shall be guilty of an offence.  Further down that page it refers to a fine not exceeding &pound;100.  It looks like the legislation was from the era when we lived in small towns and the garda&iacute; knew that the driver would bring in his or her licence in the following week.  While we have made great steps in training people and so on, allowing a driver simply to get back in a car and drive off seems to be something from 1961, which is why I have proposed stricter penalties for not having a licence.  As we move closer to the credit card-sized licence, drivers should have it and not waste Garda time in establishing whether the person will turn up and at what station.<\/p><p>  It should be a much more serious offence than a &pound;100 fine in 1961 prices to drive without a licence.  Once it is a small credit card-sized licence, all drivers should carry it with them so that Garda time is not wasted on these matters.  When we raised the issue previously, the Minister asked what would happen to somebody was on holidays in Kerry and his driving licence is in Donegal, or he is in a rush to the airport and forgot it.  We need to move to ensuring that unlicensed driving is penalised and if a driver does not turn up pretty quickly with a driving licence, that is also penalised and brought within the penalty points system.  For those with an existing penalty and do not have a driving licence, I would put it up to 12.  If it goes beyond ten days in producing it, the driver should be suspended and the vehicle impounded.<\/p><p>  There are just thought that occur to me on this.  I believe the Minister and I share the same goal.  What he has done on vehicle testing and the stricter training of drivers has had dramatic results.  How do we deal with people completely outside this system, going back to the very casual arrangements in the small villages of the Ireland of 1961?  Driving is a serious activity.

Where the driver fails to produce the licence or permit, the garda may require the driver to produce the licence or permit at a Garda station of the driver&rsquo;s choosing within ten days of the event.  The so-called ten-day rule is a practical measure as the person may be away from home on business or on holiday when stopped by a garda.  Where a driver fails to produce a valid licence or permit, he or she commits an offence and the Garda can then begin proceedings.<\/p><p>The Senator&rsquo;s amendment proposes the reduction of the leeway period to 48 hours.  While I accept that drivers should carry a licence at all times, I consider that a 48-hour period for production of the licence to be too onerous in circumstances where the driver may be away from home.  For example, the person may be taking a flight the next morning to go on holidays, or he or she may have left his or her licence in work or with somebody else and have to go and pick it up.  The person may find, God forbid, that he or she has to get on a plane to Brussels or Luxembourg for a European Council meeting and will not return for 48 hours.<\/p><p>I also believe that imposing six points is very onerous.  We will now disqualify large numbers of drivers after seven points.  This amendment could result in a driver being disqualified from driving because it took three days to find a licence or might have a vehicle impounded under those circumstances.  In addition, the amendment as proposed is not acceptable from a drafting point of view, as it refers to section 40 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, whereas in fact it should refer to section 40 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.<\/p><p>I have also discussed this proposal with representatives of the Garda.

That has come about because over the years when it has been impossible to match penalty points to a licence for some reason, they stay there and do not get counted down after three years.  It is not that 37% every year are unmatched; it is that because they are never matched they are never counted down.  Some of these could be penalty points imposed on a driver ten, nine, six or four years ago but they still accumulate.<\/p> <p>That is something we must deal with because that number will increase every year as they continue to accumulate.<\/p><p>The figures we have indicate that approximately 12.5% of events in any one year cannot be matched.  The figure is 12.5% because 75% of the 12.5% are foreign drivers.  Although we can record those penalty points we cannot impose them on a foreign licence.  We record them because if a driver hits 12 points we can disqualify him under a different law.

In the first part of my amendment I am trying to support the Minister's amendment seeking to raise penalty points for mobile telephone use on the basis that the distraction of finding cigarettes and matches, lighting them, smoking and so on is of the same order of magnitude.  I agree with the Minister's increased penalty for the use of mobile telephones while driving.  The mobile telephone penalty does not apply when the vehicle is stopped and I am seeking to use that aspect of it.  If a person wishes to have a puff, he should stop and make a mobile telephone call or have a cigarette.  However, the person should not engage in that form of distraction when he is travelling.<\/p><p>  The North Rhine-Westphalia state in Germany has banned smoking in cars for safety reasons.  I gather there are German court cases dealing with the matter now.  In addition to the health aspects of the matter, which Senator Crown and others in the House have been strong on, the road safety dimension of smoking while driving is now coming to be recognised.  The purpose of this part of the amendment is to show that the Minister's wish to increase the penalties for mobile telephone use when driving a car attracts the same penalties as smoking.<\/p><p>  The other parts of the amendment refer to cases led by the Minister's example.  We went through the penalty points legislation.  We could play parliamentary ping-pong about whether it should be &quot;5&quot; or &quot;7&quot; and so on.  In the spirit of what we are trying to achieve we chose some of them.  I am proposing these should be the offences with &quot;5&quot; in column (5) of the legislation.  The Minister proposed a penalty of five points for mobile telephone use when he gave his views on what should merit an increased penalty.  I will go through them.  They follow the proposed part (iii) of the amendment.<\/p><p>  Part (iv) relates to a vehicle exceeding the maximum permitted width.  I will not mention the location but I came across an incident illustrating the serious consequences of that behaviour.  Someone was driving and the towing vehicle was narrower than the vehicle which was being pulled.  When the vehicle got to where a person was waiting for a bus, the driver did not realise the danger because only the following vehicle was wider and the unfortunate victim was dragged until the next crossroads.  My strong view is that it should be a serious offence to tow a vehicle that is wider than the vehicle that is towing.  If the Minister needs extra details of my example, I would be pleased to supply them.  That is something we should consider.<\/p><p>  Part (v) of the amendment relates to seat belt offences.  In the recent past one of the consequences of the overloading of cars has been that at least one of the people in the car will not have a seat belt.  Let us suppose there is a car for five people and there are six people in it, then the extra person is not protected.  Frequently, we find that the extra person is injured.  Garda&iacute; still report, with some amazement in their voices, on situations of people not wearing seat belts after four decades of advice to do so.  Some people continue to ignore the advice.  We have cars which make warning noises if people do not have seat belts fastened.  However, even after all this time with the Houses of the Oireachtas working for safer roads I am calling for an increase in the penalties for seat belt offences.<\/p><p>  Part (vi) of the amendment relates to not wearing crash helmets either as the driver of a motorcycle or a passenger.  This is something we have been trying to achieve for a long time and I am putting it before the Minister for his consideration.  Part (viii) of the amendment also relates to safety belts.<\/p><p>  The penalty points for refusing to comply with signals given by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are too low.  We are trying to promote law-abiding behaviour for everyone.  The Garda is in place to uphold the law.  For someone to simply ignore the signals of a garda seems to me to be something we should not wish to see continue.<\/p><p>  There are two more parts to the amendment - I thank the Minister for his patience.  I travel on the M4.  Almost every day someone has parked a vehicle on the motorway.  Motorways are designed for fast speeds, up to 120 km\/h.  If a car is parked, a passing motorist may wonder whether someone has had a heart attack or why the car is parked at the side.  It is a distraction.  I am unsure whether it is a habit that is developing but I see it a good deal.  I would be interested to hear what advice the Minister has had from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the matter.  The hard shoulder is part of the design of a motorway.  They are not there for driving on or for parking.<\/p><p>  I realise the Minister is bringing forward more legislation but those are my thoughts having examined the reports by the Road Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Should the Minister wish to increase penalty points for any of the offences I have listed he would have my support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500028#CC00800","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1391610300,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I have two amendments but I wish to support Senator Barrett's amendment as well.  In respect of part (iii) of that amendment, when will we introduce the legislation with regard to children and tobacco?  I would love to think that will happen.  I realise Senator Crown has strong views on the matter and has been urging the change for some time.  I can understand the points that have been made up to now.<\/p><p>I am in a different situation.  The amendments I have almost suggest I am aiming to reduce penalty points for U-turns, because I believe the Bill is somewhat excessive as it stands.  I can remember being in the United States on one occasion when I gave the wrong direction to the person I was driving with.<\/p> <p>We could have solved it all by taking a U-turn, but he refused to do it and we went about 22 miles before we got back on track again.  I was demoted from front seat navigator to the back seat in order to sit and watch what was happening.<\/p><p>I mention the U-turn because there are times when there is no traffic around.  It is not correct to have a U-turn, but on occasion there is no traffic around.  My amendment aims to reduce penalty points for U-turns, which I think is excessive as the Bill stands.  I do not think that doing an illegal U-turn is worthy of two penalty points, with four on conviction.  This amendment reduces the number to one penalty point for payment of a fixed charge, and two penalty points on conviction.  It is crazy to give somebody four penalty points out of a total of 12 for one U-turn.  If a person causes an accident, that is different.  The book should be thrown at them.  However, it seems that we are not treating drivers like adults if we impose such serious penalties if there is no accident or traffic problem but just a technical breach of the law.  If somebody does a U-turn at 3 a.m. with no cars around, I do not see anything wrong with that.<\/p><p>Many countries go even further.  In the US and in Belgium, drivers can turn on a red light if they see nothing is coming.   In Belgium, a driver can proceed at a pedestrian crossing if there are no pedestrians.  At the same time, if the driver causes an accident, he or she is liable.  Paris now allows cyclists to turn on red lights or run red lights, but any accidents that occur when they are crossing will be deemed their fault.  This measure is designed to reduce accidents, as cyclists can get away from clogged intersections and mainly away from cars.  It is also done as cyclists are slower, with less control, as they accelerate from a stop, making them more likely to swerve or fall into a car lane.  The authorities in Stockholm have been considering exactly the same measure.<\/p><p>I think we need to be a little bit more progressive on this issue.  We need to show that we treat drivers as responsible adults, which 99% of them are, and there must be some common sense.  We are banning everything and throwing penalty points around.  I hope the Minister can be forward looking on this issue and reduce the penalty points for U-turns.  On the other hand, if there is an accident, the book should be thrown at the perpetrator.  However, sanctioning four penalty points for U-turns is excessive, and I suggest it should be reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500028#CC00900","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391610900,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I listened with interest to Senator Quinn, but I cannot agree with his view on U-turns.

Being able to turn left on a red light, as occurs in the US and in many other countries, seems sensible enough.  Putting the onus on cyclists who run red lights will leave them and motorists at risk.  I can see some benefit in allowing people to turn left at junctions when there is no traffic coming, but the Road Safety Authority and everybody else would be down our throats if we changed the laws on penalty points for U-turns and the other instances mentioned by the Senator.

The Bill, as it stands, contains a large number of adjustments to the penalty points system.  These arose out of a comprehensive review of the system which I commissioned back in 2012.  That year marked ten years since the introduction of the penalty points system, which was created under the Road Traffic Act 2002.<\/p><p>The penalty points system has been adjusted on occasion.  It will always be a dynamic process and will need to be adapted over time as new threats to road safety are detected and as some kinds of offence become more prevalent or pressing than others.  As a system, it needs to be adaptable to changing circumstances.  The tenth anniversary of the system offered a useful opportunity to review it, and to see what updates and adjustments might be needed.  I ordered such a review, which involved examination of a variety of evidence on the working of the system, and consultation with key stakeholders, including the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, which includes several Senators.  I was very grateful for the input of the committee at the time, as well as of other stakeholders and participants, to the final report.<\/p><p>Section 10 represents the outcome of the review.  I am not keen on unpicking at this stage what was decided in the penalty points review, something on which the joint committee gave its views at the time.  The review was very comprehensive and I do not think it would be appropriate to make further adjustments which were not recommended by the review or supported by the joint committee.  In addition, I would have a particular concern with going as high as five penalty points for a number of offences, particularly as we are now setting a new threshold of seven points for learners and novices.  In light of this, I cannot support these particular amendments.<\/p><p>The issue of smoking and driving was raised on Second Stage, and I asked the Road Safety Authority for its views on the matter and whether it was of the opinion that smoking while driving was a safety hazard.  We try to ensure everything we do in respect of road safety and penalty points is evidence-based and proportionate in order that people will support the system and have faith in it.  The Road Safety Authority informed me there is insufficient evidence currently to recommend the implementation of a ban on smoking while driving from a road safety perspective.   While smoking is prohibited on buses, in taxis or other commercial vehicles being used in the course of employment, there is no comprehensive body of evidence at this time to support a ban on smoking in all road vehicles, including private vehicles.  The RSA&rsquo;s view is that the issue of smoking is first and foremost a public health concern rather than a road safety issue.<\/p><p>A number of studies have been conducted in this general area, but they have not provided conclusive evidence of smoking as a road safety risk, nor argument for prohibiting smoking in vehicles on road safety grounds.  Smoking while driving is one of a number of in-vehicle distracting behaviours, including eating, drinking, listening to the radio or having a conversation with a passenger, which can all potentially contribute to collisions.  Distraction is a topic that is and will continue to be addressed in the RSA's public communications.  I think, therefore, that the issue of smoking in cars would be better considered in the context of health than in the context of road safety legislation.<\/p><p>The Senator's amendment proposes to make it a penalty to hold or have about the person tobacco or a similar product.  Therefore, it would be an offence for a driver to have cigarettes in his or her pocket or possibly in the side door of the car.  That would be the effect of the amendment, which is far too onerous.  It effectively bans the possession of cigarettes in the car while driving.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Cummins's point that U-turns can be extremely dangerous.  I was a passenger in an accident that involved a U-turn.  The accident happened during the day.  The person driving the car made the U-turn and it seemed fine, but another came driving down the road.  U-turns are performed quite slowly, and it is often only when a driver is half way through the U-turn that he or she sees the other car flying down the road.   I was involved in such a collision.  Thankfully nobody was injured, but two cars were very badly damaged.  I accept Senator Quinn's point about U-turns at 3 a.m. when there is no traffic on the road, but that is where Garda discretion comes in.  I have yet to hear of a case where somebody got penalty points for doing a U-turn at 3 a.m. with no traffic on the road.  If I hear of such cases, I will certainly reconsider the matter.  Garda discretion has been discredited recently due to the issue of termination of penalty points, but none the less Garda discretion is necessary to have policing by consent.<\/p> <p>That is an area where garda&iacute; use their discretion appropriately.<\/p><p>The issue of turning left on red at a traffic light was raised, although it is not related to the amendments.  When I became Minister, I asked for papers to be done on why we have 24 hour bus lanes - there are good reasons for them - and why we cannot turn left on red similar to the provision in the US where one can turn right at a red light.  There is a debate to be had on this.  Perhaps I will put the paper that was done on this issue in the Oireachtas Library.  Such a measure could be introduced but roads in America tend to be bigger and wider and have multiple lanes with designated pedestrian crossings.  In Ireland, almost every junction is an informal pedestrian crossing and there would be risk in introducing such a change.  My mind is not closed on it and, therefore, I will lay the report before the Houses in the Oireachtas Library and allow Members to discuss it on another occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500029#DD00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391611500,"counter":251,"content":"<p>The Minister has given a logical opinion and I appreciate what he said.

I am delighted he thinks we should examine the possibility of turning left on red and I hope he will consider it.<\/p><p>I refer to amendment No. 5, which I did not realise was being taken in this grouping.  The amendment relates to the sanction of those who misuse a so-called mini-roundabout.  There is no agreed definition of a &quot;mini-roundabout&quot;.  There is general confusion, not least because of the fact that various county councils can take it upon themselves to make up their own version of mini-roundabouts.  They take the form of solid structures with a flower bed, round humps on the road or simply just a paint mark.  Motorists are confused because many of them are put in farcical places.  It is almost impossible for drivers to see them sometimes because they are small.  If they are travelling through an area for the first time, will they see a mini-roundabout before it comes up on them?  I have great difficulty with them on occasion and they are more likely to cause accidents than prevent them.  Until there is a solid definition of such roundabouts, this section should not be implemented.  Giving penalty points for this offence is a little backward when there is no agreement on the definition.  We should display common sense on this and we should not proceed with the section.  The Minister should accept my amendment until there is clarity on the issue because there is a doubt as to what constitutes a mini-roundabout.<\/p><p>On occasion, I travel from the north side to the south side of Dublin along the coast road and there are a number of these roundabouts in Sandymount.  People travelling towards the city do not realise there is a mini-roundabout there while people leaving the city who need to turn right automatically turn because they have the right of way on the roundabout, but I am amazed there are not more accidents there.  We should establish what is a mini-roundabout or we should not pass laws that refer to them until that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500030#EE00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1391611500,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Evidence has emerged in Germany about the safety aspects of smoking in cars in the report, Rauchen in Autos.

The Minister put forward a particular point of view but this measure works effectively in the US.  I do not understand why it is only an American provision and not a European provision.  One of the frustrations motorists experience is when they have to sit at traffic lights at non-peak times and there is no traffic.  Their frustration would be eliminated if they were allowed to take a left at a red light.<\/p><p>With regard to the generality of the penalty points system, two points is a severe imposition on a driver's licence.  People refer to this as if it is of no great relevance but once a motorist receives points, he or she has them for three years, which is a long time.  Gatso vans are used throughout the country and their locations can be found on the Internet.  The Minister and the Garda have made it clear speed traps are not about revenue collection but anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise.  Local superintendents send out garda&iacute; in unmarked cars to patrol major roads on which there are few accidents.  I use the N4 regularly and with the exception of the villages of Rathown and Ballinalack, one can drive at 100 km\/h.  At the top of Annaduff Hill near where the Masonite factory is located, there is a one pub and a church.  As one reaches the top of the hill, one leaves a dual carriageway and joins a wide road where one is permitted to travel at 100 km\/h.  The speed limit then reduces to 60 km\/h and almost immediately to 50 km\/h before resuming at 100 km\/h.  I have had the experience of travelling through that area late at night and having penalty points imposed on my licence because an unmarked Garda car was sent out there from Carrick-on-Shannon.  I am not the only person to whom this has happened.  I do not know whether there is any sympathy for this scenario but two penalty points are imposed on a licence for three years if an offence is committed here. <\/p><p>Road safety legislation is ever changing and the penalty points system is under continual review.  Somebody in the Department seems to be always talking about where else we can find another excuse to apply penalty points.<\/p> <p>I accept unequivocally and unambiguously that it is in the interests of road safety and saving lives and I know the reasons for it but I sometimes wonder whether the three-year imposition in respect of some of the penalty points should be universal or whether some might be reduced, in the review of the system.  It is a source of great annoyance to people.  I class myself as a driver who uses cruise control when I am on a high speed road that allows me to do 100 km\/h or even 120 km\/h for safety and for fuel efficiency.  I tend to drive between 80 and 90 km\/h.  It is mean when one is a relatively safe driver, who observes the rules of the road and is aware of road deaths and safety and does everything possible, gets caught by a garda in an unmarked car.  It is all to do with revenue collection and very little to do with road safety. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500030#EE00400","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391612100,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contributions.

The Senator should watch out for those speed limit signs as he drives around.<\/p><p>There are speed limits around the country that are not right.  That is why we had the speed limit review.  I have set up a high level task force involving people at senior level in all the organisations to implement the task force report and to get rid of some of the inconsistent or silly speed limits around the country.<\/p><p>I do not intend to commence that section of the Bill increasing from two to three penalty points until there has been significant progress on the implementation of the speed limit review.  Some speed limits may seem inappropriately low but when one investigates them they are there for a reason, often because there is a concealed entrance and one might be driving too fast to see it.  Sometimes they are there because of the camber of the road.  It may look fine but it may be at a tilt which can be quite dangerous.  I do not have any role in where the garda&iacute; decide to place their unmarked cars.  I think I am correct in saying that the revenue does not go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It goes directly to the Exchequer.  I do not see why there would be a great incentive for the garda&iacute; to do that.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na loses approximately &euro;2 million a year on the Gatso vans because the fine income does not match the cost of running them. <\/p><p>I welcome the spirit behind Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendment in regard to smoking.  I have done a little academic research in my time but he has done much more.  As we both know one will always find one paper that says one thing and another that says the opposite.  One needs a body of evidence and a meta-analysis before making an evidence-based decision.  The body of evidence is not strong enough in the view of the RSA to ban smoking while driving but should evidence to the contrary emerge we will reconsider that.<\/p><p>There are definitions of mini-roundabouts in the design and road building and the urban street manuals.  I am sure that there are mini-roundabouts all over the place that are not consistent with the design standards but there are standards.  It is an offence to contravene the rules on a mini-roundabout and one has to go to court.  One may not be prosecuted but if one breaks the rules one must go to court.  This legislation makes it a penalty point offence.  We are probably closer than the Senator may think to what he is trying to do in making it a penalty point offence rather than one that results in going to court, even if on many occasions there is no prosecution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500031#FF00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1391612100,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and for tolerating my account of being caught in the penalty point system.

Unfortunately these days we cannot always rely on the Good Samaritan to help a person in danger after a road accident.  This amendment would get people thinking.  There is a good chance that if this amendment, combined with my later amendment that would require drivers to carry first aid kits, were accepted lives could be saved.  I understand that in some countries, such as Germany, knowledge of basic first aid and even of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, is needed before one gets a driving licence.<\/p> <p>I understand that in some countries, like Germany, knowledge of basic first aid and even of CPR is needed before a person gets their driving licence.  What we need, along with penalty points and fines, is what I would call a change of culture.  I believe this amendment would achieve that.  In France, it is mandatory to stop at the scene of an accident and to deliver assistance.  Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark and Finland are just six of the other countries that have similar legislation.  Such a measure could work here in terms of both changing the culture and stopping what we call rubberneckers, who slow down and look at accidents but do not give any assistance.  I also believe it would save lives as first aid could mean the difference between life and death.  We need to show people that we take the helping of others seriously when it comes to road safety.<\/p><p>Surely we could include such a good samaritan provision in this Bill.  The fines mentioned are small but I believe we could use this as a starting point.  I hope the Minister will make a solid contribution to road safety by accepting the amendment.  There is legislation in the United States on the whole question of the good samaritan.  Of course, some people have a concern about stopping to give help at the scene of an accident, not necessarily a road accident, because if they do something wrong, they might be sued for causing more damage.  This is where the good samaritan regulations apply in the United States.  While I am not fully up to date on this, I believe there is need for a good samaritan provisions in this legislation to ensure that, if a person sees an accident, they are required to stop and help.  Hopefully, later on, we can suggest legislation to help with first aid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500031#FF01100","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391612700,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I welcome the Senator's amendment but I believe it is already catered for in existing legislation and in an amendment from Deputy Dooley that was brought through in the D&aacute;il.  Under that amendment, which is now contained in this Bill, if an injury has been caused to a person, or any person appears to require assistance, the driver of the vehicle shall offer assistance.  This puts the requirement on a person to do exactly that, namely, offer assistance if there has been an injury to a person as a result of a collision.  If the person knowingly does not do so, they can be convicted, with a fine of up to &euro;20,000 and up to ten years imprisonment.  This is where a serious injury has been caused to a person.  If the injury is caused to property, that is, to the car itself or if somebody crashes into property, the requirements of the law in section 106(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 apply.  It states:<blockquote><br \/>Where injury is caused to person or property in a public place and a vehicle is involved in the occurrence of the injury (whether the use of the vehicle was or was not the cause of the injury), the following provisions shall have effect:(<i>a<\/i>) if the vehicle is not stationary after the occurrence, the driver of the vehicle shall stop the vehicle;<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the driver or other person in charge of the vehicle shall keep the vehicle at or near the place of the occurrence for a period which is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case and having regard to the provisions of this section;<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) the driver of the vehicle or, if he is killed or incapacitated, the person then in charge of the vehicle shall give on demand the appropriate information to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ...<\/blockquote>In that case, if a person does not stop their vehicle, that person can be subject to a fine or a term not exceeding three months imprisonment.

Ireland, from being a relatively unsafe place on the roads, got right up to Scandinavian and UK standards, which is where we want to get back to or even supersede.  The first innovation, which we discussed briefly the last day, was the alcohol interlock, which is already fitted on its buses by the Matthews bus company in Dundalk.  Improving vehicles is going to be part of this so we propose, in the initial stages of amendment No. 7, for heavy goods vehicles and buses to create the culture of safety that we all wish to ensure.  We then propose extending the alcohol interlock to new cars after a due interval, but to exempt existing cars.  We also referred to lighting improvements so vehicles would have their lights on all the time, or that at least an increased proportion of the vehicle fleet would do so.  This does improve safety, and the Minister previously pointed to research which showed this.<\/p><p>  Having the alcohol interlock is a development of the restrictions we put on people who drink and drive.  It is a logical development of safer vehicles.  The Matthews company has been an innovator in regard to public transport.  I appreciate the extremely good record of public transport and we would extend this to trucks also.  I gather, having checked it this morning in a Canadian study, that the cost is some &euro;1,200 per vehicle, which is a very small proportion of the cost of a new vehicle.  As usual with such matters, when it becomes more general, we would expect the price to come down, and I hope those promises are realised.  However, it would not be a significant item in the cost of a vehicle.  The safer, so-called intelligent vehicle is the way to proceed.<\/p><p>  The next subsection proposes that vehicles &quot;will be required to have an active Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) unit installed&quot;.  We were able to fulfil the Minister's criterion in that we found a study from the University of Leeds, a renowned transport study institute.  The study states:<blockquote>ISA systems have a very large potential to eliminate accidents and reduce the severity of those that do occur.  Indeed it can be considered to be the most powerful collision avoidance system currently available. ... It is clear from the benefits and cost analysis that the economics of the system are considerable, that the benefits considerably outweigh the costs, and that the benefits of any version of ISA will be maximised with 100% fitment.<\/blockquote>The authors of the study are pretty impressed, as I know the Minister and his international colleagues will be.  While Ireland no longer has a vehicle assembly industry, the signs for both of these technologies are extremely positive.<\/p><p>  The amendment is an attempt to make the intelligent vehicle more prominent on our roads.  Subsection (5) of the amendment concerns pedestrian airbags, which Volvo already has as standard.  I gather that when in collision with a vehicle, the airbag that we know is inside the vehicle will appear on the outside of the vehicle and cushion the collision and the fall of the person with whom the vehicle has come in collision.  As the Minister knows, in 2009 single vehicle collisions were 38% of collisions.  Vehicles that can recognise obstacles and recognise drowsiness in a driver will be an important part of the safety agenda ahead.<\/p><p>  The Minister's colleagues are preparing work on this area, particularly those in Scandinavia and some in the UK.  The purpose of these amendments is to suggest that those kinds of developments would be most welcome as part of our road safety agenda.<\/p> <p> We must do something about the driver, which is what the interlock is for and it is already up and running.  We must also do something about the vehicle, which is what the pedestrian airbag is for.  The interface between the vehicle and the driver is what the intelligence speed adaptation system is for, and it is strongly favoured by the University of Leeds.<\/p><p>There are developments.  When we have done as much as we can about driver training, then we must improve the vehicles.  It is a rolling agenda, as we said earlier.  That is the spirit in which we proposed the measures for the Minister's consideration.  If he cannot do so today, I ask him to consider them for the next legislation he prepares.  We should never be satisfied to stop at 190 fatalities or even 162.  Why not go for a much more ambitious target and avail of these technologies?  Endorsement by the House would show that Ireland is a country that is serious about technologies to prevent the side-effects of road transport killing so many people throughout the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500032#GG00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391613300,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his amendment and appreciate the motivation behind them.  The matter of people driving while intoxicated is a serious one and one on which the law has been enhanced greatly over recent years.  We have reduced the legal blood alcohol content limit for all drivers, with lower limits again for learners and newly qualified drivers.  In addition, powers for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to conduct tests for intoxication have been enhanced, allowing for greater enforcement.  Most of all we have seen a cultural change away from casual tolerance of drink driving and towards an awareness of the dangers involved.  Drink driving has become more socially unacceptable and that may be considered a great advance.<\/p><p>Current thinking on alcolocks tends to view them as a potential penalty for repeat offenders, rather than as a standard piece of equipment, all the more so because the technology is evolving and it is not yet clear what an optimum standard would be.  The use of alcolock devices has been considered by the Road Safety Authority and my Department in the context of alternative sentencing options.  A study commissioned by the RSA into a variety of devices, including speed limitation devices, for example, found that alcolocks were the only devices that might be viable in the context of alternative sentencing.  The installation and monitoring of alcolocks would be costly, however, and the study also recommended that a cost-benefit analysis be carried out on their use in sentencing.  Action 121 of the current road safety strategy commits the RSA to undertake such a study this year.  I am of the view that the future of alcolocks will be found in the area of sentencing rather than general application.  In addition, we need to consider carefully the question of specifications before we move forward on this matter.  There are many types of alcolocks on the market and we would need to be clear about the technical specifications before considering imposing their use, either on offenders or on all drivers.<\/p><p>Intelligent speed adaptors were examined by the same study that examined alcolocks.  It found them overall to be non-viable as a sentencing option.  I do not think we could make something that is non-viable in some circumstances compulsory in all circumstances.  Obviously the RSA study conflicts with the findings of the Leeds study in that regard.<\/p><p>At present there are no proposals at EU level to introduce pedestrian airbags as standard in cars and it is unlikely that agreement can be reached on the matter for some time.  In general, vehicle standards are dealt with at EU level in order  that vehicles can be traded in the Single Market.<\/p><p>For these reasons it is not possible for me to accept the amendment.  However, I am determined to strengthen the law against intoxicated driving.  Provisions in the Bill will introduce intoxication impairment testing at the roadside and include measures to allow for the testing of incapacitated drivers for intoxicants following serious collisions.  My Department is also considering proposals for inclusion in the next road traffic Bill that will require employers to test for intoxicants drivers who work for them.<\/p><p>We think the technology for intelligent speed adaptors is not up to scratch yet.  With regard to the next Bill, we propose to allow the courts to impose alcolocks as a sentence.  A person convicted of being a drunken driver will have to adapt his or her car by installing an alcolock or we will require alcolocks to be installed in buses and other such vehicles.  I do not propose to make that measure standard for all vehicles.  I will return to the matter in the next Bill.  I have steered the Senators in the direction that I intend to go, that is, to grant it as an option for the courts to impose on a person rather than something that must be installed in every new car.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500033#HH00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1391613300,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500033#HH00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1391613300,"counter":272,"content":"<p>It is not.

We have also had some discussion on vehicles.  What about roads?

When the National Roads Authority was established, there was reference to it.<\/p><p>  The purpose of my amendment is to allow the Minister to say that accidents are sometimes caused by the state of the roads.  We would allow in this amendment that: &quot;The Minister may, by regulations request the National Roads Authority to examine the safety aspects of local authority planning proposals for national roads and their approach roads and to consult with the Road Safety Authority on the contribution of infrastructure to improved road safety.&quot;  As the Minister will know, there are concerns about the extension of villages and bungalow bliss onto national secondary routes, in particular.  It may be that when the school bus calls or bread vans deliver to a house that is part of a ribbon development, there should be a safety dimension by the NRA, as the authority that appears to have the legislative powers to do so, and the RSA to say this kind of planning has an unsatisfactory safety dimension to it.  Some documents by the NRA state a concern that what it might need for future road improvements is being intruded upon by county councils changing planning laws.  There are also concerns about ramps from normal roads to go over motorways and the ribbon developments that run along such roads.<\/p><p>  Roads are estimated to account for 3% of single vehicle accidents, which is a significant figure.  I believe 37% of all fatal accidents are single vehicle ones, and the road has been deemed the contributing factor in some cases.  Does the Minister's safety package include safe roads?  We know the safety record of motorways is a dramatic improvement compared with the previous road, for example, between Dublin and Dundalk.  The safety record of dual carriageways is much better than for single carriageways.  As the Minister will know from the statistics, many accidents involve a car on a relatively minor road.  Could we make such roads safer, could the Minister have an input into that, and should that influence planning decisions for ribbon developments along sections of motorway ramps, sections of the national primary route network and, apparently quite seriously, the national secondary route network?<\/p> <p>If roads are part of the problem, do we have solutions?  That is why the amendment was tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500033#HH00600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391613900,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Road conditions can be responsible for collisions.  The last figures I saw suggest it is somewhere between 3% and 6%.  I very much support the spirit of this amendment but it is covered already in a relatively new EU directive.  As the Senator will be aware, the NRA has responsibility for the national roads network.  Section 17 of the Roads Act already states that it shall be the general duty of the NRA to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  Safety is, therefore, already clearly part of its responsibility.<\/p><p>Following the introduction of the EU directive on road infrastructure safety management, Irish regulations giving effect to the directive were signed in 2011.  These regulations greatly strengthen the powers of the NRA in respect of road safety matters.  Under the regulations, the NRA may issue guidelines on road safety matters and, more specifically, may issue a direction to a road authority which must be complied with, a road authority being a local authority.  In addition, the regulations deal with the carrying out of road safety impact assessments, road safety audits, road safety auditors, safety ranking of the road network, safety inspections and repairs, and roadworks on the network.  The NRA applies the high standards set out in the directive not just to the trans-European road network but also to all national roads.  Therefore, the intention behind this amendment is already catered for in legislation and I ask the Senator to withdraw it on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500034#JJ00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1391613900,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I will comply.

In the event of a breakdown or accident, the warning triangle must be placed in a visible position to the rear of the car.<br \/>(2) A mechanically propelled vehicle is required to carry a yellow reflective vest in the front compartment of the car from 1 January 2015. In the event of a car stopping on a motorway or in the event or a breakdown or accident and a person alights from the vehicle, that person is required to wear the reflective vest.<br \/>(3) A mechanically propelled vehicle is required to carry a first aid kit to EU standard DIN 13164.<br \/>(4) The Minister may make the carrying of extinguishers by mechanically propelled motor vehicles mandatory at a later date.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>The Minister may remember I discussed this on Second Stage and raised a number of points on road safety.  This amendment aims to ensure every vehicle carries a mandatory warning triangle which would be placed on the road if a car breaks down.  It would be a simple and concrete contribution to road safety.  The car I have had for seven years has a safety triangle and I think my previous car had one as well.  It was provided with the car at no cost because it was included in the price of the car.  This simple measure would make roads safer, giving motorists some warning of an obstacle ahead.<\/p><p>  I mention the heavy snow we had a few years ago and the number of cars abandoned by the side of the road.  Many of them were obscured by the weather and a warning triangle would help motorists to avoid a crash.  A friend's car broke down on the M50 recently and one realises how dangerous it is with cars flying past a 150 km\/h or even faster.  One tired driver or a failing light can cause an accident.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that a warning triangle is compulsory in many European countries, including France and Germany.  My amendment would make a warning triangle a mandatory item from 1 January next at a tiny cost of probably &euro;5 to &euro;10.  Many car manufacturers, such as Mercedes-Benz, have been supplying safety triangles with their cars for years as they recognises it as an intrinsic part of the car.  It is a very simple safety device.<\/p><p>  This amendment aims to improve road safety in the same way by making drivers or passengers more visible in potentially dangerous situations.  In some countries, including Spain, France and Belgium, one must wear a reflective vest if one's car breaks down and one must get out of it.  It is obviously very dangerous to get out of a car on a motorway and there have been cases of people being run over after their car has broken down.  I understand there are plans to get cyclists to wear fluorescent jackets.  However, we are allowing people to wander around motorways in the event of a breakdown or accident.  Such people can be extremely difficult to see and one often only sees them at the very last minute.<\/p><p>  This amendment also requires the Minister to examine the mandatory carrying of fire extinguishers.  Many European countries strongly recommend carrying a fire extinguisher in case of engine fire.  This is another piece in the road safety jigsaw which could save lives in the case of a crash and a fire in a vehicle.<\/p><p>  I do not see any reason for this amendment to be rejected as it is very simple, straightforward and low cost.  It is a concrete way to improve road safety in Ireland.  I do not believe there would be much opposition if people were legally required to carry a safety triangle, a fluorescent vest and a fire extinguisher in their cars.  In fact, I believe there would be widespread support.  I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500034#JJ00700","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1391613900,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The motivation behind all these amendments is to improve road safety, which the Minister is also endeavouring to do.

The principal subject of the debate is homelessness.  The motion before us today is timely and, even if we were not facing the issue of emerging homelessness, it would be appropriate to discuss the measures we are taking to achieve the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ending long-term homelessness in 2016.<\/p><p>  I very much welcome some of the measures this Government has taken, first and foremost the ring-fencing in successive budgets, in 2013 and 2014, of funding for homeless services.  It is a mark of the Government&rsquo;s, particularly the Minister of State&rsquo;s, commitment to tackling the issue that this was achieved in the face of very tight budgetary constraints.  I also welcome the change in direction during the term of this Government with the adoption of a housing-led approach to tackling homelessness, in line with the programme for Government.  That involves access to permanent housing, combined with appropriate ongoing supports as part of the core package to deal with the issue, as outlined in the Minister of State&rsquo;s homeless policy statement in February 2013.<\/p><p>  Research dating back to 2011 shows that 78% of people who were at that time in homeless supports or emergency accommodation were capable of independent living.  I suspect that number has increased in the past two years, given the changed profile of those presenting as homeless.<\/p><p>  I also welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to emphasising the prevention of homelessness.  The triggers that lead people to homelessness are well known.  That two out of every three children who experience care end up in homeless services is an outrage and can be addressed.<\/p><p>  We face significant challenges in the area of homelessness.  They relate not just to traditional homelessness, as we have known and experienced it, but directly to the macro economy and housing supply.  The number of people presenting as homeless, particularly in the greater Dublin area in the past 12 months, has increased significantly.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has reported an increase of 50% in those presenting as homeless.  It is troubling that there is a different form of homelessness today, driven by affordability of housing and not by the traditional factors such as mental health or addiction issues, history of care or prison, or family breakdown.<\/p><p>  I must declare an interest.  I am chairperson of Threshold, a housing charity.  The numbers presenting to our service who are at imminent risk of homelessness have doubled.  Threshold&rsquo;s placement service for those at imminent risk of homelessness or who are homeless has experienced an even greater increase.  Focus Ireland has also reported significant increases, as have other voluntary organisations.  I pay tribute to the voluntary organisations that work in the field.  Their work at a very difficult time is a great service to the country.  I also thank our colleagues in Dublin City Council who recently fought very hard to protect funding for homeless services and, if I may be partisan, in particular the Labour Party group on the council.<\/p><p>  In this debate we need to consider the factors that are causing this dramatic change in circumstances and how to address them.  We framed this motion with the idea of dwelling less on the specifics of how to tackle the numbers who are homeless and more on the overall blue skies picture of how that can be addressed.  At the height of the housing boom 93,000 housing units were built.  That was not justifiable when one considers that it exceeded the amount built by our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom.  A total of 8,500 units were built in 2012 but in the greater Dublin area household growth was 10,000.<\/p> <p>We are dealing with an annual increase in demand for housing in the greater Dublin area of 10,000 units while, at the same time, we have produced fewer than 1,000 units in the Dublin area.  We are dealing with a scenario where we have a growing need for housing that is not being addressed and, at the same time, we are also seeing a very significant rise in rents in the private rented sector.  Threshold has reported, particularly at the bottom end of the market, that it is not at all uncommon at present to see people presenting to the service with rent increases of well over 20%.<\/p><p> The reality is we are now seeing significant numbers of families who are being put into homelessness services because they literally cannot afford their accommodation.  While it is not the Minister of State's area, and this issue has to be taken in the whole, there is a particular issue with rent supplement, which has not kept pace with rents.  Even in the bad days, rent supplement was not keeping pace with rents and was a problem back in 2009 and 2010 for single people in particular.  It is not enough to say rents are increasing and that rent supplement has not kept up.  It was a very big issue and it has now become a crisis.<\/p><p> This situation particularly impacts on the lowest 40% of the market, which involves people who are in receipt of social welfare payments, disability payments and so on.  I know it is the Government's strategy to move towards the housing assistance payment, HAP, which will be in the Minister of State's Department and will place the payment of rents directly with the local authorities.  Unfortunately, however, we will only see the rollout of pilot schemes for that in 2014 so we cannot look to it for any help in dealing with the homelessness issue in the near future.  Nonetheless, I very much welcome that the Minister of State has been progressing the HAP system and also putting pressure on NAMA to roll out additional units.<\/p><p> I want to focus on the broader picture.  I believe there are three particular strands to this difficulty and I would like to use my remaining time in dealing with these.  First, we have to act to prevent people entering into homelessness by doing what can be done to secure their existing accommodation.  This involves ensuring that where there is a crisis in existing accommodation, which is more likely to be private rented accommodation, that crisis is dealt with.  I ask the Minister of State to use her discretion with the Minister for Social Protection to ensure that individual community welfare officers are empowered to use their discretion in regard to what are often fairly small sums.  I am aware of people losing their homes for the sake of &euro;50 or &euro;100, yet it will cost the Minister of State's Department &euro;30,000 a year to keep someone in emergency accommodation.<\/p><p> Second, I would like the Minister of State to move forward with some exploratory discussions in regard to introducing a cap on rent increases where increases are unwarranted.  I am aware there are landlords out there who have no justification for the rent increases they are seeking, given they have incurred no additional cost and their properties are well bought and paid for, but who are taking advantage of the situation.  We need to move towards a situation where people know with certainty, over a period of years, what level of rent increases they will face.<\/p><p> Third, I ask the Minister of State to consider legislation to prevent discrimination against people in receipt of rent supplement.  I challenge anybody in this Chamber or outside it to go onto the most well-known website to see the number of advertisements where rent supplement is not accepted.  In our own service, the access housing unit, a negligible percentage of landlords, 1.2%, actually accept rent supplement.  It is ironic that we have gone so far to secure rights for other groups in society against discrimination but we have not moved against economic discrimination.<\/p><p> On the broader picture, we have an issue with construction.  I would like the Minister of State to outline what can be done to prioritise overall construction in the Irish economy on a sustainable basis.  Nobody wants to go back to where we were in 2004 to 2006 but, at the same time, we have to acknowledge we have gone too far in the other direction.  We must prioritise those in most need.  Any tax-driven incentive that can be geared to producing housing for those in most in need would be welcome.  Germany is an example where there are tax-driven incentives for those who produce housing for those most in need.  A proportion of all housing must be allocated on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis in the overall housing system to those most in need of housing.  Had Part V been implemented - I have done research on this - it would have generated 27,000 units over its lifetime instead of the fewer than 3,500 units it generated.   We have to use any instrument, such as REITs, PPPs or any other mechanisms, that can be beneficial in dealing with this crisis.<\/p><p> I would like the Minister of State to issue a circular to all local authorities in the State to tell them to make their best endeavours to examine existing housing and any voids they have in their stock, with regard to how these can be best used to move people who find themselves homeless out of homelessness as a matter of priority.  I am aware there are local authorities that are not moving on their voids as quickly as they should.<\/p><p> I reject the Opposition's amendment which focuses way too much on NAMA as some sort of panacea for all of our ills.  However, I would like some view from the Minister of State as to the kind of ping-pong that is going on between the local authorities and NAMA about why the local authorities will not take NAMA units and why NAMA can only come up with 4000 units.  There are 10,000 rental units in NAMA ownership which should be brought into public ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500035#KK01100","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391615100,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I second the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I wholeheartedly agree that the Minister of State has prioritised the extremely important issue of homelessness.  Senator Hayden has covered much of the area in regard to homelessness so I hope I do not repeat what she has said.  I broadly support the specific ring-fencing of &euro;45 million for dealing with this whole issue.  However, I do not envy the Minister of State's task because this problem requires a lot more than &euro;45 million.  I fully respect the fact the Minister of State is fighting at every opportunity for extra funds but, nonetheless, we are in a very difficult situation.<\/p><p>We need a proactive approach to tackling homelessness in the country.  I say &quot;in the country&quot; because it is not just in the cities although, obviously, the biggest problem is in Dublin city due to its population density.  Recent CSO statistics show that part of this problem is that house prices in Dublin have gone up by 15% to 20% in the past year alone and there is a shortage of housing stock.  This partly explains the reasons that more people are presenting as homeless in Dublin at present.  However, there is another reason, namely, the continuous attitude of the banks to people who are in mortgage distress.  What we are seeing is more and more houses being taken back, which is inevitably leading to people becoming homeless.<\/p><p>This is no solution to the problem.  We in this House are fed up with requesting action from the banks and action from the Government to tell the banks what they need to do.  The problem, very simply, is that if people cannot pay their mortgage, they are put out on the side of the street and they present to a local authority to be housed.  That is not a solution.  Surely some work can be done with the banks, for example, so they could take some interest share in the house and allow people to remain in their homes.<\/p><p>I was shocked to see the statistics about the number of families who are presenting as homeless.  I am talking about full families, not just individual people.  They are all people; they are all human beings.  In recent months I have engaged with many people who are homeless in this city, simply by talking to them on the street when I meet them.  The stories I have been told by these people are not the typical stories everybody likes to think the homeless have, for example, that they are homeless because they have a drug problem, a drink problem or the like.  They are very human stories of people who are homeless for various reasons.  For example, one woman I met was being beaten by her husband and was forced to leave her house.  She chose the street rather than the environment she had to live in at home.  These are real people with real stories.  We should never lose sight of that because it is very important.<\/p><p>I commend the work that has been undertaken under the social impact investment project.<\/p> <p>That initiative involves a collaborative effort to help people who are homeless.  In this regard, I look forward to the outcome of the research the Minister of State has commissioned.  Can she give us any information on the research findings at this stage, particularly in regard to rent controls?  The establishment of the homelessness oversight group was a welcome move by the Minister of State.  I welcome the group's view that the Government's targets for 2016 are achievable, notwithstanding budget restraints.  I have some doubts in that regard, but I look forward to being convinced.  It is important that available resources are leveraged in the appropriate manner and with a view to achieving the best possible results.<\/p><p>Helping people who are already homeless is one issue.  Another priority must be to address the situation whereby some 80,000 people throughout the country are on local authority housing lists.  In this context, I welcome the ring fencing of &euro;30 million this year for the provision of local authority housing.  It is a start and will councils throughout the country to get back to building houses.  I am a traditionalist in this regard, my view being that the most straightforward and best solution to our housing needs is for local authorities to build homes in which to house the people on the lists.  There is good work going on through social housing organisations, but the best solution is always to ensure there is adequate local authority housing.  That proved the most effective way of bringing down the housing lists in the past.  It will also help to provide employment for the many people who lost their jobs in the construction industry in recent years.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden asked the Minister of State to advance four particular issues.  My request is that the Minister of State would seek to increase the budget for the construction of local authority housing.  It is the best solution and the solution we can best stand over.  There are various difficulties with long-term leasing, the rental accommodation scheme and similar programmes.  To put it simply, Irish people do not like these concepts but have been forced to tolerate them.  From my discussions with many people over my 20 years in local government, it is clear to me that what people who cannot afford to purchase their own home have always wanted, and still want, is the provision of local authority houses, the availability of local authority tenancies and, when their economic situation improves, the capacity eventually to buy out their house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500036#LL00200","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391615700,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote><br \/>To delete all words after &quot;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:<br \/> &quot;notes-- with deep concern the rising numbers of homeless across Dublin;<br \/>- the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive's confirmation that rough sleeping in the city has increased by &quot;a shocking 200% in the past 12 months&quot;;<br \/>- that Focus Ireland had reported an 18% increase in demand for its services this year;<br \/>-the underlying causes of the dramatic increase in rent levels across Dublin and the impact of harsh social welfare cuts on vulnerable households; further notes-- that an estimated 3,000 housing units are needed to address long-term homelessness;<br \/>- that social housing waiting lists have increased to include some 90,000 households across the country;<br \/>- that, in 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, stated that &quot;2,000 housing units would be made available in 2012 to people on social housing lists&quot; through NAMA;and condemns-- the failure of the Government to drive on the transfer of the 4,000 NAMA properties earmarked by the agency for social housing in order to alleviate the current deficit;<br \/>- the consistent delays in transferring NAMA properties, with only 450 transferred to date despite the fact that ten times that amount has been identified by NAMA as suitable;<br \/>- the inadequate response of the Government to the crisis, with the repackaging of old announcements and the provision of just 600 social housing units earmarked for construction in 2014;and calls on-- the Government to live up to its pledge to end long-term homelessness by 2016 and introduce steps to address the social housing waiting list crisis;<br \/>- the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to outline a specific plan encompassing set targets on transferring NAMA housing; and<br \/>- the creation of a transfer unit to help local authority housing sections deal with the transfer of NAMA property.&quot;<\/blockquote>It is somewhat surreal that we find ourselves in the position of having to submit an amendment to a Government motion that is entirely self-congratulatory in its claims regarding the homelessness crisis.  Most people outside this House do not agree with the Government's self-assessment.  Fr. Peter McVerry, a person I hold in high esteem for the work he is doing in this city, said before Christmas, &quot;After 30 years of working to eliminate homelessness, I believe the problem is now worse than ever, perhaps even out of control&quot;.  He went on to say that homelessness is a political problem which can only be solved through the provision of housing, which is the responsibility of the Government.<\/p><p>  Today we are debating a motion that praises the Government for its efforts to tackle homelessness at a time when a leading campaigner, with three decades of experience, is saying the problem is out of control.  People come into politics to make a difference, not to praise themselves when things are going wrong.  The Government is talking about allocating funds for the provision of 600 housing units between 2014 and 2015.  That is an absolute joke.  Given that some 98,000 people are on local authority waiting lists, a capital investment of &euro;100 million will allow only 0.6% of them to be taken off those lists.  What will happen to the other 99.4%?  Does the Minister of State have an answer to that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500037#MM00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1391615700,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I can explain to the Senator some of the causes of the current problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500037#MM00300","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1391615700,"counter":322,"content":"<p>When the Government is praising itself for providing houses for 0.6% of those on the waiting list, it is acknowledging that no homes will be available for the vast majority of people who need them.

Even if we do not get a single new house, the situation could be significantly improved by enabling local authorities to rent out their existing stock.  As it stands, they do not have the money to make those houses ready for tenants.  They do not even have the money to bring the properties up to the BER energy rating standard.  The whole situation is risible.  Properties throughout the country have had to be boarded up because they were vacant for so long that the windows ended up being broken by vandals.  This is what happened to 14 houses in one estate in Lifford in my constituency.

It is disgraceful.  I realise it is not a matter the Minister of State can tackle on her own, but the Government must take action immediately to address it.  The banks are running like wildfire over people who are struggling to make mortgage payments.

I agree with Senator Hayden, however, that it is a timely motion.  The Senator referred to Dublin City Council and the position with regard to its budget.  I will return to that matter later because there is a particularly question I wish to pose.<\/p><p>It is positive that the Labour Senators have used their Private Members' time to raise the extremely important issue of homelessness.  This matter is not given adequate air time, even in the Lower House, by the Government or its Ministers.  Debate is not going to offer a solution to the crisis of increasing numbers of homeless, particularly in the context of unprecedented housing need and the shortage of houses.  A political solution will be required.  We know what that solution is because we are informed about it time and again by those who operate in the area and who deal with homelessness in a real way.  However, many of these solutions have yet not been brought to the table.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill stated, the motion before the House may mean well but it does nothing to exert real pressure on the Government to pressure it into getting really serious about its commitment to end homelessness.  I accept that there is good sentiment behind that commitment but, as is often the case, people are engaging in too much backslapping as opposed to making concrete demands for action.  The motion would have been much better if it had contained real calls for action.<\/p><p>Services for the homeless are only part of the fight against homelessness.  For the most part, they are actually the last resort.  As a result of rising rents, years of austerity, distressed mortgages and lower wages, many families are teetering on the brink of homelessness.  They are safe one week and at risk the next as a result of a bill coming due for payment, someone becoming ill or something happening unexpectedly.  These families are not protected by homeless services, rather they are assisted by means of social welfare payments such as rent supplement and social housing.  The supports they receive are all being either undermined or cut by the Government of which Labour is a part.  Senator Hayden referred to the triggers relating to homelessness.  However, not so long ago Labour Senators voted to cut rent supplement.  Focus Ireland has stated that this cut led to a direct increase in homelessness and in the numbers at risk of homelessness and increased the pressure on many citizens.  Labour Senators also voted to reduce jobseeker's benefit and allowance for young people.  Focus Ireland indicated that this also led to a direct increase in homelessness, especially among young people leaving care or who had previously experienced homelessness.  We cannot consider homelessness in isolation.  It is extremely important to take account of these other issues.<\/p><p>As Senator Hayden noted, the motion recognises that the numbers of homeless people are increasing and that the most severe form of homelessness, namely, that which involves sleeping rough, has risen steeply.  One does not need to look at the figures to realise that there was an 88% increase in the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin last year because these individuals are in plain sight like never before.  Last year, the Simon Community's rough sleeper team made contact with 4,271 people.  The vast majority of other homelessness people are far more hidden.  The 88% figure to which I refer does not include the hidden homeless who might be couch surfing or staying in squats, hospitals or temporary bed and breakfast establishments.  These people sleep on couches, share beds with siblings and friends and crash wherever they can.  A colleague told me the story of a woman who came to his office and informed him that she shares her mother's couch with her two young sons.  According to the council, this woman is not homeless.  I know of families with two or three children who are living with their relatives because they cannot obtain housing.  Things have fallen through for them and they have been left in limbo.<\/p><p>As already stated, the solution is political.  There is a massive shortage of social housing.  This is a legacy which the Government of which Labour is a part inherited but I am of the view that insufficient action has been take to overturn that legacy.  I stand open to correction but in the capital, where housing need is at its highest, just 29 council houses were built last year.  There has been a great deal of discussion with regard to NAMA which, in two years, has delivered less than one quarter of the housing it promised to deliver.  This is not permanent social housing; it is another costly bailout for developers.  It is also a mere drop in the ocean in the context of what is required.  Focus Ireland's research indicates that social housing has been singled out for cuts in every expenditure review since the start of the recession.  All aspects of capital investment have been cut but the amount allocated in respect of social housing has been more than halved.<\/p><p>We all know that the draft budget of Dublin City Council contained a cut of &euro;6 million for homeless services.  On the night on which the draft budget was discussed, however, amendments were made on the basis of a verbal commitment from the Government in the context of reversing the proposed funding cut.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether confirmation has been supplied, in writing, by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in respect of the additional moneys - in the form of grants, etc. - which form the basis for the key budget amendments adopted at the council's annual budget meeting and which were referred to at that meeting as having been verbally confirmed?  This is an extremely important matter.  I wonder whether we should be funding homeless services in a way which places doubts in the minds of those on the front line at a time when the numbers of those who are homeless are rising.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on that matter when she makes her contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500038#NN00500","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1391616300,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

The current figure of 89,000 remains unacceptably high but at least it is going down.  The word self-congratulatory was in respect of Senator Hayden.  I do not know any other Senator who has spent so much of her time and professional life working with people who are homeless and trying to improve services for them.  The Senator is involved with Focus Ireland and of all people in this Chamber she has spent more time with and knows more about the homeless.  She is certainly not engaged in self-congratulation and nor is she seeking praise from anybody.  I am of the view, therefore, that Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's remarks were well and truly out of order.  I will not ask him to withdraw them because I doubt he would do so.<\/p><p>I welcome the many things which the Minister of State is trying to achieve.  Trying to cope with homelessness is always an enormous issue for any Government.  Homeless people are always with us despite our best efforts.  Some of the efforts the Minister of State is making are welcome.  In that context, the ring-fencing of &euro;45 million in funding last year and this year and the investment in capital spend are both welcome.  Trinity College Dublin produced a report on young people aged between 18 and 25, their specific needs when they become homeless and the very particular interventions that are required in respect of them.  I am the Minister of State read this very timely study with interest when it was published last year and perhaps she might comment on its contents.<\/p><p>The Minister of State might expect me, not surprisingly, to refer to a particular category of homeless people who should not forgotten.  I refer to the victims of domestic violence.  She is aware of my interest in this matter because we have discussed it on previous occasions and I know she is giving some attention to it.  I remind the House that the reason this particular group of women is important is because its members enter homelessness at a time of crisis.  Statistics show that probably one quarter of women who are homeless first became so as a result of domestic violence.  Those women then remained homeless.<\/p> <p>That constitutes a large number of the women involved.<\/p><p>This issue is twofold.  It is the emergency crisis for those women and the fact that they fall into long-term homelessness.  The Minister of State knows that these women who flee their homes are not classed as homeless because if they have a share in the property or the land, they are deemed ineligible for housing support.  This is somewhat of a contradiction.  The local authority cannot declare them eligible for housing support and the executive officer who tries to intervene must declare the woman in question ineligible for rent supplement.  They cannot be on the housing list so they cannot get help at the most vulnerable time for them.  Many of them are in a very difficult situation where they must seek the assistance of strangers.  It may have taken great courage for them to have left their homes, possibly with their children who are very vulnerable.  Through a nonsensical situation that has arisen, and I do not think it arose on purpose, and a lack of common sense, these women fall into a terrible gap.  They may be lucky and have a strong advocate.  Certainly, I would speak on behalf of the domestic violence advocacy service in Sligo which works very hard on behalf of such women and may persist in talking with the executive officer on their behalf.  Sometimes, it may get the rent supplement that is required but it takes an enormous effort and amount of energy and puts an enormous stress on those women and their children at a time when they do not need to bear such stress.  They may have a safe house or refuge of some kind but, again, the Minister of State is aware there are not enough places.  The international figures show that we should have 644 such refuge places but we have only 143.<\/p><p>In all conscience, we cannot ignore this group.  SAFE Ireland, various legal professionals and academics have asked repeatedly for a change in Irish law to remedy this situation in order that in the Minister of State's review, about which she may be able to give me an indication, we may find a way that prevents the crisis experienced by this very small group of women - they are small in the overall scheme of the figures about which we are talking - from continuing beyond the moment they leave their home with their children and look for assistance.  There should be some category put aside in order that these women are classed as homeless in a crisis, which would assist them in their time of crisis and prevent them from becoming homeless in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500038#NN01000","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391616900,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I call Senator Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500039#OO00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1391616900,"counter":343,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1391616900,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I have to go to the other side of the House.

I did not intend to speak in the debate because I probably spoke enough on other issues today.  I have been in correspondence with Meath County Council, as probably happens with everyone else and their local authorities.  The staff in the housing section got back to me today.  Those staff are working incredibly hard.  They cannot build houses.  They cannot provide houses for people.  When I looked at the different files on which I was asked to make representations, it was really frightening.  I met a family on Friday night in a certain part of County Meath where the father is working and, as a result, the family does not get rent allowance and is facing homelessness very shortly.  The family has an extremely agreeable and nice landlord who has been very helpful but he cannot continue with rent not being paid and the family understands that.  Everyone knows that.  There is simply nowhere to put the family at the moment.  I know there are houses in the particular area that are empty but that have not been done up by the council due to lack of funding, contracts not being signed or various problems.  That is one case.<\/p><p>Another mother whom I met for the first time two years ago rang me today.  I am sure she has met some of the Minister of State's colleagues as well and is not restricting herself to me.  This is a case where a child needs a wheelchair.  People may find this case different and not interesting.  That child cannot get the wheelchair because the dwelling in which he is living is completely unsuitable for it.  There is nowhere to put the family, which is in an apartment.  This child has cerebral palsy and the twin has autism.  I am convinced the council is doing everything it can.  I have been reminding it again to make sure but I am pretty certain it is.  There simply seems to be nowhere to put the family.<\/p><p>There is a massive housing crisis in large parts of Meath, especially south Meath.  Not only is there no social housing available, there is little or no private rented housing available as well.  I know Senator Hayden has mentioned this on a number of occasions.  There is nothing there.  The family of five children and two adults that faces homelessness because it simply cannot continue the very high rental payments in this area was considering moving part of the family into a one bedroom apartment with another relation and the rest of the family into the elderly mother's house.  That is where we are at the moment, which is really frightening.  It does a disservice to the issue when the Labour Party said at least four times in the motion that it was welcoming things.  We cannot support that and we cannot be asked to do so.  There is a massive crisis that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>We need to look at the capital spend.  I know difficult decisions must be made by Government but the thing that happened in the 1980s is happening now.  The capital budget is being cut to shreds while other areas are being protected.  I wonder whether we would be better off cutting some of those other areas and spending more on capital, creating jobs and possibly solving some of these problems.  I do not want to be too critical of the Labour Party because Senator Hayden has a very attractive record in this area and I acknowledge her good faith, interest, knowledge and expertise.  I am glad she is on the Government side advocating on these issues.  However, the crisis is just frightening and I do not know what can be done because the private sector is not doing anything because it is basically broke and the public sector seems to be in the same position or possibly choosing not to spend money that should be spent.  We have a twin crisis of the lack of supply on the private side and the lack of supply on the public side and that is effectively driving up private rents.  There are other factors at play driving up the rents but that is part of it.  It is causing people to become homeless.<\/p><p>Due to the fact that rents for a normal house or apartment have become so high, people are moving out to what are in effect shacks in the country - little huts and cottages with leaking roofs and broken windows.  I have seen them.  Rats can run under front doors into people's houses.  Those houses are right beside us.  Unless we see how serious this is, I do not know where it will end because people are being put out on their ear and landlords are losing patience.  In many cases, the landlords are good people who understand the problems and probably have their own problems.  Of course, there are some bad landlords and I have seen them.  We have procedures to complain about them.  In many cases, landlords are working with tenants as best they can but it requires far more than 600 social housing units.  I know the Minister of State has probably prioritised those for people with disabilities and people in great need.  My heart goes out to the people in south Meath in the two cases I raised today - a family of five children and two adults facing homelessness and a child who cannot get a wheelchair because it could not be manoeuvred into the apartment he lives in.  I do not want to play politics on such an issue but I am pleading for something to be done for these people who are just two examples.  We all have cases like that in our clinics.  They are all over the country.  I look forward to listening to the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500039#OO01400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1391616900,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I congratulate the Labour group and Senator Hayden on tabling the motion.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to end long-term homelessness.  Every aim and objective the Government has is not written down in the programme for Government but both parties in this debate thought that homelessness was one of the priority issues that had to be addressed and a commitment to end it was included.  It is a big ask.  I have great pleasure in speaking after Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill who showed great indignation in condemning the Government for what it is not doing.  When this Government came into office, there were 98,318 households on the waiting list.<\/p> <p>Now, there are 89,872 households on the waiting list.  Even in the good old days of the boom, there was still homelessness.  The affordable housing scheme was good in theory, but it contained a clause under which councils could buy out houses, which meant that people needed to mortgage themselves to the hilt at a time when they should have been able to avail of affordable housing.  The scheme did not work as intended.<\/p><p>There are various types of homeless people.  Homelessness can mean much more than just sleeping rough.  The Government has taken that fact into consideration, showing the Minister of State's holistic approach to homelessness.  People sleeping rough are a minority, but we are serious about the issue.  We will not hide.  As Fr. Peter McVerry has pointed out, we know what the situation is.<\/p><p>Many homeless people are not counted as sleeping rough because, for example, they are staying in emergency hostels or shelters, temporary bed and breakfast accommodation or with friends and relatives.  We are trying to do something about the policy issue and correct past mistakes.  The significant increase in urban rents to which Senator Hayden referred represents a major problem.  It is causing homelessness among people whom one would not have even dreamed could become homeless, for example, those who are out of work and cannot afford to pay the market rent for suitable accommodation.  A number landlords are refusing to accommodate people if they are not professionals or employed even though they might have the wherewithal to pay some rent.  If people can get references and prove their ability to pay, the issue of such refusals must be examined.  It is not sustainable in the current economic climate.  Too many landlords are unwilling to accept rent allowance.  The amount allowable under the supplementary rent allowance must be considered, given the rents being charged.<\/p><p>We have seen people trying to exit homelessness.  I compliment the NGOs on the great work they are doing, for example, Focus Ireland, the Simon Communities and Ms Alice Leahy of TRUST, which has been going since 1985.  She could have been done out of a job had this issue been made a priority during the boom.  It is being discussed now, but talk is cheap.<\/p><p>I have worked in south Dublin.  This is an issue in which I had an interest.  One of the first people I invited to Leinster House from my area was the homeless officer of South Dublin County Council.  Organisations such as the Simon Communities provide valuable assistance in tackling the difficulties facing the homeless, for example, loneliness, isolation, poverty and poor health and welfare.  They aim to help all service users to rebuild their lives and exit homelessness.  The Government is committed to helping those NGOs that work with the homeless.<\/p><p>When the Government entered into office, the coffers were empty.  One must cut one's cloth to suit one's measure.  I compliment Dublin City Council, which reversed its manager's decision to cut &euro;6 million from its homelessness budget.  The Fine Gael and Labour councillors worked together to achieve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500039#OO01500","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391617500,"counter":355,"content":"<p>And Fianna F&aacute;il councillors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500040#PP00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1391617500,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500040#PP00300","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1391617500,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour did a lot of shouting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500040#PP00400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1391617500,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I know.

A number of the Government's social policies have impinged on people who are experiencing difficulty trying to find homes.  Senators on the Government side and I raised the rent caps debacle, which saw people displaced from their houses because the cap and cost of renting did not match up whatsoever.<\/p><p>The motion welcomes the Department's return to mainstream local authority housing construction in 2014.  This is quite funny.  When Galway County Council was drafting its budget and we asked how many council houses it would build in 2014, we were told it would be just one, and that was for an extremely bad case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500040#PP01500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1391617500,"counter":369,"content":"<p>We have not received that application yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500040#PP01600","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1391617500,"counter":370,"content":"<p>It is what the county council's executives told us based on the budget they had been given.  We hear much about what councils will get and how that will work.  We have heard of many housing targets from the Minister of State in particular.  When it comes to bricks and mortar and people waiting on housing lists, unfortunately, the words have not matched the action on the ground.<\/p><p>The motion mentions &euro;100 million for building social housing between 2013 and 2014.  Although we have heard this kind of number from the Minister of State previously, we have seen little of substance emerge in the aftermath.  The housing budget has been cut by &euro;58 million this year.  Since taking office, the Government has cut nearly &euro;300 million from the budget.  Where will the &euro;100 million come from and what will it represent in terms of social housing?  At the end of last year, we were told that there would be &euro;30 million for social housing.  It soon became apparent that not all was as it seemed, and that it was really just a case of shifting money around to make it look as if something new was on offer.  There are many visuals, press conferences, etc., but very little in the way of bricks, mortar and houses.<\/p><p>The Government must get serious about delivering housing.  There is no point in tabling Private Members' motions to the House and wringing hands about the issue when there is no real action on the ground.  One cannot have a housing-led policy without houses.  Last year, Sinn F&eacute;in's motion on housing proposed that a number of funding mechanisms, including the European Investment Bank, EIB, be used to raise funds to build 9,000 homes over two years.  This was ignored, but we have learned that the Department only recently made its first submission to the EIB.  Ideas such as social housing bands that were mentioned in the programme for Government have gone nowhere.<\/p><p>Various organisations dealing with the bread and butter issues on the ground have aired their concerns about this issue.<\/p> <p>According to the Simon Community the latest Government statistics indicate that there are 89,982,000 households on the social housing waiting lists nationwide.  That is a scandal.  The fact that people are in urgent need of social housing at a time when the State has virtually ceased construction of additional housing is unacceptable.  The Simon Community has already highlighted that the provision for the housing stimulus package in budget 2014, although welcome, was very limited.  The Government's commitment to end long-term homelessness by 2016 using a housing-led approach will not be realised without the availability of suitable housing with support.  This is at a time when many people are being priced out of the private rental sector, which not only puts people at risk of homelessness but prevents people moving out of homelessness.  It is clear that the people on the ground do not believe that the Government policy is working or will deliver the houses needed.<\/p><p>Another issue of concern in this regard is the draconian cuts in social welfare, in particular for young people.  The social welfare payment for young people was cut to &euro;100, which drove many of them out of the country.  Perhaps it was a deliberate policy of Government to make remaining here so untenable they would take the b&aacute;d b&aacute;n or a flight and go somewhere else.  For those who did not have the wherewithal to get out of the country, the reduction in payment has left them in dire straits.  These are the types of people who are finding themselves homeless.  <\/p><p>I know through my membership of the joint policing committee in Galway that there is an increase in alcoholism, domestic violence and so on.  These are also factors in people becoming homeless.  Those who are living on our streets are in dire straits, with many of them having mental health issues and no support available to them to help them get back on their feet.  This is again due to cutbacks in the health area.  <\/p><p>Although homelessness comes under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, I believe it is part of the scourge of the broader economic austerity policies put forward by this Fine Gael-Labour party Government, which are based on the model set up previously by Fianna F&aacute;il.  That people find themselves in difficult situations is exacerbating the fact that we have more people homeless on our streets.  For Labour Senators to come into this House this evening and pat themselves on the back in regard to how well they are doing in regard to homeless policy is laughable.  It is an insult to all the people who do not have a home to go to tonight and who will not be provided by any local authority with a roof over their heads, thereby giving them somewhere to call home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500040#PP01700","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391618100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House and pay tribute to the work being done by her in the area of homelessness.  I am happy to do whatever I can to help her in that regard.<\/p><p>As I have previously stated in regard to homelessness, it is criminal that it is permitted to happen.  However, failure to deal with the causes of homelessness is an even greater crime.  Before I elaborate on those causes I wish to take this opportunity to compliment the Simon Community on the great work being done by it, in particular its offices in Athlone and in the midlands.  It is important its budget is protected, particularly at a time when charitable organisations are getting a battering and being painted with the one brush, some unfairly so.  We must be mindful of this.<\/p><p>I found Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's contribution laughable.  The Senator reminds me of an assassin in that he comes in here, fires a scud missile and then runs out the door as fast as he can.  While in the House he throws around figures such as 98,000 and 198,000.  While he appeared during his contribution to be passionate about homelessness and housing he left the house once he made that contribution.  That is unfortunate because I wanted to tell him the reality on the ground.  There may, on paper, be 98,000 people on county council housing lists.  However, I have never believed that the number of people on local authority housing lists reflects the actual number of people seeking local authority housing.  The majority of these people are forced on to these lists so that they can qualify for rent allowance.  Many of them do not want local authority housing.  Such lists are not a proper guide.  The Minister of State is being criticised because of this guide put in place by the previous Government.  The reality on the ground is different.<\/p><p>Two weeks ago, I spoke to a housing officer in my area about a particular house I was trying to help a family get and was told that the council had written to 23 families offering them the house but only two had any interest in taking it.  This means, if that were to be replicated across the country, that 9% or less of the people on local authority housing lists really want local authority housing.  I acknowledge the situation might be slightly different in Dublin.  However, it is a significant fact that should be taken into consideration.  <\/p><p>Since coming to Dublin, I have met with many homeless people.  They are all over the place, including in doorways, and are often begging for money.  I feel sorry for them and often to talk to them.  I know from talking to a number of them - this matter was touched on earlier by Senators Hayden and Landy - that a homeless person who receives a rent deposit from a community welfare officer and become homeless again for some reason or another, perhaps a marriage break-up, violence in the home, drug issues which he or she could not handle at the time but has since dealt with and is back on track, is not entitled to a second deposit.  Community welfare officers should have the discretion to grant deposits so that such people can secure accommodation because when they do they then have an address and can access social welfare payments such as rent allowance and so on.  This issue needs to be re-examined.<\/p><p>Another matter of concern in the context of homelessness in Dublin, which could become an issue in rural Ireland, is the threat by the banks to evict people from their homes.  I know from talking to qualified insolvency practitioners that unless a person has money the insolvency service will not be able to help him or her.  This issue also needs to be addressed.  I am holding a seminar next Monday night in my county, which will be attended by an insolvency practitioner who will inform people about what services are available to them.  As things stand, it appears that this service benefits only rich and not poor people. <\/p><p>Another issue of concern mentioned earlier is that of qualification under the legislation in respect of county council housing.  In the case of a marriage break-up, one of the couple often retains the house.  Let us take the example of the man retaining the house and the wife and children moving out.  The wife might agree to the husband remaining in the home because she knows that in the future the house will be there for the children.  The legislation as drafted forces people to resolve the housing issue, which means they have to go to court, engage expensive barristers and sell the house, which in itself causes a degree of homelessness.  Also, in the meantime the woman and her two children cannot access the county council housing list.<\/p><p>Another issue that will become very topical in the next week or two, which the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan needs to take up with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan soon, is the proposed introduction of by-laws in regard to mooring costs for people living on boats on the canals and waterways.  Approximately 400 families in this country currently paying only &euro;126 per year in respect of mooring will if these by-laws are introduced now be faced with charges of &euro;3,500 per annum.  Many of the people concerned are retired English couples and families who cannot afford housing.  It is within the Government's gift to decide to reduce those charges from &euro;3,500 to an amount more acceptable to those concerned.  If this proposal goes ahead there will be 400 or more additional families on the housing waiting lists.<\/p><p>I support the motion.  I will continue to work with the Minister of State in trying to resolve all of these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500041#QQ00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1391618100,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, back to the House.  It is interesting that in the wording of the amendment to the motion put forward by the Government side there is an acknowledgement of serious underlying problems in the area of homelessness and in respect of the housing situation in general across the country.  For example, it recognises that the number of people presenting as homeless in the greater Dublin area increased in 2013.<\/p> <p>In fact, according to our amendment, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive has confirmed that rough sleeping in the city has increased by a shocking 200% in the past 12 months.  Focus Ireland has reported an 18% increase in demand for its services this year.<\/p><p>Another element of the Government motion refers to the emerging shortage of affordable rental accommodation in Dublin and other urban centres, leading to an upward pressure on rents and the way this is impacting on people at risk of homelessness and those seeking to exit homeless services.  Again, our amendment notes the underlying causes of the dramatic increase in rent levels throughout Dublin and the impact of harsh social welfare cuts on vulnerable households.  We believe approximately 3,000 housing units are needed to address long-term homelessness.  I am keen to hear the response of the Minister of State on those aspects of the Government amendment, because they go to the nub of the problem.<\/p><p>A further element of our amendment focuses on NAMA.  As always, I was interested to hear Senator Kelly's contribution. His background indicates he has been at the coalface dealing with people who are the most vulnerable in society given his former role as a community welfare officer.  He is obviously well-informed but what particularly interested me was his comments relating to social housing waiting lists and NAMA properties.  I was somewhat astonished to learn that while 35 NAMA properties have been identified in County Leitrim, the waiting list is an astonishing 1,622.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500041#QQ00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391618700,"counter":375,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I never mentioned NAMA properties.

The number is 1,622 with a population of 31,000 people, whereas in Galway city the corresponding number is 1,265.  There is no comparison population wise.  It raises some questions and the figures seem to raise some alarming concerns as well.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on the county breakdown of social housing waiting lists and NAMA properties.<\/p><p>We believe there have been consistent delays in transferring NAMA properties and that there has been a failure by the Government to push forward with significant levels of transfers by the agency.  In particular, local authorities require guidelines and administrative assistance to deal with the logistical and legal challenge of property transfers.  Furthermore, voluntary housing associations have noted the administrative challenges of dealing with NAMA.  While the Government is moving way away from direct supports to the housing sector, we believe it has failed to fundamentally redevelop the voluntary housing sector to meet the challenge of housing provision.<\/p><p>NAMA is committed to providing a social dividend in its work and utilising its property portfolio for local authority housing.  Demand has been confirmed by local authorities for 1,515 of the properties that NAMA has made available.  A further 799 properties are being evaluated bringing the overall total that may be deemed suitable to 2,316, potentially.  However, in reality, as has been pointed out already, only 450 properties have been acquired to date.  I am keen to hear the comments of the Minister of State in respect of the aspirations in terms of what NAMA has made available and what has actually been achieved as well as the reasons that there seems to be such a slow take-up.  Perhaps it is do with the fact that a relatively small sum of money was put aside for NAMA social housing.  We believe it has fallen short of the funds necessary to address the problem at hand.<\/p><p>The figures do not lie.  There are approximately 100,000 households on the housing waiting lists in the State, equating to an estimated 200,000 plus citizens.  Perhaps this is the nub of what Senator Kelly was saying, that is, this particular figure is probably not realistic and some people have gone on the waiting list to get rent supplement.  I am keen to hear the analysis of the Minister of State analysis with regard to these figures and whether there is some truth or credence to what Senator Kelly has said.<\/p><p>I have no wish to attack the Government on its homelessness policy in any way.  The last thing I want to do is to in any way impugn the integrity of the Minister of State in this regard.  I believe the Minister of State is trying to walk up a down escalator.  This problem is never-ending and it has had to be addressed by successive Governments.  In the current economic climate, it must be almost impossible to try to square the circle.  However, I believe the one thing that must be given is hope.  I am keen to hear how the Minister of State will respond to the allegations that have been made in terms of lack of resources, the NAMA situation relating to lack of transfers and the situation relating to waiting lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500042#RR00700","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1391618700,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, to the House.  I thank her for coming to deal with the motion on homelessness.  I commend my colleague, Senator Aideen Hayden, who drafted and proposed the motion.  I commend her on her great work with Threshold on the issue of homelessness and housing policy.  Some people from Threshold are in the Visitors Gallery.  I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery earlier of Councillor Dermot Lacey, the leader of the Labour Party group of councillors in Dublin City Council.  I know he has a particular interest in the topic given that Dublin City Council councillors recently reversed proposed budget cuts to the homelessness budget in Dublin, a welcome move.  That was an initiative led and championed by the Labour Party group and I welcome that.<\/p><p>  We all acknowledge the immense difficulty of the problem of homelessness.  Senator Mooney put it fairly when he spoke of it as an endless problem.  Previous Governments in times of economic boom sought, with the best will in the world, to tackle the problem but were unable to eliminate homelessness.  This Government has an ambitious policy objective to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  I welcome the fact that the Government has remained committed to that even in the face of economic difficulties.  The Government homelessness policy statement from last year states that homelessness:<blockquote>...has proved to be an enduring and difficult problem for many of the people affected, and for society as a whole. Central and local government and the voluntary sector have devoted considerable resources and effort to the issue and real progress has been made.<\/blockquote>It is particularly frustrating because all of us can see - it has been referred to by several colleagues - the increased numbers of people presenting as homeless and the increased visibility of homelessness in the greater Dublin area in particular.  We are all conscious, as the motion notes, that there are multiple factors for this but one particular factor in Dublin is the emerging shortage of affordable rental accommodation.  This is leading to upward pressure on rents which is driving people into homelessness and they are seeking to access homelessness services.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has announced a &euro;100 million construction programme to enable the building of approximately 600 new social homes.  We all recognise that is not enough and that other initiatives must be taken as well.  Those on the Opposition side who have been highly critical of the Minister of State should acknowledge the progress that has been made and the policy steps that have been taken.  I referred to the homelessness policy statement of February last year which was published to set out the objectives of the Government's response to homelessness.  That has been superseded by the Minister of State's oversight group which reported in December.  The Minister of State will update us on progress on the recommendations of the oversight group for meeting the target of ending long-term homelessness.  A social housing assessment has been carried out and the Government has announced the new scheme for housing assistance payment to replace the current system of rent supplement for those with a long-term housing need.  These are different parts of the strategy to tackle homelessness which has multiple causes and must be tackled, therefore, with a multi-agency and multi-factored approach.  The housing assistant payment scheme has the benefit of seeking to ensure that it will not disincentivise people from taking up employment.  Anyone who has examined the matter will be aware that this is a real problem at present.  People who had been in receipt of rent supplement have lost the benefit on commencing full-time employment or if their partner commenced full-time employment.  It is a poverty trap and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has spoken of the need to ensure that social protection schemes do not operate in this counter-productive manner, disincentivising people from entering work and amounting to deactivation rather than job activation measures.  The proposed new payment will remove that difficulty because it will ensure that people will be able to retain eligibility for housing support even when they have taken up employment and I welcome that.<\/p><p>  We all acknowledge that there are other factors and measures that must be adopted.  I have spoken with the Minister of State's officials about the issue of construction of local authority housing.  Senator Landy has spoken of the need to ensure an increase in the budget for construction of local authority housing.  However, we also need to examine the way in which we target or focus resources on construction of housing.  Construction costs have reduced and there are new ways of building houses, particularly with new technology, to ensure rapid build of housing.<\/p> <p>Housing can be built elsewhere, transported and put into place.  For example, we have seen a relatively recent development of what are strangely called permanent prefab structures for school construction.  There are new ways of building that may be more cost effective and we should be harnessing these new technologies to try to ensure greater availability and supply of housing.<\/p><p>I know the Government's strategy has been housing led.  We welcome that in our motion.  The housing-led approach seeks to ensure that people can access permanent housing, and that is the primary response.  There are several different ways in which this has to be done.  The supply of NAMA housing stock is undoubtedly one of those, and that aspect of the Fianna F&aacute;il motion is right, but we have also addressed that in our own motion.  We have spoken about the need to progress other social housing support measures, including securing additional units via NAMA and the roll-out of the housing assistance payment.  Our motion recognises the broad challenge that faces us in trying to tackle homelessness, and also acknowledges that there are many different ways in which this must be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500042#RR00800","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391619300,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Senators - particularly the Labour Party Senators - who gave us the opportunity to discuss homelessness in the Seanad.

While I acknowledge that everybody spoke constructively, I must take the opportunity to respond to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  The crisis in homelessness and the difficulty of supply, which has been going on for a number of years, is the collapse of the economy, which was presided over by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Due to lack of regulation and due to reckless lending, development happened when it should not have happened and people got mortgages that they could not sustain.

Since I became Minister of State, I have had a reduced capital budget due to a deal made with the troika following the collapse of the economy.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill seems to have forgotten all about the past.  I am not going to say anything more negative than that, and I respect the fact that the other Fianna F&aacute;il Senators spoke in a constructive and genuinely concerned way.<\/p><p>When I took up office as Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, I made it clear that tackling the issue of homelessness would be a priority for me.  Homelessness is not a label or a category; it is a destructive social condition that can wreak havoc on human dignity and well being.  Homelessness is also a complex phenomenon and measures to address it require an integrated approach across the Government.  Many Senators made that point.<\/p><p>In February 2013, I published the Government's homelessness policy statement in which the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.<\/p><p>I also established a homelessness oversight group in February 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions.  The group recently submitted its first report to me recently and a copy is available on my Department's website.  The group believes that the goals of ending long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough can be achieved by 2016.  I believe it can be achieved by 2016 as well.  It also believes that those objectives can be achieved within the existing envelope of available resources, though that will require a much more efficient and complete use of those resources.  However, the group considers that progress towards those goals has been limited so far, and I acknowledge that.  The group's first report focuses on the major challenges that need to be overcome to speed up progress, and it identifies the blockages that hamper progress towards the key goals, and recommends how those blockages might be overcome.  I recognise the extent of the problem and the fact that new people are presenting as homeless every day.<\/p><p>Specifically, the group recommends the setting up of a high-level team supported by operational personnel to undertake the preparation and publication of a structured plan to make the transition from a shelter-led to a sustainable housing-led response to homelessness and to achieve the 2016 goals for homelessness.  This plan will be a delivery plan on providing a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilising the necessary supports.  That addresses one of the issues raised by Senator Hayden in respect of focusing supply specifically on homeless people.  It will contain actions that will be direct, immediate and oriented towards solutions.  It is very much a practical implementation plan.  The team and unit will involve officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, local authorities, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Social Protection.  It is envisaged that the team would report directly to me, as Minister of State for housing and planning, and through me to the Cabinet committee on social policy.  I am considering the group's report and its recommendations.  I will consult with colleagues in the Government on the implementation of these recommendations, as appropriate.  I hope to bring proposals to the Government on this in the very near future.<\/p><p>Past policy on homelessness was driven by short-term measures and an overwhelming emphasis on emergency accommodation.  It is widely accepted that housing-led approaches offer the most positive outcomes for those experiencing homelessness.  A housing-led approach is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  It includes the prevention of loss of existing housing, and it incorporates the provision of adequate support to people in their homes according to their needs.  A housing-led approach will result in a move away from the heavy dependence on expensive emergency accommodation such as hostels and private bed and breakfast accommodation.  While it remains important that a proportion of funding is maintained to provide sufficient bed capacity for those in need of emergency accommodation - I commend those who provide that service - resources must be channelled to deliver more permanent responses.  The voluntary sector and the various homeless executives and fora around the country are working very closely with us on that.<\/p><p>The most recent data on the number of households qualified for housing support underpins the need for flexible and diverse approaches to be taken to increase the level of social housing supply.  Homeless households featured in this data.  There is no single solution to supply and my priority is to use all avenues available to me to respond to this housing need.  Over &euro;500 million in funding is being made available through my Department in 2014 across a range of housing programmes.  I expect that in the region of 5,000 new social housing units will be provided in 2014.  These units will be delivered through a range of mechanisms, including through continued investment in leasing and the rental accommodation scheme, the completion of existing capital programmes, mortgage to rent arrangements and the continued transfer of NAMA units.<\/p><p>For the first time in many years, the 2014 budget signalled a return to mainstream local authority housing construction.  Senator Landy stressed the importance of that.  A &euro;50 million stimulus package was announced for the housing sector on budget day, &euro;30 million of which is being made available for investment in local authority housing.  This will allow for a new social housing construction programme to be developed over the period to end 2015 and for a retrofitting programme to return vacant houses to productive use as soon as possible.  Some Senators referred to the need to bring back those voids into use for local authorities.  I expect that this specific investment will deliver in excess of 500 new homes for households.  The detailed arrangements for the implementation of these measures are being compiled by my Department at the moment, and in response to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's question about Galway, I expect to be in a position to announce details very shortly.  In 2014, I am determined that the social housing programme will continue to optimise the delivery of good quality social housing and the return for the resources invested.<\/p><p>As acknowledged in the homelessness policy statement, the supply of housing is critical in guaranteeing the success of a housing-led approach.  The homelessness oversight group, in its first report, referred to the challenges in maximising supply and recommended a number of solutions in this area.  There is a need for greater innovation to accelerate the transfer of homeless people from inappropriate and expensive emergency accommodation into more appropriate and sustainable housing, and to identify the barriers and solutions to accessing a supply of appropriate and adequate housing.  It is largely within the various social housing delivery mechanisms that we must find the adequate supply of housing to make a housing-led approach to homelessness a reality.<\/p> <p>If we can specify that a certain number of those must go to homeless people and homeless families, we will do so.<\/p><p>I note again that 879 people in Dublin moved from homeless accommodation to independent living in 2012, and that figure is expected to be higher when 2013 end-year results are published.  I commend the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, with whom we work, and the voluntary sector in that regard.<\/p><p>We do not have the funding for Exchequer-funded large-scale capital building programmes but I hope that in the years to come we will have more funding and I will certainly seek to maximise the amount of money.  Currently, our capital building programmes are still relatively small.  The non-governmental sector must play a key role in the delivery of social housing.  Approved housing bodies have a record of steady achievement over the past 20 years or so and greater use must be made of the skills and expertise of the sector, in particular the capacity of the sector to attract additional external financial investment will be important.<\/p><p>In regard to NAMA units, which many Senators raised, my Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies to identify suitable NAMA housing units and bringing them into social housing use.  This use may include addressing homelessness where a housing authority deems it suitable.  We are looking to see if we can agree that a certain number of those units are for homeless people.  By the end of December 2013, 596 units had been completed or contracted under this process.  <\/p><p>To respond to Senator Mooney, I acknowledge this has been very slow initially but we have had a number of meetings with NAMA which has now set up a special purpose vehicle that is speeding up the process.  We were up to 596 units by the end of 2013 and I expect it will accelerate during this year and that we will reach the 2,000 promised by the end of the lifetime of the Government.  The homelessness oversight group, in its first report, considered the role of the AHB sector and NAMA units and recommended a number of solutions in this regard and we want to implement what it has recommended. <\/p><p>Traditionally, it has been difficult to quantify the number of homeless persons on an ongoing basis.  This is, in part, a consequence of the volatility within this cohort of housing need.  When the homelessness policy statement was published, I announced a set of indicators to be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its ongoing extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.  The Pathway Accommodation and Support System, PASS, was extended nationally in 2013 and is now operational nationwide.  It will assist housing authorities to report on these indicators and 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data on homelessness.  These reports will be published on my Department's website as soon as they are available.  It is important we have accurate data on which to decide and implement policy.  <\/p><p>People become homeless for a variety of reasons and, accordingly, a variety of responses are required.  Dublin City Council recently released figures from the November 2013 count of rough sleepers which confirm a minimum of 139 rough sleepers across the Dublin region on a given night.  This represents an increase of almost 48% on the April 2013 figure of 94, which is very concerning, or almost 60% on the November 2012 figure of 87.  The increasing number of rough sleepers in Dublin reflects the gravity of the challenge facing the Government, the voluntary sector and other agencies in tackling the homelessness problem.<\/p><p>By the end of September 2013, 4,012 unique individuals used homeless emergency accommodation services in the Dublin region.  This compares to 4,837 in 2012.  The number of new presentations of homeless persons in Dublin averaged at 5.7 per day for the first nine months of 2013.  I expect to receive the finalised 2013 figure from Dublin City Council within the coming weeks.  <\/p><p>As all Senators have said, it has become increasingly worrying that the number of families presenting as homeless has increased dramatically in recent times.  An average of 15 to 20 families are presenting as homeless in Dublin each month.  Prevention measures are necessary and essential to ensure that families and all individuals do not become homeless, a point made by Senator Hayden.<\/p><p>The recently announced social impact investment project involving homeless families is addressing, to a large extent, housing supply for homeless families in the Dublin region.  The Department is working together on this project with Focus Ireland, Dublin City Council and Clann Credo.  This project will move 136 homeless families in Dublin out of private emergency accommodation into suitable long-term accommodation.  This is an exciting venture which has the potential to create economic and social returns for the State.  It will assist the most vulnerable in society and will provide them with a sustainable tenancy, a home and intensive support to prevent a return to homelessness.  <\/p><p>This initiative showcases the combined effort of the State and the voluntary sector as well as the private sector in tackling social problems with a common goal of ensuring better outcomes for those involved.  Families and society in general will benefit.  I look forward to a successful outcome whereby valuable learning will be gained and this new model of financing social interventions may be applied to other situations in the future.<\/p><p>Approximately one in five households in the country are now renting their accommodation in the private sector, the largest share of the housing market since the 1950s.  There is evidence, to which Senators referred, of rents rising far in excess of the rate of inflation, in particular in the cities, suggesting a lack of supply in certain segments of the private rented sector.  Other data available suggest a growing pressure on rents especially in the lower segment of the market.  It is notable that rising rents bring with them a risk of affordability issues emerging in parts of the private rented sector.  My Department is exploring the possibilities for commissioning relevant policy research in this area, including in regard to the potential role of rent controls.  <\/p><p>Many Senators said the rent caps, which come under the remit of the Department of Social Protection, are causing difficulties.  They are reviewed relatively regularly by the Department of Social Protection but we all recognise this is a real problem.  In that context, we are moving to the HAP situation whereby instead of rent supplement for people who have a long-term housing need, they will move under the aegis of the local authorities.  The system of payment will be similar to the differential rent schemes.  We are starting the pilots on that in the near future and we will eventually move to bring everybody, who has a long-term housing need, under that system.  We are also looking to see if there are cohorts of people who can come into that system more quickly and to see if homeless could be one of those categories.  I can keep Senators informed of progress on that.<\/p><p>Ending long-term homelessness is an ambitious target.  Success will require an enhanced level of partnership between the statutory and non-governmental sectors.  It is essential that all partners continue to work effectively together to ensure that every resource made available is efficiently targeted towards a singularity of purpose, namely, to end homelessness and to foster a resettlement culture that promotes independent living.<\/p><p>I am pleased my Department's 2014 national homelessness budget will be maintained at the same level as 2013, that is, &euro;45 million, but I am acutely aware of the demand for services and the cost of delivering such services.  This makes it all the more important that effective strategies are used to address and prevent homelessness and that people are moved out of homelessness and into independent living as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Investment of more than &euro;50 million was provided through my Department and housing authorities towards the provision of homelessness services in 2013 and similar investment is expected in 2014.  In addition, the Health Service Executive expends in excess of &euro;30 million annually providing care supports for the homeless.  It can be difficult to identify tangible outputs in regard to homelessness services.  However, since this Government has taken office, there has been a focus on the development of a more devolved allocation-based system for the provision of accommodation-related funding to housing authorities.<\/p><p>Arrangements were put in place in 2013 to provide for the delegation of homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the nine regions, and this will continue in 2014.  The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.  These arrangements seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach advocated in the policy statement, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators.  <\/p><p>I will deal briefly with some of the specific issues raised.  Senator Hayden raised the issue of prioritising homelessness.<\/p> <p>I have addressed that to some extent in my contribution but the Senator suggested a circular.  We will examine the possibility of capturing it in a circular.<\/p><p>Senator Landy referred to the banks.  The mortgage to rent scheme is operated by my Department for specific categories of people and it will be extended to cover people with local authority mortgages.  I will make an announcement on that later because a large number of people have unsustainable local authority mortgages and they are at risk of homelessness.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly asked about the Dublin budget.  My Department provided clarification because one of the problems with local authorities setting budgets is they do not know how much they will receive from the Department when they agree their estimates.  We have given them clarity as to what to expect in this regard.<\/p><p>Senator O'Keeffe raised the issue of domestic violence and we have engaged with her on that.

Nobody can doubt the Minister of State's credentials in this area.  Her social conscience is beyond question and we have witnessed that both in her interviews and the efforts she has made.  The debate emphases one of the greatest challenges a caring society has because homelessness is a lonely and devastating place for people.  They have no self-esteem and they are almost like refugees.  For that reason, we have to admit we are losing the battle when it comes to homelessness, particularly as we emerge from the Celtic tiger era, which is surprising.  The numbers of homeless have greatly increased as the recession has continued.  A total of 100,000 households are on the social housing waiting list.  In addition, over the past 12 months alone, there was a 200% increase in the number of people sleeping rough, particularly in the Dublin area.  We thought some years ago that we had succeeded in finding a remedy for this.  I presume the recession is part of the reason for the increase but the cuts in social welfare payments must also be playing a role.<\/p><p>I am sure the Simon Community is in as close a contact with the Minister of State as it is with me on a regular basis.  The organisation is staffed by young, idealistic volunteers and I refer to their experiences trying to help homeless people overnight or in the short term.  What is happening is catastrophic.  I hope the Minister of State will examine the fundamental causes of homelessness.  Some of the budgetary decisions have not been helpful.  They were made obviously because of the pressures on the State's finances but when we debate housing issues, we begin to realise that more people have joined housing waiting lists because of these decisions.<\/p><p>NAMA's portfolio is raised regularly in the House.  It is large but movement on it is almost at a standstill.  Every so often, there is a story about the sale of a major building, the agency has a significant number of properties that could be used to relieve housing lists but it is argued that they would not be suitable.  That is not true because the agency has listed the residential properties at its disposal.  The hold up has to be administrative.  It may also be legal and I do not know is what the main argument.  The urgent need to deal with homelessness demands solutions to any problems that may arise and I cannot understand why NAMA has not released property when homelessness is on the increase.  I am sure the Minister of State has tried to deal with the agency but sometimes one has to come up with different solutions because one cannot always deal with what is regarded as the norm.  It is terrible that properties are vacant while people are lying on the streets not just of Dublin, but other towns and cities.<\/p><p>The lack of self-esteem among the homeless places further demands on the State because they are not able to help themselves.  Where there is a family involved, it is serious and it undermines human dignity.  The decisions that need to be made on homelessness should be the same as the decisions when we have a flooding problem.  Homelessness should be treated as an emergency to which we must respond immediately.  If we go through the slow motion of administrative structures, we will continue to have a problem.  Local authorities say the greatest difficulties they face in providing housing stock are legalistic.  People are putting obstacles in the way and I do not say the Government is doing that.  However, we must engage with local authorities to find out precisely what are the legal problems that are causing them difficulties.  The voluntary housing associations are telling us the same.  They have done great work but they are dealing with bureaucracy and legal obstacles, which are preventing them from moving ahead.<\/p><p>I admire the Minister of State and she is doing her best but very often the obstacles do not come with her remit, whether they relate to NAMA, voluntary housing associations or local authorities.  If the soaring increase in homelessness we have experienced over the past 12 months continues, the numbers will be frightening.  The Government cannot keep up with the increases in the numbers on housing waiting lists on top of the 100,000 households that are waiting on social housing.  Instead of making inroads into the numbers, which I presume are at their highest in the history of the State, we are adding to them.  I do not have answers.  All I can do is reflect and relate what I experience.  The five issues I have mentioned need to be closely examined and if an emergency response is required, it should be provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500045#UU00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1391620500,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I welcome Mr. Cathal Morgan, director of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, Mr. Pat Doyle of the Peter McVerry Trust and Bob Jordan of Threshold who are in the Visitors Gallery.  Councillor Dermot Lacey from Dublin City Council was also present earlier.<\/p><p>I would like to make a correction to the amendment, which relates to the shocking 200% increase in rough sleeping that was apparently confirmed by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive.<\/p> <p>My understanding was that the increase in rough sleeping was 50%.  The number of people presenting to homeless services has doubled.  I think that is a drafting error.<\/p><p>The debate has been helpful and I hope the Minister of State has found it so.  I will not be quite so kind as the Minister of State about the performance of the 11 year Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  In 2004 there were 48,314 people on the housing waiting list.  In 2011 that number had doubled to almost 98,000 people.  In 2006, a total of 93,000 properties were built and between 2006 and 2007 Professor John FitzGerald indicated that there were 200,000 vacant units in the country.  That is a damning indictment of what happened during the Celtic tiger years and it should not be forgotten.  The reason we are talking about the macro-economic difficulties of housing supply, rising rents and rising prices is entirely due to that fact and there is no getting away from it. <\/p><p>I reiterate that we must understand that the increase in the numbers presenting as homeless today is a result of macro-economic issues, supply, demand and rising rents.  In the early 1990s there was a significant increase in rents in urban Dublin which rapidly spread to other urban areas.  Rents increased by between 80% and 100% in a short period.  Very soon after that there was significant pressure on the supply of housing in the country as a whole so we should not take any comfort from the fact that it is perceived as a Dublin problem because it is far from that.  It is an emerging urban Irish problem which will spread quickly.  We need to be very aware of that.  We also need to be aware that this Government does not have the options available to previous Irish Governments from the 1950s to the 1970s that were able to spend a significant sum of money generating large housing projects, which had the benefit of dealing with significant housing shortages and stimulating the economy.<\/p><p>We are in a very difficult situation when it comes to dealing with this housing crisis.  That is why I wanted this to be a blue skies debate rather than narking about what this Government is or is not doing.  I would prefer to see us with 6,000 units per annum at the cost of &euro;1 billion, which will be the cost, rather than 600 units because eventually we will face a serious problem.  The report by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, suggested that at least 30% of people in this country will need assistance with housing.  We will require approximately 15% of all housing in the country to be in some form of social ownership.  Currently, 6% of our housing stock is in social ownership.  There is no immediate solution to this problem.  With no disrespect, I have not heard a single good idea today.  I have heard positive contributions from some Fianna F&aacute;il Members but nothing from Sinn F&eacute;in that suggests where the answers to this crisis will come from.  I suspect we will return to this issue in the years to come.  The Minister of State has made a couple of positive points.<\/p><p>Before I conclude I wish to address some of the snide comments made by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill about my supposedly self-congratulatory motion.  I welcomed the Government&rsquo;s ring-fencing of funding for homeless services in budgets 2013 and 2014.  I am proud of that and do not think that is self-congratulatory.  It is a fact.  I welcomed the adoption of the housing-led approach to tackling homelessness which involves giving people a permanent housing option.  I am very proud of that.  For too long emergency provision has been a long-term option.  If the Senator does not believe me he should go to some of the hostels in Dublin and see the people who have been living there for 12 and 15 years.  I am proud of the Government&rsquo;s approach.  I am also very proud that we have adopted a deposit protection scheme, which was not mentioned here today but loss of deposits has been a significant factor in leading people into homelessness.  I am very proud of the housing assistance payment, which will lead to a very positive and different approach to dealing with housing, particularly for those who are unemployed and stuck in the social welfare trap.  I am very proud that we are returning to mainstream local authority housing provision.  It has taken several years, not because the Labour Party in government has not been willing but because it has not been able and that was not our fault.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500045#UU00300","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1391621100,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 15; N\u00edl, 28.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paschal Mooney and Ned O'Sullivan; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500046#VV00200","aye":["1116","1147","1133","1159","1140","1149","1128","1146","1139","1142","1122","1123","1115","1155","1126"],"nay":["1148","1138","1150","1114","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1160","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1162","1132","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1170","1129","1125","1163","1171"]},{"type":"vote","time":1391621700,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the motion be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 28; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Paschal Mooney and Ned O'Sullivan.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500047#WW00100","aye":["1148","1138","1150","1114","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1160","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1162","1132","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1170","1129","1125","1163","1171"],"nay":["1116","1147","1133","1159","1140","1149","1128","1146","1139","1142","1122","1123","1115","1155","1126"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1391621700,"counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500047#WW00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1391621700,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I propose that we allocate one hour to the debate on the youth guarantee until 7.50 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500047#WW00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1391621700,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I promised the Senators that when we had the plan ready, I would be happy to come back and discuss it.  I also want to thank the Members of the Seanad who made contributions during the drafting of the plan, particularly Senators Zappone and O'Donnell, who made very considered, detailed and helpful proposals on how the guarantee could be implemented.<\/p><p>Unemployment is the greatest economic, social and moral challenge this country faces.  Our central target, as a society, has to be full employment because that is how we leave austerity in the distant past.  It is how we increase tax revenue, build a viable social insurance system, reduce welfare expenditure and create room for new investment in essential services.  It is how we create a more productive economy and a more caring society.  It is how we make people in this society wealthier, richer and better off.<\/p><p>As Minister for Social Protection, I have focused on transforming the Department from the passive benefits provider of old to an active and engaged employment service through the Pathways to Work strategy.  That work, and the wider Government drive to boost job creation, is now paying off.  As compared with one year ago, more than 58,000 additional people are now in jobs, the vast majority of them in full-time employment.  Overall unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15.1% to 12.3%, as the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office today demonstrate.  That is something for us to celebrate because we are now on a par with many of the better-off European countries.  While we still have a long way to go, it is a massive improvement compared with the 300,000-plus jobs the country lost in the wake of the bank guarantee and the construction collapse.  Today's figures also show that the live register fell by 7% in January when compared with January of last year.<\/p><p>I am happy to say youth unemployment in Ireland is also falling, from a peak of over 33% to below 25% today.  This downward trend is in contrast with developments in many parts of Europe where, in a number of member states, youth unemployment is running at close to 60%.  However, although we have now exited the bailout and seen economic growth return, employment rise and unemployment fall significantly for young and older people, there remains a long way to go.  This is especially true when it comes to youth unemployment.  That is why we made tackling youth unemployment a priority of our EU Presidency in the first half of last year and achieved political agreement throughout Europe on the youth guarantee.  It is why we are going to spend more than &euro;500 million this year on providing employment, education and training opportunities for young people.<\/p><p>As I said at the launch of our implementation plan last week, the youth guarantee can be summed up in a single word, namely, opportunities.  It is about making sure we give our young people the opportunities they need to achieve their full potential.  It is about ensuring that our job activation and training system helps them achieve this potential.  It is about putting in place the cultural and organisational change necessary to achieve all of this.  The concept of the youth guarantee is simple enough - to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  However, it would be unwise to try to do this with the flick of a switch.  While the plan we have published is ambitious in its scope, it is important to stress there is no instant or single solution to the problem of unemployed young people.  It will take time and perseverance, involving ongoing investment and the sustained effort of the State, employers, unions and jobseekers alike.  We need employers with a sufficient sense of social and community responsibility to play their part in the great national challenge confronting us of getting our people back to work.<\/p><p>As agreed at EU level, and in common with a number of other member states, the guarantee will be introduced on a phased basis in Ireland because of the financial constraints we are facing.  Nonetheless, Ireland will move to implement the guarantee from a very advantageous position, as recognised by both the EU and OECD.  Many of the elements that will make up the guarantee at EU level are already in place in Ireland through Pathways to Work and related strategies.  These include Intreo, the transformative new employment service helping people back to work.  I know many Members of the Seanad had the opportunity and took the time to go to their local Intreo office to see the new system at work, for which I thank them.  The strategies also include JobBridge, which is the national internship scheme, JobsPlus, which is the wage subsidy scheme for employers, and work experience options such as T&uacute;s and Gateway.<\/p><p>In implementing the guarantee, we will build on these elements and continually widen them.  There will be earlier and faster engagement for young people under Intreo.  There will be thousands of additional places available on schemes such as JobBridge and T&uacute;s.  We will reduce the amount of time a young person has to be unemployed before availing of JobsPlus.  In keeping with the Government's broader focus on tackling long-term unemployment, we will first target interventions at those young people most at risk of long-term unemployment.  In this way, we ensure that limited resources go towards those who are most in need.<\/p><p>I want now to address the Ballymun youth guarantee pilot project which, again, some Senators have taken the time to visit and are familiar with.  In Ballymun, the first referrals for the project have already begun.  While still at an early stage, the pilot has a vital role to play, not just for the young people of Ballymun, but in informing the development and roll-out of the national youth guarantee.  Each young jobseeker we engage with will receive a guarantee of access to career guidance, leading to identification of an individual career plan, with follow-through to training, education, work experience or full-time employment.<\/p><p>An excellent team has been assembled to deliver the Ballymun project, and I have had an opportunity to meet the team on a number of occasions.  The team includes members from the public employment service, Intreo, education and training providers, local development and youth organisations and employer and trade union representatives.  I emphasise that such team work will be crucial to the success of the youth guarantee at a national level.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say there has been a significant commitment from employers, both locally and in Dublin city more generally.  Next month, an employers meeting will be co-hosted by IBEC and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to facilitate the active participation of the business sector in the pilot scheme.  I cannot stress how vital this is.  The Department, with the assistance and advice of the Labour Market Council, will seek to replicate this employer buy-in right across the country.  The support and willingness of employers to give our young people a chance will be critical to the youth guarantee's success.  Of course, it will also be critical to employers' future business success because, like everybody else, they depend on our young people for their future.<\/p><p>The Department, through the transformation from passive benefits provider to active and engaged public employment service, is perfectly placed to assist employers with their needs.  To give just one example, last July we established an employer incentive scheme, JobsPlus, which is essentially a wage subsidy for employers.<\/p> <p>Under this scheme, we provide cash grants to employers to help them meet the costs of hiring people who have been unemployed for more than 12 months.  In the short few months since it was launched, JobsPlus has helped to create 1,286 new full-time jobs.  The scheme is facilitating people to leave the live register and go to work.  We are working in partnership with employers through the provision of a wage subsidy, something which has proved effective in countries with low levels of unemployment such as Austria and Germany.  The creation of 1,286 full-time jobs in the short period during which the scheme has been in existence is a good outcome.<\/p><p>We hope many more people will avail of the scheme in the coming months.  Participating employers have recognised the scheme's potential and acknowledged the calibre of people coming off the live register.  There are many people in this country, both young and older and many of them highly educated, who lost their jobs through no fault of their own.  They include people who, during the construction boom, went out every day with the dawn and worked until the sun went down.  There is no lack of appetite for work or capacity to work among people on the live register.  In the coming months, I hope many more employers will throw their weight behind both JobsPlus and the broader youth guarantee implementation plan.  This will allow us to accelerate the pace at which we can get people of all ages back to work.<\/p><p>I have consistently stated that a fiscal response to the economic crisis could never be enough.  There must also be a social and whole-of-community approach.  The youth guarantee is a key element of that social response, which puts young people - the future of this country - front and centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500048#YY00200","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391622600,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It would be churlish not to echo her enthusiastic response to the Central Statistics Office figures released this morning.  Any reduction in the overall unemployment rate is to be welcomed and it is good to see that we are coming closer to the European average.  Looking at our near neighbours in the United Kingdom, however, where the unemployment rate is a little over 7%, it is clear we still have a long way to go.  Moreover, looking at the other side of the account book, so to speak, the numbers of young, talented people who continue to leave this country are a cause for concern.  I hope the CSO figures to April of last year, which will be published in the coming months, will show a reduction in that outflow.  The hope must be that the reduction in the unemployment figure is real and not simply an illusion created by continuing high levels of emigration.<\/p><p>  In regard to the youth guarantee implementation plan, my colleague in the other House, Deputy Willie O'Dea, observed in a statement issued today:<blockquote>One of the central planks of implementing the youth guarantee is having Intreo [in place], which is a new one-stop-shop for the unemployed where they can receive information on retraining and employment services, with offices [to be] established in towns and cities all over the country.  [However] Cork city, for instance, has no Intreo office.  How can the Government pledge to implement the youth guarantee with such a major part of the plan incomplete?<\/blockquote>Deputy O'Dea points out that there are approximately 300 employment service officers, ESOs, in place in the Department of Social Protection to cater for the 315,000 people on the live register, equating to 1,000 people for every ESO.  How can the Government promise to tackle youth unemployment with such a scarcity of resources?<\/p><p>  I understand the Minister has admitted that the Department will be unable to provide training or unemployment for more than half of those aged under 25 on the live register.  The National Youth Council of Ireland has pointed out that recent figures which do not include the data released today, show 41,453 young people have been on the live register for six months or more.  On the basis of the Swedish figures, the council estimates it would cost &euro;273 million to implement the youth guarantee in Ireland.  Given that scale of funding, it is more likely the scheme will be phased in over several years.<\/p><p>  I am interested in the Minister's view on the amount of money being allocated under the European Social Fund and how much of it the Department expects to secure.  I understand that every &euro;1 allocated from Europe under that programme must be matched by &euro;1 from the Exchequer.  I agree with the National Youth Council of Ireland's assessment that the youth guarantee scheme can work in this country.  I also agree, however, that it must, as the council argues, be properly resourced to ensure we have sufficient high-quality education, training and job experience places and the staff to provide job counselling and guidance.  There are question marks over these requirements.  In addition, the council argues that the Government must provide job subsidies and incentives to employers to encourage them to take on young people under the scheme.<\/p><p>  I confess that with so many initiatives being introduced, I am beginning to lose track of exactly what the protocols and requirements are in each case.  In the case of JobsPlus, is there a time limit on placements or are they open ended?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500049#ZZ00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1391622600,"counter":400,"content":"<p>They are for two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500049#ZZ00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1391622600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>The scheme has already been proven to some degree.

Will the Minister comment on that?  The idea behind the guarantee is that support would be offered to young people within four months of their becoming unemployed.  There has been a suggestion, however, that the Department might extend that eligibility period out to nine months because of a lack of resources and the shortage of available training places.  In a situation where 45,000 people are eligible for the scheme but only some 22,000 training and education places will be made available, how does the Minister propose to address the shortfall of 22,000 plus places?  We are talking about more than 20,000 people who will not be offered a place under the scheme and will have to rely on a vastly reduced jobseeker's payment.  I hope the Minister can offer some assurance in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500049#ZZ00800","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1391622600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this very welcome and important implementation plan.  A failure to reverse the tide of youth emigration and unemployment would mean allowing our brightest and best to depart, possibly for ever, and would denude the country of its future leaders in every sphere of life.  Several stark statistics illustrate the extent of the challenge the Government is facing.  Over the past five years, the number of people between the ages of 15 and 24 in employment fell by a staggering 60% and the youth unemployment rate nearly trebled to 33%.  In the three years following the economic crash, some 10% of our youth population emigrated .  Although youth emigration has recently stabilised and youth unemployment has begun to fall, as reflected in this morning's CSO figures, the Minister has rightly pointed out that much more needs to be done.<\/p><p>In that regard, I welcome the publication of the youth guarantee implementation plan and the opportunity to discuss the matter here today.  I compliment the officials who drew up this comprehensive document and am particularly grateful for the statistical analysis contained therein.  I note that the National Youth Council of Ireland has given a broad welcome to the plan, while expressing some concerns - concerns I share - regarding the resource base behind it.  Can the Minister provide a breakdown of the new resources committed to this particular programme?  I note the detailed chart outlining proposed Exchequer expenditure on the plan.  Will the Minister clarify whether there will be roll-over from other programmes plus additional funding or a new dedicated stream of funding?<\/p><p>The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport indicated in this House that estimated expenditure on programmes providing employment, training and further education opportunities for young people will be in excess of &euro;500 million in 2014.<\/p> <p>This appears to be an overall figure, which includes new, existing and EU funding.  In that regard, perhaps we could obtain an indication regarding when the Irish application for funding under the EU youth employment initiative will be made.  Perhaps it might be possible to obtain clarity in respect of this matter.<\/p><p>I am fully cognisant of the fact that resource constraints apply and that we will be obliged to implement the plan on a phased basis because available funds do not allow for immediate and full implementation.  If, however, some indication of how the programme is currently being funded is provided, this would be of great assistance in mapping its future.  For example, is the Minister in a position to supply an update on the location and number of Intreo offices countrywide?  Are there any plans to increase the number of employment service officers in the Department?  The plan indicates that caseworker costs are not included and it is stated that the experience during the first period of the plan will indicate the additional caseworker requirement.  I welcome the proposal to involve local and community groups in the registration process.  Would it be possible for the Minister, who referred to the pilot project in Ballymun, to provide additional details in this regard?  Have the Minister or her Department identified any particular groups in respect of this matter and have any of these been approached?  I accept that she probably dealt with this matter to some extent during her opening contribution.<\/p><p>On a more general note, the EU youth guarantee requires that a young person is to be given a good quality offer of employment.  Is there some baseline or criterion which will be used to deem whether such an offer is of good quality.  Is there an in-built measurement system similar to that relating to the Action Plan for Jobs in the context of key performance indicators and specific deadlines by which certain actions must take place?  If such a system exists and if there is departmental oversight in this regard, then it would spur matters on to an enormous degree and give rise to increased public confidence.<\/p><p>The announcement of this plan is very positive for young people.  I compliment the Minister, her officials and the Government on the straightforward way in which it is laid out.  I wish the Minister every success with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500049#ZZ00900","speaker":"1187","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391623200,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank her for keeping the commitment she made during the debate on the social welfare legislation to accede to my request for a discussion on this plan.  I also thank my colleague, Senator O'Donnell, for her very informative report.<\/p><p>I welcome the plan.  This is the first occasion since the advent of the financial crisis that a comprehensive plan bringing together all the elements to tackle youth unemployment has been produced.  We should acknowledge the role the Minister has played in this regard, both in terms of her brief and in the context of her personal commitment to youth employment.  It is extremely positive that a concerted effort will now be made to support young people from unemployment to education, training and work experience.<\/p><p>During the debate on the social welfare legislation, we engaged in a lengthy discussion on youth unemployment.  As a result, I will use the time available to pose some very specific questions on the youth guarantee.  I fully support the decision to commence the engagement process relating to the youth guarantee with the 22,000 young people who have been on the live register for 12 months or more.  This makes sense.  May we take it that these young people will be offered quality and appropriate educational, training or work experience placements by the end of 2014?  If that were made clear, it would send out a great message to people.<\/p><p>I welcome the personal progression plans and the focus and early intervention for young people with a low probability of exiting the live register, PEX, score.  There is a need for a two-way process between case officers and young people.  Will there be a commitment to changing focus from needs of education and training providers to those of the unemployed and local labour markets?  A greater number of and more intensive engagements can only happen if sufficient case workers are available.  Is the Minister in a position to provide details with regard to the number of case officers and hours that will be assigned to the youth guarantee in 2014 and 2015?  It is not clear from the youth guarantee implementation plan how much of the education-training provision is existing and how much will be new.  This is important because it is clear, in view of demand, that merely rearranging the existing provision will not be sufficient.   Will the Minister indicate, particularly in the context of education and training, where new provision will be available?  I welcome the changes to schemes such as JobsPlus, particularly as these will allow employers to take on young people and obtain the wage subsidy for those under 25 who are on low to medium PEX scores and who have been unemployed for four months rather than being obliged to wait for 12 months.  This is a welcome initiative and I thank the Minister for putting it in place.<\/p><p>The Minister correctly pointed out that some of the targets are ambitious.  I was very happy when I discovered that the expected number of new JobBridge places for young people is set at 5,000 for 2014.  Given that 6,000 young people under 25 have participated on the scheme since July 2011, however, this means that the Department proposes to almost reach in one year a target it previously took two and a half years to achieve.  Will the Minister provide further information in respect of this matter and on the proposed JobBridge scheme for disadvantaged youth?  I am interested in the latter but I would welcome additional detail in respect of it.  I welcome the strong focus in the plan on disadvantage.  Those in this category are often missed by plans of this nature because we tend to go for the low-hanging fruit and forget about that which is difficult to reach.  I am disappointed that the opportunity to harness the capacity of the youth work sector in the context of supporting the implementation of the guarantee has been missed.  I know the Minister has had some very positive meetings with representatives from the National Youth Council of Ireland and other youth work organisations on this issue.  The reality is, however, that it will be challenging for State agencies to reach and engage with young people who are most disadvantaged.  This is because those agencies lack the connections into the community that those youth sector already have in place.  As already stated, the plan represents a missed opportunity and this regard and perhaps it might be possible to review the position that has been adopted.<\/p><p>The Minister may be able to answer some of the questions I have posed now.  Perhaps she might respond in respect of the others at the earliest opportunity.  I thank her for her vision, commitment and proposal to drive the youth guarantee forward.  We are focusing on the right area and my questions are intended to achieve the results we all want to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500050#AAA00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1391623200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome the figures released by the CSO this morning.  It is great to see that they are moving in the right direction.  I thank the Minister for the work she has done in bringing this scheme to fruition.  I am aware that she has done a great deal of work, both at home and in Europe, to ensure that the scheme would be introduced here.  The scheme was piloted in Ballymun and it will now be rolled out nationally.<\/p><p>I welcome the reduction in the level of youth unemployment in Ireland from 33% to 25%.  Of course, the figure remains much too high.  While job creation is once again on the rise, we cannot ignore the fact that emigration has placed a role in the achievement of the reduction to which I refer.  The negative social impact of unemployment on the well-being of young people, their families and communities is incalculable.  We must put a halt to the brain drain that is emigration.  I appreciate that there will always be some level of emigration.  Even in the boom times young people left in order to experience different cultures and find work abroad.  However, they were always able to return because there was something for them to come home to.  Unfortunately, young people are now being forced to emigrate in order to find work because they cannot obtain employment here.  It is imperative that we create jobs in order that they might return.<\/p><p>The youth guarantee scheme must be properly resourced in order to ensure that high-quality educational, training and job opportunities will be created.  The staff necessary to provide the intensive job counselling and guidance that will be required must be appointed.  A recent study revealed the economic loss to society of not integrating young jobseekers throughout the EU is estimated at &euro;153 billion.  We face a stiff challenge in the context of providing a sufficient number of places for young people who are out of work.  The most recent figures indicate that 42,000 of those under 25 years of age have been out of work for four months or more.  It must be remembered Rome was not built in a day.  It will take time and perseverance in order to make the scheme a success and the co-operation of all stakeholders - the State, employers, unions and jobseekers - is going to be required in that regard.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, are working together to deliver training and education places.  However, I have serious concerns in this regard.<\/p> <p>I have serious concerns in this regard because delivering education and training places in large urban areas is completely different from delivering such places in rural areas.  For example, if a person aged under 25 years who receives a social welfare payment of &euro;100 per week decides to return to education, the back-to-education allowance would not even cover the cost of transport from the Dingle or Iveragh peninsulas to the Institute of Technology, Tralee, which is the only third level facility in County Kerry.  If he or she wished to move to Cork or Dublin, it would be difficult to meet the cost of accommodation.  The Minister for Education and Skills has a role to play in this regard.  Let us take the case of a person aged under 25 years who has completed a course at third level but has been unable to find a job in the area of his or her competence and decides to retrain.  In such circumstances, he or she will face the prospect of paying fees on the basis that he or he received a grant or free fees for the previous course.  The Minister should consider introducing an exemption for such persons under the youth guarantee.  <\/p><p>I had hoped to speak about the JobBridge scheme, which has been reasonably successful, with 60% of those who have completed the scheme subsequently finding employment.  In some cases, however, employers who take on a person under the scheme subsequently reduce the number of hours of their full-time employees.  As such, the costs of full-time employees are reduced and the company benefits from having an unpaid employee under the JobBridge scheme.  We need to be mindful of this unfair practice.  Furthermore, if a company takes on two interns and does not provide one job at the end of their internships, it should be precluded from taking on further interns.  In addition, Government jobs should not be offered to interns because they have no prospect of being recruited subsequently as an embargo on recruitment in the public sector remains in place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500050#AAA00300","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391623800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>The Senator should conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500051#BBB00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1391623800,"counter":412,"content":"<p>On the Order of Business this morning, Senators asked for more time for this debate.

I will make only a few points, therefore.  I have a question on the programmes that are being offered to those who have been unemployed for four months or nine months.  These programmes range from initial engagement to record keeping, progression plans, progress in education and training and so forth.  How many staff will be needed?  Are the resources required to bring this about being made available?  <\/p><p>  I have written previously on the issue of apprenticeships.  Apprenticeships are offered in 384 occupational areas in Germany, 170 occupations in the United Kingdom and only 26 occupational areas in Ireland, although the number is being increased.  The Minister for Education and Skills received 76 submissions on the apprenticeship model as part of his review.  It was amazing to read the list of those who made submissions.  It included the Forestry Service, the Crafts Council, the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, the Heritage Council and the technology, hospitality, hotels, engineering, furniture design and accountancy industries.  A wide range of organisations submitted ideas on apprenticeships.  I will cite one submission made by Forestry Ireland.  It is probably not well known that the output from forestry in 2008 was valued at &euro;1.89 billion, 3,700 people are directly employed in forestry and 2,500 people are employed in saw milling, panel board manufacturing and so forth.  Forestry Ireland's submission states the following: <blockquote>At present, there is a lack of any structured, formalised and nationally accredited system of workplace training for forestry workers employed within the Irish forestry sector.  Such systems are widespread across Europe and are a recognised, effective and respected way for new workers to begin a career path within the forestry sector or for existing workers to formalise their status within the industry. <\/blockquote>I am firm believer in apprenticeships and a strong opponent of a caste system in education.  There is something brilliant about vocational education and it is a good way to go.  I referred previously to using the gateway project for this purpose but the Government is not using that method.   One could go through the submissions to find out about issues such as inland fisheries, national landscapes, wildlife, national parks, maintenance, water, seashores and so forth.  There are thousands of ways this could be used. <\/p><p>  I have a question on the resources in place to bring about education, training and experience.  There is nothing wrong with being aspirational and I know the Ballymun pilot project is a good one.  Are there other projects in place?  How will the Department cope with this?  The Minister is a great Minister.  We have a wonderful opportunity to be creative and establish a pilot project in one or more counties, which involves construction, surveying, flora, fauna, engineering, surrounds, the environment, plants, marketing and communications.  We should take something that involves all of these experiences, vocations and vocational education and training and use it as a vehicle.  I made this suggestion in a report and while it may be too creative, in some senses, we have nothing to lose. <\/p><p>  I congratulate the Minister because this is the beginning of an attempt to come to terms with this issue.  One of the most important aspects of my work as a Senator is to try to link into what the Minister is doing in creating possibilities and positive outcomes for young people, without whom we will not go anywhere. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500051#BBB00600","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1391623800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I will not make a statement but instead take advantage of the Minister's presence in the House to ask a series of questions.

This issue was raised with me in conversation with a representative of a youth organisation.  Another issue that was raised with me - previous speakers also alluded to it - relates to numbers.  Will the Minister clarify how many of the places are new and how many are being rolled over?  The document provides a breakdown of the funding for the youth guarantee.  How much of this is added value?<\/p> <p>For example, if we exclude the turnover that is already happening naturally, what is new for those who are already participating in these courses?  Does the Minister have an idea of how much funding will be drawn down from European funding?  Perhaps another document with more statistics and figures in that regard could be provided.<\/p><p>I would like to speak about the initial engagement with disadvantaged youth, which is an issue I consider to be important.  In that context, a footnote on page 18 of the Minister's document provides that &quot;where there are indications that there are any significant groups of young people in difficulty not covered in this way [the public employment services and through Intreo], alternative ways of reaching these young people (e.g. through Youth Work approaches) will be explored&quot;.  The pilot in Ballymun is concerned with young people on the live register.  The Commission has recommended that there should be an alternative defining point for young people who are not registered with the public employment services.  Page 17 of the Minister's document suggests that &quot;a system will be developed and implemented to ensure that all post primary schools give contact details for early school leavers to the relevant Education and Training Board for early follow up on alternative education and training options&quot;.  How will that happen if the pilot will be confined to those on the live register?  Is that happening already?  Can the Minister give any practical examples of that?  Will this be evaluated?  What benchmarks and targets will be used in any evaluation of this?  What indicators will be used?  Who will be reviewing this?<\/p><p>I have attended many informal meetings with youth groups in recent weeks.  I met a youth group - St. Michael's Youth Project - and a young mothers' group in Inchicore.  Page 8 of this report notes that &quot;among inactive NEETs [those not in employment, education or training] aged 18-24, almost 60% are carers - primarily young women aged 22-24 who describe themselves as looking after children&quot;.  The members of the group I met in Inchicore told me that access to child care is a barrier for them if they try to go into education, training or employment.  What can be done to try to square the circle in this regard and ensure these young women are able to take up any places that might be open to them?  When I met a T&uacute;s scheme supervisor in a rural area, he told me that the days of placing people in the right placement are gone.  I know that the personal plan approach represents an attempt to put young people in courses that suit their skills and career paths.  He made the interesting point that if he was to place a young man in his group on a course he wanted to go on, and which would give him future employment, it would account for the entire budget of &euro;1,000 that is available for the entire cohort of 20 participants in that group and some other people in the group could lose out as a result.  How would these personalised plans deal with such constraints?  What will happen if a course is found to suit a young person, but the budget is not big enough to enable him or her to avail of that opportunity?  The Minister has already responded to one of my points, but maybe she will answer the other questions I have asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500051#BBB00900","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391624400,"counter":420,"content":"<p>When my officials receive the transcript of this debate, I will try to ensure more detailed replies are provided to those Senators who have made specific requests for information and made particular points.  I will make a few general remarks about the position of young people in Ireland.  As Senators will have seen, the secondary school completion rate in Ireland has reached 90%, which is a tremendous national achievement.  People often complain about teachers, but it is a great tribute to those involved in education in Ireland that so many young people are now staying on in school until 18 or 18 and a half years of age.  Many of our young people are in education and will complete their leaving certificate.  Our school completion rate of 90% is one of the highest of any country.  The school completion programme, which is in place as we speak in areas where young people are inclined to leave school early, is very important.  We will be following that process from an educational point of view in the hope of keeping young people in school and ensuring they complete their leaving certificates, at least.<\/p><p>I would like to take up one of Senator O'Donnell's points.  If young people are to take up apprenticeships and traineeships, they need a good basic level of education.  It is clear from the experience in countries like Austria, Germany and Finland, which have low levels of youth unemployment, that participation in a wide variety of educational and other opportunities and pathways is critical.  As most Senators know, no one thing will address the needs of everybody.  It is a question of having a series of different options.  Some Senators, including Senator Mooney, will appreciate that those young people who leave school at 16 years of age are almost always the same people who are most at risk of long-term unemployment.  As we speak, we have an adequacy of places on the Youthreach and community training schemes.<\/p><p>I was asked how many Intreo offices have been rolled out so far.  The Intreo system is in operation in between 45 and 50 social welfare offices throughout the country.  A large number of them have been converted.  There are issues in a number of places, including Cork city.  As Senators probably know, requests have been made over the last ten years for more and better social welfare offices to supplement the existing facilities.  That process, which involves the OPW, has been fairly protracted.  I am constantly involved in efforts to sort out supplementary provision in Cork sooner rather than later.  The fact of the matter is that we are in the hands of the OPW in that respect.  Many of the Intreo processes are under way in Cork.  I have been in the social welfare office in Cork on a number of occasions.  I have to say that in Cork and right around the country, the staff of the Intreo offices and the social welfare system in general have participated enthusiastically in this process.  The next Intreo office that is due to be opened, in honour of the Cathaoirleach, is in Castlebar.  I assume the Taoiseach and the Cathaoirleach will be there to celebrate that.  It is very important because it is not just a question of the offices.  Perhaps Senator O'Donnell will come home to Mayo for that day as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500052#CCC00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1391624400,"counter":421,"content":"<p>She was down there last weekend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500052#CCC00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1391624400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>She would be very welcome.

We are converting it into a public employment service.  An Intreo-serviced office is a place where people can get income supports, including jobseeker's payments, but it is primarily a place where everybody can be placed on the first step back to work, education or training.  I hope this service can be rolled out in all of the principal offices throughout the country by the end of the year.  It will depend on the OPW, but that is our target.  We were on target at the end of December.  I hope we will have converted most of the offices by the end of next December.  The key thing is to profile the prediction of exit.<\/p> <p>We take details of people's levels of education, where they have previously worked and what they earned.  Based on that, we get a prediction of their likely exit from the live register, in many cases through getting a job.  If you have young and highly qualified and experienced IT graduates whose work premises has, unfortunately, closed down, given the shortage of such people, it is very likely that they will be able to find a job in a relatively short period of time.  Therefore, their spell of unemployment is likely to be short rather than protracted.  If one takes those who possibly left school early on, signed on when they were 18, possibly built up two or three years where they have not worked and have relatively light qualifications, one would probably not be surprised that what might be essential here is to have educational and training assistance to help them get even an entry-level job in today's employment market.  It is a process that is person-centred.  <\/p><p>This year, we will double the number of case officers, as I advised Deputy O'Dea during the last Question Time involving the Department of Social Protection.  Is that enough and would I like more?  Yes, of course, I would like more but our resources are constrained and it is better to build up the system than say we will hold everything until we have a perfect set of resources in place.  We submitted our proposals to the European Commission in early to mid-December in more detailed form that I have outlined to Senators.  We anticipate that the Commission will come back to Ireland by the middle of this month and that this will enable us to have a more firm understanding of what we are likely to draw down.  Due to the fact that Ireland had a much higher level of youth unemployment when the benchmark dates were set than we have now when it has fallen below 25%, we are still allowed to use the figures from 2011 to 2012 when the level was much higher as our benchmark.  That should allow us to fast-forward some of the European funding.  Those Senators who have dealt with European social funds will know that this process is complex and very demanding in terms of what one must fill in and one gets the money in arrears.  I hope that in respect of European funds plus Irish additional funding, we would have an additionality amounting to &euro;100 million per year.  When we get the confirmation from the Commission, we will be in a better position to give the House a more finalised item.  There is a cash flow element because by and large, European funding is recovered after about two years.  <\/p><p>I stress the personal element.  This is what is interesting about the Ballymun project, which is a European pilot.  There is a series of pilots in other countries.  Every unemployed person is an individual.  Statisticians can group all the characteristics and give statistics but every young person is their own self.  We hope to have services that are generalised but also personalised.  I have seen in Ballymun how very disadvantaged young people who have not worked much will get support and help that builds up their confidence.  The co-operation of employers and the SOLAS service is incredibly important.  Before Christmas, the Department ran the first pilot scheme in the Cabra-Finglas area and north County Dublin with the supermarket chain Tesco.  Tesco took on a number of trainees whom it interviewed.  The people involved got an educational module of some period of time via Col&aacute;iste Dh&uacute;laigh.  Out of that, they got a FETAC level 4 qualification in retail.  As part of their module, they also got work experience in warehousing logistics, which is obviously very big in terms of the supermarket industry, and worked in some of the Tesco branches.  Out of that, up to one third of the young people were offered employment.  Tesco now hopes to roll this out nationally.  <\/p><p>I will address the JobBridge programme in Kildare.  Again, I will make the details available to Senators.  A number of the other supermarkets such as the Musgrave Group have training in retail excellence programmes.  Different organisations offer training at different levels.  In respect of JobBridge, a number of people spoke at an event where a supermarket took on some people on JobBridge.  Some of them have gone into management while some are managing the delicatessen side of the operations, which is a big area in local large supermarkets.  Based on the feedback from the people involved who were previously unemployed, some of whom had been in construction and changed field, the experience has been so positive for them on a personal level and very positive for the employers.  We constantly monitor JobBridge.  Where Senators or anybody else bring forward any criticisms, we always investigate.  About 9,000 organisations have hosted JobBridge opportunities.  It is not for everybody.  It is a voluntary scheme.  We have had about 4,400 site visits to monitor organisations offering JobBridge places.     <\/p><p>There is a difficulty with respect of the embargo in the public sector.  Based on my experience, a good quality work experience that is well-mentored, be it in the private or public sector, SME or voluntary or community organisation, is so important even if the organisation cannot guarantee to subsequently employ the person possibly because of funding issues.  I know there was some comment recently about advertisements for JobBridge intern posts for PhDs.  This is a question about our education system.  Senator O'Donnell has worked in this sector.  It is very sad to come across a PhD student who has had no work experience.  If one has a very large gap on one's CV because one has been unemployed - this applies to any age - or has never worked, it is quite difficult to convince an employer that one is a person of serious calibre who will really contribute to their business.  That is the job we must do.  None of the schemes we offer, be it back to education, community employment, T&uacute;s which I started from zero or JobBridge, is perfect for everybody.  We must find different ways.  JobsPlus is a very important and generous incentive that is paid each month in arrears for each month that the person has been unemployed.  The person must leave the live register so it has to be a sufficient enough job for them to do that.  The employer is paid by electronic funds transfer the month after for up to two years of employment.  Somebody asked whether this is a job for life.  <\/p> <p>Relatively few jobs, unfortunately, are guaranteed jobs for life.  However, experience builds experience in a job.  My time is concluded and there have been many questions from Senators.  I will endeavour to provide replies to Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500052#CCC00600","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391625600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I ask if the Minister could circulate those replies to all other Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500054#EEE00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1391625600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>If I may suggest to the Cathaoirleach that another discussion could be arranged.

I raise the matter of the flooding in recent days and in particular flooding in Cork city which was devastated last night.  Cork has experienced many flooding events over the years.  The two flooding events this week are related to high tides, a lot of rain and winds from the south east.  This combination is dynamite for the Cork city area.<\/p><p>When I was a child my father had a shop in Prince's Street in the city centre.  The fire brigade often rang at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. to say the place was flooded.  He always kept a pair of waders inside the door.  Some floods happened as a result of blocked culverts.  I am asking for a response from the Minister of State so that I can go back to the traders and householders in Cork and tell them what the Government plans to do.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, made the point that not everywhere can be protected and I accept that.  However, the protection of people's homes and businesses should be prioritised.  Priority should be given to the value of the property, not just its monetary value but also value related to the use of the property.  Significant funding will be required and the Minister has said it will come sooner rather than at the end of 2016.  I hope this will be the case.  Rather than a fire-brigade response all the time, we need a long-term plan of action to alleviate and to respond to flooding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500054#EEE00800","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1391625600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Clune for raising this important matter.  I apologise for the absence of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who is unable to be present.  I will bring the Senator's comments to his attention.<\/p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the flooding situation in Cork city and surrounding areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has visited the city on many occasions in recent times.  He is travelling to Cork again tomorrow to receive a briefing on the current situation from the city manager and to meet with elected representatives and residents in Cobh.  The residents and business owners of Cork city, as indeed in other flooded areas of the country, have had to deal with a truly awful situation during this recent period of storms and flooding.  The scenes of devastation we have seen on television are really heart-rending.  There have been many tributes paid to the emergency services over recent weeks and I wish to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the emergency response teams who put themselves in the front line in difficult and sometimes dangerous conditions and who have made great efforts to mitigate the very worst effects of these events.<\/p><p>The flooding situation in Cork city has been under active consideration for some time.  While there has been criticism of the length of time it is taking to implement a flood defence scheme for the city, it is important that there is a clear understanding that the flood situation in Cork is not straightforward.  The work being undertaken by the OPW, the council and their advisers, in progressing a scheme for the city, involves complex and detailed preparations to ensure that the best possible long-term solution is found.  A catchment flood risk assessment and management study for the River Lee catchment which was commissioned by the OPW in 2006, produced a draft plan which identified potential options for the alleviation of flood risk in Cork city and county along the lower Lee.  The OPW appointed Arup engineers as consultants in April 2013 to further develop the proposals.<\/p><p>The main objectives of the work currently being undertaken by Arup include: the development of a flood forecasting system for Cork city and the lower reaches of the River Lee, downstream of Inniscarra, to facilitate optimum decision-making on dam discharges; assessment and development of a viable, cost-effective and sustainable scheme, to permit greater discharges from Inniscarra dam without causing flooding of properties and to provide protection along the lower Lee and through Cork city against residual fluvial flooding and flooding from high tides and surge levels; and assessment and development of a viable, cost-effective and sustainable scheme for Blackpool and Ballyvolane, to protect against flooding from pluvial, fluvial, tidal and surge.<\/p> <p>The work by Arup is well under way, with most of the emphasis on detailed hydrological analysis and hydraulic modelling of the channels involved, along with the development of a flood forecasting system.  A public information day was held on 17 July 2013.<\/p><p>A site investigations contract is due to be tendered shortly.  This will aid in the development of the outline scheme.  The options for defences will then need to be examined from an environmental perspective before a preferred scheme can be identified.  The OPW intends to bring the emerging preferred scheme before the public on 29 July 2014.  Subject to no major obstacles emerging at the information day, the scheme will be further refined, an environmental impact assessment, EIA, will be completed, statutory scheme documents will be completed and a formal public exhibition will commence towards the end of the year.  This will be held over a four-week period and detailed information will be provided on all aspects of the scheme, after which the public will be invited to make submissions.<\/p><p>Subject to the proposals being generally well received, detailed design will then commence, from which contract documents will be drawn up for the procurement of a civil works contractor to undertake the works.  The OPW is examining whether there are possibilities to bring forward certain elements of the detailed design in advance of that time.<\/p><p>I emphasise that any scheme for Cork city has the potential to be a large project, possibly the largest flood relief scheme ever undertaken by the OPW.  This will be a substantial investment by the State, which can only be done when we are absolutely sure that we have the right solution for the city.  Therefore, the time being taken to complete full and comprehensive hydrological analysis and hydraulic modelling will be well spent in the long term.  In addition, the flooding of recent days has provided an opportunity to gather significant data that will help to confirm the eventual solution.  It is understandable that those who have been affected want an immediate solution to the problem.  However, it is important that the work be done correctly.<\/p><p>Apart from the proposed scheme for the central city area, studies are also being advanced in areas near the city at Glanmire-Glashaboy, Douglas-Togher and Crookstown, where Cork County Council is taking the lead role, with funding being provided by the OPW.  It is hoped that proposals to deal with the areas' problems will be made before the end of 2014.<\/p><p>Further afield, the OPW and Cork County Council are at an advanced stage for schemes in Bandon and Skibbereen.  Both have been through the public exhibition stage, with works due to be commenced in Bandon in mid-2014 and in Skibbereen towards the end of 2014.  Consultants have also been appointed to develop proposals in Clonakilty, with a preferred scheme due to be tabled for public consultation before the end of this year.  It is also hoped to introduce proposals for a scheme in Baile Mhic &Iacute;re towards the end of 2014.  All of the work being done in respect of these areas underlines the commitment to deal with the most significant flooding problems in Cork.<\/p><p>On the broader national level, there has been a significant amount of investment since 1995 in flood relief works, with approximately &euro;320 million invested by the OPW.  This investment has brought benefits estimated at more than &euro;1 billion in terms of damage and loss avoided and has provided flood protection to more than 10,500 properties.  In Cork alone, more than &euro;57 million has been spent on capital projects since 2002.  In addition, the OPW has funded 23 projects in County Cork under the minor flood works and coastal protection scheme since its introduction in 2009.  The Government has prioritised investment in flood risk management by allocating &euro;225 million for the period 2012 to 2016 as part of its infrastructure and capital investment framework.<\/p><p>The OPW will continue to work closely with its partners, Cork city and county councils, to advance all these projects in a timely manner.  There are and will be challenges in developing such large projects, but I assure the Senator there is a commitment to progressing the projects in order that the people of the city and county will reap the benefits as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500054#EEE00900","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391626200,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for highlighting the commitment to progressing the projects.

The devil is in the detail.  Not only do single parents lose the tax credit, but they also move up to the higher tax band more quickly as a result.  It is a double whammy.  The knock-on effect is a large reduction in income, leading to a substantial reduction in their maintenance payments to their partners, one party taking the other to court for maintenance and higher one-parent family payments.<\/p><p>I called for this debate to address a situation that has arisen whereby there is a requirement for one partner, the primary carer, to give written permission for the other parent to avail of the tax credit.  We are going backwards.  It is like how a husband used to have to give written permission for his wife to use a tax-free allowance.  We must address this issue.  In real life, many marriage and relationship break-ups can be nasty and result in collecting children at the door without partners speaking to each other.  There are many good men who are willing to be part of their children's lives despite those break-ups and it is demeaning to make them get written permission in order that they might avail of this tax credit.  Revenue must be in a position to know whether a primary carer is working and to make the tax credit available to the other parent if the primary carer is not using it.  I await the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500055#FFF00900","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1391626200,"counter":444,"content":"<p>The one-parent family tax credit was reformed and replaced with a new single person child carer credit from 1 January.  While the single person child carer credit is of the same value, that is, &euro;1,650, as the earlier tax credit and also carries the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum, the new credit is targeted such that it is available only to the claimant who is the principal carer of the child, that is, the individual with whom the child resides and who looks after the child for the year or the greater part of the year.  A maximum of one credit is available per single carer-claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child.<\/p><p>Given the difficult fiscal environment, it is essential that all tax reliefs, credits and incentives are kept under review to ensure they are properly targeted and, if necessary, refocused in order that they might achieve the socioeconomic objectives set for them.  The one-parent family tax credit was, in certain cases, being claimed by multiple individuals in respect of a single child.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child is unsustainable in the current budgetary circumstances.<\/p><p>It is important to point out that this new credit has been designed to work as an activation measure and to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up or remain in employment.  It will assist single parents or carers with the cost of child care.<\/p> <p> In addition, it should be noted that this new policy has been agreed by Government based on a recommendation put forward by the Commission on Taxation that the tax credit should be retained but that it should be confined to the principal carer only.  The Government is satisfied that the restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.  <\/p><p>In the first instance, it is the responsibility of the parents to look after a child, including financially.  Tax credits should not be considered a supplementary source of income, or an alternative to the financial support of a parent.<\/p><p>It is worth pointing out that where a principal carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit, or the former one.  In such circumstances the principal carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer.  In addition, a secondary claimant who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting would not be entitled to the new credit, or the former one, regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.<\/p><p>The allocation of child care responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree.  However, having listened carefully to the views expressed by colleagues in both Houses, the Minister brought forward an amendment on Committee Stage, such that a principal carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.  A secondary claimant may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year.  It is entirely appropriate that such surrendering of the credit should be evidenced in writing.  This allows for certainty for the full duration of the tax year - this may be the point on which the Senator was seeking clarification - and caters for situations where a principal carer expects to have no tax liability, is actively seeking work, or simply wishes to relinquish the credit despite having the requisite income to utilise it.<\/p><p>The single person child carer credit is initially granted to the principal carer and it is only in circumstances where that individual chooses to relinquish his or her claim that a secondary claimant can then make a claim for the credit.  The procedure for relinquishment is that the principal carer proves entitlement to the credit in the first instance and then notifies the Revenue Commissioners, using the same approved form, that he or she wishes to relinquish or surrender this entitlement.  It is only in the event of such a relinquishment or surrender that a secondary claimant can then make a written claim to the Revenue Commissioners for the credit.  Rather than requiring the second parent to get permission from the first to claim the credit, the legislation requires the first parent to notify Revenue of his or her intention to surrender the credit.  That detail clarifies the point.  Once the credit has been awarded to a secondary claimant, it will remain with that secondary claimant until such time as the primary claimant wishes to re-enter a claim for the credit.  In such circumstances the credit will only be restored to the primary claimant from the start of the next tax year where a formal claim for reinstatement of the credit is made before the end of the current tax year.<\/p><p>In the situation where a principal carer is unwilling to relinquish the credit, it would not be possible to easily identify a secondary claimant, who could be a grandparent, parent or sibling, any one of whom might present a claim to the credit.  In addition, a primary claimant could be awaiting a change in his or her employment status before claiming the credit, and as a result, may not want to give it up.<\/p><p>To allow the credit to a secondary claimant without it being surrendered voluntarily by a principal carer could reveal information about the financial or civil status of the principal carer and therefore be in breach of confidentiality.  I trust the reply, while is quite technical, has clarified some of the points the Senator raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014020500055#FFF01000","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391626800,"counter":446,"content":"<p>The reply has clarified some points but not others.  I would refer to a paragraph in the reply, which states:<blockquote><br \/>In the first instance, it is the responsibility of the parents to look after a child, including financially.  Tax credits should not be considered a supplementary source of income, or an alternative to the financial support of a parent.<\/blockquote>Of course they should not but people were availing of this credit and they were basing their maintenance payment on the income they had, but now their income has been substantially reduced.  It was not that they were taking this credit as a source of income but that their net pay has been substantially reduced.  That statement is a little harsh in inferring that people that they were looking for the credit as a supplementary payment - they were not.  They were taking what was available to them and using it,and it was the law of the land.  The Minister of State is right in that this credit is open to a high level abuse and there have been cases of people pretending to be separated in order to avail of it.  I know of a family where the three children in the family have three different fathers and each of them were availing of this credit.  They did so - this is the crux of the issue - because there was no monitoring or follow-up on it.  All they had to say to the tax office was that the child was staying with them overnight.  I note it is stated that it would be a breach of data protection to give the credit to the second carer but it is not easy for someone to get written permission to avail of the tax credit.  The Minister of State has said that the second carer does not have to get permission from the first carer but that the first carer can surrender credit to the tax office but we should be realistic about this in that we will have to ask that parent to go to the tax office and surrender the tax credit.  Such people will not do it voluntary especially if the break-up is not amicable.  <\/p><p>  I am not happy with the answer but unfortunately it is one I have got.  We have gone backwards on this.  We are going back to the old days where a husband had to sign off on his wife's tax free allowance.  I thought that day was gone but obviously not.

Agreement as to who would be the principal carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians.  However, in the first instance, only the principal carer will be entitled to the credit, a policy change recommended by the Commission on Taxation in 2009.  As regards the parent who is taking care of the child, while he or she may not agree to give a concession in respect of the credit, there is provision for agreement having been made with Revenue supported by documentary evidence.  Even without the secondary carer getting a letter from the primary carer, agreement can have been given in this respect.<\/p><p>There is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code and the Senator should be aware that married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit in respect of their children.  This is despite the fact that in certain cases such couples also have to maintain two households due to the location of employment.  Notwithstanding the above, as a result of the amendment to this section, which the Minister brought forward, the primary carer may relinquish the credit such that it can be claimed by a non-primary carer in situations, for example, where the primary carer has no tax liability.
