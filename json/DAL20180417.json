We agree that having an independent and free media is essential to the operation of a parliamentary democracy.  We should all hold dear the protection of journalistic sources, editorial independence, the independence of journalists and their freedom from undue interference.  Recent events serve as a wake-up call for the Oireachtas to consider legislation to deal with these issues on several fronts.  Much work has been done in that regard by interested parties, not least the former Chief Justice, Mr. John Murray, whose very comprehensive report on the protection by the State of journalistic sources, was published last year but has not been acted on.  He says this protection should apply generally because it is essential to democracy.  The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, also produced a comprehensive report two years ago on the desirability of, and necessity for, a national law to be established to deal with these issues.<\/p><p>It was very much on the button in terms of what has transpired over the past two weeks.  It states we should have specific national legislation for source protection, with its legal foundation being the right to freedom of expression, including press freedom and privacy.  It states such legislation should recognise that source protection should extend to all acts of journalism and across all platforms, services and media, including digital data and metadata.  It affirms that state and corporate actors, including third-party intermediaries who capture journalistic data, must treat those data confidentially, and that the law should shield acts of journalism from targeted surveillance, data retention and the hand-over of material connected to confidential sources.  It recommends that arbitrary unauthorised and wilful violations of confidentiality of sources by third-party actors should be criminalised.<b><\/b>In addition, we have the media plurality monitor in league with the EU Commission and others.  It identifies very high risks in terms of ownership, transparency of ownership, and editorial autonomy.<br\/><br\/>Fourth, will the Government consider legislation across the three strands I have identified?  Will the Taoiseach reaffirm his position to the House?  Yesterday an actor of the State, the director of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, essentially received correspondence stating he may be personally held liable in respect of certain things done in the line of his duty.  It is very important that the message go out from the Oireachtas and Government that any actor of the State is indemnified and will not lose out in any way for conducting his duty on behalf of the taxpayer and the State.  It is very important that this affirmation be given in respect of the director of the ODCE today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important question.  To answer it, given recent revelations we will have to consider legislation in this area to protect sources.  I am not aware of any legislation being drafted currently by the Government and I have not seen any by the Opposition in the form of Private Members' Bills in the past two years, but perhaps the time has come for the Government to dust down the reports and give consideration to legislation in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Having independent news and media is a cornerstone of our democracy.  It is, after all, the Fourth Estate.  Journalists must be free to pursue stories that they want to pursue.  Their sources should be protected and free from any unjust interference, external or internal.  We need a plurality of voices in the media.  We need to ensure these voices are not drowned out or silenced.  We also need diversity in ownership.<\/p>  <p>  I commend journalists who have worked to report on this story, including journalists in Independent News &amp;amp; Media, who have not allowed their independence to be compromised.  The reported data breaches represent a very significant threat to the freedom of our press but the way in which the media have responded to this threat to date should reassure us that our press will not be silenced.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, any alleged breach affecting personal data is a matter of concern, whether it relates to journalists or public citizens.  It is important to say that although this is now a matter before the courts, we need to respect that and bear it in mind in our contributions.  The Deputy has done so.<\/p>  <p>  The ODCE, a Government office at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, has now made an application to the High Court under section 748 of the Companies Act 2014 to appoint inspectors to investigate the affairs of Independent News &amp;amp; Media.  This is now an enforcement matter for the ODCE.  Section 949(3) of the Companies Act provides that the Director of Corporate Enforcement shall be independent in the performance of his statutory functions.

Hundreds of thousands of emails may have been compromised.  Nineteen individuals were singled out for data interrogation in October 2014 and, allegedly, it involved a hired firm conducting a trawl of electronic records of journalists and others at the company.  They included investigative journalists and lawyers who had worked on the Moriarty tribunal.  This data interrogation represents an attack on the privacy and safety of journalists and their sources.  It undermines fundamentals of how members of the press go about their work in the public interest.  We know also that a former chairperson of INM ordered the data interrogation, but we do not know his reasons for so doing.  We do not know why the 19 individuals I cited were specifically targeted and certainly do not know why the bill for the data interrogation was paid by Blaydon Limited, a company based on the Isle of Man.<\/p>  <p>  The ODCE, as the Taoiseach said, wants the courts to appoint inspectors to go into INM to conduct a full and proper investigation, which is correct and understandable.  However, yesterday it emerged that Mr. Denis O'Brien was seeking a judicial review of the ODCE's request to appoint such inspectors by accusing it of leaking information on the data breach.  The ODCE has been investigating the story for a whole year without any leak, but as soon as the affidavit arrived at INM premises there were numerous leaks.  INM even reported on details of the affidavit.  It appears that an attempt is being made to silence the ODCE.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the office is up against it because of a lack of resources and support on the Taoiseach's watch and that of previous Governments.  Currently, 35 staff and seven garda&iacute; are assigned to the office.  That gives a clear insight into the State's attitude to white collar crime and corporate enforcement.  Companies should fear the ODCE and the consequences of data breaches or any other unethical action.  The office should be properly resourced and empowered to ensure white collar crime is not only prosecuted but deterred.  This jurisdiction has gained a reputation as being the Wild West when it comes to tax avoidance and the prevalence of white collar crime.  If we are to shake this reputation, we need to take a stand here and now.  The Taoiseach cannot stand by and allow the ODCE to be disrupted or silenced.  He has a responsibility to support its work.  Does the office have his full support?  How does he plan to demonstrate that support in terms of the provision of adequate resources and staffing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700005#C01200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The matter is before the courts.<\/p><p>Anyone has the right to challenge a decision in the courts if that person has a <i>locus standi<\/i>.  With regard to resources, 36 staff are in place in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and seven garda&iacute; are also assigned.  Reforms have taken place since 2012, which have included the recruitment of additional staff, particularly those with specific skills and expertise.  This means the ODCE is well resourced to tackle the increasingly complex breaches of company law.  Over recent years, nine professional staff have been recruited to the office to enhance its capability.  These include a digital forensic specialist, two enforcement portfolio managers and six forensic accountants.  Furthermore, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is engaging with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to fill through open competition two more positions for forensic accountants and two more for enforcement lawyers.  While recruitment is ongoing, the ODCE, in common with many other State agencies, faces difficulty with recruiting high-quality professional staff.  I am advised that, at present, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has no requests for additional staff other than those I have mentioned.  The director has the full support of the Government.  As part of our white-collar crime package, which I published with the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, a few months ago, it is our policy to develop the ODCE, take it out of its current role as an office within a Department, make it a stand-alone statutory body in its own right and make it a national corporate enforcement bureau.

I will grant that he did better than Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin when, in 2005, 2006 and 2007, as the line Minister, he, in a studious way, ignored the calls for an increase in the number of staff for the office.  The Taoiseach now tells us that there are 36 staff and the Garda complement.  Contrast that with 350 welfare inspectors.  Of course, we need welfare inspectors.  When one looks at those figures, it tells a tale of where the balance of consideration is.

People living on these roads at present are frustrated, angry and resentful because their local road network is in tatters.<\/p><p>This is a massive political issue.  The Government does not need research, surveys or focus groups to establish the extent of the problem but, rather, should just ask county councillors in Tipperary and elsewhere who are currently embarrassed and ashamed to meet people living on such roads.  People using such roads in north, mid, south and west Tipperary are incensed and furious at the neglect and abandonment of some rural roads.

I listened here to the sweet words that were blown up to our friends in the Press Gallery about the importance of the media and how it is central to our democracy.  We heard a lot of that in recent weeks.  I agree with the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting today to note that we have the head of global policy in Facebook coming before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and the effect of some of the new media companies on the democratic system.  I think Facebook is more of a publisher than a platform.  The evidence of that in this country is that Facebook and Google are taking in more than &euro;300 million in advertising revenue that previously went, by and large, to Irish media companies.  It is the same with Netflix.  Figures out today show that its revenue is growing by 20% a year.  Spotify's revenue is growing by 30% per year.  Sky is taking &euro;500 million in profit out of the country and Irish media are on their knees.<\/p>  <p>  I looked to find what the Taoiseach has said and done about the situation.  The first thing he did was to get rid of the digital Minister from his Department.  I looked at the Facebook page of the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen.  I learnt a lot about County Clare, a county I love, but I learnt next to nothing about what he had to say in the past year about the digital issues of our time.<\/p>  <p>  I sought to find out what the Taoiseach had to say when he went to see Facebook.  He was in the beautiful roof garden in the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park.  The Taoiseach said his main purpose was to assure Facebook that the pro-business, pro-enterprise, pro-trade policies that have been pursued in the past would continue to be followed into the future.  He could not have been clearer that we would be pro-business.  There was not a word about good regulation and high standards, and there has not been a word from the Taoiseach about his thoughts on the matter since we heard about Cambridge Analytica.  That is important, given the importance of those companies to us.  They are important to my city.  Thousands of jobs are involved.  We have to get them and we will hold onto them when we have high standards.  The world is seeking to invest in places that are not just pro-business, pro-trade and whatever we can do for you, but that have ethics, values and standards.<\/p>  <p>  My first question to the Taoiseach is what questions I should put on his behalf to the head of global policy at Facebook with regard to Cambridge Analytica.  Is there anything the Taoiseach wants to say to the company following what we have discovered in the past two to three weeks?<\/p>  <p>  My second question is how the Taoiseach is going to fund Irish media if all the money is going to Facebook, Google, Sky and others.<\/p><p>I asked the Taoiseach this question a few weeks ago in the context of promised legislation, but he had no answer to it.  He just said there was a Bill coming.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, came into the D&aacute;il on the last sitting day before the Easter recess and made a speech in which he said effectively that the Government was doing nothing in funding Irish media.  The Government will not take on board the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee which set out how we could raise a pot of between &euro;60 million and &euro;70 million per year that would go to Irish television, radio, music, content creators, film and drama producers.<\/p> <p> My second question is: what does the Government intend to do?  All of the pious talk about the need for legislation to protect sources is fine, but, first and foremost, we need to make sure the companies survive.  How is the Government going to fund Irish media if it is not going to accept the Oireachtas committee's recommendations in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700008#F00800","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523972400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The Deputy will get front page headlines tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700009#G00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1523972400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Sometimes when I hear the Deputy preaching from his perch on the edge of the Chamber, I almost forget-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700009#G00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1523972400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Forget what?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700009#G00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1523972400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>-----the fact that he was not just elected to the D&aacute;il in 2016.

That needs to happen urgently.  Unfortunately, he was not in the Chamber today.

Will the Minister do that?  He should pay the farmers now because the need is real and acute.  His prime responsibility is to Irish farmers who are in crisis, not to the EU rules.  The transport subsidy scheme has been a failure and has merely resulted in the price of fodder rising and in spreading the shortage.  Had the Minister spent the same amount of money on vouchers for meal as he spent on the transport subsidy and as advised by Teagasc we would not be in the situation we are now in.

Although we are in a good position, with the economy being strong, with the fall in the deficit and in unemployment and with incomes rising, and with all such trends going in the right direction, the country is still dealing with many legacy issues, not least the enormous debt placed on the heads of people.  It now stands at &euro;45,000 per head.  As well as reducing the deficit, we need to reduce the debt.  The most important thing is that the Government will be prudent in the decisions it makes on budgets.  We will not adopt the policy of the past &ndash; the if-I-have-it-I'll-spend-it procyclical economic policy.  I encourage Opposition parties not to go back to that philosophy in their demands in the run-up to the budget.  After that, it will be matter of investing on a two-to-one basis in favour of investment and public spending.  I refer to spending on infrastructure and public services.  It will also be a matter of finding some space for tax reductions, particularly focusing on middle-income earners and the fact that people on very modest incomes pay income tax at the highest marginal rate.  The average person working full-time in Ireland earns &euro;46,000 per year.  If he gets a pay rise, does a bit of overtime or gets an increment or promotion, he finds more than half of it is taken away in income tax and PRSI.  We would like to raise the threshold further and allow more people to keep more of their hard-earned money.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the fiscal space, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, prefers not to speak of that and instead prefers to talk about the fiscal stance, which takes into account issues wider than the question of how much money is available to allocate.  I refer to the deficit, for example.  We would all agree that no matter what the fiscal space is, we should not have a higher deficit next year.  The economy is going well.  When the economy is going well, one should try to reduce and eliminate the deficit so there will be some headroom should the economy slow down.  No matter what the fiscal space is, we should still try to reduce or eliminate the deficit.  We should still be trying to reduce the debt.  That is why we have put forward the concept of the rainy-day fund, or of setting aside some money for a downturn in the economy, if it occurs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700018#Q00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1523977800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>A Fianna F&aacute;il proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700018#Q00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1523977800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>It is ours as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700018#Q00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1523977800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>It is a bad proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700018#Q00800","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1523977800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Great minds think alike sometimes.

We have already announced that capital expenditure will increase by &euro;1.5 billion next year.  That means extra money for housing and health care, such as the children's hospital.  The cost of that really falls into next year.  There is to be further investment in transport.  This is good expenditure but it is already committed.  Also to be considered is the impact of increased public sector pay.  There is a further pay increase for public servants in October.  The full-year cost of that next year has to be borne in mind.  This is good spending.  It is extra money for teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; but it does mean the money has to be taken out of the budget for next year.  Also, there is the full-year cost of the increases in social welfare for jobseekers, lone parents, the disabled, carers and other groups who have seen a welfare increase in the past few weeks.  The full-year cost of that has to come out of the allocation for next year also.  Also to be considered are the demographic effects of an ageing population.  There is to be an extra &euro;200 million for pensions, and there is to be an additional health care cost.  Taking into account the full-year cost of measures already announced and committed to, including the costs of demographics, pensions and health care, the figure amounts to well over &euro;2.5 billion already.  When one looks at the figures in that way, one sees that what is left to be allocated for new measures in the budget is quite small.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the capital plan for education, we are building more schools and providing more school places than ever before.  In fact, we doubled the number of additional school places provided since 2010.  Some 9,000 new school places were created in 2010.  In 2017, we provided 18,000 additional school places.  The capital budget of the Department of Education and Skills has increased by 56% since 2012.  That is a major increase.  It had been slashed by 40% between 2007 and 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Prefabs are only ever a temporary solution.  There are quite a few classes in prefabs in St. Mochta's in Clonsilla, which is in my constituency, but that is because a whole new school is being built.

The Taoiseach will be aware that there are ongoing and growing numbers of disputes over pensions provision.  He will know the controversy over the CI&Eacute; pension scheme.

I would like to return to the issue of housing and homelessness, which was raised in the previous batch of questions, because I think we can agree that those without a roof over their heads - individuals and families in homelessness - are among the most vulnerable.  I understand the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is bringing forward a new set of proposals.  He believes they will tackle issues for tenants in the private rented sector and I hope he is right.  The proposals include a rent register and an increase in the minimum notice period.  We will support anything that is credible, progressive and has a prospect of working.  We have been saying for a long time that tougher sanctions are needed for landlords using illegal notices to quit and for breaches of the rent pressure zone, RPZ, legislation.  We welcome the fact that the proposed legislation will make it a criminal offence for landlords to increase rents in RPZs above the 4% cap, but this must also apply to letting agents, online rental platforms and to student accommodation.  We have to make sure that new sanctions are enforced.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to raise one glaring omission from the legislation, which is the Focus Ireland amendment.  This would prevent buy-to-let landlords who benefited from tax breaks from seeking vacant possession if they seek to sell their property.  We need to restrict the criteria for issuing notices to quit.  Landlords can use them when a family member needs the property.  This clause should be removed from the Residential Tenancies Acts.  The proposed Bill is set to be first substantive piece brought forward by the Minister since assuming office almost a year ago.  When will it be published?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that it will include some of the measures I have described?

This is because student accommodation was not covered by the Government's inadequate rent cap legislation.  Will the Taoiseach do something for the DCU students and other students who will be unable to continue their studies if they are asked to swallow these rent increases?  Does he accept that a 4% rent cap is ineffective?  Even the imposition of criminal sanction in the legislation mooted earlier by the Minister would be a futile, half-baked exercise in closing the door after the horse has bolted because the problem is rents are unaffordable.  Will the Taoiseach please address this point?  There is no point limiting average rents of between &euro;1,800 and &euro;2,000 in Dublin to a 4% annual increase.  Rents need to be reduced to affordable levels.  These average rents equate to 70% of the income of the average worker.  That is not sustainable or payable.

With regard to social policy and public services, the public, unfortunately, does not have confidence in a range of public services, with housing and health being the top two.  The rental issue is, as has just been articulated, putting enormous pressure on people on a number of fronts such as young people who move to cities for work and so on.  A significant proportion of their income goes on rent and they are left with little disposable income.  The lack of security of tenure for many families has led to the homelessness crisis and continues to compound that.  Fundamentally, there is a lack of supply.  The Department of Finance conducted an analysis of the lack of action two years ago in the context of incentivising supply.  That is needed.

I started this work as Minister for Social Protection and I am keen to drive it through to completion if I have the opportunity to continue in my current office.  We have run into some difficulty getting it right when it comes to further protections for defined benefit, DB, schemes.  We still intend to have the legislation processed before the summer recess but we want to protect members and former members of DB schemes in such a way that this does not put companies out of business.  Legislation that would put the entire deficit on the shoulders of the employer could put companies out of business in many cases and, as a consequence, cause people to lose their jobs and their pensions.  In other cases, and this would apply to semi-State companies, in particular, while it might not put a company out of business, the legislation would make the company's debt so high that it would be unable to invest anymore.  That would have a serious impact on the public good because large State-owned enterprises need to be able to borrow to invest in infrastructure and if they cannot do so because the pension scheme deficit has to be put on their balance sheet, that would create huge problems for society.  Whatever we do, we have to get it right.  We are not quite in the position that we have that right but we are still working on it.  We anticipate having a social welfare and pensions Bill enacted before the summer recess.<\/p>  <p>  Auto-enrolment will commence in 2021 and it will be very much targeted at the private sector.<\/p><p>Nearly everyone in the public sector has a pension, a reasonably good pension in most cases, and pays into the fund.  Two thirds of those in the private sector have no pension provision, other than the State pension.  That is an enormous inequality with which we need to deal.  We are setting the date at 2021 because we need time to prepare.  First, we need to put the legislation and systems in place.  We also want to give employers, employees and their unions notice that this will happen.  If employers or employees are required to pay into a pension scheme fund, that will impact on business plans and wage demands.  We want to give people good notice.  As part of our renewed and deepened engagement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and IBEC, we are working very closely with them on these proposals because we want to do it on a tripartite basis, with the Government working with employers and unions to get it right.  It will not work without support from IBEC and ICTU.  We are very keen to have them on board.<\/p> <p> It is intended that there will be a State contribution roughly similar to what is available under the current tax relief system.  Roughly one third of whatever contribution an individual makes would be the State's contribution.  We intend to publish a straw man proposal - a rough outline - in June as to how this will work and allow people to comment on it.  Giving people in the private sector decent pensions is one of the really big changes we could make.  Two thirds of them have no pension provision beyond the State pension.  If we can do this, we will have done a good service for them when they retire.  It will not make a huge difference for those who are now in their 50s or 60s, but it will make a huge difference for persons who are now in their 20s, 30s and 40s.

We discussed preparations for the March European Council, including Brexit, trade, Economic and Monetary Union, EMU, and the tax challenges of digitalisation.  I also took the opportunity to congratulate the Chancellor on her recent re-election for the fourth time.  <\/p>  <p>  On Brexit, we welcomed the previous day's agreement between the task force and the United Kingdom that a backstop for the Irish Border, agreed to in December, would have to be legally operative in the withdrawal agreement, to apply unless and until an alternative solution was agreed to.  I took the opportunity to thank the Chancellor for her ongoing support and solidarity for our unique concerns arising from Brexit, especially the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and ensure there would no be hard border on the island of Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  I updated the Chancellor on my meeting with President Trump in Washington the previous week.  As representatives of countries that both support free and fair trade, we shared concerns about the President's approach to steel and aluminium tariffs and looked forward to clarification on the exemption process for the European Union, which was forthcoming later that week.  <\/p>  <p>  On Economic and Monetary Union, we agreed on the importance of ongoing work by Finance Ministers, with a view to decisions in June in areas where agreement was strongest such as completing banking union and further developing the European Stability Mechanism.  <\/p>  <p>  On the tax challenges of digitalisation, we agreed that all companies, including large digital platforms, should pay their fair share of tax based on where value was created, not simply where a transaction happened.  We will continue to engage actively with ongoing work at both Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and EU level.  I highlighted my concern that unilateral EU action had the potential to damage EU competitiveness and disadvantage smaller member states and also that it might result in a retaliatory response from the United States.  We did not have a broader discussion about corporate tax rates, which are clearly a matter of national competence.  Ireland's 12.5% rate is long-standing Government policy and remains the centrepiece of our competitive tax offering.  The Chancellor and I agreed more generally that Europe must adopt a positive approach to digitalisation and that our approach should not be insular.  That means a digital Single Market that is open, competitive and innovation-friendly, with high levels of protection for personal privacy and the free flow of non-personal data.<\/p>  <p>  Our exchanges also covered bilateral relations, which are excellent.  I look forward to the further strengthening of this relationship in the period ahead as we tackle the urgent demands of Brexit and play our part in shaping the European Union's response to new challenges and opportunities.  This work will be guided by the comprehensive review of relations between Ireland and Germany that was published by the T&aacute;naiste last Thursday.  It is entitled, Ireland and Germany, A Wider and Deeper Footprint.  <\/p>  <p>  I also met the Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, on Easter Sunday for a brief courtesy call.  As well as discussing the mayor's programme in Ireland, we discussed Brexit and political and economic developments in Ireland and the United States.  After that, he attended the Leinster game in the Aviva Stadium as my guest.<\/p>  <p>  Forthcoming visits include a speaking engagement in the university in Leuven on 26 April; the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 17 May; and the European Council in Brussels on 28 and 29 June.  A number of other visits are also envisaged.  They will be announced once they are confirmed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700020#S01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1523979000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>With the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Franco-German axis is becoming more central in determining the future of the European Union, the dynamics of which will change.  It is welcome that the Taoiseach travelled to Berlin last month to meet the Chancellor.  German support for the Irish position of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland will be very important coming up to the June summit and perhaps the October summit too.  I hope it is firmly in place.  I know from my experience that Germans are very interested in the peace process and want to see it maintained.  I hope the Taoiseach impressed on the Chancellor the important role small nation states have to play in the evolution of the European Union.  He has stated we are willing to pay more into the EU budget post-2020, which is reasonable.  His meeting took place against the background of a Commission proposal for a digital tax and the ongoing push for a consolidated corporate tax base and the harmonisation of corporation tax generally.  There are also discussions on the reform of the eurozone and its governance.  I know that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has allied Ireland with northern EU states in that regard.

I do not know whether the Taoiseach discussed that matter with the Chancellor.  The bulletin also talks about the key issues being decided in June, but yesterday the T&aacute;naiste admitted that there had been no substantive progress and said everything might fall apart.  I know that conflicts with the Taoiseach's position and that he does not see a problem with everything being delayed until October.  However, the T&aacute;naiste has a different view.  Will the Taoiseach tell me why the co-ordinators' meeting was delayed and if he was consulted about the move away from the agreed schedule of meetings?  Will he explain if he agreed that the meetings would no longer be focused solely on Ireland but could be linked with a meeting on the overall final status negotiations?

The prosecution of such offences must be dealt with in a sensitive manner, with respect for the rights of the accused person and the complainant.  Although in a different jurisdiction with a distinct set of court procedures, the recent case in Northern Ireland has, rightly, brought out into the open conversations on consent and the way sexual offences are dealt with in the courts.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been reports this week on discrepancies in statistics for sexual assaults.  I know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the Policing Authority to ensure the issues related to crime statistics will be resolved as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  Much work has already been done to protect complainants in sexual offence cases from any additional trauma arising from the criminal process.  There are many existing provisions aimed at supporting the complainant in sexual offence proceedings, including restrictions on public attendance at the trial and press reporting.  Complainants are entitled to legal advice and representation through the Legal Aid Board in certain limited circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has introduced measures to ensure complainants will be dealt with sensitively in investigations into sexual offences.  Appropriately trained staff have been placed in divisional protective services offices to investigate these difficult crimes.  Three of these offices have been established and at least four more will be established this year, with work in hand to expand the network to cover all Garda divisions by the end of next year.<\/p>  <p>  The enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2017 last year was a significant development of the law on sexual offences, putting in place a statutory definition of consent to a sexual act.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 also has enhanced protections for victims of crime, including victims of sexual offences.<\/p>  <p>  While these developments have been extremely positive, I believe it is timely to take a broader look at the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences to identify any scope for further practical or legislative steps to support victims of sexual offences, while fully respecting the rights of the accused.  As I have announced, I am drawing up proposals for such a review which will, of course, involve consultation with relevant stakeholders and take account of other proposals which have been made in this area such as the recent report by an inter-agency group headed by Rape Crisis Network of Ireland on vulnerable witnesses.

A commitment was given by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there would be a certain percentage of garda&iacute; allocated to road safety, but that has not happened.

The new measures that are actively being put in place by the Department are aimed at ensuring an oversight of any kind cannot happen in the future.  These plans were referred to and endorsed by Mr. Michael Collins SC in his report, which was published last month.  I listened to Deputy Kelly when he spoke on certain aspects of that report.  These new measures include the use of specialist IT consultants where needed for discovery and the establishment of a separate unit to interact with tribunals and commissions.  Mr. Collins's report points to the absence of a systematic system for filing emails in the Department.  This is under review.  A review of parliamentary questions relating to Sergeant Maurice McCabe was undertaken by the Department and published in January.  A search of approximately 30 million emails, which was undertaken by an external IT company, ultimately resulted in the identification of 79 additional documents of potential relevance, many of which related to the drafting of a single statement.  The review also noted that the search provides an appropriate degree of confidence that the Department of Justice and Equality has identified and supplied all material of potential relevance to the Disclosures Tribunal.

In July 2016 the Supreme Court dismissed the State's appeal in the case of O'Farrell, McDonald, Rafferty <i>v<\/i>. The Governor of Portlaoise Prison.  The case concerned an appeal taken by the State against a judgment of the High Court ordering the release of the three named prisoners who had been transferred to Ireland from the UK under the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Acts 1995 to 1997.  The judgment is detailed and has complex implications for the process of transferring prisoners from other states, and in particular the UK, to Ireland.<\/p><p>As of 11 April 2018 there are 29 applications on hold following the Supreme Court judgment and 23 of these applications are from the UK.  The principal issue in the judgment is the significantly different sentencing systems that operate in the UK and in this State.  In particular, the judgment raises the issue of how best to adapt and administer under Irish law a foreign sentence that contains features not found in Irish sentences.  This is important, as it is not possible to operate a prisoner transfer system where there is uncertainty on the part of either the transferring or receiving State as to the length of sentence to be served by the prisoner concerned.<\/p><p>The complex legal and administrative implications of this judgment are being examined by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office.

One of the main reason for the transfer of prisoners is to prevent others from being punished for someone else's crime, namely the parents.  As can be imagined, if a person is in jail in Australia it is incredibly harsh on the parents.  They can never see their child, irrespective of what he or she has done.

I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, including road traffic issues, to ensure optimum use is made of these resources.  I assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain the strength of community engagement and provide reassurance to citizens.  Members will be aware that the increase in Garda numbers last year represented the first significant increase since numbers stared falling in 2009, and that is good to see.  It is great that we have been able to drive this level of recruitment.  It has seen the number of garda&iacute; assigned to the Mayo division increase by 30 as of 28 February last, the latest date for which figures are readily available, as compared with the end of 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the investment in resources and the ongoing recruitment process will support Garda activities and enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources to County Mayo in response to the Deputy's submissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700027#Z00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Law Review","time":1523983200,"counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700027#Z00250"},{"type":"question","time":1523983200,"counter":299,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[16488\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700027#Z00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to outline the status of his review into the legal protections offered to complainants in sexual assault cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides for a statutory definition of consent and other measures that give protections to complainants during court proceedings.  I intend to bring forward further legislation this year, including the criminal law (sexual offences) (amendment) Bill 2018, the general scheme of which has been published.  The Bill will deal with sentencing for sexual offenders.  Further legislation will strengthen post-release supervision of sex offenders.<\/p>  <p>  Other provisions serve to protect complainants in sexual offence cases from any additional trauma arising from the criminal process, including restrictions on public attendance at hearings and on press reporting.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has begun a programme of establishing divisional protective services offices with specially trained staff to investigate these difficult crimes.  The recently enacted Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 has significantly enhanced protections for victims of crime, including victims of sexual offences.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that complainants in sexual offence cases can access legal advice in certain limited circumstances.  This is given effect through the Legal Aid Board, which provides a legal advice service free of charge to complainants in prosecutions for certain rape and sexual assault cases.  A person seeking this service is not required to undergo a means test or to make any financial contribution.  A legal aid service is also provided in certain rape and sexual offences cases where the complainant's prior sexual experience has been raised by the defence in the course of the trial.  In these instances the Legal Aid Board will appoint a solicitor and a barrister to represent the complainant where the issue of previous sexual history is being raised.  This service is also available without a means test.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, I am examining the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences as a whole to identify any scope for further practical or legislative steps that would support victims of sexual offences while fully respecting the rights of the accused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700027#Z00600","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1523983200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>We need to try to identify why so many victims of sexual assault and rape do not report the crime.

Part of the reason they are deterred by the process is that they think it is an alien process and one under which they will be challenged.  This can mean issues in respect of their personal lives may be unnecessarily exposed.<\/p>  <p>  We need to do something to create greater legislative support for people who are victims of crime and who are deterred from making a complaint in respect of sexual assault or rape.  One method by which we could do this is to ensure that any individual who makes a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of sexual assault or rape would be given legal advice immediately by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This legal advice could include advice on the process involved for such an individual.  Many people are unaware that victims will have to give statements, other relevant witnesses will have to give statements, disclosure will have to be made to the person accused if there is to be a prosecution, and that subsequently there will be a trial at which the victim will have to give evidence and be cross-examined.

I am glad the Minister is here to take the issue.  The Minister will no doubt be aware of the shock, disappointment and anger expressed by pupils, staff, parents and the entire community in Croom in Limerick following the news that Sammon contracting group, which it has been reported submitted the lowest tender for the construction of the long-awaited new secondary school building, has been place into examinership.  The decision of the High Court to appoint an examiner has thrown the process into a state of flux.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will be aware that the process of building a new secondary school in Croom has been dogged by many disappointments, much controversy and a huge amount of delay.  It has been going on since the early 2000s.  We have had issues with site suitability, the size of the school and with planning permission which had to be obtained on at least three occasions having been allowed to lapse.  It had to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We have also had issues with the access road.<\/p>  <p>  There was finally some light beginning to appear at the end of the tunnel and there was a little bit of hope it might pass through the tender stage and a contractor would be appointed.  I inquired about the status from the local education and training board, the Limerick and Clare ETB, which is the patron, and we were promised construction would commence well before now.  We are where we are.<\/p>  <p>  It would be worthwhile for the Minister to take the opportunity, if it ever presents itself, to visit the facility which operates as a secondary school.  My colleague, Deputy Neville, who is present in the Chamber, knows all too well that it is substandard, which is to put it mildly.  The pupils and staff have to operate in prefabricated buildings, many of which are years old and so substandard it beggars belief that they would meet any safety standards or pass any inspection.<\/p><p>My purpose in raising this matter is to keep the pressure on the Minister and the Department to bring a positive note to the mood surrounding it because the community in Croom and the community the school serves are very worried.  Some feel it will never go ahead.  The Minister needs to knock that on the head and make clear that he is determined to see this project through and ensure that the new school building, which was promised 16 or 17 years ago, will be delivered.<\/p> <p> In time the Department of Education and Skills will see this as a case study in how not to build a new school.  Can the Minister give us the update on the tender process today?  Has the Sammon Group formally withdrawn from the tender process, which is the stated desire of everybody involved, including the education and training board, ETB?  Can he update us on any discussions he or the Department has had with the Sammon Group or the building unit?

He is right that there has been a difficult development process for this project.  The original decision was devolved to the ETB to run the project.  A service level agreement was put in place.  A planning application was submitted and granted in April 2014 but that was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by a third party and the board overturned the grant of planning permission.  I do not know the background to that but planning difficulties are not unknown in project development.<\/p>  <p>  Following further consultation a new application was lodged and planning permission was received in January 2017.  Limerick County Council approached the ETB to ask it to consider an alternative access route to the school site.  As part of the planning permission granted access to the school site was to be achieved by upgrading an existing road.  The alternative route proposed by the local authority involved the development of a new road off a distributor road, which would open up contiguous lands for development.  As the Department had no difficulty in principle with the local authority's proposal it mandated the ETB to make a capped offer of a capital contribution to the cost of the new road, equivalent to what it would cost to upgrade the existing road in accordance with the planning permission granted.  Following some period of consideration of the offer by the local authority and correspondence between it and the ETB, the Department's offer was accepted.  To facilitate access to the school from the proposed new road the design team had to make some adjustments to the layout of the new school site to place the entrance at a different point in the site.<\/p>  <p>  The ETB and its design team submitted a stage 2B submission for the project incorporating the requisite design changes to the Department towards the end of last year.  A stage 2B submission provides a detailed cost plan for the project prior to going to tender.  The Department approved this and the project went to tender.  When the tender process was completed the ETB filed a tender report with the Department as required and this is being evaluated.  Once this evaluation has been completed the project will be allowed to proceed to the award of a contract and construction.  I expect that it should happen within the coming weeks.

This is a commercially confidential process and there are very strict procedures for the award of public contracts, how those who are successful and those who are not should be notified as the process goes forward, and bidders can challenge a tender outcome before a contract is signed.

In 2011 there was a plan to close the hospital.  A court case involving two of its elderly residents and a mass campaign locally were instrumental in stopping the closure, or putting the brakes on it.  The hospital has changed from being mainly a long-stay hospital to a respite care hospital used as a step-down facility for patients from acute units such as that in Portlaoise.  That is no bad thing; it is actually good.  However, the hospital badly needs investment.  It badly needs to be extended and renovated.  Nothing has been done to it in the almost seven years since the closure was stopped.  Not a shovel of concrete has been mixed and not a piece of timber has been cut.  There is a large site, of which the existing building occupies only a small part.  The hospital is centrally located in the town of Abbeyleix which is close to the centre of County Laois and in an ideal position to be utilised.  As it is on HSE-owned land, there is no requirement to buy or lease land.  There is very little development to be undertaken because the area is very well serviced with infrastructure.  The land is ideal for the putting in place of a new or extended facility.<\/p>  <p>  Population growth in Laois is faster than in any other county.<\/p><p>Percentage wise, it is even faster than in County Kildare which is close to the commuter belt.  The population of County Laois is mushrooming, according to the latest census, and we must cater for this.  In addition, we are all living longer; therefore, the number of elderly people in the county is increasing.  There is a huge need for nursing home places.  Private nursing homes will take low dependency patients but high dependency patients cannot be catered for in many of them.  That is where the Abbeyleix unit comes in.  It has always been available with an excellent staff to cater for high dependency patients whose care is costly and who need many supports and services.  With the nursing home services, it also provides excellent day care services.  <\/p> <p> I have a pain in my head listening to all of the talk about primary care provision in the past 15 years.  Abbeyleix hospital provides an opportunity to expand the primary care services in the town by adding chiropody, physiotherapy and GP services and so on, in which there is huge interest in the area.  Seven years on, there is no plan.  I met HSE officials, accompanied by representatives of the friends of the hospital committee, twice after Christmas, but there was no plan, design or cash because the upgrade had not been included in the capital plan.  Promises have been made, but they have been recurring in the past seven years.  The Minister of State will understand that even people like me who are optimistic by nature have become sceptical.  We need to move the process on because it cannot be allowed to drag on at a snail's pace.  The current capacity of the unit is 20 beds, but that needs to be increased.  I am anxious to hear the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700032#EE00200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523986500,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I apologise for the delay.  <\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue which relates to Abbeyleix hospital.  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  That is what older people clearly want and only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route.  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those in facilities such as Abbeyleix hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Abbeyleix community nursing unit is registered with HIQA to provide care for 20 residents.  It comprises 17 short-stay and three long-stay beds.  All bedrooms are on the ground floor.  In addition, a day service is provided for between 20 and 22 people from Monday to Thursday.  The HSE is committed to the long-term future of the Abbeyleix facility which will continue to operate as a community hospital for the area.  In that context, a meeting took place in January this year between the HSE and the friends of Abbeyleix hospital committee.  At the meeting it was agreed that plans for the future development of services at Abbeyleix would be progressed in conjunction with local community interests.  The HSE gave a commitment to the establishment of a project group in quarter 1 of 2018, representative of all stakeholders, to plan for future services at Abbeyleix community nursing unit.  The project group has been established and its first meeting is scheduled to take place on 4 May.  The HSE will also continue to meet the friends of Abbeyleix hospital committee.  While the community nursing unit is not accepting long-stay residents, it is providing respite care services in County Laois and the extended area, in addition to day care, rehabilitation and meals on wheels services.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE's plan for the long-term future of Abbeyleix community nursing unit is to develop a sustainable model of service which will see the unit operate as a community hospital, providing short-stay beds for step-up and step-down from Portlaoise acute hospital, as well as respite and transitional care beds for the area.  Short-term beds contribute to the provision of an integrated model of care for older people, enabling them to return home following a period of hospital care, thus avoiding admission to acute hospital, or postponing admission to long-stay nursing home care.  Both the HSE and I recognise that Abbeyleix community nursing unit is vital for the provision of community-based services that help people to stay in their homes and communities and that assist those who require admission to be discharged as early as possible from acute care back to their home environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700033#FF00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1523986500,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

Are there people with technical expertise in the Department on it?  <\/p>  <p>  The community nursing unit is registered with HIQA and has a capacity of 20 patients.  It had higher capacity in years gone by, but standards have changed and a huge upgrade is needed.  However, there is also a need for additional places because people from the town and surrounding areas are in nursing homes in County Tipperary.  The Minister of State referred to step-up and step-down facilities for those receiving acute treatment and the need for respite care.  The respite care service provided by the unit is very much valued by the local community and much sought after.  I receive many representations on it.  Why can it not have more long-stay beds?  <\/p>  <p>  There is also the issue of ensuring the unit has enough staff to keep it operational.  When something is being run on a 24\/7 basis, a critical mass of patients is needed to maximise use of the staff and facilities.  A total of 20 residents will not result in that happening.  I, therefore, urge the Minister of State to think big and aim to have a capacity of 45 or 50 beds.<\/p>  <p>  The friends of the hospital committee has raised a lot of money.  It should not have had to do this, but it did anyway during the years and it is still active in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  When is it anticipated that the project group will produce a plan?  When will the plan be put out to tender?  When will it get into the all-important capital programme to make sure there will be euro and cent in place?  We need a plan, a timeline and funding.  That is what the people of County Laois want to hear about because this has been an issue for a long time.  It is welcome that we prevented the closure of the unit.

They demand that international law is upheld by others but seem to have no problem with ignoring it themselves.  The auspices given that this was to enforce the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons is a joke when we know that the system to deal with this was outlined in the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.  International investigators were <i>en route<\/i>to Syria, due to land there within hours when these so-called world powers decided to strike without any lawful basis.  Can the Minister imagine what would have happened in a similar situation?  We all know that the US, UK and Israel have used, for example, depleted uranium and white phosphorous.  What would have happened if the Russians or Chinese decided to bomb Maryland or Porton Down in the UK without a proper, independent investigation?  It is ludicrous.  These are the same powers that lied about Iraq and Libya.  These are very dangerous times.<br\/><br\/>We, as an independent country, should firmly stand up and argue for diplomatic solutions and an end to war, not its continuation.  We do not know whether chemical weapons were used at all.  If they were, it is abhorrent.  Unlike others, we condemn the use of all weaponry, not just chemical weaponry.  We do not know if they were used and if they were used, we do not know by whom.  The people who were charged with carrying out the investigation have not got there yet.  The Minister may have read today's article in the British <i>Independent<\/i>by Robert Fisk, hardly a radical, who was in Douma yesterday.  He spoke to some of the doctors who were present who put forward the idea that what happened there was not a gas attack at all but hypoxia caused by bombing that was taking place, dust clouds, wind, and people being withheld from oxygen underground, causing the symptoms that were displayed.  The Minister can read the article.  It is incredibly illustrative.  Robert Fisk is hardly a radical and is on the ground in Douma, talking to people today and yesterday, including survivors of that incident.  We have to be very careful in this situation and we should be taking a lead on it.  It is somewhat ironic when one considers that ISIS has used chemical weapons provided by Saudi Arabia on multiple locations in Iraq and Syria and that no action was taken.  These powers could not care less that the Saudi dictator who supplied the weaponry in Yemen is slaughtering innocent women and children.  No action has been taken there relating to gas or the killing of civilians.  We cannot choose our battles.

I have no doubt about the brutalities it has committed and is capable of committing.  The idea that US, UK and French missiles and a massive dose of hypocrisy and double standards from those powers will assist in the humanitarian disaster in Syria is stomach-churning.  For Government representatives to talk about the attacks being understandable is shocking.  Let me refer to the double standards we are talking about.  In 2009, Israel rained down chemical weapons, white phosphorous, in the full view of day, on the UN school in Gaza and on densely populated areas.  A report was done by Human Rights Watch afterwards called Rain of Fire: Israel's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza.  This was well-documented and proven.  The shells were found all around the place.  They were chemical weapons.  Guess where they were produced?  Louisiana in the United States.  Were there sanctions?  No.  Were there expulsions of diplomats?  No.  Were there threats of military action by these politicians who told us, in the context of bombing Syria, that they could not sleep with the thought of the use of chemical weapons?  They were able to sleep very soundly when Israel rained down chemical weapons on the people of Gaza.  Incredibly, the Israelis said at the weekend that it was absolutely right to take military action to uphold international law but in the last few weeks, 36 unarmed Palestinians were killed who were marching to assert their rights under international laws to return to their homes as confirmed by UN resolutions.  Sanctions?  No.  Military action?  No.  Expulsions?  No.<\/p>  <p>  This sort of rank hypocrisy is corrosive of politics and is responsible for the mess in the Middle East.  There is cynical interference of big powers, whether Russia, Donald Trump, Theresa May or Emmanuel Macron, trying to shore up their collapsing popularity by diverting people's attention with a war abroad and furthering the interests of imperial powers in that region, to gain influence on the back of the suffering of the Syrian people.

Instead of understanding the actions of Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron, does the Minister not think we should have had condemnation of this military action which ratchets up tension across the world and brings us closer to a new world war?  We know that neutrality has never been a reality in this State but it has rarely been so blatantly flouted repeatedly by our Government.  It is only weeks since we had the expulsion of diplomats on the say-so of unpublished British intelligence.  It is only months since the Government signed Ireland up for the European military alliance, permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and now it is giving implicit support to western imperialist intervention in the Middle East.  Does the Government not agree that the use of Shannon Airport and the support that represents for US military action abroad has to be ended by the US military?  Can the Minister even give a commitment that Shannon will not be used for the US military either going to or coming from Syria?

That corrupt regime has defended itself through rivers of innocent people's blood repeatedly.<\/p>  <p>  No evidence has been presented.  We are expected just to accept what has been put forward.  The question that has to be asked is why it would launch a chemical attack now, giving a reason for western imperialism to intervene.  Everybody should remember that it is just over 15 years since the dodgy dossier about weapons of mass destruction was used to justify going to war in Iraq.  The disaster is there, right across the region, for everybody to see and yet we are expected to believe them again.  The use of it as a pretext for another imperialist intervention, regardless of who is responsible, should be rejected.  I echo the points about the utter hypocrisy of these people, including Trump, May and Macron, all of whom recently rolled out the red carpet for the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, the architect in chief of the carnage and deliberate starvation in Yemen, where a child dies every ten minutes.  They all celebrated the re-election of el-Sisi in Egypt and they gave a free pass to Israeli snipers gunning down unarmed Palestinians in Gaza.  Imperialist intervention is a disaster.  It has been a disaster, including both Russian and western imperialism.

International law, under the UN Charter, makes clear two exceptions to the general prohibition of war.  The first is the use of force by a state against another, the self-defence clause as defined by Article 51.  The second permits certain military interventions when authorised by the UN Security Council under chapter 7 of the Charter.  Until the US, France or the UK have been attacked or the UN Security Council acts, Article 51 in chapter 7 of the UN Charter makes the US, UK or French airstrikes in Syria illegal under international law.

However, the line that has been spun by much of the media as to what has happened there is very disturbing.  More than anyone else, the Saudis, with the help of the Israelis, have escalated the war out of all proportion.  Two and a half years ago, it looked like a group of fundamentalist jihadists was going to take over Syria with the backing of the Saudis and US support.  We must not forget that the United States has put over $1 billion into training the opposition to the Assad regime in Syria.  The so-called acceptable opposition is made up of groups such as al-Nusra, al-Qaeda and Ahrar al-Sham.  They are mad people.  No one likes Russia or Iran bombing anyone but if a country were to invade Mexico, would the United States stand by and allow the forces of a hostile country to operate along its border?  It is rational that Russia did not want a crowd of mad fundamentalist jihadists on its border, controlling Syria.  It would be mad to have allowed that.  It is unfortunate that that means war.<\/p> <p> What is the United Nations doing about it?  If the United States got Saudi Arabia to call off its dogs of war - the so-called rebels or opposition, who the Syrians call terrorists, being made up primarily of Saudi Arabian and Chechnyan nationals - the Russians and the Iranians would pull out.  The primary aim of the EU should be to stop the bombing and the supply and infiltration of weapons into the region - the place is awash with weapons on both sides - and avoid any escalation of the conflict.

The apparent chemical attack in the city of Douma in Syria on 7 April was horrifying, even by the standards of the Syrian conflict to date.  It was distressing to see images of children choking to death, their lives cut short by a conflict they did not understand and in which they were not involved.  Whole families were wiped out in basements in which they had sought shelter from bombs falling overhead.  I remember seeing very similar images when I visited Halabja, as I said when Deputy Wallace and others asked questions on this matter previously.  There, I spoke to families who witnessed similar incidents in 1988.  I wish to make several matters clear before I deal with the military intervention.  Ireland condemns the use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere and in any circumstances.  I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate my unreserved condemnation of this callous act perpetrated on civilians, particularly women and children.<\/p>  <p>  As has been mentioned, on 14 April the United States, France and the United Kingdom launched a series of strikes on a number of facilities which have been linked to the Syrian Government&rsquo;s use of chemical weapons.  From what we were told yesterday, notice was given to ensure that there were no civilian casualties.  The stated objective of the strikes was to ensure that chemical attacks such as that in Douma do not reoccur.  When a chemical attack as horrific as that occurs and in the absence of the UN Security Council being able to take action because of the repeated use of a veto, I can understand why the military strikes happened, as I have stated.  That is not the same as an implicit endorsement of or support for that action.  Last week I was asked about military strikes in advance of their happening but when they were being discussed.  I urged caution and very clearly stated that I did not see how further military activity in Syria would improve an already very difficult situation.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, at the Foreign Affairs Council, I continued to urge caution and asked that the focus be on political solutions.  Anyone who reads the entirety of the resolution that was agreed will see that there is a short reference to military strikes but all its emphasis is on humanitarian support, accountability in Syria and legal mechanisms to deliver that, inspections, a more comprehensive UN response and a conference on Syria to be held next week in Brussels, at which Ireland will make a further significant financial contribution towards supporting the millions of refugees who need international assistance.  I discussed the situation in Syria with my EU colleagues at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  We condemned in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in Syria and stressed the need to ensure full legal accountability for those responsible for such crimes.

As I stated, the EU will host a donor conference for Syria next week, as it did last year.  The EU, including its member states, is the largest single donor to the effort to support the Syrian people.  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;95 million, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone, to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria and will again make a significant contribution next week.  Our approach is UN-led but, as I stated yesterday, I understand why some countries decided to move ahead while the UN Security Council is paralysed to respond to human rights abuses such as this because of the inappropriate use of a veto.  Those countries have published the legal justification for their actions and that justification will be tested, as it ought to be.  Ireland has not supported military action in this case.

In the absence of the UN Security Council being able to respond comprehensively, I said that response was understandable.  I did not say I supported it, but I can understand the motivation behind it.  That is all I said yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the French and British Prime Ministers outline in detail why they took part in that action.

That is where Ireland can be relevant and focused.  We have no role or capacity in terms of military strikes.  After they had taken place, it would not have achieved anything for me to have been strongly critical.  Instead, I want to focus on the positive agenda that the European Union and the United Nations are working together to try to achieve, which is the implementation of ceasefires that have been signed up to but are being ignored.

I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members and obtaining the broad support of the House for the contents of this most important legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Bill was amended during its passage through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  A number of new provisions have been added to it and I will draw attention to them in due course.  The explanatory memorandum, which accompanies the Bill, has been updated to reflect the amendments from the Seanad.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to give further effect to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, to transpose the accompanying law enforcement directive into national law and to establish the data protection commission to replace the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The GDPR enters into effect on 25 May next and the directive must be transposed into national law by then.  I am hopeful that with the support of the House, this Bill will be signed into law and enter into force in May next, alongside the GDPR.  I am confident that the GDPR and this legislation will serve to make our data protection laws fit for purpose in the digital age.  The updated data protection rules entering into force next month will affect all of us in one way or another.  It will affect each of us as individuals, because it will increase our control over the manner in which, and the purposes for which, our personal data are used.<\/p><p>It will affect businesses, whether large, medium or small, because it will require them to review and update the manner in which they collect, use or store the personal data of their customers and clients or any other individual whose personal data they retain.  The same applies to Departments and all public bodies.<br\/><br\/>The simple fact is that data protection law has not kept pace with the many technological advances and new business models such as social media and cloud computing that have emerged in recent years.  Our current law, based on the European Union&rsquo;s 1995 data protection directive, predates mass Internet usage, hand held devices, apps and games, social networking and data analytics, all of which involve the collection and processing of our personal data, often for purposes that are opaque and largely unknown to us.  The basic data protection principles set out in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 will remain largely unchanged following the entry into force of the GDPR.  However, GDPR rules will strengthen our control over our own personal data and the purposes for which it may be used.  Increased transparency is essential for increased control.  In the future, information must be provided for users in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible format, using clear and plain language.  It will no longer be acceptable for service providers to direct users to opaque terms and conditions written in legal jargon.  The obligations placed on companies and public sector bodies that collect, use and store personal data are set to increase but will do so in a measured and proportionate manner.  The compliance burden will increase for some but it will be proportionate to risks for the rights and freedoms of individuals arising from any accidental or unlawful loss or disclosure of, or access to, their personal data.  This will inevitably pose a greater challenge for those bodies, whether in the public or private sectors, that specialise in data processing and for those handling, for example, customers&rsquo; financial data or patients' sensitive health data.  While large companies have been gearing up for entry into force of the GDPR for some time, it is likely that the SME sector and micro enterprises will continue to require assistance and support during the coming period of adjustment.  Awareness raising activities have been under way for the last year and a half involving conferences, seminars and workshops and those activities will continue.  Practical guidance is also vital and I strongly recommend the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s web page, <i>gdprandyou.ie<\/i>, which contains a wealth of useful information and practical guidance for both business and individuals.<br\/><br\/>High data protection standards are not anti-business and will not reduce competitiveness.  The harmonised rules set out in the GDPR and the Data Protection Bill will ensure that the same data protection safeguards will operate across the European Union.  This will provide a level playing field for businesses, especially those involved in the cross-border provision of goods and services.  Enhanced data protection standards will also be beneficial to the increasing numbers who avail of the Government&rsquo;s online services.  Public and private enforcement of data protection law is set to increase.  In future the data protection commission will have stronger supervision and enforcement powers as well as a broader range of sanctions at its disposal, including the imposition of administrative fines.  The scope for compensation claims arising from infringements of data protection rules will also increase, resulting in higher levels of private enforcement activity.<br\/><br\/>The Government is committed to achieving the full potential of the digital economy and its capacity to promote innovation, create jobs and boost economic activity in the State.  We already host many of the world&rsquo;s leading digital companies here and they provide their services well beyond our shores.  That number will increase in the future.  The GDPR together with this legislation will ensure that the data processing involved in the provision of these services will meet the highest data protection standard.  The establishment of the data protection commission will ensure effective supervision and enforcement of these high standards.  <br\/><br\/>Following protracted negotiations, the GDPR was agreed in early 2016 and will, as I mentioned, enter into force across the European Union on 25 May next.  An accompanying directive, which establishes data protection standards for the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties also requires transposition by May of this year.  Both the GDPR and the directive have a legal basis in article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and they provide for significant enhancements to current data protection rules based on the 1995 data protection directive.  Both instruments generally provide for higher standards of data protection for individuals and impose increased obligations on bodies in the public and private sectors that process personal data.  They also increase the range of possible sanctions for infringements of these standards and obligations.  The GDPR seeks to provide for a uniform interpretation and application of data protection standards across the European Union, thereby providing a level playing field for all those doing business in the EU digital market.  The European data protection board, a new entity that will replace the current advisory committee and made up of representatives of the data protection authorities of all member states, will play an important role in that respect.  <br\/><br\/>At the heart of both the GDPR and the directive is a risk based approach to data protection.  This means that each individual controller and processor is required to put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place in order to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that their processing of personal data complies with the new data protection standards.  I remind the House that the terms &quot;controller&quot; and &quot;processor&rdquo; are not esoteric concepts.  Those of us involved, for example, in the handling of constituents' requests and representations are data controllers and any operator of an off-site storage facility for files containing personal data is a processor.  I will return to the point about the work of elected members later in my remarks.  For the purposes of assessing the nature, level and likelihood of risks for the rights and freedoms of individuals, controllers and processors must have regard to the nature, scope, context and purposes of their data processing activities.  In certain cases, this will in future require the carrying out of a data protection impact assessment in order to take steps to mitigate such risks.  Where mitigation measures are not feasible, prior consultation with the data protection commission will be mandatory.  The GDPR and the directive both place greatly increased emphasis on the transparency of processing, the responsibility of the controller and processor for compliance with data protection standards and the need for appropriate security standards in order to protect against data breaches such as unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage.  <br\/><br\/>The GDPR and the directive also impose an obligation on all public authorities and bodies, as well as some private sector bodies, to designate a data protection officer with responsibility to oversee data processing operations and to report data breaches to the data protection authority.  The GDPR also limits the grounds for lawful processing of personal data by public authorities and bodies.  For example, depending on the circumstances, an individual&rsquo;s consent to the processing of his or her personal data may not provide a reliable basis for such processing by a public authority.  The so-called legitimate interest ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR will no longer be available to public authorities when acting in their public capacity.  Both the GDPR and the directive provide for increased supervision and enforcement of data protection standards by the data protection authorities of member states, including the future data protection commission.  The GDPR provides for the possible imposition of substantial administrative fines of &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million or 2% or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year.  I will return to the fines issue shortly.  The liability of controllers and processors will also be broadened to include non-material damage such as distress.  In future an individual who has suffered material or non-material damage because of a breach of his or her data protection rights under the GDPR or this legislation will have the right to seek compensation in the courts.  <br\/><br\/>The key purposes of the Bill are to give further effect to the GDPR in the areas in which member state flexibility is permitted to transpose the directive into national law; to establish the data protection commission as the State&rsquo;s data protection authority with the means to supervise and enforce the enhanced protection standards enshrined in the GDPR and directive in an efficient and effective manner; and to enact consequential amendments to various Acts that contain cross-references to the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  The Data Protection Bill 2018, which is both lengthy and complex in nature, comprises numerous parts.  Part 1, sections 1 to 8, inclusive, contains a number of standard provisions, including citation, commencement and definitions.  Part 2, sections 9 to 27, inclusive, establishes a data protection commission to replace the Data Protection Commissioner as the State&rsquo;s data protection authority.  Its primary task will be to act as the supervisory authority for the purposes of the GDPR and the directive.  Part 3, sections 28 to 58, inclusive, gives further effect to the GDPR in a number of areas, mainly affecting the public sector, in which the regulation gives member states a margin of flexibility.<\/p><p>In certain cases, this involves the creation of a regulation-making power that will permit the making of more detailed regulations.<br\/><br\/>Part 4, comprising sections 56 to 65, inclusive, contains a number of provisions that are consequential on replacement of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner with the data protection commission.  Part 5 transposes the provisions of the law enforcement directive into national law.  Part 6 contains provisions dealing with the enforcement of the obligations and rights set out in the GDPR and the directive by the data protection commission.  Part 7 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, mainly concerning the application of data protection rules to the courts and a number of related legal matters.  Part 8 contains a limited number of consequential amendments to a number of Acts.  I intend to table a substantial amendment to Part 8 on Committee Stage to incorporate the necessary adjustments to a large number of Acts of the Oireachtas that contain cross-references to the Data Protection Act 1988.<br\/><br\/>As regards substance, the updated explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill contains much detail.  For that reason, I do not intend to delve into the provisions of the Bill in great detail.  However, I want to take this opportunity to highlight a number of issues and to refer to Part 5, which transposes the law enforcement directive into national law.<br\/><br\/>Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill contain provisions concerning the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  While article 2.2(a) of the GDPR provides that its provisions do not apply to the processing of personal data in the course of an activity falling outside the scope of EU law, there has been considerable uncertainty about the scope of that exclusion in light of evolving Court of Justice case law.  A detailed analysis of relevant Court of Justice case law by the Office of the Attorney General has concluded that this exclusion is essentially limited in practice to data processing in the context of national security, defence and the international relations of the State.  While national security and defence lie outside the scope of EU law, the Council of Europe's 1981 data protection convention - Convention 108 - contains provisions that apply to data processing for these purposes.<br\/><br\/>The GDPR contains a consistency mechanism, or so-called &quot;one-stop-shop&quot;, which is intended to streamline the handling of data protection infringements and complaints across the European Union.  For this purpose, it employs the concept of a lead supervisory authority of a member state.  This means that complaints will be investigated by the data protection authority of that member state, irrespective of the member state of origin of the complaint.  Before arriving at a final decision in cross-border cases, the lead authority must submit a draft decision to other data protection authorities that have an interest in the case and must have regard to any objections received from them.  In order to underline and further enhance the independence of the commission as required by the GDPR and by Court of Justice case law, the commissioner will be the Accounting Officer of a separate financial Vote.  This is covered in sections 25 and 165.<br\/><br\/>I would like move on to the child-related provisions of the Bill.  Article 8 specifies a &quot;digital age of consent&quot; of 16 years but allows member states to lower it but not below 13.  In late 2016, my Department launched a consultation process and invited submissions from interested parties on the digital age of consent to apply in this jurisdiction under article 8.  The Government Data Forum, which brings together legal and data protection experts, business representatives, sociologists, psychologists and education specialists, also carried out a consultation process.  A majority of respondents recommended that the digital age of consent should be set at 13 years and the Government approved such an age limit in June of last year.  When the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality during the pre-legislative phase of this process, he also recommended that the digital age of consent should be set at 13 years.  This is the background to the Government's decision to specify 13 years as the digital age of consent in section 30 of the Bill before the House.<br\/><br\/>Arising from the sincere and strongly-held concerns that were expressed during its discussions on this matter, the Seanad accepted my proposal for a review clause.  This clause, which is provided for in section 30(3) of the Bill, means that the operation of this provision must be reviewed not later than three years after its coming into operation.  I want to refer to article 6.1(f) and to article 12, which imposes high standards of transparency on controllers.  Article 17 relates to the right to erasure.  Article 40 makes general provision for codes of conduct.  Article 57 requires data protection authorities to promote public awareness and understanding.  Arising from the discussion in the Seanad, I proposed the inclusion of section 31 of the Bill as it now stands.  Another new section, section 32, makes specific provision for an enhanced right to be forgotten in the case of children.  Before I conclude what I have to say on the protection of children, I express my support for the joint committee's recommendation for consultations with children in relation to data protection measures.<br\/><br\/>Article 57 of the GDPR requires data protection authorities, such as the proposed data protection commission, to promote public awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in regard to data processing.  Article 23 makes provision for possible restrictions on controller obligations.  The need to apply restrictions will arise from time to time.  Section 57 of the Bill provides for proportionate restrictions in order to safeguard a range of important objectives of general public interest - for example, to avoid obstruction of any official or legal inquiry, investigation or process.<br\/><br\/>I have referred to article 57 of the GDPR.  Article 83 provides for the imposition of administrative fines for infringements.  To ensure fair and equitable trading conditions, section 139 of the Bill provides that administrative fines may be imposed on public bodies that are acting as &quot;undertakings&quot; by providing goods or services for gain in competition with private bodies.  This will ensure fair competition.  In Chapter 2, section 68 contains provisions outlining the general principles of data protection.  Chapter 3 outlines the obligations on controllers when acting within the scope of Part 5.  Chapter 4 specifies the data protection rights of individuals, including rights in respect of automated decision-making in sections 87 to 90, inclusive.  Part 6 of the Bill contains detailed provisions relating to the supervision and enforcement of the GDPR and the data protection standards set out in Part 5.<br\/><br\/>I want to mention the important report that was drawn up on foot of the pre-legislative process.  I thank the committee and other stakeholders for their work in that regard.  Before I conclude, I need to mention a specific amendment that I intend to introduce on Committee Stage.  Deputies will be aware that concerns have been raised that the GDPR and the Bill before the House may have an adverse impact on the ability of elected representatives, including Members of this House, to make representations on behalf of their constituents and carry out other aspects of their work as elected representatives.  I intend to bring forward a Committee Stage amendment to ensure there is an appropriate legal basis for, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the processing of personal data for the purposes of dealing with constituents' representations and requests from members of the public, interest groups and stakeholders, which is the essence of our work as public representatives.  This amendment is being finalised at present.  I intend to circulate it at the earliest opportunity and obviously in advance of Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned, this is a complex and lengthy Bill.  I acknowledge the positive and constructive engagement on it that took place in the Seanad.  That it is lengthy or complex, or both, should not blind us to the central purpose of the Bill, which is to promote and facilitate the exercise of our right as individuals to the protection of our personal data and to increase our control over it and the uses to which it may be put.  Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights provides simply that &quot;everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her&quot;.  The GDPR and this Bill seek to make that a reality.  In acknowledging the constructive debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and in showing that I am open to engaging in debate, I hope to set the scene for a similar type of engagement here.  Many of the parties represented in this House were successful in working to ensure the legislation I am introducing is fit for purpose.  I hope we can advance it on Second Stage in the next couple of days before moving on to Committee and Report Stages with a view to having it enacted well in advance of the due date of 25 May next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700036#JJ01200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523989500,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy James Lawless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700038#LL00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1523989500,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

As the Minister mentioned, the purpose of the legislation is twofold: first, to give effect to the general data protection regulation, GDPR; and second, to transpose into Irish law the accompanying directive in respect of law enforcement governing the area of data protection.  Like the Minister, I am conscious that the regulation itself comes into force on 25 May next.  We will seek to facilitate the Government in respect of its commitment to try to get the legislation enacted by the end of May.  However, I think we need to be aware that this vital legislation, which will affect the rights of citizens throughout this country, should not be rushed.  It is important that we get it right, as opposed to simply enacting it as quickly as possible in order to get this done by the end of May.<\/p><p> Before looking at a number of specific provisions in the Bill, I will refer to the developments in data protection that have taken place in the past 30 years.  Legislation dealing with data protection was first introduced in this country in 1988.  I do not know if anybody present was in this Chamber back in 1988, but if he or she was when the data protection Bill of that year was being discussed, I doubt anyone could have envisaged the developments that would take place in data protection in the subsequent 30 years.  We must recognise that the debate on this legislation takes place against the background of an extraordinary technological revolution that has taken place in the world in the past 20 years, in particular.  I am talking about the development of the Internet and the establishment of data and large technology companies that have been able to develop enormous powers through the accumulation, collation and use of personal data for individuals.  This is something we never envisaged prior to the creation of the Internet and the revolution that took place in data technology in the past 20 years.<\/p> <p> It is important to note that there have been many beneficial developments as a result of the technological revolution.  We have seen great developments in access to information and through this revolution people have been able to access information that they have never been able to access before.  Accessing that information has become much more democratised since very many people can use the Internet and search engines.  There have been benefits in providing people with the opportunity to become more aware of their culture and past; that is a great benefit generated by the technological revolution.<\/p> <p> Another great development and benefit for society is in communication.  Many years ago when people left Ireland, they did so with the certainty that they would probably never be able to communicate with the individuals they were leaving behind in any meaningful or regular way.  That has now gone as a result of the excellent developments that have taken place in technological and Internet communications.<\/p> <p> There have been very many benefits as a result of the technological revolution, but there have also been very many negative consequences.  I will give a couple of examples.  No society has been exposed to the prevalence of pornography more than this one.  Young people have never previously grown up with the promotion of pornography being so general and broad on the Internet.  It must necessarily have an impact on their sexual development and perception of sexuality in general.  We do not yet know what the consequences will be, but it is something we must watch carefully.  We need to assist young people who are being exposed to matters such as this that previous generations were never exposed to.  Another very negative consequence of the technological revolution is its facilitation and enablement of child abuse on an international basis as never encountered before.  A third negative consequence is what is generally referred to as \"fake news\", with false information being given out and accepted by individuals as being true.<\/p> <p> The issue on which I want to concentrate in this contribution is the damage being done in another important area of public life by the technological revolution.  I am talking about the damage done by it to individualism.  This is not a political philosophy; it is more of a social outlook or personal philosophy.  Individualism is generally about individual people being able to make decisions for themselves based on their own intellectual capacity and life experiences.  There is great benefit in a society having widespread individualism.  It encourages the exchange of ideas and asks people not to get involved in \"groupthink\" which can be prevalent in certain societies.  It adds to the intellectual life of a nation, when individuals can think differently for themselves, and promotes an exchange of ideas.  It enables individuals to be honest with themselves about the generation of personal views, as opposed to the formulation of views based on what others think.  Unfortunately, I am sure many others and I believe the technological revolution that has taken place in the past 20 years and, in particular, the accumulation of data from individuals have damaged the principle and practice of individualism.<\/p> <p> Part of the reason large technology companies have so much information on individuals is they na&iuml;vely give away much information on themselves.  There is also a purpose behind large technology companies or corporate entities wanting to accumulate data for individuals.  They do it because they want to categorise individuals into groups and commodify them.  They want to make it easier to sell these groups to advertisers or people who believe such groups would be of interest to a particular market for a product they wish to sell.  We must be very conscious of the fact that this process of accumulating data for individuals and commodifying them into groups is having a very damaging effect on individualism.  It is something we need to recognise and discourage.  We need to constantly tell young and old people that they should formulate their own views and opinions based on their own intellectual assessments, rather than being told to do it or being malleable or impressionable while following a crowd.  Unfortunately, many people now make up their minds not only on political issues but sometimes even on personal choices based on how they see the group to which they have affiliated acting.  That should not be the case.  It was always the case in Ireland and around the world that people could have a variety of views, but, unfortunately, we are now seeing homogenous views among society's groups.  This is being used in a political context and around the world people's political views are sometimes formed because they believe the group to which they see themselves aligned in a data process has been identified as voting for or against some topic.  Individuals na&iuml;vely see themselves as being in favour of that topic.  Throughout history people have been impressionable and malleable, but, unfortunately, the technological revolution that has taken place with data makes that malleability even more apparent.  It is one of the major concerns I have about the entire practice of data accumulation and the commodification of data by individuals.<\/p> <p> I am sorry.  I did not realise I had gone on so long giving what was probably a boring lecture for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700038#LL00400","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523990100,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I have to say I am finding it quite interesting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700039#MM00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1523990100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  It is welcome that the Minister has identified that something will be done for Members of this House and other elected representatives.  Looking at the equivalent British legislation, we can see that they are going through a similar process with their Bill.  Some regulations have been included in it, not for the purpose of exempting politicians but recognising the very unique role politicians play in society.  If we do not stand up for the status of what we do, as politicians, we may as well give up being Members of the House.  We are not doing this to benefit ourselves but rather for the benefit of democracy.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that we can have all of the data protection laws in the world in place, but there will be a huge responsibility placed on the Data Protection Commissioner.  Fortunately, we have very many large technological companies in the country.  Notwithstanding my views about the threat posed to individualism, it is welcome that employment is provided by these large groups.  We need to recognise that the Data Protection Commissioner will have a major job to do as a result of the passing of the Bill and the extra responsibilities that will rest with the office.<\/p><p>The Data Protection Commissioner is going to have a huge job to do as a result of the passing of this Bill and the extra responsibilities that will rest on her.  We need to fund it properly.<\/p> <p> I am also pleased to hear the Minister say he has looked at the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  Much work was done on that committee on pre-legislative scrutiny.   We produced a number of recommendations.  One point that concerned me during the pre-legislative scrutiny, and this may provoke a wry smile from some people here, is that the law in respect of data protection will become a lawyer's holiday.  The last  thing we want is to have a situation where people can have their data infringed to a minor extent but a team of lawyers will advance a data protection claim which will result in not an enormous award of damages to the person whose data has been breached but it will be accompanied by correspondingly large legal bills.<\/p> <p> I also support the finding of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality recommending that fines be administered to public bodies in breach of new data protection legislation.  If fines are not imposed on public bodies, there is no real sanction.  The argument is that it is just a fine going from one public body to another.  However, in that case, no sanctions would ever be imposed on a public body.  We need to have a sanction in place.  It is not so much the actual payment of the fine that is significant, but the fact that the fine has been imposed, recognising the wrongdoing on the part of the public body.  I welcome that there is an entitlement to seek compensation.  In general, the courts to date have awarded small amount of damages in respect of data protection breaches.  Obviously, there may be examples of where large damages should be awarded.  In general, however, I think the damages awarded should be moderate.  That echoes the concern I have about the fact that we have to careful not to generate it into an industry where people can take class actions for breaches of data protection and the awarded damages will be minimal but the costs will be significant.<\/p> <p> I have gone on for long enough.  I and Fianna F&aacute;il will be co-operating with the Minister and the rest of the House in trying to ensure this is enacted.  We will probably be tabling our own amendments on Committee Stage and I welcome listening to the other contributors to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700039#MM00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523990700,"counter":409,"content":"<p>To follow on from Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's comments, I welcome the Data Protection Bill implementing the GDPR.  I will reflect on the origins of data protection in general for a moment.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan spoke of the rights of the individual.  It is important to note that data protection is not a technological aspect but a human rights issue.  Data protection has its origins in the many august institutions founded post the Second World War, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, UNCHR, and the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, later on.  It emanated from concerns about promoting peace and international co-operation and ensuring that the events of the Second World War would never happen again.  The state does not need to know someone's religious preferences, sexual orientation or other sensitive information about an individual which could be exploited in horrendous ways or indeed for purposes slightly less malign but with many other malevolent possibilities.<\/p><p>Data protection legislation and theory has advanced from those early fundamental concepts into the Internet age, through the age of the PC and into the age of social media.  Indeed, we had the Data Protection Commissioner, Ms Helen Dixon, and representatives from Facebook, before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment this afternoon talking about the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017.  They also spoke about these issues which remain relevant today.  I welcome the GDPR and this Bill coming before the House.  However, I think the fundamental concepts in the previous legislation, the five or six general principles, were fairly sound.  By being principle-based, they were easier to follow and implement because we had things like no more than is necessary, collect for the purpose consented to, and no more than for that purpose, etc.  Those broad principles served us well.  The GDPR is complex legislation.  It has been thought through in detail in Europe and now here.  However, it is fair to acknowledge the European Union, in particular as a driver of this, has been the gold standard in data protection and indeed the right to privacy in these areas to date.<\/p><p>Ireland is the home to much of Europe's data.  As many multinational corporations are based in Ireland, that means we are the data centre for European operations.  That in turn means that essentially most of the world's data that is not in the United States is controlled, managed and regulated out of Dublin.  In a sense this is a good thing and a great opportunity as Deputy Jim O'Callaghan said.  I refer to foreign direct investment, employment and technological advancement.  Being in proximity to that for our students and graduates is a fantastic thing and long may it continue.  However, it places strains on our regulatory officers, and the Data Protection Commissioner in particular.  In the committee this afternoon I asked her a question I will now put to the Minister and flag it to the House in general.  We saw a situation in the United Kingdom where the Information Commissioner's Office had to face the unedifying spectacle of appearing on national television announcing the seeking of a warrant to raid the Cambridge Analytica offices.  The warrant was, I think, eventually procured a week later.  Generally in matters of criminal investigation or evidence gathering, it is not a great start to give a week's notice to the office about to be raided.  It is not the way it is done.  I hope the powers and resources are available to the Data Protection Commissioner for the likes of dawn raid scenarios or any other scenarios of enforcement as may arise.  If they are not there, it is something we need to look at and incorporate into either this Bill or elsewhere because regulation is only effective with enforcement.  We have seen that in a number of sectors to date and this is no different.<\/p><p>On the Bill coming before us, we have heard it is important that fines are included.  I am glad that public bodies are no longer exempt.  That did not really make sense because the State is one of the largest controllers and processors of information overall.  Why should it be exempt?  That would seem to give <i>carte blanche<\/i>to ignore the rules and I am glad that has been addressed in the Seanad.  The impact on the small firms sector has been a source of concern.  Many are worried about the legislation because they understand it is onerous and complicated.  With good faith and the best will, they want to implement it but they are concerned they may not be able to.  I hope there is a degree of proportionality in respect of the introduction and early enforcement of that as firms do get up to speed.  It is important they be given some degree of understanding and support to get there.  Having said that, I think firms should not look at it as an entirely negative issue.  It is an opportunity for firms to differentiate themselves and it could become a marketing strategy that a firm was GDPR compliant and the first in its sector to be so.  They could turn it from a shield into a sword and become a positive.<\/p><p>If it unfortunate we are debating the legislation in the D&aacute;il for the first time with five weeks to D-Day.  It is less than five weeks.  I think it is four and a half weeks now.  Going back to the SME sector, I am aware of many firms in my constituency, and I am sure around the country, desperately trying to get up to speed and put in place training, regulation and audit regimes.  I spoke to some recently and I said we would be amending it; therefore, the fact that the Bill is still a work in progress and small firms are desperately trying to get up to speed is far from ideal.  I am not sure why it is only now, with four and half weeks to go, that we are getting to debate it in the D&aacute;il.  I know it has been through the Seanad in the past two weeks, but even at that, the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas started six or seven weeks out from the due date.  We knew this was coming for a couple of years.  I understand the Minister flagged that there was consultation with the committee and perhaps wider consultation.<\/p><p>However, it seems that in this House we have ended up with two parallel systems.  One is where the Government issues Bills which undergo deep and wide consultation, apparently, but much of it is unknown to us in the Houses of the Oireachtas and much of it is done privately behind the scenes in the Departments.  The other is where Private Members' Bills are introduced and then the Government criticises them for being introduced too quickly, but there is no other option.  We look forward to Committee and Report Stages being the place to thrash them out and indeed the scrutiny phase.  On one hand the Government criticises Opposition Deputies for introducing Private Members' Bills and doing so, as it describes it, rapidly, whereas in actual fact it is only the normal process.  On the other hand, if the Government delays introduction of a Bill to the Oireachtas until four and a half weeks before it is due to become law at European level, there is a difficultly with that.<\/p><p>There is much more I could say but I will conclude because we are out of time.  However, I do want to flag that I will be studying the Bill along with Deputy O'Callaghan and my colleagues and I am sure we will be bringing amendments forward on the next Stage.  I look forward to further engagement and discussion on the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700040#NN00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1523991300,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire.

D&eacute;anfaimid iarracht d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na deacrachta&iacute; sin tr&iacute; leasuithe a mholadh ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste.  This is significant, complex and lengthy legislation.  From our point of view there are still many concerns.  The Bill was improved on several fronts in the Seanad.  However, we still have significant concerns in respect of the legislation and if these concerns are not addressed we may not support the Bill at the final vote.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge the need to complete this work by 25 May but we have serious reservations relating to ministerial exemptions, potential inconsistencies with the general data protection regulation and several other areas.<\/p>  <p>  As has been outlined, the Bill partially emanates from the general data protection regulation.  The European Parliament, the European Council and European Commission have attempted to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals in the European Union through the regulation.  The GDPR is essentially a minimum standard expected of each member state on the threshold and rights afforded to citizens of member states and the data protection of individuals within those states.  More important, it supersedes domestic law.  We supported the GDPR in the European Parliament.  The principles behind it are good.  Where we divert from the GDPR is where the Bill runs into trouble.  As I have stated, this legislation has direct effect but some elements require legislation.  Some elements allow for a margin of appreciation or discretion in how jurisdictions apply the provisions, such as digital age of consent.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is far longer than it needs to be.  Deputy James Lawless made a point in reference to small and medium-sized enterprises and how the Bill could be amended in the context of the challenges they face.  However, the reality is that the GDPR will be the GDPR and it will have supremacy.  It will be European law and, therefore, it will be Irish law.  We should seek to ensure that where there are allowances left to member states, we make decisions on them.  Too much of this Bill attempts to adjust, make exceptions to or amend the principles and provisions of the GDPR.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is not fully in compliance with EU data retention law currently as of the Tele2 Sverige and Watson case.  Essentially, we have been in breach of EU law since 2016.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for the protection of data protection officers from the interference of a data controller who aims to suppress a release of information on the basis that despite its release being in the public interest it is not in the interest of the data controller for a variety of reasons.  We can imagine an employer or someone in a public body who may have an interest in the data protection officer not doing his or her job properly.  The lack of protections or avenues for addressing these concerns represents an oversight.  This flaw was raised in the Seanad.  Nevertheless, it is something that can be provided for.  The Minister has informed us that the general law covers this, but it would be beneficial and necessary for specific protections and procedures to be explicitly stated and put in place in that context.<\/p>  <p>  The manner of the drafting of this Bill is not ideal or clear.  After the passing of the Bill there will be need to consult three Acts, the data protection regulation and any other relevant European instruments in order to be aware of the legal position.  It would be far clearer, better and more comprehensible for the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1998 to 2003 to be consolidated into this Bill and for those Acts to be repealed.  Deputy O'Callaghan has identified the potential for significant confusion and litigation.  While such a move is no longer feasible at this stage before the coming into force of the GDPR, the Minister should consider consolidating data protection legislation as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  One important change made in the Seanad was proposed by my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues.  The amendment required transparency and required the Data Protection Commissioner to conduct an impact assessment where the Minister of the day decides to involve public interest to bypass consent.  The basis of the amendment was that the ministerial exceptions in this legislation are too broad.  That was the reason we put in place the safeguard.  We remain concerned but we believe the amendment must be retained as a safeguard.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Minister has accepted that public bodies should be open to being fined.  That is welcome and important.  This was a flaw with the original Bill but it is welcome that the Minister has taken the point on board.  It is important there is an incentive for compliance, including for public bodies.  It is welcome that this has been taken on board.  The concern was shared by many.<\/p>  <p>  The Seanad held a comprehensive debate on this Bill.  I commend Senators on their work, including my colleague, Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile, and Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, who made a significant contribution across a wide range of amendments.  Despite their best efforts I still have misgivings.  In general, our concerns relate to the far-reaching exemptions and discretion.  We are also concerned that the protection for data protection officers from the interference of a data controller who aims to suppress the release of information is inadequate - I addressed this point earlier.<\/p>  <p>  There is potential for a lack of legislative clarity due to the potential contradictions between this legislation and the GDPR.  I am concerned about section 45, which I believe may not be fully in compliance with article 9 of the GDPR.  Article 9(1) states: \"Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.\"  The expression \"shall be prohibited\" is the key phrase.  I understand there are exemptions under article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR.  However, my party believes that the relevant section in the Bill does not fit the definition of the exemptions outlined in the GDPR.  I do not believe, therefore, that the Bill is in compliance with article 9.  This is the basis for our significant concerns.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from being contrary to the GDPR, and by extension, European law, the Bill is ambiguous in a number of aspects and there may be several unintended loopholes.  This could lead to an infringement of rights in the context of data protection for citizens.  Such loopholes would leave us in a situation whereby Ireland could become a target for those who deal in micro-targeting and data harvesting due to inadequate regulation and oversight.  My interpretation is that the amendment to section 45 proposed on Report Stage in the Seanad fell short of what was required.  It was an improvement but, as I read it, the provision would allow a political party, organisation or data company of whatever kind to come to Ireland with the intention of compiling voter data or data on citizens for the purposes of an election or electoral purposes elsewhere.  This would be contrary to article 9.  Perhaps the Bill deals to some extent with data collected in this State for use in the State but I do not believe the extraterritorial issues have been adequately dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  The data breach relating to Cambridge Analytica has been discussed at great length.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan articulated well the advantages of modern information technology, as well as the dangers.  Even where it is legal, I imagine many would have reservations and misgivings about the scale of data gathering that occurs and the analysis and management of it.<\/p><p>I do not believe the legislation properly manages the prevention of the collection of data of those under the age of 18 years.  We should consider a ban on the micro-targeting of those under the age of 18 years, as well as banning their psychometric profiling.<\/p> <p> I have concerns about section 36.  I do not believe it is in compliance with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  It should be the same as it.  As with this and many of the other provisions, the GDPR, when it takes effect, will not only be European law but also Irish law.  It is an unusual European instrument in that it will largely have a direct effect, but it does allow some flexibility.  I do not know why the Department and the Minister have taken the approach of trying to spell out everything where it is not necessary to do so.<\/p> <p> Likewise, while section 38 has been improved by the introduction of the proportionality test, I am concerned that it is not necessarily in compliance with the Bara judgment.  As with many provisions in the section, the Department has adopted an approach of providing that something shall be lawful, with some exceptions, whereas the GDPR takes the approach of providing that something \"shall be prohibited\", with some exceptions.  That does matter and it is those differences and forms of language that will be examined by the courts in making decisions in cases in which there may be contradictions.<\/p> <p> Inserting section 38 appears to be the way the Department intends to legislate for the public services card.  I believe it knows - it has all but admitted it, as have other Departments - that the legal basis for demanding the public services card in exchange for services from the Government is effectively non-existent.  The Government is attempting, in what I believe is a cynical way, to shoehorn in this provision.  It is a very serious matter.  If there is to be a requirement to have a public services card and for the gathering of that kind of data in the management of public services, it should be the focus of a separate debate.  This is a general provision which is attempting to provide legislative cover where it was not provided previously without adequate safeguards, at the very least to require people to produce a public services card. <\/p> <p> The public interest is referred to as the safeguard for numerous exemptions provided for in the Bill.  There are more than 20 exceptions from the GDPR generally where the public interest is referred to, but the public interest is not properly defined or specified in the Bill.  It is much more specific in Article 9.2(g) of the GDPR which states the interferences with the public interest should \"...respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject\".  Given that the Minister has taken the approach of trying to put as much as possible into the legislation, which is questionable, it is unusual that some of the less specific points relate to the safeguards which have not made it into the legislation.<\/p> <p> I am also concerned that electoral activities under sections 45, 55 and 56 are not properly defined.  There is surely potentially ample room for challenge and query and for legal cases to be taken on the basis of a lack of clarity and a contradiction with the GDPR.<\/p> <p> Another gap in the Bill is that it does not include the provision in Article 81 that not-for-profit groups can bring actions on behalf of data subjects.  The regulation envisages a form of multi-party action akin to a class action, but that is not provided for in the Bill.  Our Multi-Party Actions Bill has passed pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  I hope it can proceed to Committee Stage at an early date and that the Minister can provide a money message to ensure it can be enacted as soon as possible.  It is relevant not only from a data protection point of view but also to a number of other areas.<\/p> <p> I referred to electoral activities.  Clearly, there is a need for a greater definition and greater clarity as to what is involved.  There is certainly the potential for disagreement on what electoral activity involves.  The Minister made reference to amendments that he was likely to bring forward on the operations of Deputies in their offices.  Their work in their constituency offices regularly involves making representations or inquiries on behalf of constituents.  It is unfortunate that people often believe the only way they can get satisfaction with respect to matters concerning public services is to go to a Deputy, whereas, by right, they should be able to seek out and achieve answers on such matters themselves, but that is another matter.  I do not believe there is anything in the GDPR that prevents this from happening.  I will carefully examine the amendments when they are brought forward as it is a role that needs to be carefully protected.  My understanding of the GDPR is that where such representations are likely to be made, it requires full and informed consent and good records to be kept.  There is nothing in it that prevents anyone from making representations.  I will examine the amendments, but I do not believe the GDPR in any way prevents it from happening.  If the Minister believes it does, that should be stated.<\/p> <p> I made a point about incentives and fines.  Recital 149 of the GDPR allows member states to penalise companies that break data protection law with a clawback of the profits obtained through misbehaviour.  That would mean that those acting outside the law, intentionally or otherwise, would be deterred from taking an action that could see them profit financially, even in an illegal way.  That is something the Government should consider.  It is not something that has been considered up to now.  It is one of the areas in which the EU institutions have allowed flexibility.  I do not believe the Minister has addressed it thus far in this debate, the debate in the Seanad or elsewhere.  It would be a significant deterrent to companies to misbehave.  The examples are all around us.  We heard at a joint committee this week that the potential for the misuse and exploitation of data was very clear.  The Government should consider this.  We will bring forward amendments in that regard.  If companies are going to exploit, undermine and abuse data and profit from them, why should they, when caught, not be penalised for it through a clawback of their profits?  It is eminently logical and sensible and right.<\/p> <p> I have a concern about this legislation in the context of Brexit.  When the United Kingdom becomes a third country after Brexit, for the purposes of legal certainty in the GDPR, the European Union and its institutions will require an adequacy decision from the United Kingdom.  The Government has stated thus far that it is confident that will be achieved and not present difficulties.  However, Jan Philipp Albrecht, the European Parliament's rapporteur for the GDPR, has expressed doubts about whether the United Kingdom could obtain adequacy, as he has said there would be fewer safeguards for intelligence services in the United Kingdom than in the United States.  That is a matter of enormous seriousness, given the Border, the great concern in this state about Brexit across a wide range of areas and the fact that there are a number of areas in which data may need to be transferred between various authorities in the North and the South with the usual safeguards.  However, if the United Kingdom cannot obtain an adequacy statement, that will present very significant problems for this state.  Will the Minister provide greater clarity on this issue, on whether there will be an adequacy statement and whether it will be achieved immediately?  We need to inquire of the European Parliament's rapporteur to a greater extent why he believes there may be difficulties in that regard.  It is extremely serious and an implication of Brexit that has not been properly explored up to now, either here or in London.  <\/p> <p> We will approach this legislation on the basis of critical engagement.  We will support positive amendments.  However, we are very concerned about the level of ministerial exceptions, the inconsistencies with the GDPR and the potential for a lack of legal clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700041#OO00100","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523992500,"counter":412,"content":"<p>The first issue I wish to raise relates to the complexity of the data protection code.  In Ireland we have chosen to retain most of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, although we will in the future apply them only to cases involving national security, defence or international relations.  For every other case, we will have the new EU data protection regulation which has 173 recitals and 99 articles.  We will also have this implementing Bill which has 165 sections and three Schedules.  The Bill and the regulation will have to be read side by side.<\/p>  <p>  Data protection compliance is as pervasive an issue in modern society as tax compliance and the code is becoming as complex, attracting its own cohort of professional advisers who are needed to explain all of it to those of us who must comply with it.  The rules do not just apply to the Mark Zuckerbergs and Denis O'Briens of this world.  The reality is that every one of us who has even a basic mobile phone that stores names and numbers is a data controller in the eyes of the law.  Years ago the code was extended to apply to manual as well as electronic records.  The rules will not apply to what are called \"purely personal or household activities\", but if someone has any name or number on his or her phone that he or she no longer needs for personal or household activities, strictly this law will apply to that person and he or she will be in breach of it.  I wonder how many citizens are aware of this.<\/p>  <p>  An example of the complexity are the rules relating to children.  First, there is the so-called digital age of consent.  This is the age at which a child has the capacity to consent to the processing of personal data by the provider of an \"information society service\".  The regulation deals with personal data, data that identify or are about an individual person and include names, addresses, dates of birth and anything that a person shares on social media such his or her preferences, status updates and, in many cases, private conversations over messaging apps, among other elements.<\/p>  <p>  A key issue in the GDPR involves the notion of profiling.  Profiling is essentially about using algorithms, data analytics and artificial intelligence to predict what a person might like, what his or her fears might be, what his or her biases might be, what advertisements he or she would like to see and to what messages he or she would respond well.  While this all sounds of little consequence, recent scandals such as those involving Cambridge Analytica show that profiling is an extremely powerful tool and can be used to undermine democracy and manipulate ordinary citizens.  The tools used to profile users are complex computer algorithms that use machine learning, data analytics and artificial intelligence.  A major question in the context of data protection is whether the typical user of any online platform on which one shares data actually has a good enough understanding of how these algorithms work and what the consequences of sharing data that are fed to them might be.<\/p>  <p>  Before proceeding, I acknowledge the work of people like Professor Barry O'Sullivan, to whom I have deferred on this matter as a guide on its technical elements.  Professor O'Sullivan who is a professor of computer science at University College Cork highlighted to me that an important point to remember was that the Internet was designed as a democratic environment in which all users were treated and regarded equally.  As a consequence, no special allowance is made for children online, but they do deserve special attention.<\/p>  <p>  There has been considerable debate in the Houses on the digital age of consent.  It is Professor O'Sullivan's contention, as an expert in the field, that the digital age of consent is not about when children can go online, use devices, etc.; rather, it only relates to situations where the processing of the personal data of a child is performed.  The Bill sets the Irish digital age of consent at the lowest possible age - 13 years - but do we believe a child of 13 is able to understand the power of algorithmic profiling?  Do we believe children understand how their actions online influence the adverts that they see or the content suggested to them?  The answer is surely not.  Of course, one can easily make this argument against 16 year olds also, but we should err on the side of caution and set the digital age of consent at the upper end of the allowed age band, that being, 16 years.  Doing so would keep Ireland in line with Germany, the Netherlands, France and others that have best-in-the-class approaches to protecting children online.  A digital age of consent lower than 16 years is out of line with the age of consent for other matters, for instance, giving consent for health procedures.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that parents have the power to give consent for young children, which a digital age of consent of 16 years would provide.  Parents need to be in a position to parent their children, not to be excluded in this instance at the age of 13 years.  Advocates for a digital age of consent of 13 years might argue that children have a right to a voice online and a right to participation.  No one is arguing against this.  However, the digital age of consent only applies when their personal data are being gathered and processed.  The argument should be about providing children under the digital age of consent with platforms that do not exploit their personal data as a condition of their use.  This is particularly important for vulnerable younger children who should not have to rely on parental consent.  The issue in this instance becomes the provision of safe places online that protect their anonymity and platforms that do not profile them on the basis of personal data.  Relying on commercial platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others to provide such safe places or to attempt to use them as such puts vulnerable children at risk.  Such risks can arise from the unintentional breach of their anonymity, their targeting through advertising and marketing campaigns based on their interactions online and the potential exposure to individuals online who might not have their best interests at heart.<\/p>  <p>  Many special interest groups and children's rights representatives have argued for a digital age of consent of 13 years.  Some of the arguments include the question of how we should support children whose parents are, for example, abusive and, therefore, cannot be relied on to give consent; the need for a child in care to have access to his or her birth family, other family members and friends where it is not clear who has the power of parental consent; and those children who need access to support and preventive services.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that it is dangerous to rely on social media platforms to provide a mechanism for vulnerable or at-risk children to network with like-minded children.  First, the existence of these children on such platforms is often easy to discover by a parent.  For example, if the child and the parent use phones to access Facebook and each has the mobile number of the other on his or her phone, Facebook can recommend each of them as a possible friend to the other.  In other words, the anonymity of the child is not protected, as has been argued on social media sites.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the closed groups might themselves be dangerous since predatory individuals might lurk in them to befriend vulnerable children.<\/p><p>The solution that must be provided to support the children of abusive parents is not standard social media companies but platforms that are safe and that do not process personal data, which would make them exempt from the digital age of consent.  Who has parental responsibility for the child is something that should be clarified in the Data Protection Bill 2018.  For example, such consent could be given by the person or entity that has guardianship of the child.  This is something the Bill needs to include and that can easily be solved.  <\/p> <p> We have to acknowledge the complexity of the world in which children live.  In this party we take the view that we should err on the side of caution and that the most appropriate digital age of consent is 16 years.<\/p> <p> The regulation defines an information society service as a service normally provided for remuneration at a distance by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of the service.  It includes services that are not directly remunerated by those who receive them, if they represent an economic activity.  Google search, as an obvious example, falls within the definition of an information society service.  The Government has decided to set at 13 years the age at which a child can consent to the processing of his or her personal data in connection with an offer from an information society service.  I note that a Seanad amendment provides for a review of this age limit after three years.  However, the Bill contains provisions relating to codes of conduct for the protection of children who, for this purpose, are all persons under 18 years of age.  We will have 13 year olds with the capacity to sign away their personal data, even though for the next five years of their lives they will be the subject of special protective codes because in the eyes of the law they are still children.  It is a contradiction in terms.  <\/p> <p> On top of this, we have to incorporate the common law rules relating to children and contracts.  As I see it, these rules have not been displaced or amended by the Bill.  Article 8 of the regulation specifically states its provisions \"shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child\".  What is the position on this apparent contradiction?  The digital age of consent is not about a child&rsquo;s general capacity to enter into a contract; it is solely about his or her capacity to consent to the processing of personal data.  It does not affect the general law of Ireland on the validity or effect of a contract with a child or so it states.  As I said, under Irish common law, an individual does not have full capacity to make a contract until he or she is 18 years of age.  There is an exception for the sale to a minor of what the law calls \"necessaries\".  If these common law rules are left in place and unamended, it seems that the outcome will be that a minor will have the capacity at 13 years to consent to the processing of his or her personal data but may not have capacity to enter the substantive contract in question on the grounds that it is not a contract for a \"necessary\".  Whether the contract is for a necessary entirely depends on a court&rsquo;s views on the contract in question and, in particular, the goods or services in question and the minor&rsquo;s need for them.  If that is so, in such a case the contract will be unenforceable against the minor such that, for example, any debt accruing will not be recoverable.  My point is not so much about whether these are good or bad rules.  My question is whether it is an improvement to have two sets of rules that can conflict with each other and which cease to apply at different ages.  That is the nub of what I am saying.  <\/p> <p> I will speak briefly about electoral activities.  Following the Cambridge Analytica saga, the mass manipulation of personal data banks for electoral and referendum purposes has attracted a great deal of interest and comment.  The Minister responded in the Seanad with amendments to section 45.  The section now provides that, as an exception to a general prohibition, the processing of personal data revealing political opinions is lawful where it is carried out in the course of electoral activities in the State by a political party or candidate or a referendum commission.  I wonder if this tightly drafted exception has missed the point.  As I understand it, Cambridge Analytica is not accused of processing personal data that revealed political opinions.  It is accused of amassing data from Internet usage that enables it to compile a crude psychological profile of an individual in order to assist an advertiser in deciding how to shape a political message that would specially appeal to that individual, a custom designed message that would not be seen by the broad mass of voters.  If that is correct, I do not see how section 45 would apply to these activities at all.  The section, as amended, does seem broad enough to cover political canvassing and the marking of the register, but, as the Minister seemed to admit in the Seanad, it is not a form of exemption envisaged by the regulation.  In other words, there does not seem to be a specific provision of the regulation that enables the Oireachtas to carve out an exception enabling the processing of political opinions for electoral purposes.  The best the Minister can point to is Recital (56) which states \"Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions\" and so forth.  I note that the Minister has said he intends to bring forward an amendment.  I do not know if it will speak specifically to that issue.  I am hopeful it will.  We are putting him on notice that it is our intention to speak to this issue further on Committee Stage.  <\/p> <p> We in this House and the upper House, councillors and every elected representative in the country are not always electioneering.  We aim to always be ready for an election.  In the interim, we act as a citizens advice bureau and social workers, legal advisers, advocates and facilitators.  We explain and, to some extent, humanise the bureaucracy of the State on behalf of our constituents.  This daily routine of our lives has nothing to do with section 45.  It is not electoral activity and does not involve processing data on political opinions, but in this process we compile varied and detailed files which, of their nature, are full of personal information, much of which is very sensitive.  When elections are held, we contact the people in question and remind them of all the occasions on which we engaged with them in the preceding years.  There is nothing underhand about this.  It would be astonishing if we did not do it, but is it legal to do so?  <\/p> <p> Sections 55 and 56 of the Bill seem to have been designed to override the general provisions of Article 21 of the regulation.  That article gives an individual the right to object to the processing of his or her personal data.  The two sections of the Bill state this right does not apply to direct mailing or data processing carried out in the course of electoral activities.  I am entirely unclear on whether this covers direct mailing during an election from a database compiled outside election time and which is compiled from constituency clinic cases.  There is a need for clarity in that regard because it goes to the heart of what we do.  If no clarity is provided, we are in an existential crisis.  If, for example, we are obliged under the general rules not to retain constituent data for longer than is necessary to deal with a clinic case, how would we have the wherewithal to generate any direct mailing list at election time?  I can well appreciate that the law should apply to our activities and the information we amass and keep, but I cannot help wondering, having regard to our own activities, how well we and, by extension, the rest of the country will, in practice, comply with the detail of the rules we are about to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041700043#QQ00100","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523993700,"counter":414,"content":"<p>The reason I am a socialist and believe capitalism needs to be replaced with a system that has a different set of values is that in its essence capitalism turns everything into a commodity from which someone can profit.  As he or she accumulates that profit, he or she gains more and more power over society.  When the first critiques of the pernicious logic of commodification and profit at the heart of how capitalism operates were developed by people like Marx, they talked about the commodification of raw materials, goods and services and the profits accumulated by the owners of these resources, factories, small businesses, landholdings and so on.  Even 200 years ago Marx understood the logic was relentless, that the process of commodification would reach into every single aspect of human existence and the natural world and that slowly but surely everything would be commodified and made subject to the cash nexus.  In fairness to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, perhaps slightly surprisingly, he alluded to this and was absolutely right.  That is where we have got to with the digital or information technology revolution.  I do not think even Marx could have understood just how far-reaching the process would be in commodifying every aspect of our existence, down to genetics, with the genetic profiling of individuals, categories of people and so on.  The digital revolution has facilitated the process of commodification to an absolutely extraordinary degree.<\/p><p>The beneficiaries of the technological process, the owners of the information or the technology that amasses and controls that information on us accumulate levels of wealth parallel to their accumulation of enormous stores of information on us as human beings and individuals and now dominate the economy and the globe like colossi.

That matter is being investigated.  Whether he is guilty will be adjudicated on by the courts.  I am simply pointing out that that level of control and wealth gives people that access.  Will the legislation we are bringing forward to protect data, in this case emails, if people are found guilty of the very serious charges levelled against Mr. Denis O'Brien, result in the police being sent for or will there be administrative sanctions?  That is important because there is a parallel system of justice when it comes to these matters.  It works in financial areas where, if someone is found guilty of engaging in white collar crime, the Central Bank imposes administrative sanctions and the person concerned is then immune from criminal sanctions.  Will this legislation ensure people who are found guilty will be jailed, if, for example, as in this case, the courts adjudicate that there was illegal access of journalists' data?  Will the police be sent in or will there be administrative sanctions?  I want people who turn out to be guilty of committing that kind of crime, not just in this case but any case, to go to jail.  They are doing exactly the same as someone who breaks into a house and burgles it.  It should be treated as a criminal offence.  There should not be two laws, whereby there are administrative sanctions for the corporate or financial sector or the owners of big digital corporations who have a lot of information on us and inappropriately allow our emails to be given to others, without our permission.  They should be jailed.  There should be dawn raids to arrest them.  They should be subject to the same criminal sanctions as those guilty of common or garden criminal actions or theft.
