From the outset it seemed clear that it would not work.  Although it was a key project, it led to serious hardship on students.

The INTO also said that the current system, while not perfect, ensured that children got access to resource teaching in a timely fashion.  The union also said that parents should view the NCSE report through the lens of another potential cutback which would reduce resources for teachers while increasing paperwork and bureaucracy.

One was regarding children with Down's Syndrome, about whom the Minister asked the NCSE to advise.  There are approximately 30 such children per year, as the Minister knows.  If they are diagnosed as mild on the intellectual disability spectrum rather than moderate they do not have automatic access to resource teaching hours.  These children will enter the system this September, and since there will be a time lag involved in bringing about any proposals the Minister has to change the way resource hours are allocated, a decision is urgent for them.  Will the Minister now decide for this September to allocate specific resource teaching hours to those children with Down's Syndrome who are diagnosed as having mild intellectual disability?<\/p><p>  There will be an increase in September in the number of children going through our primary school system.  The Minister is increasing the number of mainstream teachers by 450 to meet that demand so the pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, does not have to be increased as a result of those additional children coming in.  However he is not increasing the number of special needs assistants and resource teachers in the system to match that.  There will have to be a reduction somewhere along the line for those who have special needs.  That is very unfair.  Those who have the greatest needs are suffering as a result of the way the Minister is approaching the finances of the Department on this.

He stated it is not the final Bill, it is not the new law and is a preliminary document.  The next morning, less than 12 hours later, during an interview on national radio the Chairman explicitly stated provision will be made in the Bill for a woman to obtain an abortion on the grounds of risk of suicide during pregnancy.  This is a deeply conflicting state of affairs and shows the Chairman had already decided to ignore the testimony of those psychiatrists and legal experts who have demonstrated such a provision is contrary to the best medical and legal practice.  Such comments confirm to those of us who oppose the main thrust of the Bill that this process of so-called investigation had been marked by political expediency from the outset and was never serious in its intention to objectively examine the heads of the Bill.<\/p><p>  Given that the Chairman of the Oireachtas committee acknowledged the purpose of the hearings was as a pre-legislative consultative process to facilitate further consideration when drafting the Bill, will the Taoiseach agree it is very worrying that the Chairman could, less than 24 hours later, undermine this very statement by laying out in the national media very specific elements which he states will be in the Bill regardless?

As the Deputy is aware, the Chairman of the committee does not prepare the Bill.  The purpose of the hearings was to have reflection, analysis, views and a consideration of the heads of the Bill that were approved by Government.  The heads of the Bill were based on a number of important principles, first, to provide legal clarity on the circumstances where a medical termination is possible where there is a real and substantial risk to the life as opposed to the health of the mother.  That is required by the European Court of Human Rights' judgment in the A, B and C case.  Second, the legislation, which is currently being prepared, will remain strictly within the parameters of the Constitution and the Supreme Court judgment in the X case.  It will cover existing constitutional rights only, as I have said on many occasions, and it will not create any new rights.   The third principle is that the equal right to life of the unborn will be upheld.  The obligation on the medical profession to save both lives, where that is possible, is quite clear and will be confirmed.  The medical termination of a pregnancy can only be permitted in situations where the doctors involved in the assessment process have unanimously certified that it is the only treatment that will save a woman's life by averting a real and substantial threat to her life.  The fourth principle was that because of the subjective nature of the assessment of suicide risk, the legislation will provide for a demonstrably more rigorous process of assessment in such cases.<\/p><p>  The Bill is now being worked upon and when it is prepared, the Minister for Health will bring it before the Government.  Assuming the Government accepts it or changes it, it will then be sent off in the normal way to the committee for Committee Stage, which will be followed by Report and Final Stages.  It will therefore stay within those parameters and principles only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800020#S00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1369753800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.

On the Cosma case reading of the X case test, head 4 would fail to meet the necessary standards because it does not require evidence of a treatment plan or consideration of other means of avoiding the risk to life and because it does not take into account, as the Minister insisted we should, the public policy arguments that are relevant in addressing claims of suicidality.<\/p><p>  Will the Taoiseach undertake to review the myth that we are legally compelled to legislate on foot of the X case?

Obviously, there will be ample opportunity for Members of the House to have further discussions and views on the Bill when it is prepared, presented to Cabinet and comes back to the D&aacute;il and the committee for further detailed scrutiny and analysis.

How will the Haddington Road agreement impact, if at all, on people who are working part-time within the Department of the Taoiseach?  Will those who are working part-time work even less, or will the options for flexitime or short-time working be eliminated altogether?  It seems that in some quarters of the public service, management is saying that it is unable to manage the challenges of work-sharing patterns.  We would all be loath to see the pattern of work-sharing being withdrawn.  How does the Government view the issue of work-sharing and how family-friendly policies are reflected at the very top of the public service, including the Department of the Taoiseach?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800020#S01400","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1369753800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>The Government welcomes the Haddington Road proposals.

While this is a welcome development, all of the evidence to date is that it has made absolutely no difference to those who are being appointed to serve on boards.  The main development is Ministers, in conjunction with the Taoiseach, are getting the people they would appoint anyway to put their CV through the State's appointments commission.  It seems that many of the people who were appointed previously are being reappointed which, thankfully, would indicate the Government sees that many of the people appointed in the past had merit.<\/p><p>  Can the Taoiseach tell us if he will undertake a review of the plethora of State boards we have across the country to indicate the extent to which these boards are being effective, whether they are doing the job they were appointed to do and if they have the correct skillsets in place?  It is all very well to appoint them, and one can perhaps to some extent point to some improvement in the process of appointment, albeit that many of them still have very strong political connections.  Having political connections is not a bad thing, a sin or something we should hold up to ridicule, but are they doing the job they are charged with doing effectively?  What systems for monitoring the effectiveness of these bodies has the Taoiseach put in place or does he intend putting in place in the period ahead?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800021#T00725","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1369754400,"counter":237,"content":"<p>This is a small country and most people have a political record of one description or another.  That does not mean it should be the only criterion that should apply to appointments to boards.  Under previous administrations there was no process at all for public involvement in board appointments.  Before this Government took up office, in the last few days of that regime, a couple of hundred people were appointed to different boards.  It has been opened up for the first time ever.  Every Department is required to advertise vacancies on their own websites.  That enables members of the public to come forward and make their views and expertise known.  While Ministers are not confined to that list, it has greatly widened the opportunity and the pool of people from whom appointees can be chosen.  Quite a considerable number of appointees have come through that process and those nominated for chairpersons of State boards must attend the relevant committee in advance of appointment to set out their vision, priorities and what they see they would bring to that board.  That also enhances the transparency of the board's process.<\/p><p>  We will keep that under review.  The relevance of what the Deputy raises is the question, rather than just making appointments, whether these are people who really have something to offer.  Are the boards doing the job for which they were set up?<\/p><p>The relevant question is not simply about which appointments are made but rather that they be of people who really have something to offer; and whether the boards are doing the job for which they were established.  I would assume that every Minister has an engagement with these boards and if they are not measuring up, that he or she will ensure something is done about it.  Under a number of appointments that were made through the public advertisement system, I note, for example, the chief executive of Fujitsu and the head of regulation and public policy at O2 Ireland were appointed to EirGrid.  The chair of Accenture Institute for Public Services Value and a member of the Smurfit Graduate School of Business, Vivienne Jupp, was appointed to the board of CIE.  The chairperson of Bord Bia is currently the chairman of Jacobs Fruitfield in Ireland.  Michael Carey has had senior positions in a number of multinational food companies in Ireland and the UK.  Also appointed to the board via the public process was Rhona Holland, who is a managing director of Global Intelligence, and formerly of PepsiCo.  These are people of exceptional calibre and quality who applied through that system.  It has brought about a change in the range, calibre, quality and speciality of people who can be appointed.<\/p><p> I encourage Ministers on a regular basis to see to it that the strategy and requirements of the boards are met and followed through and that a programme and plan are being followed in order that we can make progress.  From my point of view, I chair the Cabinet sub-committees.  People occasionally attend from agencies and are required to report on progress made in so far as implementing the programme for Government is concerned and on the planned strategies of the individual groups or organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800021#T00750","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369755000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I agree with the Taoiseach it is a very positive development that the chairs of these boards are now coming before Oireachtas committees and have an opportunity to set out for themselves in a clear way the vision they have for the development of their respective organisations in the years ahead, and also that the representatives of the political parties, and of none, have the opportunity through the Oireachtas committees to engage with these people, put questions to them and tease out the agenda they have.  That is entirely positive and I commend the Taoiseach on it.  It is a pity that initiative was not taken many years ago.<\/p><p>  I put it to the Taoiseach, however, that there still is considerable political influence at play in how people are appointed to these boards, irrespective of the involvement of the State Appointments Commission.  I am not convinced there is anything in particular wrong with that but there certainly is something wrong in suggesting that although it was wrong for the previous Administration to do this it is in some way right if this Administration proceeds to do the same.  It is alleged against the previous Government that a multiplicity of appointments was made in the interregnum between the completion of the term of the last Government and the beginning of the new Government, but that was nothing different to what had happened down through the generations.  The Taoiseach's party, when in Government, did it; so did the Labour Party.  The Taoiseach's Government will probably do it again when its current term of office finishes.<\/p><p>  I refer to the business of monitoring by committees of the efficacy of the appointed boards, which is of considerable importance.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, was in the Chamber until just a while ago and this is a matter we have been exploring over the course of Question Time.  I welcome that the Taoiseach is asking Ministers to monitor how the State boards are performing.  That is good, and fair enough.  The Taoiseach needs to go a step further, however.  These boards are of significant importance and the people who serve on them consider themselves privileged to be doing so.  I encourage the Taoiseach to encourage his Ministers to devise some kind of formal process of assessment so that the boards can understand they have a challenge to live up to and that the objectives set out by the chair when the chair meets with the Oireachtas committees are being assessed, at least on an annual basis.  In this way the boards can be given the challenge of working towards the agenda which has been set out for them and they can produce, to the Oireachtas, the Minister or whomsoever, annual reports that indicate the progress that been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800022#U00200","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1369755000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>The Deputy is aware that annual reports are produced by the boards in respect of the work programmes they follow.

At that point, one asks how board X or Y is doing, whether it is measuring up and whether the chairperson is able to do the job.  That is only normal practice.  These are very important positions and some are more sensitive than others.<\/p><p>  First, it is a duty of the chairperson of the board to see that it performs its function; second, it is the responsibility of the Minister involved to see that the board is driven and motivated to make a difference; third, the board must report to Oireachtas committees and to the public.  I hope those appointed fulfil their duty, that the requirements of the board are met, as determined by the Department and the Minister, in respect of whatever skill needs or ranges of experience are needed, and that they get on with the business of being effective, run their boards properly and make a difference - which is the reason they were appointed in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800022#U00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1369755000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his answer.

However, I note that an Oireachtas committee cannot prevent the appointment of a chairperson.  I made the case previously to the Taoiseach that a real democratic revolution would be in place if Oireachtas committees had the same status as committees on Capitol Hill have, which can actually stop such appointments.  Perhaps that is work for another day.<\/p><p>  Can the Taoiseach give us some sense, in respect of boards under his auspices or those of his Department, as to what percentage of board members are women?  Has the Government considered any additional measures to secure gender equality or advance that objective?

Most members are nominated by the individual organisations and, while one might like to have a balance as close as possible to 50-50, members of this board are nominated within academia or individual groupings.  I do not have that control over them.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is aware that a number of the appointments made to RTE are made, in part, by the Oireachtas committee which recommends names to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  That is a particular case where the committee is in a position to make nominations which the Minister subsequently approves.  I do not have data in respect of any particular Minister but I am sure if the Deputy tables parliamentary questions the Departments in question will be happy to supply answers to him.  In the case of NESC, the appointees are either academics or are nominated by individual unions or sectors.<\/p><p>The direct appointment from the Taoiseach's office is limited to public servants at assistant secretary level, as in this case.<\/p><p> Deputy Adams referred to the person in Dubai.  I understand from memory that the chairman made a substantial number of trips home at his own expense in order to deal with the questions arising in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  From what I know of him, he is an exceptionally competent person and I am glad the matter was resolved and that the drivers continue to do an excellent job.<\/p><p> In regard to Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l's question, the target of 40% representation for women was restated in the National Women's Strategy 2007-16.  The programme for Government commits to taking steps to ensure that all State boards comprise at least 40% representation of each gender.  Clearly, it is not possible to make appointments until vacancies arise.  In 2011, a proposal from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to advertise future vacancies on State boards on the website of the relevant Department was brought to Government and approved.  Public advertisements inviting these applications state that due regard will be given to Government policy on gender balance on State boards.  I have discussed on previous occasions the suitability of applicants for boards.  Composite data on women's participation in State boards in recent years indicate that approximately 34% of places on boards were held by women.  Progress towards achieving the gender target has been slow and significant deviations persist between Departments.  A pattern has emerged over the years whereby significant numbers of women are on boards with a caring focus but fewer are on boards with an economic or business focus.  I have outlined a number of examples of exceptional and competent people, including women in particular, who were appointed following public advertisements for important economic bodies.  I would like to see that continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800022#U00500","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Presidency Engagements","time":1369755600,"counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800023#V00150"},{"type":"question","time":1369755600,"counter":245,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[22126\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800023#V00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his plans to discuss concerns regarding the 26 million persons who are unemployed across Europe;

We discussed a range of major EU and Presidency agenda items including the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework, MFF; progress on banking union; the growth and jobs agenda, particularly the European Union's competitiveness; and developments in the euro area.  I also updated Minister Sch&auml;uble on economic developments in Ireland, progress made during the Irish Presidency and ambitions for the rest of our term.<\/p><p>  In relation to unemployment in the European Union, the compact for growth and jobs provides a clear framework for the key actions necessary to return our economies to sustainable growth and job creation.  We must ensure that it is implemented.  There will be a full review of progress on this vital work at the June meeting of the European Council, one year on from its adoption.<\/p><p>  The agenda for the June meeting of the European Council is being prepared in the normal way.  President Van Rompuy prepared an annotated draft agenda for consideration by last week's meeting of the General Affairs Council, which was chaired by the T&aacute;naiste.  The draft agenda includes conclusion of the European semester process for 2013, with the endorsement of country specific recommendations; assessment of implementation of the compact for growth and jobs; and progress on banking union.  The meeting will also consider President Van Rompuy's response to the four questions on economic and monetary union that he was asked to explore by the European Council in December.  The meeting will also consider developments in the EU's relations with strategic partners and on enlargement.  In due course, President Van Rompuy will circulate draft conclusions for the June European Council, which will be discussed by ambassadors in Brussels and subsequently by Ministers meeting at the June General Affairs Council, which the T&aacute;naiste will again chair.  In the usual manner, at each step in the process, Ireland will continue to input its views, as appropriate.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste and I met President Barroso and President Schulz in Brussels on 6 May to discuss the way forward on the MFF.  I did not distribute any papers.  We agreed to start formal negotiations between the Presidency, the Commission and the Parliament on the MFF, and in parallel to negotiate on the draft amending budget for 2013.  This was a problem for the Parliament.  An Irish Presidency compromise proposal on the draft amending budget was endorsed by the meeting of the ECOFIN Council earlier this month.  The proposal put on the table a first tranche of &euro;7.3 billion out of a total ceiling of &euro;11.2 billion.  We agreed that negotiations on the MFF would begin with a trialogue on 13 May to focus on matters of particular concern to the Parliament, as set out in its 13 March resolution on the MFF, namely, flexibility, a review clause, own resources and unity of the budget.  It was also agreed not to re-open the figures on administrative expenditure under heading five of the MFF and to speed up negotiations on the staff regulations, which are part of the MFF legislative package.  The first trialogue took place on 13 May.  A further trialogue, in which the T&aacute;naiste is participating, is taking place today.  The Irish Presidency aims to get political agreement on the MFF in June. <\/p><p>  I attended the meeting of the European Council which took place in Brussels last Wednesday.  As I will be making a statement to the House on this meeting tomorrow, I will merely give a short summary of its proceedings.  Discussions at the meeting focused on energy and on tax policy in the context of the EU's efforts to promote growth, jobs and competitiveness.  On energy, leaders agreed on a series of guidelines in four fields that should help boost competitiveness and assist us in responding to the challenges of high energy prices and cost.  These are urgent completion of a fully functioning and interconnected internal energy market; facilitation of the required investment in modern energy infrastructure; diversification of Europe's supplies; and enhanced energy efficiency.  In my intervention, I highlighted potential gains from energy efficiency.  Our discussion of tax policy had a particular focus on how to improve the efficiency of tax collection, and how best to tackle tax evasion and fraud.  This discussion largely reflected the agenda set by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and Commissioner &Scaron;emeta in their joint letter on tax issues.  There was a strong endorsement of our ambition as Presidency to reach agreement on VAT fraud counter-measures in June.  The Council also briefly discussed Syria, reaffirming its commitment to a political solution.  It adopted a decision to continue with the situation whereby each member state nominates a Commissioner.<\/p><p>  I wrote last week to each of my colleagues in the European Council as we enter the final stages of the Irish Presidency.  I thanked them for the excellent level of co-operation which we have received and highlighted a number of areas on which we would appreciate further support over the coming weeks.  To this end, I identified a range of files on which we hope to make progress, including measures that will boost employment and assist businesses to grow in the Single Market area, especially the digital single market.  I also highlighted the importance of concluding a draft negotiating mandate for the transatlantic trade and investment partnership between the EU and the US.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800023#V01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1369755600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach will be aware, public discontent with the EU is at its highest level ever and, with 27 million people unemployed, nobody believes it is taking serious or urgent action to help.  I have to mention the plague of youth unemployment, particularly in countries such as Greece and Spain, which have youth unemployment rates in excess of 50%.  The escape valve of emigration has kept the rate in Ireland at between 29.5% and 30.5%, although many of the people who are leaving Ireland are in fact the fathers of people in their mid to late 20s and are following their sons and daughters to places like Canada and Australia.<\/p><p>  We also looked at the enviable record of Malta, the Netherlands and Austria, where youth unemployment levels are particularly low.  We are used to hearing lists of what has been agreed at summits but it is increasingly clear that a difference exists between the statements and what is happening on the ground.<\/p><p>A good example of this is the proposal for project bonds agreed last year.  I ask the Taoiseach to explain the reason not one project bond has commenced.  We hear a great deal about the need for stimulus and all of us, including the Taoiseach, agree on the issue.  I could identify a number of major national projects for which project bonds would appear to be a potential solution but nothing seems to be happening.  <\/p><p> Will the Taoiseach explain the reason the agenda for last week's summit was so limited?  Why were no issues related to the major economic and financial issues of the moment discussed?

While I am conscious that other Deputies wish to speak, I would appreciate an opportunity to contribute again on this group of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800023#V01700","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369756200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Certainly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800024#W00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1369756200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l asked some good questions.  It is completely unacceptable that 28 million people are unemployed in the European Union.  No leader can be happy with that situation.  Depending on competitiveness and whether budgets are under control, the position as regards unemployment and employment will vary between countries.  I visited Spain and Portugal recently.  The rate of unemployment among young people in Spain is 57%, which is a horrendous problem and would be an enormous challenge for any prime minister.  Portugal also has a significant level of unemployment among young people and Greece announced last week that more than 50% of its young people are unemployed.  What is to be done?  One issue that has to be dealt with is the European Union budget for the period from 2014 until 2020, which is known as the multi-annual financial framework or MFF.  Under the current proposal, a &euro;6 billion fund has been allocated for addressing youth unemployment.  Following the European Council meeting, there is a direct focus on countries preparing effective programmes to provide opportunities for young people and front-loading this allocation, which they cannot access until the MFF has been agreed.  This is the purpose of the T&aacute;naiste's visit to Brussels today.  The Irish Presidency hopes to secure agreement on the multi-annual financial framework in the next couple of weeks.<\/p><p>  This is an urgent matter.  When one speaks to the Austrian Chancellor, Dutch Prime Minister or leaders of other countries which have low rates of unemployment, Germany for example, one finds that they have a structure in place for providing young people with training and apprenticeships.  In Austria, for instance, when a young person decides to leave the formal education system there is a structure in place for channelling him or her into an area that would be of interest and in which he or she would develop skills and so forth.  As a result, the level of youth unemployment in Austria is very low - perhaps 3%, 4% or 5% - whereas it is more than 30% here and we also have continuing emigration.  <\/p><p>  The agenda of last week's meeting was limited because the issues were of such importance.  When one starts to discuss issues with 27 different member states, all of them will have a view.  VAT fraud costs in the order of &euro;1 trillion each year and systems need to be put in place to deal with the problem.  The digital world has clearly moved ahead of the capacity of taxation systems to be able to catch all of these activities.  The issues of VAT fraud and tax evasion were the subject of significant discussion at the meeting.  Some comments were also made about multinational companies, which had implications for Ireland.  While individual companies were not mentioned, I was happy to clarify for the European Council that Ireland wants to be part of an international movement in setting new international codes of practice, whether this is the FATCA system in place in the United States or a new code that emerges globally.  This is an issue on which European leaders are now focused. <\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l made a point about energy, an important issue.  If we do not understand that energy prices are impacting on costs and, therefore, competitiveness, we will not be at the races.  I can testify that serious developments in the United States in the areas of fracking, shale gas and extra drilling have led to a decline in the country's energy dependency.  It is expected that the United States will become an energy exporter in the next decade and the country's energy costs have dropped by more than 30%, whereas they have increased by the same amount in Europe.  As a result of these developments, major investment can take place in the United States at fixed-term prices and with relatively low energy costs.  This has implications for jobs in Ireland and every other country.  European leaders must agree on an integrated, interconnected European grid for energy.  Ireland is at the end of this pipeline, which has significant implications for those who are working in manufacturing and industry.  Three quarters of the meeting was spent discussing energy and decisions were made on which we hope to follow through in June.<\/p><p>  The other issue discussed was on securing agreement in principle from countries that were very secretive about taxation and sharing information on tax matters.  As I stated, we need to recognise that the digital world has swiftly moved far ahead of the capacity of individual national tax systems to cater for it.  There is a need for a political focus from leaders to deal with this issue and this was accepted in principle by everyone who attended the meeting.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800024#W00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1369756200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Was the Taoiseach in any way uneasy, to say the least, when the European Council meeting moved on to a discussion on taxation?  I note from the communiqu&eacute; issued after the summit that measures to fight tax evasion, fraud, etc., were discussed &quot;in order to protect revenues and ensure public confidence in the fairness and effectiveness of tax systems.&quot;  Leaving aside the issue of fraud for the moment, did the Taoiseach give an explanation in regard to the Irish tax system and mounting evidence to show this State is used as a taxation haven by many multinational corporations?  I am not referring only to the hearings in the US Senate.  On the day before the summit, the London editor of The Irish Times, the respected journalist, Mark Hennessy, pointed out that Marks &amp;amp; Spencer accounts for goods sold and handled in the United Kingdom through Ireland to avail of the 12.5% tax rate, in other words, to avoid paying significant tax in Britain.  How can this mechanism be described as anything other than consistent with a tax haven?<\/p><p><br \/>  I put it to the Taoiseach that the State is also a tax funnel in that it acts as a facilitator for transfusing revenues that are raised around the world, including in the poorest countries, through the tax mechanisms available in this State and onto places such as Bermuda.  In the case of Apple, for example, which is a massive corporation, a tax mechanism known as the &quot;double Irish&quot; enabled the company to keep its international taxes to 3.2% of foreign profits in 2011, 2.2% in 2010 and single digits for the past half decade.  These figures are taken from <i>The New York Times<\/i>.  As a result of these mechanisms, the Apple corporation is sitting on $100 billion in accumulated profits.  <\/p><p> Is the Taoiseach aware that development agencies and organisations such as, for example, Christian Aid have studied this matter in some detail and that they very convincingly highlight how this type of tax avoidance and minimisation of tax liability - with the help of the Irish taxation system - is cheating people who live in the poorest countries on Earth of resources which should be used to develop their societies?  How can he stand over that type of activity, which is immoral by any standard?  What did he say at the EU summit in respect of this matter or did he say anything?  I am not asking him to just contradict some of the specific allegations that were made in the US Senator about a 2% deal, which, very possibly, are not correct.  However, the substance is correct, namely, that the double-Irish mechanism and other instruments facilitate a huge minimisation of massive levels of tax liability by these most powerful corporations and that people in this country and throughout the world are thereby cheated of resources which could be used to develop their societies, create jobs and attract investment.  If such investment were forthcoming, it would be possible to ensure that some of the 26 million people throughout the EU who, tragically, are unemployed could get back to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800024#W00400","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369756800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>The discussion which took place at the European Council was constructive and positive in the sense of reflecting an understanding that the world has changed utterly in the way multinational companies do business in different jurisdictions.  From our perspective, I stated before I entered the meeting that if the matter arose, I would deal with any issues of transparency or accountability in respect of Irish tax law in so far as corporate tax rates are concerned.  I also stated that no special deals were done with any individual company and that this is because our rate of 12% has been set out in law.  The latter has been deemed to be an effective rate of 11.8% or 11.9% by the World Bank.<\/p><p>  The issue which arises relates to how to deal with this matter.  Clearly, it cannot be dealt with by any individual country.  That is why Ireland was the fourth country to sign up with the US in respect of the sharing of information.  Ireland has participated very strongly in the analysis carried out and group hearings held by the OECD.  Ireland wants to be at the forefront in the context of individual and collective decisions by countries to put in place a new international code in respect of tax.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and EU Commissioner &Scaron;emeta recently sent a joint letter to the Finance Ministers of the other 26 member states in which they outlined seven different areas where concrete action can be delivered in the short term.  Four of those have been adopted and significant progress has been made in respect of the others.<\/p><p>  Deputy Higgins will be aware of the OECD's four indicators in respect of what constitutes a tax haven, namely: having no taxes or only nominal taxes; a lack of transparency; an unwillingness to exchange information with the tax administrations of OECD member countries; and an absence of substantial activity in the country concerned.  It is clear that many of the multinationals which have been mentioned in the recent past employ substantial numbers of people - on high wages - in this country.  In addition, there is no question with regard to the substance or extent of activity in the Irish economy.  As already stated, this matter will not be resolved by an individual country.  However, it is being dealt with by the OECD - at European level - through the base erosion and profit-shifting process.  This is the appropriate mechanism and we fully support it.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to the hearings which took place in the US Senate.  The relevant report was clearly written to address concerns regarding the US taxation system as distinct from any other.  Its final sentence reads &quot;Congress can change those incentives by closing offshore tax loopholes and strengthening U.S. tax law&quot;.  This emphasises that the central issues addressed in the report are specific to US as opposed to Irish tax law.  While the report's central focus concerns perceived problems in the US tax system, it does contain some misleading and some inaccurate references to the Irish tax system.  As the Deputy pointed out, there are references in it to a special rate of less than 2% being negotiated with the Irish Government.  It is not possible to negotiate a particular rate in Ireland which deviates from the two main statutory rates of 12.5%, for trading income, and 25%, for non-trading income.  There are no special rates for particular companies or types of companies.  For trading companies, taxable profits are calculated under domestic rules which are based on internationally accepted principles that are themselves mainly influenced by the OECD.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also referred to the double-Irish mechanism.  The profits charged in Ireland reflect the functions, assets and risks that are located here by multinational groups.  Payments to non-resident companies represent the expected higher remuneration of extremely valuable assets owned outside the State.  Ireland could not, therefore, expect to retain the remuneration of these assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800025#X00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1369756800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>It facilitates tax evasion by them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800025#X00300","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1369756800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Our treatment of residence of companies for tax purposes, as determined by the location of management and control, was settled long before it could have any relevance to current international structures.

Of course, youth unemployment is a scourge.  Clearly, that is why the European Council, for the first time ever, put &euro;6 billion into the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.

There was a very strong view about that.  This is why it is important for us as the Presidency to view as critical getting the MFF through during this Presidency.  If it fails and we end up having to do annual budgets that take up three or four months and on which everyone cannot agree, at least the Council has made its decision.<\/p><p><br \/>  The European Parliament has to give its <i>imprimatur<\/i> to the budget, otherwise it cannot function.

I hope they can settle down at the trilogues over the next few days and get agreement on this because it would be very important to get it through.<\/p><p><br \/>  I might say that the draft amending budget - because there is a ceiling on the deficit of &euro;11.2 billion - is an important element of the work we have been doing.  The T&aacute;naiste and I went to meet President Barroso and President Schulz and got agreement on that.  It was pushed through by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, at ECOFIN for &euro;7.3 billion of a first tranche.  We hope to get the draft amending budget and the MFF through by July.  Obviously, the Parliament will want to wait until the back end of the year to see what bills come in from the Commission for payment by countries of whatever remains, some &euro;3.9 billion or whatever.<\/p><p><br \/>  Central to this is youth employment.  In our own country, we got an extra &euro;150 million put in for PEACE IV, which impacts, as the Deputy well knows, on young people in sensitive areas in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  The agriculture discussions are ongoing.  They are informal.  There is a fundamental principle of productivity.  If one decides to pay a flat rate per hectare, whether there is productivity or not, one takes away the motivation and the very high incentive level and the high standards that we have achieved in Ireland.  As there is a big divergence of opinion from eastern European countries to more developed countries in our agrisystem, which has an exceptionally high standard, what one does not want is a flat rate payment on a per hectare basis.  It takes out that productivity element.  For example, if one is running a 400 acre farm and a highly intensive dairy industry with very professional standards and someone is running 400 acres with very little activity, it would not be consistent with good agri practice to equate those levels of payment in the same way.  It may well be that the discussions will take some off the very top and put it onto the bottom because reference years are different and new farms move into the system.  One must retain the principle of productivity.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is very strong on that.<\/p><p><br \/>  As to dairy quotas going, there has been movement in the banks because of the purchase of land and arrangements for new leases.  If we do not produce extra, then some other country will.  This opportunity is there for young farmers who will drive, with a sense of motivation, this end of the industry.  That is why there is a backlog in the applications for agri courses and so on.  That is why Glanbia put its money where its mouth was in terms of south Kilkenny with a major investment, which will create 2,000 jobs on family farms from Cork up to the Deputy's own constituency.  I was very pleased to see last year that Kerry Group made its decision to invest &euro;100 million in Naas, which will become a magnet for new food innovation and research and development for years to come.  These are extraordinary developments by Irish companies.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is a big understanding in the agrisector of what is happening.  Yes, the fodder crisis is a difficulty and we will clearly have a problem again next year.  I have spoken to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about this and there will be an intention to run a scheme later this year with extra fertiliser driven to have more grass cut.  That farmers must now put in cattle in September-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800026#Y00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1369757400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800026#Y00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1369757400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>They have not gone out yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800026#Y00400","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1369757400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>-----means difficulties in terms of extra costs, feedstuffs and all the rest of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800026#Y00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1369757400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach, but I want to allow Deputy Boyd Barrett to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800026#Y00600","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1369757400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Healy-Rae.

Is it not a fact that he is trying to throw mud in the eyes of the public, Deputies and his European partners in a way that will do immense damage to the international reputation about which, as he has told us many times, he cares so much?  The facts are coming out.  As some of us have asserted for some time, as has become apparent to our European partners, as was put to the Taoiseach at the European Council meeting and as has been discussed in the US Senate, Ireland is a tax haven and is facilitating a staggering level of tax dodging by significantly wealthy multinationals.<\/p><p>  The latest evidence came today.  Abbott Laboratories Ireland Limited, a company registered in Ireland, made &euro;1.8 billion in profit but paid 0% in tax.  If it had paid 12.5%, we would have received &euro;235 million, almost as much as the Government is planning to take out of the pockets of public sector workers.  If Apple had paid 12.5%, we would have received more than &euro;2 billion for the Exchequer.  All we get, however, is sleight of hand whereby the Taoiseach claims that our rules are different because a company must be controlled and managed in Ireland.  With a nod and a wink, we have agreed this little trick with the multinationals.  Our light-touch corporate tax rules allow them to dodge billions or tens of billions of euro in corporate tax obligations at the expense of the taxpayer, who is being savaged by austerity, at the expense of tax fairness and tax justice across the world and at the expense of Ireland's international reputation.<\/p><p>  After what happened at the European Council meeting and the US Senate and given the emerging facts, does the Taoiseach not believe it is time to end the cover-up and to stop prostituting Ireland's tax system for the benefit of multinational corporations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800026#Y01300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1369757400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The Deputy is wrong.

It concerns an individual case in which I believe an injustice is being done, whereby a person's public service pension is erroneously being reduced.  While I would not normally raise an individual case, I do so for two reasons.  First, others in similar circumstances may now or in the future be similarly treated and second, I believe the existing injustice may now be compounded by the legislation Members are due to pass tomorrow and which will be discussed later this evening.<\/p><p>  In a nutshell, the pensioner concerned worked for more than 30 years in the private sector and during that time, accumulated a substantial pension fund.  Towards the end of his career, he transferred to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which is in the public service, and transferred his accumulated pension fund assets to the NTMA's pension fund.  The bottom line is that 62% of his pension now comes from his privately-purchased pension pot.  In other words, he paid into the NTMA scheme a sum agreed with the agency that allowed his agreed pension to be paid to him without any cost to the NTMA or to the State.  The public service pension reduction, PSPR, is targeted at pensions funded by the public purse but although almost two-thirds of this gentleman's pension is not funded by the public purse, it is all subject to the reduction.  He made prudent provision for his old age in good faith by purchasing these added years of service.  He could have kept his pension pot or cashed it in.  He could have spent it foolishly or could have put in a bank and saved it and now be earning interest from it.  However, he did what was advised by the NTMA when he went to work for that agency.  At present, &euro;22,929 is being deducted from his pension and is being paid to the State but only &euro;4,400 of that reduction is attributable to the NTMA or public service portion of his pension.  In short, &euro;18,524 is being deducted from the privately-funded portion of his pension and this appears to me to be an egregious injustice.<\/p><p>I understand that section 6 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 gave discretion to the Minister to write this kind of unintended consequence, and I assume it is an unintended consequence.

It is a matter which was the subject of a recent parliamentary question and I set out in my reply to that question the position regarding the public service pension reduction, PSPR.<\/p><p>Before addressing in detail the particular point raised by Deputy Mitchell, it is important to set out the context in which these measures are introduced.  As is clear to all citizens, there is a very serious crisis in the economy and a very serious deterioration in revenues into the State.  Ireland is availing of financial assistance programmes provided by the EU-IMF and has undertaken to meet spending targets set out in that regard.<\/p><p>In introducing the PSPR from 1 January 2011, the then Government effectively decided, in the context of the serious national budgetary position, that retired public service pensioners should make a contribution to the overall required fiscal adjustment.  This decision was taken having regard to the gap between the burden being borne by those currently in public service employment, where the pension related deduction, PRD, and the direct pay reduction were having an impact, and their retired counterparts.<\/p><p>The current Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill proposes limited further reductions to high value public service pensions.  That Bill is to be discussed later today.  It is one of a number of measures taken or proposed by the Government as part of our plans to restore stability to the public finances.  None of these measures were or are being adopted lightly but are considered necessary in view of the wide gap that has emerged between our income as a State and our expenditure, and our commitment to restore order to the public finances by reducing the general Government deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2015.<\/p><p>Any reduction in pension payments is a serious step.  However, the grave condition of the public finances and the threat to Ireland's economic well-being provide the context for such an exceptional measure.  I would note that the first &euro;12,000 of anybody's pension is exempt from the reduction and that the bands and rates of the reduction are progressively structured so that persons on lower pensions are proportionately less affected than those on higher pensions.<\/p><p>I would add that as recently as yesterday, I met representatives of the Alliance of Retired Public Servants to hear at first hand their concerns about the impact of pension reductions on the lives of public service pensioners.  As I indicated to them, I would genuinely wish economic circumstances were otherwise but the reality is the Government must continue to take all necessary steps to ensure the economic survival of the State, and this inevitably impacts across society.<\/p><p>I also informed the alliance representatives that it is my intention, as a matter of priority, to move towards reducing the burden of the public service pension reduction, with the initial focus on people in receipt of low pensions, at the earliest date economic progress permits.  I am very aware of how critical this matter is for pensioners and I intend to keep this matter under review to see when we can begin to take steps to reduce the burden on public service pensioners in particular.<\/p><p>On the particular question of whether identified portions or specific elements of public service pensions could be exempt from the PSPR, the long-standing norm in public service pension schemes is that service which is purchased or transferred-in is treated in the same way as ordinary accrued service for the purposes of calculating pension benefits initially and on an ongoing basis.  This parity of treatment also applies in respect of the exposure of pensions to the public service pension reduction.  Since its introduction on 1 January 2011, the PSPR has applied to affected public service pensions in an across-the-board fashion, with no distinction being made in respect of any part of a pension which derives from purchased or transferred service, and I do not have plans to change this arrangement.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1369759200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to respond to this matter.  I am disappointed with the response.  Nobody understands the situation facing the country more than me, and I fully appreciate the need for financial emergency measures, but given that they are extraordinary powers, they must be used judiciously and justly.  The proportion of the pension from the fund, which was privately accumulated, is so large relative to the portion of pension that comes from the State contributions, it makes this a special case.  I may not be explaining it properly but the pension pot that was transferred to the fund was actuarially determined to ensure there was no cost to the National Treasury Management Agency for that portion of pension that would later accrue.  In other words, there is no cost to the State or no reduction in terms of  what is due to the State.  I accept that the portion of pension that comes from the contributions - the NTMA - is fair game but the privately funded part, which was actuarially determined to ensure there was no additional cost to the State, should not be included.  This case will probably end up in the courts but the Minister might examine cases like this one where the majority of the fund comes from private sources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800029#BB00300","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1369759200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I fully appreciate the case being made by Deputy Mitchell, and it is a fair and reasonable one, but it is very difficult to disaggregate pensions into the proportion that is transferred-in.  As she is aware, because of the vulnerability of many private pensions, for example, in academia, most of them have now been transferred into the State and most of them are in deficit.  Should somebody have exempt a portion of their pension which they happened to have paid in before it was subsumed into the State pension, it would be extraordinarily difficult.  We cannot have individual cases.  We have to have a general application of a rule such as this one.  While I am mindful of what the Deputy has said, the general provision that has gone on always is that where the State takes on the payment of a pension, it is treated as if it was accrued through State contributions, regardless of what was brought into the equation.<\/p><p>  I will reflect further on what the Deputy has said.  As she will know, there is provision in section 6 of the existing legislation for individual anomalies to be addressed, and that provision has been replicated in the provisions I will bring before the House later this evening, which, if an anomalous situation arises, will allow me, as Minister, to make an order and an exemption.  That is an important provision to have.

The most expensive item for a child going to primary or secondary school is the schoolbooks.

Thanks to the article by Nicola Byrne in the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday<\/i>, we know that not only are we dealing with Irish companies that do not produce any accounts but that these companies are farming out the printing of the books to outside of Europe, having them printed at rock bottom prices.

Textbooks are a very important way in which students can be supported in their learning and the range and quality of textbooks has increased in recent years.<\/p><p>  Since taking up office, the Minister has attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  The Minister has met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks and to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.  The association responded positively to the Minister's approaches and agreed a voluntary code of practice among members.  The code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at substantial discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  All these developments are welcome.<\/p><p>  The Minister launched guidelines for developing textbook rental schemes in schools last January.  The guidelines provide practical advice to schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start book rental programmes. The publication of the guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department last year.  This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those who responded, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the community and comprehensive sector operated book rental schemes.  These results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country.<\/p><p>  I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the guidelines to introduce them.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  A special guide for parents has also been published to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  The Minister has been very clear in his support for book rental schemes.<\/p><p>  The Minister has protected the budget for school book grants at &euro;15 million over the past two years, despite economic pressures.

The bypass of the N80 on the eastern and western sides of the town of Portlaoise would mean that traffic, of which there is a high volume on this route from the south east, across the midlands and to the west, would not have to pass through the town of Portlaoise as it does at present.  It is very important for Portlaoise, for County Laois and the midlands, but also for the west.  The N80 connects the west with important ports to the east such as Waterford and Rosslare.  There are already 6 km of this route in place.  The 6 km, which have been constructed by Laois County Council, amount to nine tenths of it.  The remaining section of which I speak is almost 0.6 km.  Nine tenths of the infrastructure is in place and the last one tenth is needed.<\/p><p>  To date, it has cost the local authority in excess of &euro;13 million.  Often it is asked what development levies are used for; in County Laois, in the main, they have been used well.  Laois County Council has used them to get this vital piece of infrastructure in place.  The local authority has delivered magnificently.<\/p><p>  From a local point of view, it is an important piece of infrastructure for Portlaoise town.  There are two low rail bridges in the town and while safety measures and warning measures have been put in place, there is still the occasional bridge-strike when high lorries hit them.  It is important to get those high lorries away from the town completely.  High lorries are going through James Fintan Lalor Avenue, up through the middle of a shopping area where there are pedestrian crossings and other pedestrian facilities, and that needs to change.<\/p><p>  Also, in September next three new schools will open on a campus beside the orbital route and there will be traffic chaos.  The Gaelscoil, the local Church of Ireland school and the Educate Together school will open there in September.  In the following September, hopefully, the three schools for the parish, which will be amalgamated at Aghnaharna-Summerhill, will also open and we need this infrastructure to move traffic around the town.  It is vital.  The new schools opening in that area along with the existing facilities will put considerable pressure on the roads in the town, including the Timahoe Road, the Abbeyleix Road, the Stradbally road and the Dublin Road.<\/p><p>  From a national point of view, as I stated earlier, it is important to connect ports such as Rosslare with the midlands and the west.  If we are to improve the economy and competitiveness, we must improve regional connectivity.<\/p><p>  The northern orbital route which was the grand plan for Portlaoise - not to go to the east and to the west of the town but to build a completely new northern orbital - is not feasible because it is dependent on development levies from housing construction.  That will not now happen.  One would be looking at a cost of up to &euro;30 million to construct it.  The local representatives and local officials are realistic about this, and as a local Deputy I am realistic about it.  We are not banging down anyone's door looking for funding to construct a new orbital route.<\/p><p>  As I stated, the local authority has stepped up to the plate here.  The councillors, the local authority staff and the county manager have delivered magnificently.  They have put nine tenths of this infrastructure in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800031#DD00100","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1369760400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanley will have time for a supplementary point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800031#DD00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1369760400,"counter":423,"content":"<p>It is in the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800031#DD00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1369760400,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I am taking this Topical Issues matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.<\/p><p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants.<\/p><p>  There have been large reductions in roads expenditure over the past number of years and there will be further reductions in the next number of years.  In contrast with the figure for 2007, for example, when grants of &euro;607 million were made available towards regional and local roads, in 2013 these grants have fallen to &euro;350 million or almost half.  Given the current financial position, the main focus must be on the maintenance and repair of the roads in which we have already heavily invested and this will remain the position in the coming years.<\/p><p>  In this regard, it should be noted that the initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority.  In July of last year, local authorities were invited to submit applications for consideration for funding in 2013 under the specific improvement grants scheme.  Laois County Council applied for funding for 11 projects under this grant category but the Portlaoise southern circular road was not among the projects selected for funding in 2013.<\/p><p>  The specific improvement grants scheme is being suspended from 2014 onward in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work.  In lieu of the specific improvement grant programme, applications will be sought in mid-2013 for minor bridge repair works, which is a subset of the current specific grant programme, for 2014.  This is in line with focusing funding on road and bridge maintenance and strengthening.<\/p><p>  The reality of the funding position means that in all areas of activity priorities must be set.  Given the current financial position, it has been necessary to reduce the grant allocations for major new road schemes and for major realignment schemes.  The main focus must be on the maintenance and repair of roads and this will remain the position in the coming years.  The small amount of funding available for major schemes will focus on projects already under construction or to which the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is already committed.<\/p><p>  It is appreciated that many local authorities are trying to implement savings, but it is also important to re-iterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities such as Laois County Council in their spending in this area.  The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work required.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and local authorities are working closely to develop new more efficient ways of delivering the best outputs possible with the funding available to them.  Given the likely continued squeeze on Exchequer funding, this concentration on efficiency is essential to achieve the best outturns for the limited funding available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800031#DD00400","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1369760400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I recognise that funding for these projects has fallen from over &euro;600 million to &euro;350 million in the current year.

It used local resources and used them well.<\/p><p>  I take on board the Minister of State's point that the priority is to maintain what is there.  In the context of Portlaoise, and if the Department is to maintain what is there, significant damage is being done to the Timahoe Road, the Stradbally Road, the Abbeyleix Road and other roads in the town because this 600 m of road is not in place.  If this piece of infrastructure was in place, it would take a considerable burden of traffic off the other roads.<\/p><p>  I am informed that the total cost would come to a maximum of &euro;4.8 million.  Laois County Council has acquired one of the parcels of land.  It has already started that process in that the CPO has been approved for all lands concerned.  The remaining section, of almost 600 m, is the last piece of vital infrastructure.  It is the last piece of the jigsaw and would complete the N80 bypass, from the south east, right up across the midlands and into the west.  I am urging the Government in this regard.<\/p><p>  There was some talk in recent days - about which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who is seated beside the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, may know more - of some kind of stimulus package.  I recognise the Government must spend money carefully and I would not want to see money thrown around, but this would represent value for money.  I am reliably informed that Laois County Council would not come looking for the full &euro;4.8 million from the Government.  It would play its part and pull its weight by making an input locally.  If the Government is considering a list of capital projects, I ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who is beside the Minister of State, to ensure this vital piece of infrastructure is included.<\/p><p>  It is good that the cities were connected by motorways.  It was long overdue.  We must connect the regions by national secondary routes and we are a long way behind on it although that was the intention.

The Government has failed to raise the plight of these 17 teachers from Ireland who are owed salaries totalling up to &euro;200,000 by the ISM.  These teachers have recently criticised the Irish Government for continuing to facilitate the leaving certificate curriculum at the school despite the non-payment of their wages.<\/p><p>  The Tripoli-based International School of the Martyrs has offered the Irish syllabus and exam system since the mid-1990s.  It is the only school outside Ireland to offer the leaving certificate curriculum and exams, and two of Colonel Gadaffi's grandchildren once studied at the school.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are currently liaising with the Maltese authorities to facilitate the exams.  Many of the school's expatriate staff, including the 17 teachers from Ireland, fled Libya when the uprising against Colonel Gadaffi began in February 2011.  The co-educational school is now operating fully again, with 700 students enrolled, and more than 60 are registered to sit the leaving certificate this summer.<\/p><p>  In an e-mail sent on 25 April, Ms Martina Mannion of the Irish State Examinations Commission, SEC, told the school dean, Moftah Messei, and its principal, Ms Donna McPhee, that the issue of the outstanding salaries was &quot;an urgent matter&quot; which the commission wished to see resolved.  The school has not responded to the e-mail.  The school claims that Libyan restrictions on overseas money transfers introduced following the 2011 revolution are the cause of the non-payment of salaries to the Irish teachers.  Nevertheless, it appears the school had continued to pay the Department of Education and Skills the relevant fees to allow its students to sit the leaving certificate exams.  It was claimed by teachers at the school that they had previously been paid through a Maltese bank account.  The State Examinations Commission states it has no role in contractual issues between schools and their employees.  It has been indicated that the SEC has been informed by some former teachers in the ISM that there are outstanding contractual issues between their employers and themselves, and in order to be helpful to these former employees of the school, the SEC has brought the concerns to the attention of the school authorities.<\/p><p>  The school was established in the late 1950s to educate expatriate children whose parents worked in the oil sector and the diplomatic community.  It was called the oil companies school and it is still known as that by many people in Tripoli.  I urge the Minister to consider this most important issue, as 17 teachers - many of them young and out of training school - have loaned their expertise and training know-how to the school in Tripoli.  Not everybody would relish the challenge of teaching there but they did.  Unfortunately, they have yet to be paid for a period in which they were employed, so I urge the Minister to explore the possibility of some diplomatic initiative being taken on the matter.  The possibility of using diplomatic channels in this way should be explored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800032#EE00200","speaker":"945"},{"type":"speech","time":1369761000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who the House will appreciate is in Brussels today.  I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this issue, which is I know of great concern to the individuals involved and their families.<\/p><p>  I understand that the teachers' dispute with the International School of the Martyrs, ISM, in Tripoli has been ongoing for some two years now.  At issue is a sum of &euro;142,000 in unpaid salaries owed to 17 Irish nationals who were employed as teachers by the ISM in Tripoli, Libya.  Deputies will, of course, be aware that the ISM is the only educational institution outside of Ireland which offers the leaving certificate to its students, as Deputy Kirk correctly stated.  The teachers in question were employed directly by the ISM to teach the leaving certificate.  The unpaid salaries date back to the early months of 2011 when, due to the popular uprising and large-scale conflict which erupted in Libya at that time, the individuals concerned were either required to leave Libya or were unable to return there to complete their contracts for reasons of personal security.<\/p><p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was only made aware of this issue of unpaid salaries in early May.  Officials in the Department have discussed the matter with relevant officials in both the Department of Education and Skills and the State Examinations Commission.  I understand that the State Examinations Commission has already intervened directly with ISM some weeks ago requesting that the issue be resolved and that any sums outstanding to the teachers concerned be paid immediately and in full.  Ongoing contact at official level on the issue is being maintained between the two bodies.  It is obviously for the Department of Education and Skills and for the State Examinations Commission to set out their own position on this matter.  From the perspective of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, however, the sole concern and reason for involvement has been to offer any assistance to help achieve a resolution to this contractual dispute between 17 Irish nationals and the privately owned and operated International School of the Martyrs in Tripoli.<\/p><p>  At the T&aacute;naiste's direction, the Irish Embassy in Rome, which is also accredited to Libya, has now made direct representations to both the ISM and to the Libyan Government on this matter.  We have formally requested the assistance of the Libyan Foreign Ministry to ensure the outstanding contractual obligations and money owed to the Irish teachers by the ISM are fully met and paid.  Officials in the embassy in Rome have also spoken with the principal of the ISM and urged that this matter be resolved as speedily as possible and the outstanding moneys paid.  The ISM, for its part, has suggested that there are technical difficulties which prevent it at present from transferring the amounts owed and paying the teachers.  I understand that these difficulties relate to the much more stringent controls on large financial transfers which now apply in Libya since the fall of the Gadaffi regime.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste and the Government remain anxious that this issue be resolved as soon as possible and that the outstanding salaries be paid.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the embassy in Rome will continue its efforts to secure the assistance of the Libyan authorities and of the ISM in resolving this matter.  Libya is a country with which Ireland has traditionally enjoyed excellent bilateral relations.  There are strong historical and cultural links between the two countries and many Libyans have chosen to make Ireland their home and have made an important contribution to Irish society.  The Government remains strongly committed to developing our bilateral relations even further and to promoting greater co-operation in areas of mutual interest.  It is important to recall this context in considering this particular issue and the current efforts to resolve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800032#EE00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1369761000,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Howlin, for the comprehensive response.

The context is the continued priority given to the stabilisation of the public finances and to meeting the State's obligations with regard to the reduction of its deficit.<\/p><p>At this point, consolidation measures amounting to around &euro;28 billion, or over 17% of Ireland's estimated GDP in 2013, have been implemented since the crisis began.  This represents about 85% of the total consolidation required to get our finances back from the morass they were put into, in large part through the decisions made by the last Government.<\/p><p>As I have said elsewhere, the remaining effort may well feel like the hardest part - the last hundred yards are always the most difficult - but the scale of the challenge still faced by this Government and by the people of this country is large.  A continuing programme of fiscal consolidation, accompanied by structural reforms, must continue.  The fiscal parameters, while improving, do not provide any significant latitude to the current programme necessary to meet the general Government deficit target of less than 3% by 2015.  The Government's policy of restraint and prudent budgeting will have to continue if we are to get our finances into fit shape for future generations.<\/p><p>To meet Ireland's commitment on the deficit, the medium-term fiscal statement published in November last year indicated that, in addition to the overall consolidation of &euro;3.5 billion required for 2013, an additional &euro;3.1 billion in savings and revenue raising measures must be identified for 2014, and a further &euro;2 billion in 2015.<\/p><p>The public service pay and pensions bill at 36% of spending must, in the Government's view, make a proportionate contribution to the additional expenditure reduction identified as necessary over the three-year period.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1369762500,"counter":447,"content":"<p>We have identified that proportionate contribution as a further reduction of some &euro;1 billion, or 7%, in the cost of the pay and pensions bill.  Otherwise the existing significant burden of adjustment falling on services and social transfers rather than pay would be untenable.  In short, if we seek to exclude public service pay and pensions from further consolidation efforts, the burden must be borne elsewhere in public services.  I do not believe that is a sustainable proposition.<\/p><p>  This Government has always sought to ensure that the measures it takes are proportionate and fair, and that their impact on the most vulnerable in our society is mitigated as far as possible.  The measures set out in this legislation, and indeed the terms negotiated with the public service unions and associations and set out in the Haddington Road agreement, are in line with this model.  In that way, they are in sharp contrast to the measures taken by the previous Government.<\/p><p>  This is the fifth financial emergency measures legislative proposal that has come before the Oireachtas for consideration; three were introduced by the previous Government in 2009 and 2010.  Those Acts were introduced unilaterally and made provision for a reduction in the annual remuneration of public servants through a pension related reduction of &euro;1.35 billion and a reduction in remuneration of &euro;1 billion, and in 2010 a reduction to public service pensions in payment above &euro;12,000.  The previous measures introduced were of universal application to all public servants.  They were brought in unilaterally, in a vain attempt to halt the descent into insolvency of the country created by the disastrous fiscal and economic policies of the last Government.<\/p><p>  The approach of the Government today to secure further savings from the public service pay and pensions bill is markedly different from the approach employed by that Government in 2009.  First, this Government has ensured that, in the interests of equity, no public servant can stand aside from the necessary contribution.  A change to the Constitution was put to the people by way of referendum to permit the pay of the Judiciary to be reduced in line with the reductions applied to all other public servants.  The previous pay reductions were applied to the Judiciary in the Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest Act 2011, FEMPI 4, and this legislation will also apply to the Judiciary, once enacted.  In addition, the Government is extending the measures to bodies that the last Government surprisingly decided should not be included in the pay reductions, namely the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA.<\/p><p>  Second, and more radically, this Government has freely engaged with its employees and their representatives on the policy challenge facing us.  The Government has set out the financial parameters which gave rise to the necessity to secure savings in its pay and pensions bill.  Like any company, we opened the books to our employees.  The proposals put forward by the Government protected the basic salary rates of low and middle income earners in the public service, while applying progressive reductions to the remuneration of higher paid public servants, unlike the 2009 pay cuts which were applied to all.  The Government allowed an extended, some would say protracted, period to its negotiators and to the unions to try to secure an equitable and agreed approach on achieving the savings we set out.<\/p><p>  There are those who hold the view that this approach was neither necessary nor appropriate and that the Government should impose a further simple, unilateral reduction to the basic salaries of all public servants, without consultation, discussion or negotiation with those affected.  Neither I nor this Government share that view, despite its being put forward over a protracted period over the last two years.  I do not believe any responsible employer in any sector of the economy would approach a problem in their company's finances in that fashion.  If such an approach was adopted by any employer, Members of this House would be the first to criticise that approach.<\/p><p>  Equally, the right to represent employees carries responsibilities, both to their members and their employers.  Unions traditionally and correctly fight hard to maintain the terms and conditions of their members, but sensible union leaders also recognise that short-term sacrifice on a negotiated and agreed basis can often play a part in the long-term financial health of their employer.  If it retains higher levels of employment and if it keeps the employer in business, it ultimately serves the longer-term interests of their members.  There can be no greater goal for public servants than that their employer, the State, returns to its previous level of economic independence and is not beholden to external borrowers.  Without it, they will find they are trying to negotiate on their future pay and conditions not with the person in the room, but with people sitting in judgment on Ireland's economic performance from abroad.  Those would be very one-sided negotiations.<\/p><p>  The approach adopted by the Government is not without difficulty or challenge.  It has required an enormous effort on the part of public service employers, unions, representative associations and the industrial relations machinery of the State through the Labour Relations Commission, to reach the point we are at now, with an agreed solution.  I hope all public servants will be consulted on the outcome to allow everybody's views to be known.  If these proposals are accepted, it will be possible, in the Government's view, to achieve the required savings and secure the necessary reduction in the public service pay and pension bill without having to make additional and deeper basic pay cuts.  That can be done in part through major increases in public service productivity.  Our approach to this whole challenge was, as far as possible, to get better productivity and minimise the take from people's pockets.  We need widespread work practice reform, in co-operation with all public sector staff.  The essential elements and protections of the Croke Park agreement will also remain in place.  Industrial peace in the public service can be secured at a critical time in our path to economic recovery.<\/p><p>  The Bill before us today is an integral part of the architecture of such an agreement.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to implement the proposed pay reduction for public servants earning annual salaries in excess of &euro;65,000, and the parallel but lesser reduction in public service pensions over &euro;32,500.  Contingency measures that may be deployed to secure reductions in the public service pay and pensions bill are also included, including provision for a universal freeze on pay increments.  The legislation also provides a facility for unions and representative associations to conclude collective agreements with their public service employers which will avoid the need for those contingency measures to be applied.<\/p><p>  For the benefit of Members I will now briefly outline the provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for a graduated reduction in the remuneration of public servants earning &euro;65,000 or more.  Any amount earned by those higher paid staff up to &euro;80,000 will be subject to a reduction of 5.5%, any amount over &euro;80,000 will be subject to a reduction of 8%, any amount over &euro;150,000 will be reduced by 9% and any amount over &euro;185,000 will be reduced by 10%.  All public servants including the Government, the Oireachtas - other than the President whose pay is protected under the Constitution - and the Judiciary will be affected.  Those affected by the measure represent some 13% of the public service workforce, those who are paid the most in core salaries and allowances, so 87% of the public service will be unaffected by the core pay cut.<\/p><p>  This section also includes a provision to enable a public employer or a Minister of the Government to exercise an existing power to fix terms and conditions so as to result in less favourable remuneration, other than core salary, or in increased hours for the public servants concerned.  That existing power may be exercised notwithstanding any terms of any enactment, contract or otherwise.  In essence this provision aims to permit public service employers, including Ministers, to make necessary savings if they cannot be achieved by way of collective agreement.<\/p><p>  This section does not grant any additional rights to employers to adjust terms and conditions.  Basic salaries are excluded.  I am of the view that reductions in basic salaries should be done only in the context of primary legislation, and with the consent of the Oireachtas.  That is what I am doing in this legislation.<\/p><p>Furthermore, any group that has its terms of employment set by the Oireachtas cannot have them changed by any public sector employer, or by a Minister.  That includes officeholders, in particular the Judiciary, whose pay terms are determined, not by a Minister, but by the Oireachtas.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Section 3<b><\/b>sets out technical amendments which provide for the application of all existing ancillary powers of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 to the new pay reductions, including the prohibition on pay increases and the ability of the Minister to modify the pay reduction as it applies to certain persons, or groups on limited grounds, to the pay reduction provided for in this Bill.<\/p><p><br \/> Section<b><\/b>5 provides for amendments to be made to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010 to increase and extend the impact of the public service pension reduction, PSPR, on persons who have retired from the public service and currently attract pensions of &euro;32,500 per annum, or more.  Persons in receipt of annual pensions of less than &euro;32,500 will be unaffected by these measures.  To reflect the fact that public servants who retired before 29 February 2012 would have had their pension entitlements based on pay rates greater than those who retired after that date, different levels of reduction apply, as detailed in the tables.  These reductions will apply from 1 July 2013.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Section<b><\/b>4 is a consequential amendment, to the definition of pensioner.  Section 6<b><\/b>consists of technical amendments to ensure that relevant elements of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, including in respect of aggregation of pensions and calculation of pension, are adjusted for the purposes of the Bill.  Sections 7 and 8<b><\/b>provide for a freeze of progression along incremental scales by public servants for a period of three years, commencing on 1 July 2013.  Public servants may have the effects of this provision modified on the basis that a collective agreement, which has been registered with the Labour Relations Commission, has been reached.  As is standard in these Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, the Minister is, under section 8, granted a power to exempt public servants from the application of the measure on limited and exceptional grounds.  This issue was raised during a Topical Issues debate.<\/p><p><br \/> Section 9<b><\/b>provides that persons retiring before 31 August 2014, or on a later date that may be ordered by the Minister, will be entitled to have their pensions calculated as if the pay reduction and any increment pause or freeze had not applied to them.  This provision is similar to the grace period provision provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  It is intended to prevent an unmanageable and unaffordable short-term outflow of staff affected by the pay reduction to the detriment of the delivery of public services.  There will be a further grace period until August 2014, or before the adjusted pay impacts on pensions.<\/p><p><br \/> Section 10 amends the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 to provide that the employees of the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, and the National Treasury Management Agency will be subject to the measures proposed in this Bill.  They were not included in the pay reduction imposed under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act of 2009.  However, this Government does not consider that the basis for their exclusion at that time continues to be valid.  It should be noted that the RPA is due for merger with the National Roads Authority under the Government's rationalisation programme.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Section 11<b><\/b>amends the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to provide for a modification of the pension-related deduction that applies to serving public servants.  That modification will reduce the pension deduction on all public servants by &euro;125 a year, to commence from 1 January 2014.  That &euro;125 is a small payback to everybody who is enduring the pension deduction now.  It is important to signal it to Deputies who dealt last year with the overarching Pensions Bill and the new pensions framework because at the time there was an argument that the pension levy should be calculated as part of a person's pension contribution.  I am of the view that it is an emergency additional imposition that will be removed when the emergency ceases.  I wish to signal that we want to begin that process in this legislation, albeit on a very modest basis.<\/p><p><br \/> Section 12 provides for annual review and report to the Oireachtas of the necessity of the measures set out in the Bill.  As an administrative efficiency measure, one single review will now encompass the reviews currently necessary under the earlier FEMPI Acts.  One reporting will determine whether the financial emergency continues to exist and if there is a case to continue the existing FEMPI legislation.  Section 13<b><\/b>states the Short Title of the Act.<\/p><p><br \/> The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2013 is a relatively short Bill but its impact is considerable.  I believe it represents one of the major final steps to the restoration of our economic sovereignty.  An essential condition for balanced economic growth is sustainable public finances, something all of us have stated repeatedly.  As such, the Government is committed to cutting the deficit and putting the debt ratio on a downward path.  We estimate the debt will peak this year at 123% of GDP, which is an extraordinarily high debt by any international comparison.  We are making considerable progress, however, and this progress is lowering the cost of borrowing, helping to put the public debt on a declining path and contributing to increased investor confidence in this country.<\/p><p><br \/> Every person in this House is aware there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend.  This situation is not sustainable over the longer term.  In addition to the requirement to bring our deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2015, in line with the excessive deficit procedure, it makes sense that we bring balance back to the public finances, and stabilise and reduce our debt burden.  This is how we will ultimately create growth and jobs on a sustainable basis in the Irish economy.<\/p><p><br \/> I am conscious of the argument that the measures we are taking on public expenditure can have a negative short-run impact on economic output.  That impact, however, is reckoned to be small and in the short term.  Over the medium term there will be a positive impact as the deficit is reduced and debt is put on a declining path.  The Government's policy fiscal consolidation, which is as growth-friendly and equitable as we can make it, has shown results in recent years.  Having returned to growth in 2011, Ireland achieved a second successive year of economic growth in 2012.  Preliminary figures show real GDP increased 0.9% last year.  Allied to that, inward investment remains strong, exports from Ireland are now considerably above their pre-crisis level, and bond yields on Government debt have fallen sharply and remain stable at that lower level.<\/p><p><br \/> As well as being a key building block to the final restoration of our economic sovereignty, this Bill achieves another key goal.  It provides a platform for the well-established industrial relations process in the public service.  It will underpin the negotiation of collective agreements, a measure to which I was wedded, through which public servants can secure the benefits they have under the proposals brokered by the Labour Relations Commission, between now and 2016.  Those agreements will be critical to our recovery, by providing a degree of certainty for all in regard to the cost and provision of our public services over the next three years, without the disruption that would be caused by industrial action.  As I have stated on several occasions, this will be the last ask of public servants.<\/p><p><br \/> I wish to pay tribute to all involved in these negotiations, most especially the Labour Relations Commission and the work undertaken by Kieran Mulvey and his team.  I also thank my own negotiators - some of whom are in the Chamber - led by Mr. Paul Reid, who did a remarkable, patient and difficult job for the country.  In part, what they were negotiating was a reduction in their own wages.<\/p><p><br \/> This is a difficult measure and I acknowledge that.  However, it is an essential one and therefore I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800035#HH00100","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369763100,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Deputy Sean Fleming has 30 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800036#JJ00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1369763100,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I wish to speak on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2013.  It is important to dwell on the Title of the Bill before we go into the specifics of the legislation and discuss the contents and what is involved.<\/p><p>It is being introduced under the procedure called financial emergency measures in the public interest.  I ask the Minister to spell out to us when he believes the financial emergency will come to an end.  He concluded his speech by noting that the final section of the Bill provides for the preparation of annual reports for the Oireachtas which will also encompass previous legislation.  I welcome that measure and will be tabling an amendment to confirm that we are still in a financial emergency.  If the financial emergency no longer obtains, nothing under this legislation should have effect.<\/p><p> The Minister indicated that the NTMA and the RPA have been removed from the Schedule, which lists most of our commercial semi-State bodies.  I have tabled an amendment to ensure that annual reviews confirm whether the Schedule remains accurate.  By removing two bodies, he has accepted that the Schedules contained in previous Acts require legislation.  These bodies are not exempt from the emergency measures that applied heretofore.  From one perspective, this is a positive development because these are commercial organisations not directly under the control of the Minister and are required to cover their own costs and make profits.  I refer to big organisations like the ESB and An Post.  The Minister did not want to micro-manage these organisations, many of which are competing against private sector companies.  However, many people working in the public service take a jaundiced view of their compatriots in semi-State companies not being included in the cuts.  ESB employees have received a number of pay increases in the past year or more for what people see as public sector work.  I am conscious of these opinions in my constituency of Laois-Offaly.  I barely need to walk out my own door to meet civil servants and employees of the local authority and the HSE.  A significant number of people living in my village work for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, ESB or An Post.  Debate rages on occasion in the pubs as to why some are getting cuts and others are not.  Generally they thought they were all public sector workers.  I am not saying they should be brought into the Bill but the review should include an assessment of whether the Schedule is still appropriate in its current form.  The Minister is introducing two amendments for good reason.  Perhaps we should also consider the banks that are in State ownership.  I do not see a difference between the ESB and a financial institution that is in full State ownership and provides a service, albeit poor.  I am not coming down one way or another but the case needs to be considered.  Perhaps an argument could be made for including all organisations that receive the majority of their funding from the Exchequer. <\/p><p> We have a number of problems with the Bill.  Our first problem is the use of the guillotine because we think rushed legislation is bad legislation.  This Bill does not need to be guillotined.  We also oppose the inclusion of reductions for pensioners were not party to any negotiations.  A decision was made unilaterally even though the Minister spoke at length about the need to negotiate and opposed previous Governments' decisions to introduce pay cuts unilaterally.  That is precisely what he is doing to public service pensioners, after excluding them from the talks.<\/p><p> The Minister stated that he wants to reach a deficit target of 3% by 2015.  Will the financial emergency end if we reach that target or will it extend beyond that date?  If, by good fortune, we meet that target earlier than 2015 will this legislation fall or no longer be necessary?  The Minister spoke about a required consolidation of &euro;3.5 billion in 2013 and additional savings and revenue raising measures of &euro;3.1 billion for 2014 and &euro;2 billion in 2015.  However, he lost the battle on the most important aspect of these figures, namely, the breakdown of the adjustment, or consolidation as he likes to call it, between taxation measures and expenditure cuts.  Most of the adjustment has been achieved through cuts to current expenditure.  The Minister might cut capital expenditure but I might then increase capital taxation to balance the equation.  Very little has been raised in additional capital taxes.  The amount has been much less than 50% of the required consolidation, which results in cuts to those who rely most on the State's services.  People hoped the Labour Party in Government would stand more firmly against further cuts without additional measures to increase revenue.  When we begin to deal with Estimates and the budget for next year, I hope we will see a 50:50 balance between expenditure cuts and increased taxes.  The Minister referred to the amounts without referring to the split, which is equally important.<\/p><p> This is a short and easily understood Bill which sets out to reduce the remuneration of certain public servants on higher rates of pay in excess of &euro;65,000 and suspend incremental progression for three years for all public servants unless they are covered by a collective agreement that modifies the terms of the incremental suspension and which has been registered with the Labour Relations Commission.  It also gives the Minister powers to set terms and conditions of employment for public servants so as to reduce the remuneration or increase the working time of those public servants.  My major difficulty with the Bill is that it also provides for a reduction in pensions payable in respect of certain persons who are currently in receipt of public service or occupational pension schemes or pension agreements.  That issue has not yet been discussed and the individuals concerned have been excluded from the process.<\/p><p> Why are we now discussing this Bill?  We started a couple of years ago with the Croke Park agreement, in respect of which we are still awaiting for the third annual implementation report for 2012.  I recognise that the Minister's officials have been busy but it is important that people are made aware of the progress that has been made so they can know the starting position of what was to be the Croke Park II agreement until it was rightly rejected by public sector employees.  We told the Minister that the new agreement was unfair.  We did not tell people how they should vote on it but we made it clear that aspects of it were unfair and disproportionate.  Cuts were inflicted on people earning less than &euro;65,000, mainly through the reduction of the Sunday premium for those who look after our health and security at weekends.  A key issue that arose from discussions with individuals working in the public service was that it was not family friendly in terms of the additional working hours required.<\/p><p>Many parents value time at home with their children.  They are very concerned about the quality of child care and always want to get home as early as possible to look after their children.  Many public servants believed the additional working hours built into the Croke Park II were worse than a pay cut.  My party told the Government within hours of the agreement being published that people would vote against it for that reason.  <\/p><p>  The Minister has since produced the Haddington Road agreement, whose publication at lunchtime last Thursday dovetailed with the introduction of this legislation.  The new agreement breaks the mould because, for the first time, it is not a collective agreement across the public service.  The Government's decision to have a series of bilateral agreements for different sectors will have knock-on effects.  Separate agreements have been drawn up for the Irish Prison Service, the Defence Forces, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Civil Service and non-commercial semi-State bodies, craft groups and the education, local authority and health sectors, respectively.  The agreement also includes an appendix dealing with traditional hours for certain grades, depending on which agreement covers their work.  As a result, eight different agreements need to be agreed between line Ministers representing the Government and the trade unions in the relevant sectors.  We do not have an overall collective agreement by the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  From that point of view, I am sure the other party in government is pleased that ICTU's public service committee has been effectively stood down as part of the Haddington Road agreement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800036#JJ00300","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369764300,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I would not rule out a collective agreement yet.

Last Thursday, during Oral Questions, the Minister indicated he would provide figures on projected savings.  The new agreement adjusts the previous Croke Park II agreement.  For example, the latter proposed to save &euro;65 million by reducing Sunday premium payments.  This target will not be achieved because the Government agreed to make significant changes and concessions.  This was a correct decision as it was unfair to target front-line workers.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would like the Minister to provide costings for some of the other areas of savings.  The Government has an overall target of achieving savings of &euro;1 billion by 2015.  Will the Minister spell out the savings that will be achieved under the Haddington Road agreement and the additional savings it is proposed to achieve through other measures?  Some of the most significant savings to be made by 2015 will be achieved through a targeted redundancy programme.  Reference has been made to reducing headcount subject to Government action.  The trade unions have not signed up to any such measures.  Notwithstanding the Minister's statement about ensuring all measures are achieved through co-operation and agreement, the Government proposes to make unilateral decisions to reduce public sector numbers from 290,000 to 282,500 by next year.  From 2015 when public servants receive their lump sums and start to receive their pensions, the public sector pay bill will logically reduce.  What will be the precise savings generated by this measure?<\/p><p><br \/>  The early retirement scheme introduced in 2012 should also deliver some further savings in 2013 and 2014.  Will the Minister indicate what savings will be achieved through retirements in the normal course, as occur in all organisations?  The Government has set a date of August of next year by which it hopes to encourage public servants to retire.  What savings will be generated from the recruitment embargo in place in many parts of the public service?  I am aware that teachers and health staff above nursing grade, including doctors and consultants, are exempt from the recruitment embargo.  It is important that we find out what savings will be generated by the Haddington Road agreement as well as from other measures being taken by the Government.  I expect that combined these savings should add up to the &euro;1 billion target.  It would be useful to find out what savings will be generated and from where.  <\/p><p><br \/>  As I indicated, the inclusion in the Haddington Road agreement of measures on public service pensions is a major issue.  The matter was also included in the Croke Park II agreement.  Paragraph 2.27 of the new agreement states: <blockquote>Separately, to this Agreement, the Parties note that the Government intends to align the reductions in public service pensions in payment with the reductions applied to serving staff.  The Parties note that this measure will apply to pensions in payment greater than &euro;32,500 only.<\/blockquote>It is clear from this reading that this measure will be implemented separately from the agreement.  What savings will be achieved from the proposed cuts in public service pensions?<\/p><p><br \/>  I do not propose to repeat the Minister's speech, the gist of which was that he would not do as my party did in government when we made unilateral changes to public service pay, income and remuneration without consultation with the relevant bodies.  He is doing precisely that in respect of public service pensions.  The decision to exclude public service pensioners from the talks on the Croke Park II agreement caused great anger.  Representatives of public service pensioners requested meetings with the Minister and his officials but were refused.  They also wanted to be involved in negotiations on the Haddington Road agreement because they knew it would make reference to public service pensions.  In response to a number of questions I tabled on this matter in recent weeks, the Minister indicated arrangements would be made for his officials to meet representatives of the Retired Civil and Public Servants Association or its constituent bodies.  Now that the agreement has been published and emergency legislation is ready to be forced through the D&aacute;il, the Minister has indicated he will speak to the representatives of public service pensioners.  I do not know what he will discuss with them as he has done the dirt on them without first speaking to them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800038#LL00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1369764300,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I met them at length yesterday and my officials met them last Friday.

Public service pensioners were not included in any discussion before the Haddington Road agreement and the legislation were published on Thursday last.  The meetings took place after publication.  Moreover, the list of Committee Stage amendments does not feature any amendments from the Minister.  If no changes are to be made to the legislation, clearly the views of public service pensioners are considered irrelevant.  Opposition spokespersons have drawn up amendments to address the issue of public service pensioners and while they may differ in content, all of them reflect the same general principles.<\/p><p>  I specifically wrote to Mr. Kieran Mulvey before his proposals were published requesting that he refuse to include any reference in the proposed new agreement on public sector pay to matters that did not form part of the negotiations.  While Mr. Mulvey has done a fine job in reaching nine individual agreements with different sectors, it was not necessary for him to provide cover - to whom I do not know - by including a reference to public service pensions.  He should have taken the view that it is the Government's prerogative to legislate for cuts in public service pensions.  He did not include a reference to targeted redundancies in the agreement o the basis that this matter will be the subject of a Government decision.  Public service pensions and redundancy schemes were not negotiated as part of the Haddington Road agreement.  I presume the reference to public service pensions was included at the request of one or two people to make it easier to sell the agreement to different people.  Public service pensioners were used as pawns and they feel aggrieved as a result.  <\/p><p>  I and several party colleagues met a number of representatives of public service pensioners who expressed the view that they had been unfairly treated as a result of being excluded from the negotiation process.  Meeting them at this stage is a case of too little, too late.  I am surprised by the number of people who contacted me about this issue over the weekend, not so much in my role as my party spokesperson but as a constituency Deputy.  One normally recognises a structured e-mail because one receives exactly the same e-mail from 20 or 30 people.  However, the many telephone calls and messages I received from people over the weekend were clearly spontaneous as they related to individual circumstances.  They were not inspired by any national organisation because public service pensioners do not have a strong national organisation.<\/p><p>These are the views of individual public service pensioners.<\/p><p> The Minister stated that the single public service pension scheme was introduced last year.

Just because one is not at work does not mean one can live on half the amount on which one was living up to one's retirement.

The legislation already contains a proposal to the effect that the incomes of those who are in receipt of &euro;180,000 plus will be subject to a reduction of 10%.  The Taoiseach's salary is currently in the region of &euro;200,000 and as a result of the proposed cuts, it will drop to &euro;185,000 or perhaps a little less.  I am of the view that anyone who is in receipt of a salary larger than that of the Taoiseach should have it reduced by 20%.  There are those who state that no one should be paid more than the amount to which I refer and it has often been stated that half of the people who earn these high salaries are hospital consultants.  A cut of 20% in the portion of someone's salary that is over &euro;200,000 would not amount to a great deal.  If a person - for example, a surgeon - is in receipt of &euro;250,000, the 20% cut would be applied to the &euro;50,000.  This would mean a cut of &euro;10,000 gross and only &euro;5,000 net.  Given that the incomes of such individuals will already be the subject of a 10% reduction under the terms of the legislation, they would only be obliged to absorb an additional pay net pay cut of &euro;2,500 in order to bring them up to 20%.<\/p><p>  The Deputy seated just down from me would probably state that the amount to which I refer is not half enough.  She might be right in that regard.  In any event, it is my view that there should be an additional cut for those who are on more than &euro;200,000 and I have tabled an amendment in this regard.  I am aware that there is a conflict between the various amendments relating to this matter because Deputies have suggested different ranges of figures and different levels of reductions.  There are, perhaps, those who might state that no one should be paid more &euro;200,000.  However, all of us on this side of the Chamber are of the view that there is a point at which people who are in receipt of higher salaries should be obliged to absorb significant cuts.  I have taken the Taoiseach's salary as the benchmark in this regard.  Anyone who is earning more than the Taoiseach should be obliged to take a steeper pay cut than him.  Most people would agree that this is both fair and reasonable.<\/p><p>  A thorny issue is going to arise with regard to the agreement being binding on individual sectors, particularly in the context of how the trade unions vote.  A constitutional issue arises here.  As a member of the Labour Party and a former trade unionist - he may still be a member of a trade union - the Minister will be aware that people's right to join trade unions is enshrined in the Constitution of Ireland, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  The courts have deemed that people also have an equal right not to join trade unions.  There are public servants who choose to exercise their constitutional right not to be members of trade unions.  I am of the view that the Minister is making an assumption with regard to how these people should be impacted upon by any agreements in their sectors.  He almost seems to be implying that if a sector votes &quot;No&quot;, then non-union personnel will also be deemed to have voted in this way.  This is despite the fact that they would not have a vote in respect of matters of this nature, which is an important consideration.<\/p><p>  Another difficulty I have relates to the guillotine that will be applied in respect of the legislation.  The trade unions have not yet balloted their members but the Bill will be passed by the House tomorrow night.  This is a grave discourtesy to people.  I would have understood if the Minister had published the legislation, put it through Second Stage and then informed the trade union movement, &quot;This is what is coming down the track the week after you ballot your members, one way or the other.  At least you know where we stand&quot;.  For it to be passed by the Oireachtas before voting on the new agreement even commences, is informing the unions that the Minister does not care whether they vote &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; or whether members tear up their ballot papers and do not vote at all.  What he is saying is that it does not matter, the legislation is going to be passed and the views and decisions of trade union members are of no consequence.  I do not understand why the Minister is proceeding in this way.  He is paying a major discourtesy to these people.  He previously stated that he would not rush legislation through the House in the absence of consultation.  He has introduced this legislation following a period of consultation but in the absence of agreement.  If the Haddington Road agreement is or is not accepted, that will be of no consequence because the Minister has decided that the legislation should be passed in any event.<\/p><p>  The different sectoral agreements to which I refer may have knock-on effects in the context of staff mobility across the public service in the future.  In addition, the legislation is very weak on public sector reform.  The Minister will state that it contains a number of measures in this regard but I am of the view that they are watered down in nature.  They say little about ensuring reform and improving delivery of public services.  The new Haddington Road agreement has largely been treated by the Government as a cost-saving exercise.  In that context, it has missed out on the opportunity to improve public service delivery.<\/p><p>  It is key that we should monitor how what is being done here will impact on citizens.  We must also monitor whether the delivery of front-line services improves.  The main challenge will be to ensure that such services are protected and that the public will not suffer as a result of those services being impaired by attempts to make savings, other than those relating to payroll.  Key areas to monitor will be those relating to hospital waiting lists, queues in accident and emergency departments, special needs facilities in schools, the time taken to process social welfare applications and appeals - no one in the House can be unaware of the fundamental difficulties which already exist in this regard - the ongoing and lengthening delays in respect of Garda vetting and the delivery of local authority services.  There must be a greater facility for staff transfers from the HSE to, for example, the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Passport Office is currently under pressure, which is understandable, and a backlog is building up again.  Staff could also be transferred to the State Laboratory and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Many of the entities to which I refer are understaffed at present.  As part of a mobility scheme, however, staff could be moved into them.<\/p><p>  The lack of a formal assessment process is hampering staff redeployment.  International studies show that investing in key areas of the public service such as, for example, that relating to the collection of revenue, can improve the delivery of services.  We have witnessed this in the context of the amount of money that is going to be levied from the local property tax, responsibility for the collection of which was given to the Revenue rather than to the Local Government Management Services Board or local authorities. One of the latter - I do not know which - were responsible for collecting last year's household charge.  It was much better that Revenue was given power in this area.<\/p><p>  There is an increasing need to appoint specialists to certain areas of the public service.  I refer, for example, to statisticians, IT specialists, environmental specialists, solicitors and barristers.  It would be better to employ the latter full-time rather than pay them on an hourly or a daily rate, as is currently the case with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and similar bodies.<\/p><p>  My party has supported measures that were introduced in the past.  However, as a result of the provision in respect of pensioners - who were not consulted in respect of or who were not allowed to be involved in the discussions relating to either the Croke Park II or Haddington Road agreements - and in view of the unfair treatment being meted out to them, I will be opposing the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800039#MM01100","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1369765500,"counter":468,"content":"<p>The Minister has moved with indecent haste to introduce this legislation.  I was interested in his comments, in that he described it as part of \"the Government's policy of restraint and prudent budget\".  There was a complimentary glow to that depiction.  The agreement has just been published, some union leaderships have taken a judgment on it and not a single union member has been balloted on its provisions.  The legislation could have waited, but the Minister's objective in pushing it through is to strong-arm public sector workers, the very workers for whom he is responsible.  I consider this to be a pre-emptive strike against them.  The contingency measures to which he referred are blunt threats - sign up or else.  Shaping up to one's workforce with such bravado is unnecessary, unhelpful and bad practice.<\/p><p>  The Minister stated that he had taken the radical decision to engage freely with employees and their representatives on the policy challenge facing us.  Is it not extraordinary that a Labour Party Minister would consider a process of collective bargaining and consultation radical?  It is not radical - it is necessary.<\/p><p>  Following the rejection of Croke Park II, a new negotiation process was initiated.  Mr. Kieran Mulvey of the Labour Relations Commission was tasked to take the lead and union leaderships engaged fully in the discussions despite the unduly constrained framework set by the Government.  There was no need to bully the leaders to the table - they went openly.  In the course of the discussions, however, the Minister intervened time and again, barracking from the sidelines with his contingency plans.  This caused me to wonder when he stated this evening that, while some people believed that the Government should act unilaterally and reduce the pay of all public servants without consultation, discussion or negotiation, neither he nor the Government shared that view.  This is precisely the view that he articulated throughout the process - pass the agreement or else.  Now the message is to agree the Haddington Road deal or else.  The big threats and big sticks are still out.<\/p><p>  This legislation has already been presented to union members and has been widely reported and commented on in the media.  Trade union members and public servants are fully aware of the Minister's intent in the event of rejection of the Haddington Road deal.  The Government's approach throughout this sorry episode, from Croke Park to Haddington Road, demonstrates nothing short of contempt for public sector workers.  Let us remember that this and the last Governments have cut the public sector workforce by 10%.  There is a commitment to reduce it by a further 10,000 workers.  As at 2008, staffing figures in the public sector were slightly below the OECD average.  In a comparison with eight countries, including Britain, Canada and the Netherlands, Ireland had the third lowest figure for general government employment per 1,000 population, as I am sure the Minister knows.<\/p><p>  Last December, he told the D&aacute;il that there were 565,000 more medical card holders, 50,000 more students in schools, close to 30,000 more third level students and 80,000 more State pensioners.  Carer's allowance applications are taking six months to process and children seeking speech and therapy supports are on waiting lists of at least one year.  Today, 292 people are lying on hospital trolleys and 14% of the working population continues to rely on social protection supports and services to make ends meet.<\/p><p>  Despite this upwards trend or spike in public service need, significantly fewer public sector employees are dealing with the increased demand.  They are working harder and for longer, with less pay and within a system that is inadequately resourced.  This is unsustainable.<\/p><p>  Railroading the legislation through the D&aacute;il is little more than throwing political shapes.  As the employer of the largest workforce in the State, it is wrong of the Minister to behave in this way.<\/p><p>  This legislation and the Haddington Road agreement contain provisions to cut public sector pensions.  As the Minister pointed out, the majority of public sector pensions in payment are to the value of &euro;30,000 per year or less and, therefore, will be unaffected.  Pensioner representative organisations, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Retired Members Association, GSRMA, and the Senior Citizens' Parliament, have raised concerns with the lack of consultation with public sector pensioners during negotiations.  Although the Minister and officials met the Alliance of Retired Public Servants, it was too little, too late.  He has committed to lessening the burden of the public service pension reduction, with the initial focus on former workers who are in receipt of low-income pensions, at the earliest date that economic progress permits.  This sounds like good news, but low-income pensioners, like their low-income public sector worker counterparts, could be forgiven for not taking much comfort from these words.  The first Croke Park deal contained a similar commitment for low-paid workers that has yet to materialise thanks to our own troika of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour and their agreed economic strategy of the past five years.<\/p><p>  I hope that the Minister lives up to his commitment to continue to engage with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants and that he extends this necessary, minimal courtesy to other representative organisations.  However, his dogged refusal to address the small number of gold-plated pensions still being paid out to former taoisigh, Ministers and officeholders is a matter of immense frustration.  Paying out pensions to the tune of &euro;150,000 is unacceptable in good times as well as bad.  Refusing to take on these payments within the reform agenda makes a mockery of every public claim to change.<\/p><p>  When the Minister makes excuses for not cutting excessive pensions, he cites the Attorney General's advice.  We have yet to see that advice.  It may not be the norm for such advice to be published, but a Minister dedicated to increased public scrutiny of Government decisions would have no reason not to make such advice public.  Regardless, the property rights argument does not stand.  The public service pension reduction is a levy on public sector pensions and has been in place for a number of years.  Therefore, the precedent for the Government to cut public sector pensions has been set.  The Government has also placed a levy on private pensions, reaffirming its ability to target pensions.  Indeed, the IBRC Act, which was also rushed through the House, included a provision requiring &quot;permanent or temporary interference with the rights, including property rights, of persons&quot;, debunking the Government's position that property rights are sacrosanct.  I am unsure as to what could be fairer than ending the practice of significant pension pay-outs to political insiders during a time of ongoing economic and social crisis.<\/p><p>  If the Government is comfortable with threatening to freeze indefinitely the increments of clerical officers, 75% of whom are women and are on starting salaries of &euro;22,000 per year, and to cut their pay further while increasing their working week if they do not sign up to its latest round of cuts, surely reducing substantially the outrageous gold-plated pensions paid out to predominantly male former politicians is not beyond its reach.  Sinn F&eacute;in has often proposed a large levy, essentially a clawback levy, on public pensions in excess of &euro;100,000.  A reforming, radical and fair government would introduce such a measure.<\/p><p> Reference has already been made to yesterday's media report that the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, is commissioning legal advice to examine the FEMPI legislation&rsquo;s provision to allow the Government to cut the pay of public sector workers without agreement.  The IFUT's general secretary said yesterday that he believed there are constitutional implications for the legislation on the basis that it is the first time that the treatment of employees will be dictated by their membership or non-membership of a union, rather than the work they do and the grade they hold.  I do not know whether the Minister sought advice from the Attorney General on the matter but, if he did, I urge that he would make the information public.  If not, I would like to know whether he intends to do so.<\/p><p> The Minister's increasingly cynical use of the legislative process is deeply worrying.  I previously raised concerns with him on the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill, which have clearly fallen on deaf ears.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, scheduled the Oireachtas inquiries Bill for Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il before the final legislation was even published.  Despite the contentious nature of the Bill, and the Minister's abject failure to publicly engage with citizens on the Oireachtas inquiries referendum he appears to have learnt nothing from the experience.  He has again given Members just two working days to consider and submit Committee Stage amendments to the Bill &ndash; just less than eight working days since the legislation was first published.  By any standards that is unacceptable.  It certainly makes something of a mockery of the Minister's claim to reforming zeal.  In addition, there is the long-awaited whistleblower's Bill.  In light of the ongoing controversy surrounding the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, might have been better off prioritising that legislation rather than forcing through the FEMPI legislation.<\/p><p> On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in I will table a number of amendments to the Bill.  The gist of our approach is that we want excessive pay at the top reined in.  We do not want it done gently or delicately, we want it done clearly and definitively.  If that does not happen, as I have said repeatedly to the Minister then he cannot make any claim to fairness.  He cannot dangle threats over low and middle-income workers while protecting those at the very top.  There is no good reason for not imposing substantial cuts to the pay of the Taoiseach and Ministers, over and above what is envisaged in the current arrangement.  Neither is there a reason not to re-examine the pay of hospital consultants, bar a lack of political will.  There is certainly no good reason why the gold-plated pensions in payment to many of the great and good of this island cannot be tackled.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in does not support cutting the pay of low and middle-income public sector workers, whether in the form of cuts to core pay, allowances, twilight payments or additional hours of work, which in real terms amount to a cut in pay for such workers.  We will not support that.  Any argument based on equity or people carrying their fair share of the burden to dress up attacks on those categories of workers is simply wrong.  We do not support the Government's position that &euro;300 million in 2013 and an additional &euro;1 billion by 2015 must be cut from the public sector pay and pensions bill.  I have set out the position on how savings could be found in the pay and pensions bill.  If the moneys are so desperately needed, other measures could be taken and the Government knows that well.  It cannot go back again to public sector workers.<\/p><p> I listened carefully to the Minister's insightful but worrying comment.  He said, &quot;measures we are taking on public expenditure can have a negative short-run impact on economic output&quot;.  He then went on to extol what he saw as the great achievements of the Administration.  At no point did he sound out the reality of a domestic economy that is in crisis.  Either the Minister is oblivious to the fact, which I doubt, or he simply edited out the reality from his script.  He said the cuts he would introduce might have a negative short-run impact.  That will not be much comfort to the workers in receipt of the cuts.  Taking people's spending power out of the domestic economy and putting money instead into the black hole of bad bank debt, for instance, is not a good strategy.  There has been a consistent strategy of austerity for private sector workers, but also for those within the public sector, who are on modest wages - many of whom are in negative equity and who struggle with all of the same dilemmas and pressures as private sector workers.  Taking money out of their pocket makes absolutely no sense.  The deep worry, which extends beyond public sector workers, is that we can see from the Minister's script this evening that he is definitely wedded to a strategy of cutbacks for the lower echelons of society, the ordinary five eights - the average man or woman - yet he will persistently defend those at the very top.  That is unacceptable and verges on the obnoxious.  The union leadership will take their view on the agreement, now called the Haddington Road agreement.  In most cases members will be balloted.  It is the prerogative of every worker to take his or her decision on the matter.  I cannot imagine any public sector worker taking any comfort from the fact that the Minister has taken to himself in this pre-emptive way the power to cut the wages of those workers if he does not get the answer he likes.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has form in that regard.<\/p><p> I look forward to Committee Stage on which he will table amendments.  Perhaps the miraculous will happen and the Minister might see the light.  He might listen to some of the good sense and the reality behind some of the amendments we are moving.  However, I suspect that will not be the case.  The manner in which the legislation has been rushed through the D&aacute;il to be in the Seanad by Thursday is disgraceful and sends a negative message to public sector workers.  It also sends a very negative message to elected Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800040#NN00100","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369766100,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Joe Higgins.

The public interest suggests the well-being of a majority in society and society in general.  A regime of cuts to the income of low and middle-income workers and a worsening of their conditions is not in the public interest or in the interest of society.  It damages society and increases the stress and difficulties of the workers concerned and it takes &euro;1 billion out of the domestic economy over the next three years, further intensifying the downward spiral of this austerity-blighted domestic economy.  This Bill is in the interests of the financial markets - the bondholders, the bankers and the troika who act in the interests of the financial capitalists of Europe.<\/p><p>It also is in the interests of the bailing out of the financial market system on the backs of working-class people.<\/p><p> The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill is a disgraceful blackmail measure to browbeat workers into accepting significant attacks on their incomes and conditions.  The registration for the property tax, the home tax in reality, closed today, providing for another income cut also accompanied by threats and menaces.  For many workers, the property tax amounts to a week's income.  The public sector workers should take on both the property tax and these proposed cuts to their wages and conditions - hatched appropriately in this agreement in a place called Beggars Bush - beggaring the low and middle-income workers concerned.  They should take on the property tax and mount a massive campaign of opposition, mobilisation and industrial action to halt this insane austerity and to force a change in Government policy towards investment, job creation and regeneration of the economy instead.<\/p><p> It was ironic to hear the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform criticise his Fianna F&aacute;il predecessor and, he charged, for introducing similar measures unilaterally.  While that is correct, have Members forgotten that over the past few months, the same Minister has been bullying and badgering the public sector workers concerned on a weekly basis?  They have been told they have absolutely no choice or they would face worse.  He has threatened them that unless they vote for the amputation of their right arms, the Government will cut them off anyway.  This has been the tone of the Government and it is a disgraceful position for a Labour Party Minister to adopt.  I reject this legislation and urge workers in the public sector, to be supported by private-sector workers, to reject it out of hand and to fight for an alternative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800041#OO00500","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369766700,"counter":475,"content":"<p>First, I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this new legislation, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2013.  The Bill is an attack on all public servants and one should not beat around the bush, it will cause further hardship to all public servants and their families.  In addition, it will suck out more money and spending from the local economy and will damage further the potential to create and develop jobs and local employment in the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector.  Neither the Minister nor the Government appear to get it.  Ireland's jobless figures are still among the highest in the European Union.  Moreover, its long-term unemployment figures also are among the highest in the EU, despite recent initiatives such as changes in the welfare system and the provision of more training opportunities for people looking for work.  Approximately 62% of Ireland's unemployed people have been without a job for a year or more.  This is far in excess of the EU average of 45% and these people make up 9% of the total Irish population.  I raise this point because it is relevant in this debate.  Under other definitions, these statistics could be even more dramatic as the European Union's approach to measuring long-term unemployment is generous when compared with that of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, which defines it as being 27 weeks or longer without a job.  Unemployment statistics also do not take account of those who emigrate in search of work.  I raise this issue in the context of cutting the wages of public servants who did not cause this crisis.  I also mention this in the context of the banking crisis and more importantly, of the debt crisis that is dragging this country down.<\/p><p>  Paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of the Bill's explanatory memorandum outline measures that will see a reduction in the remuneration of certain public servants on higher rates of pay in excess of &euro;65,000 per annum, which in the present day is not a huge amount of money.  The Bill provides for the reduction of the amount of the payment of pension or other benefits, other than lump sums, payable to or in respect of certain persons who are or were in the public service under an occupational pension scheme or pension arrangement or in receipt of pensions greater than &euro;32,500.  The Bill also provides for certain contingency measures for savings to pay the bill, which include provision for suspension of incremental progression for three years for all public servants, unless they are covered by a collective agreement that modifies the terms of the incremental suspension and which has been registered with the Labour Relations Commission.  This Bill is disgraceful legislation and I will be voting against it.  I will stand by our public servants, who do not deserve this injustice and this legislation is not in the public interest.<\/p><p>  In addition, I must also point out the issue concerning senior citizens and the effect on pensions of the Bill.  The fact there are to be reductions in pension payments, while stated at paragraph 2.27 of the Haddington Road agreement, is inserted in that agreement in a manner that could be construed as in fact forming part of the agreement.  However, closer examination reveals it is merely noted in the agreement.  The introduction of this Bill without consultation with pensioners or their representative groups is a further matter of serious concern to the citizens and pensioners of the State.  Many of the aforementioned groups are very angered and it is important that people should look at the details of this legislation, which is the reason I will be voting against it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800042#PP00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1369766700,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Given that this Bill forms part of the Government's stated objective of reducing the public sector pay and pensions bill by an additional &euro;1 billion by 2015, I will draw on some research carried out by the Nevin Economic Research Institute, which questions the validity of the subjective.  Tom Healy and Rory O'Farrell of the institute have calculated that the actual savings to the Government of a &euro;1 billion cut to the public sector payroll is likely to be no more than &euro;250 million.  They also have found this measure will cost between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs, approximately half of which will be in the public sector.  According to Tom Healy, this is because most of the savings on the Government spending side are lost either directly through income tax, universal social contribution and other State deductions or through falling retail sale taxes and loss of jobs in the private sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  I was interested to hear the earlier contribution of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and was somewhat taken aback by his comment that he regards the Government's fiscal consolidation policy to be growth-friendly and as equitable as possible and that it has shown results in recent years.  This is quite a claim, given the domestic economy is on its knees and four to five businesses are going out of business each day.  Furthermore, the deprivation rate, which measures those experiencing two or more types of deprivation, more than doubled from a low of 11.8% in 2007 to 24.5% in 2011.  On average, 38% of all households spend more than their disposable incomes and households with the lowest incomes are most likely to have expenditure that exceeds their income.  Almost two thirds or 63% of those in the lowest income category have higher expenditure than income.  The autism unit in Scoil Mhuire, Wexford had a 57% success rate for full-time integration of children from the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit into mainstream classes.  Since the imposition of the cuts two years ago in which six positions were axed, this success rate has been reduced to zero.  The Minister should tell me what part of this is growth-friendly and equitable because I cannot discern it.<\/p><p><br \/>  In an article published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> a fortnight ago, Tom Healy commented on the Government's austerity agenda.  He stated:<blockquote>If &#8220;savings&#8221; actually equal &#8220;cuts&#8221; then Ireland might be running a government surplus.  Instead, after &euro;28 billion of fiscal &#8220;effort&#8221; the underlying government deficit (excluding bank bailouts and bank levies paid to government) has fallen from 11.5 per cent to just 8.6 per cent in four years.  There has been a huge degree of pain for relatively little gain.<\/blockquote>Mr. Healy argued that the alternative to this approach is to minimise further harm by focusing the fiscal consolidation on job creation, income distribution and maintenance of priority public services, all of which have been undermined as a result of five consecutive years of austerity budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800042#PP00300","speaker":"956"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1369766700,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality: Motion [Private Members]","time":1369767300,"counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800043#QQ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1369767300,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Niall Collins is sharing with Deputies Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Charlie McConalogue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800043#QQ00300","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1369767300,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I am sharing with Deputies Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Charlie McConalogue and perhaps Barry Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800043#QQ00400","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1369767300,"counter":481,"content":"<p>He has not been notified to me but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800043#QQ00500","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1369767300,"counter":482,"content":"<p>We can have that rectified.

A motion of no confidence is a grave matter.  The country faces huge challenges, which are being actively debated day in and day out, but that is not a valid reason we should not hold the Minister or his Government to account, despite its massive majority.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister holds what is arguably the most sensitive position in Government.  That sensitivity arises from the roles and relationships the Minister has with some of the most important institutions of State.  He is responsible for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, he must provide for the Judiciary, and he receives important and confidential information, often pertaining to State security.  This motion is the culmination of the fundamental policy mistakes and massive errors of judgment displayed by the Minister.  It is about broken and damaged working relationships, flawed policies and the misuse of privileged information for political gain.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to a series of strategic errors, the Minister has fatally compromised his integrity in that role by using this information that was not on the public record to gain a quick and cheap political advantage.  Under the Minister we have seen 140 Garda stations lying idle in unprotected communities throughout the country.  We have seen a poorly resourced Garda force hovering above 13,000 hit with additional budget cuts in the midst of an unprecedented morale crisis.  We have a Judiciary so alienated by the Minister that the Chief Justice had to intervene to set up a remediation forum to restore confidence in the rule of law.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Minister we have a new personal insolvency regime that has handed all the cards to the very banks that have fuelled the property boom.  Under the Minister we have a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman and Garda force which are in open conflict with each other.  In addition to all that, the Minister misused his position for cheap political gain by jeopardising his relationship with the Garda Commissioner, which is one of the most important working relationships in the State.<\/p><p><br \/>  I do not expect this damning list of failures to have any impact on the Government benches.  They have already shown their true colours and what their new politics really mean, but for an Opposition party there is an obligation to hold the Government to account and ensure such mistakes and abuse of power do not go unnoticed.  The disastrous policies, poisoned relationships, hypocrisy and arrogant abuse of power by any Minister will never be allowed go unchallenged in this House.<\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding the personal insolvency regime, let us look at the record of the Minister, whom the Government has claimed is the most radical and reforming Minister for Justice and Equality ever.  The mountain of debt facing home owners is a deeply personal crisis for those struggling to stay afloat in tough times and a national crisis that is dragging the economy into an ocean of debt.  Instead of producing a Bill that gives home owners under pressure a fair chance to come to terms with their bank, the Minister has given the financial institutions all the power under the regime.  With no independent arbitrator or appeals mechanism, the Government has created, through the Minister, a bankers' veto on progress in tackling debt.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister has missed a number of deadlines in that regard.  The delayed insolvency regime is due to get up and running during the summer.  Hard-pressed home owners will find little relief in the new system that is biased towards the very banks that got them into the problems they have in the first place.  Home owners will be left with only the final nuclear option of bankruptcy to save themselves if the banks wield their powerful veto over any arrangement.  This is a missed opportunity to throw a lifeline to those drowning in debt and not the radical reform the Government points to in defence of the Minister.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is fair to say the Minister has the most toxic relationship with rank and file garda&iacute; ever experienced in the history of the State.  That is due in no small part to the Minister's arrogant mismanagement.  It is hostile and it has played out over the airwaves day in, day out, week in, week.  He engaged in megaphone diplomacy over the airwaves, and it was unseemly.<\/p><p><br \/>  We must recall that only a few months before the last election, the Minister told this House that a reduction in Garda numbers would &quot;obstruct the battle against crime&quot;<b><\/b>and that it would see drug gangs and their leaders &quot;drink a celebratory toast&quot; to the then Minister.  What do those words mean now?  Under the Minister we have witnessed the jaw-dropping closure of 140 Garda stations throughout the country announced on budget day by e-mail.  The Minister is jeopardising the fight against crime by putting at risk the number of garda&iacute; in the force, potentially lowering it to below 13,000.  He has dropped their payroll budget by up to &euro;36 million, and it is being openly stated by rank and file garda&iacute;, right up the line to management in the Phoenix Park, that they will run out of cash in early December to pay the Garda payroll.  The Minister can shake his head ruefully but we have raised this with him on many occasions.  It has been reported authoritatively in the press but he continues to deny that.  The day will come when there will have to be a debate about a supplementary budget but the Minister was happy to seek to fund a Garda force insufficiently to fight crime.<\/p><p><br \/>  What is the Minister's position on Templemore?  He promised he would re-open Templemore later this year but then did a spectacular U-turn on that.  All of this is against a backdrop of rising burglaries, drug smuggling and serious dissident activity.  The Minister expects to lead the fight against these headline crimes when he will not resource the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He continues to recruit into the Irish Defence Forces but he will not recruit into the rank and file members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister can huff and puff about it but Fianna F&aacute;il has put forward, through our budget submission, our fully costed alternative budget proposal that would see Templemore reopened to recruitment and rural Garda stations, and many Garda stations across this city, opened.  Instead, in the Minister's own words, criminals will be toasting his decision to dismantle the garda&iacute; as the thin blue line is stretched even thinner across the length breadth of the country.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was set up by an Act of this Oireachtas.  If anything, it has proven that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in the main, carries out its functions with the highest integrity and professional standards.  In recent weeks, however, we have witnessed a complete breakdown in the working relationship between the force and the ombudsman.  The ombudsman is a vital component in keeping the force to account, and an effective working relationship between the two is a vital connection to ensure public trust in the justice system.  The Minister is entrusted with ensuring that relationship is not neglected and that it does not break down to the point it has now reached.  The public must know that the checks and balances in the system are maintained.  It is the duty of the Minister to oversee that, but he has failed to do that.  In recent weeks we have seen the chairman of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission taking to the national airwaves to articulate his dissatisfaction with the way he is being received in his statutory role which was given to him by this House.<\/p><p>Separate to that we had another member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission articulate exactly the same and the Minister has done nothing about that.  That is not good enough.<\/p><p> The garda&iacute; are not the only stakeholders to be alienated by the Minister.  The unseemly dispute that has erupted between two fundamental branches of government strikes at the heart of how we operate as a functioning, democratic state.  The fact the Chief Justice was forced to intervene and establish a new forum to help smooth over the turbulent relationships between the Minister and the Bench reflects the complete disconnect the Minister has shown in his dealings with the stakeholders under his Department.  A breach between the Judiciary and the Government that results in an open dispute undermines the separation of powers and the rule of law.  That the Minister has allowed relationships to deteriorate to the point where judges felt the need to give public speeches criticising Government policy on the Judiciary was a fresh low.  We have reached a dark moment where senior members of the Judiciary have called into question the strength of the rule in the State.<\/p><p> The past two weeks have brought these matters to a head.  The mask has completely slipped and the arrogant, out of touch manner that we all suspected has been fully revealed.  In a shocking abuse of power, the Minister used confidential information given to him by the Garda Commissioner to gain cheap political advantage over an opponent.  This is not the time to talk about the rights or wrongs of Deputy Mick Wallace.  What is at stake this evening is far more important than one person or incident; it is about a Minister who has reached a tipping point.  The Minister has exploited personal, off-the-record information he acquired solely because of his Ministerial position to launch this personal attack.  In a democracy based on the rule of law, every citizen, regardless of his politics, is entitled to due process.  Betraying the responsibilities of his ministerial seal, the Minister took on the role of judge and jury himself for his own political advantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800043#QQ00800","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369767900,"counter":486,"content":"<p>And executioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800044#RR00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1369767900,"counter":487,"content":"<p>A half-hearted, conditional apology does not wash away that fundamental error of judgement and the irreparable loss of ministerial integrity it entails.<\/p><p>  The Minister has poisoned the relationship between himself and the Garda Commissioner due to that misjudgement.

Confidential briefings containing highly sensitive information are a vital part of the job but the Minister has now lost that trust.  He bought a quick jibe at Mick Wallace at the price of fatally compromising his connection with the Garda Commissioner.  The Commissioner cannot say it but that bridge is another one that the Minister has burnt.  His capacity to carry out his duties as Minister took another deadly knock with that short-sighted attack.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to the Minister's blatant acts of hypocrisy and his double standards.  The Minister himself was a keen advocate of high standards when he sat on these benches.  When Bobby Molloy inappropriately misused his position as a Minister of State in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2002, Deputy Shatter emphatically stated that such a monumental error of judgement might have been forgivable had it been made by a political novice serving a first term.  In demanding the resignation of Deputy Willie O'Dea in 2010, he stated incorrectly that he willingly and publicly discussed for his own electoral gain confidential information furnished to him by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that such conduct was unacceptable by any Minister in any Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800044#RR00300","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1369767900,"counter":488,"content":"<p>The chickens are home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800044#RR00400","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1369767900,"counter":489,"content":"<p>They have landed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800044#RR00500","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1369767900,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Why does the Minister not apply the same standards to himself?

Why can we not have a report today?  Can Garda management not generate a report today after consulting with those who were at the incident on Pembroke Street?  The fact a report was not generated at the time does not mean one cannot be generated now.<\/p><p>  The ultimate issue is that we have lost trust in the Minister for Justice and Equality but, more importantly, all the key stakeholders under his Department have lost trust, as has the wider community.  There is a growing sense of arrogance from the Minister and his colleagues and that is related to the huge majority they enjoy in this House.

The main area of complaint with regards to investments is the alleged mis-selling of these policies. This complaint type accounted for over 37% of investment complaints for the period 2007-2010. The majority of complaints relate to the consumers' contention that they were sold unsuitable products.&quot;<\/p><p><br \/>  More recently, in its bi-annual review for July to December 2012, the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman has again highlighted the mis-selling of financial products in noting that, &quot;Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) complaints, representing 32% of all insurance complaints in 2012, have increased by 216% on 2011 figures&quot; (from 405 in 2011 to 1280 in 2012), and that, &quot;in general, the main feature of the complaints concern the suitability of PPI for the consumer and the consumer's knowledge or lack thereof that they agreed to and paid for the product in the first instance.&quot; I am also aware that the Central Bank has sought a review by banks of the sale of PPI and the refund of customers who could never claim under that insurance as purchased.<\/p><p><br \/>  While not under the aegis of my Department, the Financial Services Ombudsman was established under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 and became operational on 1 April 2005. It is a statutory body funded by levies from the financial service providers. The Financial Services Ombudsman can investigate, in an impartial and independent manner, complaints from individual customers and small businesses who have unresolved disputes with Financial Service Providers who are either regulated by the Financial Regulator or are subject to the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. <\/p><p><br \/>  Under current law, the Financial Services Ombudsman may not investigate a matter which occurred more than six years before the complaint is made. This is in line with the limitation period for most civil claims in the courts, including contract. This limitation period is provided for under section 57BX of the Central Bank Act of 1942, as amended by section 16 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004. The relevant provision states:<\/p><p><br \/>  &quot;(3) A consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of--<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>a<\/i> ) is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal, or<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>b<\/i> ) occurred more than 6 years before the complaint is made, or<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>c<\/i> ) relates to a matter that is within the jurisdiction of the Pensions Ombudsman, or<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>d<\/i> ) is of a class prescribed by Council.&quot;<\/p><p><br \/>  I would also point out that the statutory functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council include the keeping under review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Office of the Ombudsman and advising &quot;the Minister for Finance, either at the Minister's request or at its own initiative, on any matter relevant to the Ombudsman's operation&quot;. It would seem, therefore, open to the Council to make any relevant recommendations concerning the current limitation period that it considers appropriate to the Minister for Finance - who will be best placed to consider the appropriateness of such a change in relation to overall Government policy as it applies to financial services. I am also aware that a different approach has been taken to this issue in the United Kingdom. While consumers in that jurisdiction must bring complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service within six months of the final response letter from the business concerned, no limitation period applies to the matters on which the complaints are based. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Law Reform Commission has made recommendations in relation to enhancing the coherence of the broader limitation of actions regime in its Report on the Limitation of Actions of December 2011 and in relation to the limitation period applicable to contract law which could have a bearing on the matters raised. I will be happy to take account of these recommendations in any proposals for legislation that I may develop on periods of limitation in the future. In relation to directly addressing the issue of mis-selling raised by the Deputies, this will, in the first instance, have to take account of any relevant developments in core sectoral policy between the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, its Council, and the Minister for Finance. To date, I have not been made aware of any developments or proposals in this regard. However, I will take the opportunity to raise the Deputies' concerns with my colleague in Cabinet, the Minister for Finance, as regards the policy position of his Department in relation to a change in the limitation period applicable to the mis-selling of financial products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800044#RR02700","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1369768500,"counter":512,"content":"<p>If I may continue, today's report in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> states the Minister, &quot;Said nothing about being asthmatic, preventing him from completing the test&quot; which he was asked to do.  It also indicates that Deputy Shatter, &quot;Intimated to the garda that it was unconstitutional for them to stop him as he was coming from the D&aacute;il and said: 'Check your law book'.&quot;  The <i>Irish Independent<\/i> also claims he, &quot;Appeared not to make a sufficient effort to complete the breath test&quot;, and &quot;Drove off without being waved on by the officer&quot; who had stopped him.  All of those questions need a clear response from the Minister here tonight.  I do not know the veracity or otherwise of them.  All I can do is put them to the Minister because they are out there.  They are questions which the public, having read those articles today, will have.  They are questions to which it is crucial he has a clear answer and can refute.<\/p><p><br \/>  It also has been found out that there is now no report with the Garda on that particular incident.  This is in stark contrast to the report the Minister was able to give on Deputy Wallace's interaction with the garda&iacute;, where he was not stopped and where the garda&iacute; did not even get out of the car.  It was merely a conversation which took place and their discretion was used, and yet a report on that incident was able to make its way up through the Garda ranks right to the Garda Commissioner and into the Minister's hands, and then was used by Deputy Shatter in a political debate with Deputy Wallace.  That is in stark contrast to what we have before us here, where we can get no official evidence of something which would seem to have been a much more significant event and where it would seem that Deputy Shatter had informed the garda&iacute; on the night that he was coming from the D&aacute;il.  As someone who has more legal experience than any other person in this Chamber, Deputy Shatter, more than anyone, would know the implications of stating that he was on his way back from the D&aacute;il given the long-standing and archaic privilege that was put in place to exempt D&aacute;il Deputies at the foundation of the State from arrest on their way to or from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is crucial tonight that the Minister addresses those issues and gives clear answers to them.  Unfortunately, it may - I believe it will - not be enough in order for people to have confidence in him.

In carrying out his role, Deputy Shatter has failed in many instances - as a rule - to acknowledge the difficulty with which the Garda force must carry out its job on a daily basis.  He has got into conflict with the garda&iacute; in a way that no previous Minister managed to.  For the first time in the history of the State, a sitting Minister was not invited to the Garda conferences.  He also was at loggerheads with the Judiciary.  Indeed, a special committee has had to be set up in order to engage with and communicate between the legal and political arms of the State.  In the past couple of weeks, by disclosing the information he did following on from a briefing he was given by the Garda Commissioner, the Minister has also damaged irreparably the relationship which needs to exist between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner in administering law and order in the State.<\/p><p>  Some core pillars, of which the Minister for Justice and Equality must be at the head, have been irreparably severed by Deputy Shatter, leaving him in a difficult position and making it difficult for the public to have the type of confidence that is required in a Minister for Justice and Equality and in the justice system in the country.  If there are question marks hanging over the way the Minister for Justice and Equality participated when he faced the same scenario, how, for example, can he expect rank and file members of the Garda, in carrying out their duty and in conducting mandatory breath-testing stations across the country, to be able to carry out their job in the way they would have previously and ensure that people can give them full co-operation?  That leaves them in a very difficult position.  It is an unenviable position for a force to be in in relation to the political figurehead who is in place.<\/p><p>  I also want to remark upon the impact the Minister has had on Garda resources right throughout the country, where we have seen numbers reduced over his stewardship and stations closed, and the flippant way he threw out there that if Croke Park II had been passed, he may have reopened Templemore.  Should Deputy Shatter remain in office, an office in which he should no longer remain considering the difficult position in which he has found himself as a result of how this role has been performed by him in recent times, I might ask him, now that it looks like the savings which the Government was seeking will be achieved, if he will commit to doing what he stated he would do should he remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800045#SS00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1369768500,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I join my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, and others in supporting tonight's motion.

It was reasonable to seek an independent inquiry into the issue.  As we have a Garda Ombudsman Commission and an inspectorate, it would have been simple for either to carry out an independent inquiry into what went on.  In such a position, one must try to attain public confidence but unfortunately, the Minister decided not to do what he would have done in opposition but rather to get people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate themselves.  That did a service neither to him, the country nor An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  When people queried the process, the Minister tried to tittle-tattle about a trivial affair he heard about in some way.  At times, all of us could blurt out something we would, on reflection, not mean to say.  Echoing what happened with the three motions on the D&aacute;il agenda, the Minister could not come out within 24 hours to say that his action was totally inappropriate, that it was a slip of the tongue and that he would sincerely apologise to Deputy Wallace for what he did and hope that the apology would be accepted.  That would have been the manly and sensible course of action but instead, the Minister persisted in arguing that proper procedure had been followed and it was perfectly correct for a Minister who might come by information confidentially, but which is irrelevant in the public sphere, to put that information in a bad light in the public domain.<\/p><p>  I doubt if too many people in the country have not at some stage been stopped by a garda for some very minor infringement.  People might be told that they should not have acted illegally but they might be allowed to continue onwards.  That does not mean there is anything wrong with the judgment of a garda in such a position.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, seems to think Deputy Wallace should have contacted the Garda and argued that he should not have been allowed to continue without being summonsed for breaking the law.  This is part of a pattern from the Minister of fighting not on the substance of issues but trying to besmirch the names of others.<\/p><p>  I hope that when the Minister rises to speak tonight, he will cut the knot of the mess in which he is embroiled, as there is no doubt the Government has the numbers to win any confidence motion; that does not mean he is right.  I hope he will have the courage to stand up and state that he should never have said what he did on &quot;Prime Time&quot;, that he will apologise sincerely for any hurt caused and that he will ensure in future never to use information inappropriately.

A local garda living in the community, even though he or she might have worked official hours, was seen in the community and provided a level of security which garda&iacute; driving around in squad cars will never provide.  Having lived for a long time in a rural community in the happy position of having a local rural garda, I know the reality of such a person living in a community 24 hours a day.  It creates a policing situation which cannot be replicated by any other model.  If the Minister wants to undo some of the damage he has done, I suggest he reverse this policy and revert to the policy of encouraging local garda&iacute; in rural areas to live in these communities.  If he wants to understand the real effect of this, I suggest we bring him to a rural community with local resident garda&iacute; and they will show him the effectiveness of the work they do and that placing them all in district headquarters creates fear in rural Ireland which is unfair to people, particularly older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800047#UU00600","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1369769700,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I have always wanted to be introduced to rural Ireland by someone from Dublin 4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800047#UU00700","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1369769700,"counter":604,"content":"<p>Or introduced to Dublin 4 by somebody from rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800047#UU00800","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1369769700,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Deputy Rabbitte should not milk all of the cows together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800047#UU00900","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1369769700,"counter":606,"content":"<p>It is like the Mayo Deputy who thinks he knows a lot about Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800047#UU01000","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1369769700,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;

Fianna F&aacute;il's no-confidence motion is particularly galling considering that one of my biggest problems upon entering Government in March 2011 was trying to unravel the expenditure ceilings for the justice and defence sectors contained in the Fianna F&aacute;il national recovery plan of November 2010.  If implemented, they would have led to devastating cuts which I could not and would not have stood over.  Fortunately, I was able to secure necessary additional funding for the justice area in excess of &euro;400 million for the years 2012 to 2014 and also to mitigate the shortfall in funding for defence.<\/p><p>  Deputy Collins should consider where the Garda force would be today with an average of &euro;90 million per annum less in the Garda budget, which is where we would have been with Fianna F&aacute;il's 2010 plan.  He speaks about Garda numbers but fails to acknowledge that, with the dedication and co-operation of the force, we have preserved them at higher levels than Fianna F&aacute;il intended in 2010.  He speaks about Garda resources.  By effecting efficiencies in the Department, and with the assistance of the Commissioner and my Government colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, we allocated approximately &euro;4 million in 2012 and a further &euro;5 million this year for the purchase of Garda vehicles, none of which was provided for in Fianna F&aacute;il's 2010 plan.  The truth is Fianna F&aacute;il's no-confidence motion is both disingenuous and opportunistic.<\/p><p>  In the two great Departments I lead, it has been a time of unprecedented dramatic change and reform.  The achievements are not mine alone but of all in both the justice and the defence family who have travelled the route with me.  The public owes a debt of gratitude to the officials in both Departments at all levels, many of whom work hours well beyond the call of duty.  I also want to particularly acknowledge the contribution of the two Ministers of State, the Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and the Minister of State at the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, each of whom makes an invaluable contribution.  Also, of course, there is the very considerable commitment, expertise and dedication to public service in the Defence Forces, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service.  I also greatly value the crucial support of my Cabinet colleagues in the Fine Gael and Labour parliamentary parties.<\/p><p>  For some, reform and change bring uncertainty and cause worry.  However, through talk and discussions, we have together addressed problems and overcome very many of them.  Together, we have implemented reform in the public interest through dialogue with the various representative bodies with the objective of resolving, in so far as is possible, the concerns of those who work in vital services.  In the vital area of curtailing public expenditure, in the talks relating to Croke Park II, agreements were successfully concluded with the Defence Forces representative bodies and with the Prison Officers Association.  Unfortunately at that time, it did not prove possible to engage in talks with the Garda representative bodies.  This is now history and I am pleased that in the context of the Haddington Road agreement, there has been a successful conclusion to discussions with the staff representative bodies in the Irish Prison Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, and I look forward to a successful outcome to the ballot on what has been agreed.<\/p><p>  Deputy Collins, in all of his recent comments and again tonight, has chosen to ignore the fact that these agreements have been concluded and that the Garda representative bodies have concluded them also.  It is appropriate that I list, without detail, some of what has happened over the past two years.  We have completed the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, into a two brigade structure from a three brigade structure.  The strength of the PDF has been preserved at 9,500.  We have consolidated Army barracks.  We have made crucial financial savings through increasing efficiencies.  Despite the very severe financial difficulties facing the State, we have continued our commitment to, and engagement in, vital UN peacekeeping and training missions.  We have completed a value for money review on the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, and reorganisation of the RDF is taking place.  The defence budget has kept within its allocated spend for each year in which I have been Minister.  We have abolished unnecessary quangos.  By thoroughly engaging through dialogue with the Red Cross, reforms in this great organisation have been effected.  The D&aacute;il has enacted a Second World War amnesty Bill with regard to deserters who fought the Nazis.<\/p><p> We have re-energized Ireland's engagement in  the Common Security and Defence Policy.  During the EU presidency we have taken the opportunity to provide leadership on a broad range of issues of importance to this country, and to Europe as a whole, relating to security and defence.<\/p><p> As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have brought the following legislation to the Oireachtas and seen it enacted: Personal Insolvency Act 2012; National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable persons) Act 2012; Criminal Justice Search Warrants Act 2012; European Arrest Warrant (Application to Third Countries and Amendment) and Extradition (Amendment) Act 2012; Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (Amendment) Act 2012; Criminal Justice Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Vulnerable Adults Act 2012; Property Services Regulation Act 2011; Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011; 29th Amendment of the Constitution (Judges Remuneration) Act 2011, on which there was a successful referendum; Criminal Justice Act 2011; Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Act 2011; and the Criminal Justice Community Service Act 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800047#UU01500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369770300,"counter":613,"content":"<p>And he closed down more than 40 Garda stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800048#VV00200","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1369770300,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Good man, Michael.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800048#VV00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1369770300,"counter":615,"content":"<p>All of these measures were enacted in the space of two years.<\/p><p>  Innovation and bringing reforming legislation to this House has been a large part of my life's work as a TD over the past three decades, as well as tackling injustice and child abuse.

There is, of course, the additional benefit of a parliamentary majority.<\/p><p>  Much of the work of Government is executive rather than legislative.

I look forward to constructive contributions from all sides of this House on this stream of legislation.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the EU front, this Government realised upon taking office that it had a huge task in restoring Ireland's reputation in the EU.  It was felt in European circles that the previous Fianna F&aacute;il government had become disengaged from the EU process.  For example, Ministers failed to attend important Council meetings.  This led important decision-makers at EU level to take an increasingly negative view of Ireland.  One of the main priorities of An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, upon taking office, was to restore Ireland's reputation which had taken a hammering during the previous Fianna F&aacute;il government's term.  He asked all Government Ministers to give their full commitment to rebuilding our reputation in Europe.  I have committed myself wholeheartedly to this task since taking office as Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence.  I have regularly attended Justice and Home Affairs Council meetings and meetings of Defence ministers.  I have also regularly met bilaterally with my European counterparts. <\/p><p><br \/>  As with all matters, personal contact is critically important.  In this case the issue was our country's reputation abroad.  Of course, there remains the final month of our EU Presidency in which I hope to achieve many of the objectives for our Presidency's term on a broad range of measures and issues.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to Northern Ireland, I have been fully engaged with my counterpart David Ford and with the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers in ensuring continuing co-operation in tackling criminal terrorism and cross-Border crime.<\/p><p><br \/>  The catalyst for this motion is nothing to do with my substantial work as a Minister.

Is it something for which I owe Deputy Wallace an apology?  It is and I have already apologised.  Would I do it again?  No, I would not.<\/p><p>  The very particular circumstances in which the matter arose meant that it was absurd to contend that it had implications for the manner in which I deal with sensitive matters from the garda&iacute;.

Had I not done so, I would have been accused of covering up something.  Once I did reply, I was accused of landing the Garda Commissioner in it.  As the commissioner cannot respond publicly to criticism voiced, it is important that I explain that I am advised that it was only in the context of the controversy involving the use of Garda discretion that Deputy Wallace's car phone incident was recalled by a member of the force and brought to the attention of the commissioner who mentioned it to me.  The Commissioner never suggested I mention the incident without Deputy Wallace himself first mentioning it publicly.  So it is unfair for the commissioner to be the object of criticism.

Last Thursday, the Deputy used the privilege of this House to ask questions about an occasion when I stopped at a Garda checkpoint in early 2011, shortly prior to my appointment to Cabinet.  I was involved in no such event at that time.  He alleged this involved an offence under the Road Traffic 2010.  The relevant provisions of that Act did not become operative until a ministerial Order was made on 27 October 2011, seven months after my appointment.<\/p><p>  Despite these inaccuracies, I detailed in a statement last Thursday afternoon the facts of an event that occurred long before I became a Minister.  The extent to which this matter grew legs and has been the subject of media comment and analysis has been extraordinary.  Together with other motorists, I stopped at a Garda checkpoint, queued until reached and had my tax and insurance checked.  I co-operated with a request to exhale into a breathalyser, attempted to do so but did not exhale sufficiently due to my suffering from asthma.  I informed the Garda that I was on my way home from the D&aacute;il where I had been working all evening, had consumed no alcohol and that I suffered from asthma.  I was subsequently waved on.<\/p><p>All of the commentary to date, whether it has come from my political opponents, appeared in articles, or in the context of broadcasters interviewing other broadcasters or journalists, has studiously avoided mentioning that, under the then relevant legislation, the Road Traffic Act 2006, which Deputy Mattie McGrath reverted to referring to on RTE's \"Morning Ireland\" on Friday last, there is an express provision which states that where an individual has \"a reasonable excuse\" for not completing a breathalyser, no offence is committed.

Of course Deputy Mattie McGrath was implying wrong doing by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, when in opposition, but takes refuge in the fact that he was only asking questions.  Some Members of the House will be familiar with the story of President Lyndon B. Johnson, LBJ, in America in the 1940s when he was in trouble in an election campaign.  He suggested to his aide-de-camp that he would use a scurrilous and unmentionable rumour that would be spread about a political opponent.  When he was asked by his campaign manager whether it was true, he said, \"Of course it's not, but let's hear the son of a gun deny it.\"  This is Deputy Mattie McGrath's cynical game.  For the sake of clarity, I am not making any further comparison between Deputy Mattie McGrath and LBJ.  Woe betide.<\/p><p>  This is a Minister in whom we can have confidence.

I have said very clearly that the Minister was wrong in the way he used that information on &quot;Prime Time&quot; about Deputy Wallace.  I very much welcome this evening the absolute clarity of the Minister's statement.  It is worth repeating:<blockquote>Do I think it was a mistake to mention the incident regarding Deputy Wallace? I explained my reasoning but put simply, I do.<\/blockquote>If more Ministers would respond with that kind of clarity, this House would be an awful lot better for it and I congratulate the Minister.  I also accept the Minister's solemn assurances that he was never &quot;in the business of receiving, seeking or maintaining confidential, sensitive information&quot;, as he said very clearly last Thursday.  I tabled written questions.<\/p><p>The Minister has again provided a clear answer to these questions.  If Fianna F&aacute;il does not believe this is the case, let us put out the facts rather than quote the <i>Irish Independent.<\/i> All I heard in the earlier debate was people reading from this morning's <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, adding nothing new and probably wasting time.  <\/p><p><br \/> I believe no politician should use confidential information from Garda sources for political purposes and I do not believe two wrongs make a right.  I believe Deputy McGrath has questions to answer about where he received his misleading information.  In my view, the charge he levelled against the Minister last Thursday during Leaders' Questions was an abuse of privilege in the House.  It was an attempt to smear the Minister but it also smeared the Garda.  Many garda&iacute; were horrified at the way in which information has been used in this House in recent weeks.<\/p><p><br \/> I represent a working-class constituency in Dublin South-East.  One of the hardest jobs I have is to convince people to give information to the Garda, telling them it will remain confidential.  However, given the kind of issues we hear about from the newspapers in recent days, people are now saying to me, &quot;Kevin, you told me that information that goes to the garda&iacute; is confidential and it'll never be used.  Look what we're reading about in the papers&quot;.  Confidential information is coming out all the time.<\/p><p><br \/> The Minister, Deputy Shatter, outlined the work he has carried out during the past two years and I commend him for it.  I have confidence in him, as Minister for Justice and Equality.  He has proved himself to be a reforming and crusading Minister in modernising our laws and our justice system, while taking on vested interests.  I found some aspects of this very difficult.  Deputy Collins tabled a motion of no confidence even before the Minister came into the House.  When this issue blew up on Friday, I asked the Minister to attend the House and explain the situation, which he did, and he gave further clarification.  Deputy Collins tabled this motion of no confidence on the &quot;Six-One News&quot;, without even hearing the Minister's response.  The Deputy forgets what is in the DNA of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I remember very clearly Fianna F&aacute;il putting taps on journalists' telephones, it is very much in the party's DNA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800049#WW03000","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369771500,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I must ask the Deputy to conclude.

What will be apparent in this Chamber tonight and tomorrow night, as we discuss the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is his clear track record of hard work and his determination to bring about much needed reform.  What some will not appreciate to the same degree, however, is that throughout his career the Minister has shown true compassion for groups and individuals, some of whom have been crushed by circumstance.  Let us remember this is the man who fought for the Magdalenes.  This is the man who appreciated that the extraordinary hurt experienced by these young women over the years could not be simply ignored.  He commissioned the report that highlighted the scale of the injustice done to these women.  He published it and is now implementing its recommendations.<\/p><p>  This is the man who, while on the Opposition benches, constantly raised questions about the way we treat children in care and about the poor outcomes many of those unfortunate children experienced.  He spoke about children in care and his fears concerning those children who died while in care.  He was unshakeable in his determination to seek answers and was clear about the scourge of our neglect of children.  It is significant that this Government is the first to have established a full Cabinet position of Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>  On another level, I wish to remind Deputies that while the leader of the party opposite is lauded as the man who brought in the smoking ban, it was Deputy Shatter who did much of the preparatory work on the health committee that led to the implementation of the ban and gave analysis of the need for the ban and its value.

He is impatient for change, as many of us are but he is also persistent.  He speaks out but also listens.  He concentrates on his portfolio but never loses sight of the human being his reforms will affect.  He is committed, diligent, focused and supportive of every person around the Cabinet table.  I cite, for example, the tremendous co-operation he and his Department gave to me in the Department of Health as we moved to set up an emergency aero-medical ambulance service, a first for the country and brought in during a time of deep recession, a service ignored by the previous government when money was flowing through the coffers.  There were many complex issues involved in this but with the Minister's strong commitment and with the support of helicopters from the Air Corps, we set up the emergency aero-medical service based at Custume Barracks in Athlone.  It has been an invaluable service and has saved many lives, in more than 200 completed missions.  The helicopter has a reach across the west and many persons alive today owe their survival to the fact that the helicopter brought them from the scene of an accident or because of their health problem to the hospital where lifesaving care was given.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, can rightly point to a long list of areas where he has implemented reform.

The Government will read out a list that will present the Minister as verging on a saint; the Opposition will argue a case that tries to present him in as bad a light as possible.  I will say something that may surprise the Minister.  For the record, I believe he is an immensely hardworking Minister and somebody of immense capability, with the potential to do great good in his portfolio in the time ahead.  Of course he will win this vote of confidence tomorrow.  However, I will outline to him substantial concerns my party has in regard to policing, the present and the historical relationship between his ministry and senior police in this State, and the need for change.  I ask the Minister to hear our case, which is made to him in sincerity.  We acknowledge his strengths but he also needs to hear the weaknesses.<\/p><p>  In terms of Garda morale, 140 stations will have closed across the State.  The argument that has been made by the Minister and the Garda Commissioner is that it is all about efficiency, modernisation and smart policing.  It is the way to go.  The Minister has spoken about the 750 stations that existed in the time of the RIC and the fact that these police officers would have cycled around, and the need for modernity.  The difficulty with his argument, however, is that he has reduced Garda numbers and presided over this reduction, by 10% in recent years from the previous government until now.  We see a net reduction of hundreds of Garda vehicles.  Any Member of this House or the Seanad who talks to their local garda&iacute;, from grass roots to senior level, will say they admit to us they are not happy with the changes, not because they are resisting change but because they see the impact in their communities.<\/p><p>The Minister and his Government colleagues must know that morale is genuinely low.  As recently as last week I spoke to a couple of garda&iacute; in this city who shared with me their concerns about how these cutbacks will affect their ability to do policing.  They are immensely impressive people who want to provide a service to this State, but we are failing them.<\/p><p> For the first time in its 35 year history the GRA did not invite the Minister of the day to its conference.  That is deeply worrying because nobody wins if front-line garda&iacute; have such concerns about a Minister.  I admit that the previous Minister, Dermot Ahern, had a similarly poor relationship, to the point that the former president of the GRA made a blistering speech which gave rise to considerable controversy.  We need to deal with this issue.<\/p><p> A couple of weeks ago the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission published a seven page summary of a 500 page report that it had submitted to the Minister.  The report expressed grave concern that the lessons of the Morris tribunal, which was the reason the commission was established, had not been learned.  It found that contemporaneous notes had not been maintained and expressed concern about the handling of informants.  The commission clearly felt it did not have the co-operation it should have received in investigating the Kieran Boylan affair and the serious allegation that an individual convicted of drug dealing found in possession of &euro;1.7 million of cocaine and heroine had his charges dropped without reasonable explanation.  The commission carried out an investigation in the public interest and put its concerns in the public domain but the Garda Commissioner dismissed the report by saying he did not have sufficient time to consider it.  Two weeks later we still do not know the Commissioner's response.  The Minister has stated that he wants to pull both sides together to address the issue but the Government needs to clearly outline what it intends to do to address the commission's concerns.<\/p><p> The penalty points debacle began when two honourable members of the Garda came across what they regarded as double standards in the administration of the law.  They expressed their concerns to the appropriate Garda authority, that is, the confidential recipient, but nothing happened for months.  They also raised the issue with the Comptroller and Auditor General in light of the financial implications and with the Road Safety Authority.  I understand they also made contact with the Taoiseach, who passed their information on to the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  These individuals were not hiding behind a cloak of anonymity; they were trying to change things for the good.  However, the Minister chose to ask senior police to investigate senior police.  That was the wrong decision.  He should have requested the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to investigate the issue because of the concern that senior police will not have sufficient independence or separation from the individuals they are investigating.  The Garda Commissioner and the Minister then chose to criticise the Garda whistleblowers instead of commending them and implied they were acting anonymously when their identities were in fact known.  In raising the matter with the appropriate authorities and putting it into the public domain when they felt they were getting nowhere with the internal structure, these two brave men have done a service to the people of this State because we will now have a new penalty points system that is accountable and provides a paper trail.  It is acceptable in certain circumstances to rescind penalty points as long as citizens clearly understand the reason.  These individuals should have been commended instead of criticised.  That was the wrong approach on the part of the Minister.  The overwhelming majority of garda&iacute;, from the bottom to the top, are people of the highest honour who want to serve this State.  There is nothing to fear in making the system better and more accountable.<\/p><p> The Government has indicated that it intends to introduce whistleblower legislation.  I remind the Minister that we got into this crisis because too many people in the private and public sectors failed to blow the whistle or shout stop.  For whatever reason, they did not speak out about what they knew to be wrong.  We now want to create an environment in which people can feel comfortable speaking out.  What encouragement will those who want to speak out get from this debacle?  One of the aforementioned whistleblowers has had to resign from the force and I am sure the other one is seriously considering his position.  That is in nobody's interest.  The matter was badly handled in a way that goes against stated Government policy.<\/p><p> In regard to the Deputy Wallace affair, I think the Minister looks back on that moment and wonders why he chose to make his comments.  It was wrong but it was not new.  For too long the relationship between senior garda&iacute; and the Ministers of the day was unhealthy.  They were almost interdependent.  The history extends back to the Se&aacute;n Doherty affair, the Michael McDowell business and the issues arising for Deputy O'Dea.  This unhealthy relationship needs to change.  Our amendment to the motion calls for an independent police authority, a proposal which Fine Gael used to support.  The authority would have independence in its budget and affairs, and would be insulated from political interference.  As an independent policing authority, the Garda should be fully accountable to the Oireachtas and joint policing committees.  Garda&iacute; would also be required to co-operate fully with the ombudsman and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  We need a new beginning to policing and the relationship between senior garda&iacute; and Ministers.  The information on Deputy Wallace came into the Minister's possession but he was wrong to use it.  It was a huge error of judgment on the part of the Minister.<\/p><p> In regard to the issues raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath, the Minister put his own version of what happened at that checkpoint into the public domain and repeated it in the House tonight.  He may be entirely correct in his assessment but there are different presentations of what happened that night.  The only people who can shed light on the matter are the garda&iacute; who were on duty.  While the Garda Commissioner has indicated that no record exists of the incident, there must be a record of the checkpoint itself because a checkpoint with a mandatory breathalyser test can only be sanctioned by somebody at the level of inspector or higher.  The record of the checkpoint would set out the number of tests administered and their outcome, when they took place and who was on duty.  That information would be passed onto the local superintendent and to Garda headquarters.  We call on the Garda Commissioner to speak to the garda&iacute; who were on duty that night to confirm or contest the Minister's version of events in order to put the issue to bed.  Checkpoints and stoppages are not the central issue in this affair.  It is more important that the public have faith in the Garda and its accountability.  The Morris tribunal found that a small minority of garda&iacute; in my county of Donegal behaved reprehensibly and abused their power.  We were supposed to have learned lessons from that tribunal.  We subsequently established the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to move us in the right direction.  Let us take the next step by establishing an independent policing authority which would be completely free from political interference while remaining fully accountable to these Houses.  <\/p><p> I have been marking the Minister from the Opposition benches and have seen many things that impressed me.  I do not dispute his immense capacity or desire to introduce reform and improve matters.<\/p><p>He has waited most of his life to become Minister for Justice and Equality and I am sure he wishes to complete his term of office.  If he survives this period, I ask him to learn lessons from recent events.  If he manages to remain Minister for Justice and Equality for the duration of the Government, I ask him to introduce the reforms that are necessary.  He should also allow the allegations by Garda whistleblowers concerning penalty points to be examined independently by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  There is nothing to fear from having a spotlight shone on this issue.<\/p><p><br \/> There are two certainties with regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  First, morale among the men and women of the force is at an all-time low.  Whether the Minister accepts, agrees or understands this, garda&iacute; feel demoralised as a result of the recent plethora of cutbacks and the impact they are having.  This is an important issue which must be addressed through engagement and by winning hearts and minds.  This will require the reversal of some of the cutbacks the Government has made.  The second certainty is that we must restore public confidence in how policing is carried out at senior levels and the manner in which it relates to the Department of Justice and Equality.  Those are the two challenges facing the Minister.<\/p><p><br \/> The Minister will survive the vote of confidence tomorrow night as the Opposition will vote virtually<i>en bloc<\/i>in favour of the motion, while the Government side will fully support the Minister.  That is fair enough but once the matter has been closed, we need to know that lessons have been learned.  Neither the Minister nor I is perfect but we need to move on and make things better.  That is the challenge arising from this debacle and I hope the Minister is up to meeting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800050#XX01300","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369772700,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important Private Members' motion expressing no confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality.

The independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has communicated its complete dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Garda hierarchy has been responding to its queries.  It is obvious that the office of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is being treated in an arrogant and disrespectful manner by the Garda hierarchy.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister stated he received information by way of an aside about a Deputy allegedly using his mobile telephone while driving.  Two issues arise in this context.  Either the garda&iacute; who stopped the Deputy in question should have issued penalty points at the time and entered this information in the PULSE system or, having decided not to do so, it should have been the end of the matter.  The Minister's explanation that he learned about this incident through an aside reminds one of the language used by dramatists such as the famous John B. Keane who, when writing his manuscripts, used to include asides to guide his stage actors and directors.  The Minister and Garda Commissioner should behave as befits the holders of professional constitutional positions.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister's explanation in response to Deputy Mattie McGrath's allegation that he failed to complete a breathalyser test does not answer the question people have been asking.  The Garda Commissioner must state what procedure should be followed by garda&iacute; when such circumstances arise.  If it was or is the case that people are required to give blood or urine samples at the appropriate police station, why did this not occur on the occasion acknowledged by the Minister as having taken place three or four years ago?  The Commissioner must speak with lucidity and clarify the position.<\/p><p><br \/>  A former Garda chief superintendent, Mr. John O'Brien, who carried out an examination on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in 2008, states in today's <i>Irish Independent<\/i> newspaper that he highlighted many of the current issues, including individual Garda discretion, in his 2008 report.  He states: &quot;The idea that 13,000 garda&iacute; could somehow operate individual discretion is not tenable.&quot;  It is unfair to place the burden of responsibility on individual members of the Garda.  Clearly, no action was taken on foot of the report produced by Mr. O'Brien, the former head of the Garda traffic policy division.<\/p><p><br \/>  The dogs in the street know that appointments to the higher echelons of the Garda authority have been substantially politicised.  Members of the public take the view that the ruling elite has become so incestuous in the making of appointments that unethical behaviour can be sometimes present.  For this reason, when the current Garda Commissioner retires, he should be replaced by a head of police of a major city in another jurisdiction, for example, the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom.

This Bill is an attempt to pre-empt and subvert the democratic decision of public sector workers to reject the Government's attempt to impose further cuts in their pay and conditions.  It shows the Government was not acting in good faith in the negotiations.  While it showed a willingness to negotiate, it also put a gun to the heads of public servants by giving itself the power to impose whatever measures it wished on them.<\/p><p>  If it had negotiated with or dealt with public sector workers in good faith, none of this would have been necessary because the original Croke Park agreement was supposed to run until the middle of 2014.  It broke faith with public sector workers in the first instance by seeking a new deal.  Subsequently, public sector workers rejected a second deal in a democratic ballot, despite the brow-beating and threats deployed by the Government and certain trade union leaders as they sought to force workers to accept further attacks on their pay and conditions.  The Government did not accept that decision and has decided instead to ram through this legislation in an attempt to pre-empt another vote.  This appears to be a sinister, pincer movement by the Government, on the one hand, and sections of the trade union movement, on the other.  Its aim is to demoralise ordinary workers and force through a further attack on them as quickly as possible before people's feet have even touched the ground.  That is utterly reprehensible.<\/p><p> Despite what the Minister, Deputy Howlin, stated with regard to the arrangements with the troika, it is simply not true that there are no alternatives to doing what is proposed.  Some of us on this side of the House have pointed out on numerous occasions that there are fairer alternatives to attacking public sector employees, low and middle income workers in general, the unemployed and the vulnerable.  In the past week or two the evidence relating to those alternatives has been presented to us.  For example, one of today's newspapers outlines how if one firm, Abbott Laboratories, had paid the 12.5% tax the Government claims to impose on the profits of corporations, it would have been obliged to hand over in excess of &euro;200 million in tax.  However, that firm actually paid 0% tax.  We have discovered that Apple, with &euro;22 billion in profits, only paid 0.5% tax.  Other companies on the relevant list, such as Google and Facebook, pay pitiful amounts in tax.  Instead of taking a little more in tax from these staggeringly wealthy corporations, the Government is intent on inflicting further suffering on ordinary workers, imposing more cuts on their incomes and reducing their quality of life to an even greater degree.  These people have been hammered during the past five years and, as a result of this legislation, they will not receive a pay increase for the next eight years.  What is proposed is despicable and undemocratic and it should be resisted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800052#ZZ00700","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369773300,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Friday's mail brought two items to me, the first of which was the hard copy of this misnamed Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill.  The second was my SIPTU centenary membership card celebrating the legacy of James Connolly and Jim Larkin.  I was obliged to pinch myself on both accounts.  In the first instance, this has to be the worst named item of legislation in the history of the State.  Initially I asked myself whether those in government had come to their senses, had taken stock of the irrefutable evidence to the effect that wealthy multinational corporations pay a pittance in tax in this country and had finally decided to take emergency action to deal with this matter.  Instead, we find that \"Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest\" is a fancy term for slashing public sector pay.  This must count as one of the most outrageous items of legislation ever introduced in this House.<\/p><p>  The reason this Bill has been introduced is because trade union members had the effrontery to exercise their democratic right and reject proposals to worsen their pay and conditions.  Rather than acknowledging that democratic vote, this Government, which includes the Labour Party - an organisation which purports to represent workers - has decided to repackage and rebrand the deal to which I refer and force it back in front of the workers to whom I refer.  Just in case they might have the audacity to reject the deal again, the Government has introduced this legislation and is stating, &quot;Right lads, we have the gun here and the choices are quite simple: either you shoot yourselves or we will blow your heads off&quot;.  We absolutely reject the notion that this is an appropriate response in a modern democracy.  In actuality, it is completely abhorrent.<\/p><p>  This Bill gives the Government the power to reduce the pay of public servants and increase their working hours.  This is happening against the background of the loss to date of 30,000 public sector jobs.  The legislation makes provision for the axing of even further jobs.  It also provides for increased working hours, a pay freeze for up to eight years and lower pay for new entrants.  It is somewhat ironic that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, launched a heroic campaign last year in respect of proposals to take on new nurses on salaries that would only amount to 80% of those of existing nurses.  Only eight people applied for the 1,000 positions advertised.  Under the current deal, the Government is recommending that new entrants should receive salaries which amount to only 85% of those paid to existing staff.  In addition, a suspension of increments will apply in respect of those in receipt of salaries of under &euro;65,000 per annum if their unions do not sign up to the deal.  The Bill also eliminates overtime and deals a solid blow to pensioners.  The latter is particularly disgusting in view of the fact that pensioners were not given a say in respect of the agreement.  The Government is talking about cutting the pensions of those in receipt of pensions of less than &euro;32,500.<\/p><p>  The myth that was perpetrated to the effect that the Labour Party, in government, would cushion the blow of Fine Gael has been exploded by the legislation before the House.  Divide and rule is now the order of the day.  Under this policy, trade unions from certain sectors are arguing that the Government should put the pay of workers in other sectors rather than touching their members.  This is the complete antithesis of trade unionism and of the tenet that an injury to one is an injury to all.  A solidarity campaign should be launched against the wealthy in society who have got away scot free to date.  A struggle by public sector workers would be supported by every citizen as the only way to defend the public interest in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800053#AAA00200","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1369773300,"counter":679,"content":"<p>The discussion relating to this issue seems to focus on pay and on how much it costs to pay people.  It has been stated that civil servants in Ireland are paid more than their counterparts in other countries.  However, one does not hear the other side of the argument.  In the same way that there are two sides to a balance sheet, there are two sides to this debate.  The aspect of this matter which is not being discussed relates to what the Government has done to reduce the cost of living.  It is not the case that civil or public servants want to be millionaires, to take two, three, four or five holidays per year or to drive around in really big and expensive cars.  All they really want is a decent quality of life.  At a meeting members of the Technical Group had with representatives from the troika, a discussion took place about a particular newspaper headline in which it was stated that someone in this country earning &euro;65,000 could not afford to survive.  The lads and lassies from the troika found this extraordinary and the guy from the IMF said that some of its top economists only earn &euro;65,000 per year and can survive on that amount.  They could survive on that amount not in Ireland but elsewhere.  The reason for this is that it does not cost a fortune to live in many other countries where, we are told, civil and public servants are paid less.<\/p><p>  One of the reasons people cannot afford to live here is because the Government has done nothing about people's debt.  There has been no real debt write-down.  The only way one can get such a write-down is if the bank is willing to give it to one under the Government's Personal Insolvency Act.  Of course, if one is involved with Independent News and Media, however, one will receive a write-down.  One particular owner of that institution received a &euro;10 million write-down from a bank that is 99.9% Irish-owned.  If the Government arranged write-downs for ordinary people, perhaps they would then be in a position to survive on less.  However, it has not taken any action in this regard.  Neither has it done anything about the cartelisation of Irish business.  Fine Gael stated that it was going to do something about our absolutely useless Competition Authority and that it would ensure the latter would be properly resourced.  It has not been properly resourced and there are still only two garda&iacute; assigned to investigate problems with cartels throughout the country.  It is because of this that people are obliged to pay high prices in shops and that local authorities must pay more for raw materials such as concrete for building roads or whatever.  As a result, the cost of living in this country is massively high.<\/p><p>  There is no proper accountability among local authorities, so rates are high.  Money is being wasted left, right and centre and businesses are then obliged to pass on the cost involved to consumers.  The Government stated that it would do something in respect of upward-only rents.  However, action has not been taken.  This is despite the fact that Deputy McNamara of the Labour Party has stated that, in legal terms, something could be done.  Those in government would want to make up their minds because their lack of action is ensuring that prices are being kept high.<\/p><p>As such, one needs a small fortune to survive in this country.  The Government has put the cart before the horse.  It has had two and a half years to bring prices down but has not done so.  Now, it expects to get blood out of a stone.  This will not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800053#AAA00300","speaker":"1084","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369773900,"counter":681,"content":"<p>The Government has no mandate for this draconian, anti-trade union legislation.

Remember what the Government parties stated during the general election - \"Frankfurt's way or Labour's way\", the vulnerable would be protected, the bondholders would be burned and the banks would not get another cent.  The Labour Party has finally and completely turned its back on its roots, history and supporters.  The Bill is outrageous anti-trade union legislation and the Labour Party and its Minister should be ashamed.<\/p><p>  Free elections, free trade unions, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and academic freedom are among the pillars of democratic society.  Free trade unions are unions that can say &quot;No&quot; to State demands and vote freely on the merits of issues without incurring legislative penalties.  Individuals must retain the right to join or remain in a trade union of their choice without legislative penalty.  These rights are being circumscribed in this legislation.<\/p><p>  Not only is the Bill likely to be unconstitutional, but it is also in breach of international human rights law.  Its introduction by a Labour Minister is shocking and unprecedented.  The only comparison dates from 1941 when a Fianna F&aacute;il Government introduced legislation to limit freedom of association that was later declared unconstitutional.  This Bill heavily circumscribes the right of workers to be in trade unions of their choice, penalises them for not being in &quot;Yes&quot; unions and curtails their right to freedom of association.<\/p><p>  In 1913, striking workers refused to sign what was called the paper, an undertaking not to join Larkin's union.  In spite of significant state pressure, brutality and hunger, workers refused to sign it.  Some 100 years later, the Labour Party and its Minister are trying to force trade unionists to sign another piece of paper, an agreement that will be registered at the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and have the effect of imposing cuts on other unions and workers.<\/p><p>  The Bill has other outrageous elements, including the introduction of cuts, without any consultation, to pensions valued at more than &euro;32,500 or, in the case of surviving spouses, approximately &euro;16,000.  The Minister has once again stated that this will be the last ask, but how can we believe him?  He reneged on the commitment under the Croke Park agreement to restore cuts to lower paid workers.  There was also to be no further ask during the agreement's course.

Recently, I had the privilege of reading <i>Strumpet City<\/i> again for the first time in a while.  It reminded me of the reasons for having trade union leaders - workers broke bad laws to get recognition for their unions, to have the right to organise and to seek higher pay and proper conditions.<\/p><p><br \/>  Undoubtedly, members of the Labour Party, including the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will take part in the celebrations and make speeches about that heroic struggle.  The 1913 battle was in response to bullying by employers, in particular the infamous William Martin Murphy and IBEC's predecessor.  They locked out any worker who did not sign a statement disowning the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, ITGWU, Larkin's union.  Now, a Labour Minister is engaging in bullying tactics to force public sector workers to accept cuts in pay and conditions.  A gun is being put to their heads - accept the Haddington Road agreement or else.  This and previous Governments have used the imperialist tactic of divide and conquer, pitting worker against worker and sector against sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  The right of workers to vote on a proposal's merits is being undermined by the Bill, a coercive clause in which threatens to freeze the increments due to workers in the public sector unless they sign up to the agreement.  The Bill contains a provision for the suspension of incremental progression for three years for all public servants unless they are covered by a collective agreement that modifies the suspension's terms and has been registered with the LRC.  As such, unless a trade union signs up to the agreement, its members' increments will be frozen for three years even if they are paid less than &euro;65,000.  This draconian measure is far beyond anything contained in the original Croke Park II proposals.<\/p><p><br \/>  Some &euro;1 billion is still being taken out of these workers' pockets and, consequently, the economy.  This affects workers' ability to put their children through college, which is the only path forward for many people if they are to avoid leaving the country.

Many public servants are unhappy with another reduction in their pensions, particularly retired civil servants on low pensions.  However, it is obvious to everyone, even people in the public service, that many in the private sector have lost all or most of their pensions.  In terms of pensions, most of the pain is being felt in the private sector.<\/p><p>  One such private sector fund is the defined benefit pension scheme at Permanent TSB.  This issue has developed as a consequence of management's reaction to a request by the Minister for Finance to review pay and benefits and to find savings of between 6% and 10%.  The request followed on from a report by Mercer, entitled &quot;Remuneration Review of Covered Institutions&quot;, which was commissioned by the Minister for Finance and published last March.<\/p><p>  Permanent TSB's management has advised the Minister of its plan to make the required savings by ceasing payments to the defined benefit pension scheme and diverting funds to the new defined contribution scheme.  It is estimated that the saving will be approximately 8% per annum.  I have received a response from the Minister regarding this issue.  From that response, I gather that the arrangement has his blessing.  The Department of Finance should reconsider the matter.<\/p><p>The effect on the individuals in question would be devastating.  The cessation of payments would force the trustees to wind up the scheme.  That would have a massively detrimental effect on active and deferred members and could potentially reduce future benefits by up to 50%.  Nationally, approximately 3,000 staff &ndash; past and present - are affected, including approximately 120 people in my constituency of Waterford.<\/p><p> In Permanent TSB there are two separate defined benefit schemes, and one is in better shape than the other.  There is a liability of &euro;127 million in the pension fund to which I refer.  As I understand it, in 2010 it became clear that many defined benefit schemes were in deficit and the Department of Social Protection asked the trustees of funds to submit proposals to deal with the deficits.  A funding proposal or recovery plan was required for all funds in deficit before the end of November 2010, but that was postponed indefinitely.  The feeling among staff in Permanent TSB is that senior management at the State-controlled bank &ndash; it is important that we remember that &ndash; are finding the savings by hitting the ordinary staff member rather than taking any of the pain themselves.  The question staff of Permanent TSB have is whether the Minister for Finance should allow management to wind up unilaterally a pension scheme belonging to a State-controlled bank without negotiation or before any other potential options for saving the fund have been properly examined.  I can understand why they would ask such a question.  Anyone would.<\/p><p> We all understand that many defined benefit schemes are in trouble but in this case there is a very strong sense that other possible solutions have not been examined, for example, ring-fencing benefits before a certain date and from that date forward all contributions would go to a defined contribution scheme, with future benefits payable depending on fund performance.  Other possible solutions include allowing employees to make larger contributions, extending the retirement date or doing away with consumer price index, CPI, increases.  I feel strongly that this is something the Minister for Finance should reconsider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800054#BBB00700","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369774500,"counter":688,"content":"<p>This is a very significant Bill which is being introduced as a financial emergency measure in the public interest to try to stabilise the public finances and meet our obligations in terms of the reduction of our deficit.  Everyone is aware that we are in difficult economic times and our financial circumstances mean we face tough choices.  If we do not make the correct decisions now, it will have catastrophic consequences for the future of the economy and will threaten the job prospects of the current and next generation of Irish people.<\/p><p>  I am strongly aware that quality, not quantity, is the way forward to create an effective, well-honed economically viable Government.  However, even with the considerable pruning of excess by the Government, more needs to be done to achieve the change on waste that the public knows is taking place.  As never before, it is time for the concept of jobs for the boys to be thrown out.  An inflated Government that panders to the deflated egos of politicians is a luxury we can no longer afford, in the same way that we can no longer afford bonuses, allowances for committee Chairs and other committee officeholders.  In addition to the provisions contained in the Bill, I wish further wide-ranging Oireachtas reform to be introduced as a direct response to the calls from those who should be calling the tune, namely, the taxpayers.<\/p><p>  It is hypocritical of politicians to call for cutbacks and to take from the old, the young and the vulnerable yet refuse to share the pain themselves.  We should never put the interests of bankers and developers before those of ordinary people.  Old habits die hard.  Freedom of information has revealed to taxpayers the lifestyle and excesses of some current and former politicians.  People are no longer willing to shoulder the burden alone.<\/p><p>  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last week, we were treated to information on the trappings of power and the waste with which Fianna F&aacute;il used public funds to refurbish the offices of Ministers and former taoisigh.  This included the spending of &euro;250,000 on an office for the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy John McGuinness, when he was a Minister of State, and &euro;181,000 on an office for Mr. Bertie Ahern, after he stepped down as Taoiseach and was serving as a backbencher and which he seldom used.  The public are entitled to know how that was allowed to happen, as they have to make good the deficits caused.<\/p><p>  The current leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was present in the Chamber this evening.  He was the senior Minister in the same Department as the then Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, when &euro;250,000 was spent on his office, and he served in Cabinet throughout the Ahern and Cowen eras.  He must come into this House to make a statement on the amounts wasted on ministerial offices and elsewhere in his 14 years as Minister.  He should also explain the reason he told some of his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues to stay away from tonight's Private Members' debate.  However, that is another issue.<\/p><p>  With many of my colleagues, I have been frustrated by the seeming inability of successive Governments to call elected public representatives and senior civil servants to account.  It flies in the face of moral and ethical accountability for former senior Members of the Oireachtas and senior civil servants to be perceived to be above the law and for them to retire on massive pensions.  That is an outrage and an insult to democracy, as it adversely impacts on everyone who depends on the integrity of public representatives and civil servants in positions of authority not to use power for private gain nor to deflect attention and retribution.  It is also an insult to honest, hard-working citizens who abide by the law of the land.  There is no place to hide for most people who do otherwise.  No one must be allowed to be above the law.  Leadership is important in a community of citizens.<\/p><p>  In the Bill we show our will to demonstrate our appreciation of the very difficult times that many families and individuals have experienced.  This is a defining time for our country, where public services and remuneration must be radically overhauled as we face real challenges.  Reform is vital to the national interest.  Public service reform is not a criticism of public servants.  Public servants have a fine tradition of dedication and make a major contribution to the economic and social life of this country.  Citizens and businesses expect a modern public service to improve continually and deliver services faster, better and more cost-effectively.  We must improve structures to make the public service more citizen-centred in delivering services and in the provision of infrastructure.  The public must have a greater input into policymaking to ensure services are designed and delivered to meet the highest standards.  A greater knowledge of the services available and access to them with ease is important, as that attracts the confidence and support of citizens.<\/p><p>  When I was first elected to the county council 28 years ago, the manager, county secretary and county engineer were in command.  I got a decision on a query the same day on which I made the request.  Now, one has to wait weeks for a decision because of the bureaucracy and red tape inherent in the system.  The same goes for Departments, the HSE, SUSI, and other bodies where one has to wait ages for a reply.  More efficiency is required to achieve greater savings.  We would also save money if we used improved technology to help in the delivery of services such as e-mail, telephone text and the Internet, for example, and give people choices on their use.  Better value for money and greater efficiency is important.  There is nothing wrong with radical reform and transformation.  There are approximately 400,000 talented people working in the public service and the key is to unlock that potential to the benefit of all citizens.<\/p><p>  A number of important views and issues were taken into account in the finalisation of the Bill before us.  Partnership involves consensus and eliminates the right to accept what is favourable and reject what does not suit.  The Bill contains measures to reduce the top-heavy nature of Government and the public service pay and pensions bill by 2015, ensuring the pain is equally shared by all sectors of society, whether it is the Government, politicians or certain public servants on rates of pay in excess of &euro;65,000.<\/p><p>The backs of the taxpayers have been broken by the burden of carrying the rich and privileged for too long.  No sector of society should be immune from the negative impact of the economic downturn.  This Bill is important, in that Members of the Oireachtas are showing leadership by putting their own ship in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800055#CCC00200","speaker":"1062","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369775100,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I am sorry but I must call the Deputy's colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800056#DDD00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1369775100,"counter":691,"content":"<p>While I was going to move on to the subject of white-collar crime, I hope to have an opportunity to do so on another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800056#DDD00300","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1369775100,"counter":692,"content":"<p>I am sure the Deputy will have another opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800056#DDD00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1369775100,"counter":693,"content":"<p>Over the past two years, there has been a clear stabilisation of the public finances and there have been many positive events signalling Ireland's economic recovery.  It must be acknowledged that getting to this point has not been easy, has required great efforts by the vast majority of citizens and has affected almost all aspects of Irish life.  It is sad and disheartening to observe some public commentators practically hoping that things would go wrong for whatever reason, be it because they considered they would be proven right or for political benefit.  The focus of such commentators has been on the negative with little attention paid to the positive developments that have been crucial to restoring this country.  It is timely to recall some of the aforementioned positive developments that have taken place.  These include the promissory note deal, which removed the onerous and overbearing annual repayment requirement of &euro;3.1 billion and reduced significantly the amount the State must repay, the fulfilment of the Government's commitment to protect the weekly social welfare rate and to leave unchanged income tax rates, as well as political reform, including reductions to the salaries and allowances of Ministers and Deputies and an injection of transparency with the abolition of unvouched expenses.  In addition, there has been a &euro;2.5 billion investment in job creation measures, including the first ever co-ordinated and measured action plan for jobs, which hopefully will continue to deliver real results.  The vulnerable have been protected by restoring the minimum wage and exempting 330,000 people from the universal social charge and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been created.  It is the first Department to focus on maximising the effectiveness and efficiency of the public services in the history of the State.<\/p><p>  This last point is important because an inescapable fact is that 35% of Government spending is on the public sector pensions and pay bill.  During the so-called good times, the private sector, through companies paying a variety of taxes, was able to support the increase of pay in the public sector, as well as growing public sector pension costs.  At present, however, Ireland has a private sector that is recovering slowly from the worst global economic crash in living memory.  Many private sector workers have found themselves, through no fault of their own, out of work and dependent, often for the first time, on social welfare payments.  An interesting point, albeit one that appears to have been forgotten by many, is that if a company in the private sector experiences economic or financial difficulties, it must take decisive action to reduce costs in the hope that the viability of the company can be secured.  In many cases, this involves payroll reductions for the simple reason that the latter often is a company's largest cost.  The same notion must apply to the public sector, which does not operate in a vacuum.  Unfortunately, despite the efforts of all Members to play a part in the restoration of the State's finances, the State continues to be obliged to borrow approximately &euro;1 billion per month to meet the shortfall between revenue and expenditure.  It simply is inconceivable that, as the Government is obliged to close and eliminate the deficit, one of its largest sources of expenditure would be sacrosanct and remain untouched.<\/p><p>  The Bill before Members is twofold.  First, it introduces the legislation that would permit changes to the level of remuneration in the public sector which, as I have stated previously, will be necessary if Ireland is to complete successfully its economic recovery.  Second, and most importantly, however, it is necessary to prevent such measures from applying to public sector workers and unions which have signed up to the public sector stability agreement or the Haddington Road agreement.  This agreement is the result of the Trojan efforts on the part of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, the Government, representatives of public sector workers' unions and obviously, the chairman of the Labour Relations Commission, Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  Very little in life is ever achieved by descending into conjecture and argument or by simply refusing to enter into dialogue.  This agreement is proof of the benefit of staying at the table, listening to viewpoints, acknowledging problems, considering workable solutions and respectfully negotiating.  Everyone involved in this process deserves to be commended on their dedication and commitment to the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800056#DDD00500","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1369775100,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As this country continues to spend more than it earns, thereby storing up debt for future generations, Members must take on the difficult task of decreasing expenditure until the first step along the route for recovery is achieved, namely, spending within our means and therefore, I welcome the provisions of this Bill.  It aims to reduce the remuneration of public servants earning more than &euro;65,000, to reduce the pension of former public servants and to suspend increments for three years.  Reservations have been expressed about reducing the pensions of former public servants but it must be remembered that for those in receipt of pensions of &euro;32,500, this will reflect a reduction of 2%, while for those in receipt of pensions of more than &euro;100,000 per annum, it will represent a contribution of 28%.<\/p><p>  A number of the Bill's provisions are welcome and long overdue.  Redeployment measures will be revised but the guideline redeployment distance will remain at 45 km.  I believe this to be sensible, as many families could not cope with the additional costs redeployment could place upon them.  Incidentally, I also believe an overhaul of the transfer system should be carried out to identify opportunities to transfer staff, where it would benefit both the person involved and the service in general.  Given the Minister is keen to reduce public service numbers, I also believe the Government should give serious consideration to extending the availability of career breaks within the public service to allow those who are in a position to and who wish to take a break to so do, thereby freeing places for new graduates who are finding it very difficult to enter the workforce at present.<\/p><p>  The health service continues to take a large percentage of the country's income and it is only natural that health and education are two areas the Government will continually seek to preserve amid difficult financial circumstances.  While innovative measures have been put in place in an effort to maximise the effectiveness of the resources currently deployed, this has placed an increased workload on health care staff across all areas.  I welcome the fact that expenditure on agency and locum staff is to be reduced with directly employed nurses and interns providing the compensatory hours.  I also welcome that health centre staff who work on Sundays, traditionally a family day and a day of rest, are to be paid at double time for the work involved.  Another aspect of the Bill's provisions concerns the suspension of increments for three years.  Forgoing money one never had in some respects is much easier than having existing income reduced but many people have borrowed money in the belief their wages would increase incrementally in future years and I acknowledge the proposed suspension for three years will cause hardship to many.  As many cuts to income are being made across the board, with more to come if our finances are to be brought into order, fairness is key.  People must perceive these cuts to be fair and that they apply to all.  I welcome that the Bill provides that public servants affected will include Members of the Oireachtas other than the President, as well as the Judiciary.  The need to ensure that those who have most contribute most must be uppermost in Members' minds at all times and I believe this imperative is reflected in the Bill, which also places a significant burden on higher-paid public servants, both serving and retired, as well as affecting all public servants through the suspension of increments.<\/p><p>  Before concluding, I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has handled the negotiations to this point, as well as the trade union movement and Mr. Kieran Mulvey of the Labour Relations Commission.  When the topic of conversation is reducing one's pay, it certainly will be neither easy nor popular.  However, before the Minister concludes his contribution to the Second Stage debate, he should indicate whether he still believes the &euro;300 million in savings will be achieved this year and whether the &euro;1 billion in total savings is achievable over three years.  The country is at a stage at which the Government must lead.  It has set targets and must now follow through on those targets because that will be important, as this is part of the troika programme, to get us out of this situation.  The title of the Bill reflects its purpose, as these are emergency measures in the public interest and while they are unpalatable for all those affected by them, they nevertheless are necessary if the required savings to get this country back on track are to be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800056#DDD00600","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1369775100,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I understand I have until 10 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800056#DDD00700","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1369775100,"counter":696,"content":"<p>As the debate will adjourn at 10 p.m., the Deputy will have some time on the next day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800056#DDD00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1369775100,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Yes.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill but must note that like so many other extremely important legislative items, this Bill is being rushed through the House and this is entirely of the Government's making.  It is time that when Members are trying to effect fundamental change, they take the time to do it properly.  It frequently happens that efforts to get an answer or a fix result in the creation of a chaotically complicated system that no one understands fully.  The first point with which I will agree is one which when in government, Fianna F&aacute;il was trying to explain to the members of the current Administration, namely, that if one is continuously spending more than one is taking in, it is not sustainable and something must give.  I am glad the Government realises that for the long-term stability of the country, one must balance the books.<\/p><p> In terms of the second thing the Government has realised, when in opposition it thought that by cutting the salaries of a few higher paid people it would raise huge sums of money.  Anybody could have told it that the public service is a pyramid, with many more people at the bottom than at the top, and therefore the amount of money it would save by making significant cuts at the top end would never be great in financial terms but this Government always tried to give the impression in opposition that this alone would save the billions of euro needed to be saved.  When the hard reality hit, however, it realised it does not work like that and that its basic mathematics were wrong.  I believe it is important that the people at the top take the biggest cuts by a fair distance, not because it will save the Government a great deal of money but because it is important from the point of view of example.<\/p><p> I am surprised to see the proposal in the Bill to cut those in the public service earning over &euro;185,000 a year by only 10%.  It is derisory and it is very difficult to explain the reason for those cuts to people who are experiencing cuts in different directions, heaped with extra expenses, living on &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 a year and who are working hard.  When the salary of someone on &euro;185,000 a year is averaged out, it probably works out at 6% or 7% of their total salary.  I do not believe people think that is fair or leading by example.<\/p><p> We are then told that these cuts are only temporary.  I hope they are only temporary for those at the lower end but at the higher end there is a need to bring down high pay in the private and the public sectors to reasonable proportions because the wealth of society is not only the total wealth created.  We would look to societies throughout the world where those with huge wealth and those in huge poverty live side by side.  There are two things a country must do.  The first is to create wealth and the second is to distribute it fairly but, unfortunately, in the western world the second one seems to be losing out, and each group at the top end appears to argue cogently that they are entitled to these enormous salaries when ordinary people are struggling.  We must have a much more comprehensive debate than this Bill will allow on the entire structure of wages in our society.<\/p><p> I heard a Deputy boast earlier that we did not cut social welfare.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, is in the Chamber.  If my memory serves me right he is in the county with the biggest number of farmers on farm assist.  Does he know what he has done?  If a farmer is earning &euro;100 a week on farm assist from his farm, he or she has lost &euro;30 per week in the past two years courtesy of the Minister of State's Government.  He or she is effectively paying 100% tax on the farm income, in other words, one euro of social welfare is taken off for every euro earned on the farm income.<\/p><p> The Government has hit lone parents very hard.  I cannot understand, when we have a female Minister, why the Government has hit pensioners who had a low average because they may have worked between the ages of 18 to 25 or 30 and took time out to rear children, which in my view is a very important opportunity that some people chose or were forced into.  It is not necessarily the only choice but it is a valid choice that society should recognise.  They then returned to the workforce.  For some reason that Minister hit them hugely in terms of their pensions, and these are people at the bottom end.<\/p><p> We then had the across-the-board cut imposed on pensioners.  The Minister of State would say the Government did not touch the headline rate.  It did not; it just did it through the household package but a euro is a euro, and it has cut the household package significantly.  At the same time for those earning more than &euro;185,000 it proposes to make a cut of 5.5% on any amount up to &euro;80,000, 8% on the amount between &euro;80,000 and &euro;150,000, 9% on the amount between &euro;150,000 and &euro;185,000, and 10% on the amount over &euro;185,000.  To someone earning &euro;200,000, therefore, that 10% only relates to &euro;15,000 of that salary.  When it is averaged out the cut is between 7% and 8%.  I will work out the figure in the next few days but it does not make any difference to the principle.<\/p><p> I believe it was wrong not to honour the Croke Park agreement in full and work it to its ultimate end because in terms of quality of service, there were huge gains to be achieved in honouring an agreement and seeing it out to the end of its term.  In terms of the chaotic way all of this has been negotiated, when it could not get the union movement as a totality to agree, sweeteners were given and side deals done union by union.  That is a very bad precedent in terms of public service negotiation.  I can see in the future a template that the Government has created causing mayhem where certain unions it has now put into a very strong position will be able to negotiate extraordinarily good deals for themselves by this union by union methodology.  That is a wrong way to approach this process.<\/p><p> I note there has been an amendment to the issue of the increments but just because public sentiment does not understand the structure of public service pay because it has not been explained properly does not give anybody an excuse to create inequalities.  I know we did it but I have never been a great proponent of the starter pay being lower and people who have done the same period of service as other workers not being able to achieve the same pay as other workers.  I believe in the concept of equal pay.  We have now gone from gender equalities to age inequalities.  I cannot understand how it is fair that if one happens to be at the top of the increment scale one is immune to this particular cutback but if one is at the bottom, one gets the cut.  Surely that is unfair.  My belief is that all public servants in similar circumstances should be cut by the same amount.  That one has got to the top of the scale should not make one any more immune to the cut than the person who is on a much lower salary and is now being held back.<\/p><p> The reality of the increment scale is that it was part of the public service wage.  It would be fair to say that if the increments are abolished we would have to bring the lower ones up to the mean and the higher ones down to the mean, and the mean would become the new wage.  There would be no saving in that on average because over time people were constantly leaving the public service or moving up to new grades and they were replaced by people at the bottom.  The myth that increments were costing so many million a year was mathematically not true because if increments were abolished, we would have had to adjust the basic wage to the mean and we would have ended up with the average wage bill we have now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800056#DDD00900","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369775700,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to conclude.
