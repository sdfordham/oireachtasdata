I will retable that Adjournment matter following the break.<\/p><p>I refer to the need for a debate on the health service plan.  I have raised a few instances of what is happening in the health service, as have many other colleagues.  Last week the case of a seven year old with infantile scoliosos who had lost her medical card was brought to my attention.  She is not entitled to a GP card and the HSE will not even pay for the back brace that she needs.  That is what is happening on the ground.  I respectfully ask the Leader again to do his best to get the Minister for Health into the House to outline what is happening in the health service and how services will be delivered this year and, in particular, to discuss the effects of the decisions being made on people such as this seven year old girl.  She has lost her medical card, but her family cannot afford to pay for the brace that she needs.  Her father had to pay &euro;1,500 on his credit card for her.  None of us wants to see this happen and I am certain none of the Government Members wants to see it either.  However, the House is not sitting tomorrow.  If the Minister was willing to do so, he would have come to the House before now.  I, therefore, propose an amendment to the Order of Business, &quot;That the Minister for Health come to the House to discuss the issue of medical card provision, particularly for children and those with long-term and serious illnesses.&quot;  Thousands of medical cards have been withdrawn.<\/p><p>Does the Leader agree that it is unhelpful for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to try to undermine the work of the Committee of Public Accounts?

He or any other Chairman of the committee would be remiss not to do this.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has tried to undermine the work of the committee and muddy the waters by accusing an excellent Chairman who has shown himself to be independent and impartial, like the previous Chairman, former Deputy Bernard Allen.

He was paid by TBG Learning through his own company, Laragh Consulting.  There are wheels within wheels.  Well done to him for resigning from these positions, but he should appear before the Committee of Public Accounts as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  I seek a debate on the issue of inter-country adoption, a subject that has come up again and again.

Only 11 children were adopted under the post-Hague declaration between 2011 and 2013.  Clearly, there is a problem.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to come to the House to discuss this issue?  I acknowledge that she was in the House recently to take an Adjournment matter, but we should address this issue and have a debate with her on a system that clearly is clearly if there have only been 11 such adoptions in three years.

Will the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to debate the material that is coming to light, including the report that will be published later and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Garda Inspectorate?  The problem the House highlighted, with which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport agreed, was the categorisation of penalty points attributed to no licence.  That seems to have been due to people, advisedly or otherwise, not bringing their licences with them to court which resulted in the penalty points not being applied to them.  In 2012 approximately 40% of motorists avoided penalty points through this loophole.  Between 2010 and 2012 a total of 84,000 people claimed they had no licence to ensure penalty points would not be applied.  The number of penalty point offences increased from 235,000 to 319,000 during that period.  We, therefore, need to close that loophole.  When the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was in the House, he said this desperately needed to be done and that he was open to ideas.  The fact that 84,000 motorists avoided penalty points in this way over two years and that almost 40% of drivers used this loophole to escape in 2012 means that all those interested in road safety should not allow it to remain for one minute longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200003#B00700","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1394620200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We should leave matters that are properly dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts to the committee and anyone called to appear before it should attend.

A former Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, officer is deeply concerned about the damage it can do to Irish stock.  Conservation groups are also concerned about the damage it can do to whale and dolphin numbers because it can hoover everything up.  I question its entitlement to fish in Irish waters.  Apparently, it has a certain quota as a result of swapping a quota with Lithuania.  It is grossly unfair, at a time when our fishermen have been starved of a quota, that a quota swap with Lithuania enables a super-trawler which was banished from Australian waters because of the damage it had done to fish in our waters.  I sometimes preach <i>ad nauseam<\/i> about the difficulties facing Irish inshore fishermen.  Will the Leader convey my deep concerns to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and ask him to send a naval officer, with a SFPA officer to board the vessel, as such officers are entitled to do under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, to monitor what is happening?  This is critical to give some level of comfort to hard-pressed Irish fishermen who have little, if any, quota.  It is a factory ship on which fish is chopped up, frozen or canned and the vessel can hoover up more fish in one week than the entire whitefish fleet in an area stretching from Rosaveel to Castletownbeare and Dunmore East and beyond.  Such vessels should be banned outright.  The sooner we get this vessel out of Irish waters the happier I will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200004#C00600","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1394620800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome the news that AIB has written &euro;150,000 off the loan on a family home of &euro;400,000 for a family of four, which enables it to stay in it.

This type of service should, however, be available to all borrowers, not just those whose loans are with AIB or the EBS, and should be funded by the whole banking industry.<\/p><p>FLAC, Free Legal Aid Centres, has published a report entitled, Redressing the Imbalance, and one of its important recommendations is that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears has some serious deficiencies.  The report raises very serious concerns about the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It states that, although the Financial Services Ombudsman &quot;will examine a failure by a lender to adhere to process, it feels unable to overturn the commercial decisions of lenders to declare a mortgage unsustainable or to offer what a borrower may believe is an unsuitable alternative repayment arrangement.  These gaps in normal fair procedure rules leave consumers in mortgage arrears seriously exposed to the potential loss of their family homes in circumstances where such loss may not necessarily be objectively justified; hence it is a matter which requires the urgent attention not just of the Central Bank...&quot;.

We are all aware from interaction with people on a daily basis that significant issues remain in terms of the impossibility of insuring homes and businesses which were affected by flooding.  The insurance federation estimates that 2% - 40,000 to 50,000 homes and businesses - have flood exclusion provisions in their policies.  Such exclusion is often as a result of homes being built in locations where they should never have been built.  The perennial issue of one-off housing or developments being built on flood plains is one of which this House should not lose sight.  The Taoiseach recently stated that building on flood plains is a thing of the past and the previous Government's inaction or culpability on the issue would not recur.  I wholeheartedly agree with that.<\/p><p>While historical issues remain there is a multiplicity of issues with housing developed in recent years.  It would seem that there is some disconnect between the Government and the insurance industry in that regard.  The Government has quickly moved to provide moneys for remedial work in light of recent damage.  That is to be commended.  The insurance industry generally has issues with the standard of work that is carried out to rectify the problems in the short term and it is not particularly involved in investment in future proofing flood defences.  I am told that in a lot of cases the remedial work carried out is not acceptable to insurers and does not allow for a level of risk insurance in affected areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200005#D00300","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1394621400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Is Senator Naughton seeking a debate on the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200005#D00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1394621400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The IBA put together a good document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200005#D00500","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1394621400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>There is a need for joined-up thinking in this area and there is also a need for a forum where present needs, future works and insurance risks could be discussed and matters resolved to benefit the population as a whole.

The Ombudsman made it quite clear she saw no valid reason for continuing to keep this letter secret from the public.  I believe there can be no bank inquiry of any sort without this letter coming into the public domain.  I would also like to hear from the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Honohan, in regard to this matter.  I would like to know what level of involvement he had with the original letter.

It is important the cross-border health care directive is transposed and I ask the Leader to urge the Minister to bring it forward.  In the meantime, the treatment abroad fund should cover anyone who is unable to get a particular type of treatment here.  That fund should provide the necessary support to someone who requires medical treatment.  As someone who has benefited from cross-border health care, I am very much aware ofits importance.  When people cannot get the health care they need here and it is available in another country, we should give them the financial support they require.<\/p><p>I also wish to the raise the issue of the HPAT exam for admission into medical schools.  This is a disaster and there is significant controversy in regard to it in the press.  There are serious issues with it and it is seen as another unnecessary expense imposed on parents and students.  On the one hand, we have people sitting their leaving certificate exams, and on the other we now have them sitting the HPAT exam to get into medical school.  If they do not pass the HPAT exam this year but pass it next year, does this mean they will be a better doctor?  They will have studied the technique of passing the test rather than devoted themselves to studying medicine.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills for a debate in the House on this issue.  The HPAT exam was imposed unnecessarily.

I hope their trips will prove successful for the country.<\/p><p>On Monday I attended a public meeting organised by Monaghan Integrated Development Limited which was attended by over 250 people who were concerned about the future of independent local development companies and the Leader programme as a result of the passing of the Local Government Reform Bill, under which the Leader programme will be subsumed into the local community development committees of local authorities.  The independent local development companies have been operating very successfully throughout the country and I am very familiar with the work they do in my county.  A superb presentation was made by Monaghan Integrated Development Limited at the aforementioned meeting which showed the excellent work being carried out.  In Cavan Breffni Integrated Development Limited does similar work.  There is genuine concern that the work in which these companies are involved will be taken over by the local authorities and that, in many cases, it will be contracted out to for-profit organisations, thus depriving local communities of excellent services and programmes.  We are all aware that the development committees are made up of volunteers from the community and voluntary sectors, representatives of various statutory agencies, as well as local elected representatives who have worked very well together.  The system is working very well and I do not see a need to tinker with it.  In that context, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the issue before his proposals under the legislation come into effect.  We must tease out all of these matters before a decision is taken.  I know that the Minister is not a great man for engaging in consultation, but I plead with him to give this issue some time and tease it out fully before the sledgehammer falls.  <\/p><p>I understand the Minister for Education and Science will be announcing details of the new schools building programme in the next few hours, if he has not done so already.  I ask the Leader to determine whether the proposals for D&uacute;n U&iacute; Neill Army barracks which were closed by the Government almost two years ago will be included in the Minister's plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200007#F00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1394622600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the announcement this morning by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Brian Hayes, that an initial allocation of &euro;19 million would be made available through his offices for flood defence works, following the damage caused in January and February this year.  I am delighted that &euro;8.7 million of the total will be made available to the people of County Clare, the shoreline of which was ravaged in the recent inclement weather.  The money will go a significant way towards ensuring proper flood defence mechanisms are put in place on a long-term basis to ensure what we witnessed at the beginning of 2014 will not be seen again.  The provision of this &euro;8.7 million is a very important incremental step in protecting the coastline of County Clare.  I welcome the allocation of this money, on top of the &euro;17 million made available through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government a couple of weeks ago.  In total, we are looking at an investment of &euro;25 million, about which the people of County Clare will be happy.<\/p><p>I concur with the comments of other speakers regarding St. Patrick's Day and those who will travel around the world to promote Ireland.  This is also a good time to reflect on the plight of the 50,000 undocumented Irish living and working illegally in the United States of America.  There have been many false dawns for them, with various representatives in the United States making significant strides forward only to take a number of steps back.  The Taoiseach is travelling to Washington and I have no doubt that he will avail of the opportunity during his meeting with President Obama to speak about the need for a solution to the problem of the undocumented Irish in the United States.  I call on all public representatives travelling to the United States, whether in a private or an official capacity, to use the unique opportunity afforded by the St. Patrick's Day celebrations to highlight the plight of the 50,000 undocumented Irish who cannot come home for funerals, weddings, christenings and so forth for fear of being deported.  A family from my area who had been living and working in the Boston area for many years where they were well established were deported last year.  I do not want to see any other Irish family who have made a home in the United States suffer the same fate.  It is incumbent on us all to make an effort to support the 50,000 undocumented Irish in the United States and I hope we will soon see a pathway to their legalisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200007#F00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1394622600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I support the comments of my colleague, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, on the alignment process and the restructuring of Leader companies under the provisions of the recently passed Local Government Reform Bill which will have a negative effect and create more, not less, bureaucracy.  I tabled a motion on the issue on the Adjournment last night and during the debate the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government suggested it would reduce red tape and bureaucracy, but nothing could be further from the truth.  There is a total lack of clarity.  Funding is not available under the current Leader programme because it has all been spent.  The Minister needs to roll up his sleeves to have this issue sorted out and allow projects that have applied for funding to receive it.<\/p><p>I refer to the proposed amendment to the Order of Business to discuss the HSE service plan.  Before the last general election, Deputy James Reilly promised that if he became Minister for Health, he would roll out the BreastCheck programme to all women aged between 50 and 69 years.  He has reneged on this promise for those women aged between 65 and 69 years.  Under the HSE service plan for 2014, the BreastCheck service is not available to the women in question.  It has been proved beyond doubt that the BreastCheck service saves lives, but the Government, in an attempt to save euros, has rolled back on its promise.  We must have a debate on this issue.  I, therefore, support Senator Daragh O'Brien's proposed amendment to the Order of Business in that regard.  <\/p><p>The national parks play an important role in promoting our cultural heritage, history and tourist industry, but there is something very striking about the funding which goes to them.

- rejects the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with the British Government to export energy from renewable sources from Ireland; <br \/>- acknowledges renewable energy sources are valuable natural resources that belong to the people of Ireland, and that the Government has a duty to ensure that any benefit accruing from them must benefit the people of the State; <br \/>- acknowledges that the Twenty-Six Counties has agreed binding targets of at least 16% of all energy consumed in the State to be from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 under Directive 2009\/28\/EC; <br \/>- accepts that exporting sustainable energy and importing fossil fuel before these targets are met is counterproductive in that it acts as a barrier to meeting Directive 2009\/28\/EC; <br \/>- believes that a target for self-sufficiency from renewable sources should be set in line with realistic projections for growth in the generation of energy from onshore and offshore wind, wave and tidal power, and other renewables such as hydro and geothermal; <br \/>- accepts that greater emphasis should be placed on developing renewable sources other than wind, and that the potential in energy generated from the sea is recognised; <br \/>- recognises that the rising cost of fuel bills disproportionately impacts marginalised groups such as the elderly, disabled and low income families, and acknowledges the role domestic energy production could play in the reduction of energy costs; <br \/>- understands that there is a groundswell of public opposition to the erection of electricity pylons as reflected by the 35,000 submissions to EirGrid and that a fair and transparent consultation process has not taken place; <br \/>- accepts that early involvement of the public in projects and the provision of accurate and up to-date information and transparency is essential; that participation with the purpose of informing and gaining support from the public toward a project is a central pillar of good governance; and that communities have a democratic right to influence decision making; <br \/>- agrees that strict and comprehensive planning regulations must be applied to the erection of wind turbines and electricity pylons in Ireland; <br \/>- recommends the Government observe the precautionary approach in keeping with World Health Organization 2007 guidelines when constructing new electricity supply installations and in relation to high voltage lines; <br \/>- recommends the Government adopt a precautionary approach in the construction of new alternating-current power lines; that new power lines should not be built close to residential areas or day-care institutions; and that the distance required should be determined on the basis of a specific assessment of the individual project and the fields to which the inhabitants will be exposed; <br \/>- acknowledges that the Irish landscape is unique in its natural beauty and a significant national resource in aesthetic, environmental, and economic terms and that the construction of any major infrastructural project must take these factors into account; <br \/>- calls for a cost-benefit analysis of undergrounding electricity pylons to be undertaken; <br \/>- calls for the undergrounding of electricity pylons where possible; <br \/>- calls for a moratorium on the erection of electricity pylons and wind turbines until a comprehensive All-Ireland policy is in place; and <br \/>- calls for the creation and implementation of an All-Ireland Energy Policy that clearly states how our renewable energy targets will be reached; what infrastructure is needed for the development of renewable energy sources;

House counted and 12 Members being present,<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1394627100,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, to the House to debate this important motion.  We tabled the motion to be helpful and constructive.  There is considerable public concern about energy policy, specifically in regard to industrial wind turbines, overhead power lines and the plans by Eirgrid to expand the electricity grid across various parts of the State.  These justified concerns have been articulated in submissions by members of the public and campaigning groups in response to EirGrid's Grid Link project for the south, the west and the south east and the North-South interconnector.<\/p><p>There appears to be a problem with this Government's approach to proper decision making.  On too many occasions we have seen the Government jump with two feet into projects without considering alternatives that in the long term might cause fewer problems and even save money.  For example, Sinn F&eacute;in made alternative proposals on water charges and if the Government had listened it may not have ended up with the controversy of spending massive amounts of money on consultant fees or the debacle we saw in Irish Water.  A pattern appears to exist in the way in which this Government approaches policy and decision making.  There is an unhealthy contempt for Opposition views and alternative.  The Government seems to want to plough on with what it considers the best policies, which are not always the best policies, regardless of the concerns of those who live in communities and the Opposition in general.  We have seen the same issue arise in regard to the construction of pylons and wind turbines.<\/p> <p>If the Government had been willing to listen to alternative proposals, it might not have found itself in the position in which it is and it may have ended up with a much smoother path in governing and in realising the energy policies at which we all want to arrive.<\/p><p>More than 35,000 people made submissions to EirGrid on the pylon projects, which is unprecedented.  A huge number of people made the effort to make a submission.  Many people in my county of Waterford made submissions and not only people directly affected by EirGrid's plans - the erection of pylons up to 43 m high and high voltage overhead powerlines and those who live in close proximity to them - but many people who live far away from the proposed routes who are angry and do not agree with putting these pylons through the heart of the Lismore area in Waterford and the heart of the Comeragh Mountains, for example.  Many people see it as an act of vandalism and completely unnecessary.  Those concerns were clearly articulated in the submissions made by members of the public on EirGrid's plans.  They emphasise public opinion on the matter.<\/p><p>Considering the multitude of views, it is imperative the Government takes account of all of the views on pylons and the possible effects they can have on the communities through which they pass.  People have many concerns, including the potential health risks, the impact on the value of land, on livestock and on farms and the imposition on the natural landscape and on the built heritage.  I gave the example of the Comeragh Mountains.  Many people who recognise the beauty of the Comeragh Mountains do not want to see them spoiled by pylons of up to 43 m in height in a string going right through the heart of those mountains, or, indeed, through the beautiful area of Lismore, the midlands or anywhere in the south east, whether Wicklow, Wexford or wherever the planned routes are.  People do not want to see their landscape spoiled by these pylons, if it is unnecessary and if there are alternatives, to which I want to get.<\/p><p>I do not believe this Government has properly investigated the alternatives.  I certainly do not believe EirGrid has given any serious consideration at all to the alternatives.  In fact, it has been very closed in its mind and in its opinion in regard to the undergrounding of cables.  It is interesting that six years ago when this first became a big issue with the North-South interconnector, EirGrid was on record as saying that going underground could not technically be done and that it was an impossibility.  It also said that even if it could be done, it would be 20 times more expensive.  Now it has shifted its position and has said it is technically possible and that it is approximately three times more expensive.  That is a considerable shift in its position in a short space of time.<\/p><p>That tells me there are two issues here and two conclusions we can draw from this.  First, EirGrid was wrong six years ago when it said it was 20 times more expensive and that it could not be done, which then begs the question as to whether it is wrong now.  Second, perhaps it was right and that six years ago, it was 20 times more expensive but the technology has improved and it is possible.  That is what we are asking the Government to consider.  Technology is changing all the time and more countries are looking at different options and are not going for the overground high voltage power lines of the size and scale envisaged in all of these projects.  <\/p><p>This is about asking the Government to listen.  It is not about it pretending to listen or thanking the public for submissions but saying it is ploughing ahead anyway.  That is not consultation and listening to communities or the way Governments should govern.  The Government must listen to the people who live in this State and who have genuine concerns, which they have articulated.  As with so many issues, the Government parties should also live up to the promises and the pledges they made when in opposition.  There is no doubt that in the north west and in counties in that region which are directly affected by EirGrid's plans, Fine Gael was very vocal in opposing what was being proposed at that time by EirGrid and the North-South interconnector.  Now things have changed because it is in government, as is the Labour Party.  It is a case of ploughing ahead, unquestioning of EirGrid's plans. <\/p><p>The ASKON report identified alternatives to what is envisaged by EirGrid.  The report on undergrounding, published in October 2008, made a number of findings.  It found underground cables were better suited to integrating the existing grid network, that they were more reliable, that the transmission loss from underground cabling was significantly less than from overground, that underground cables were safer, that there were obvious environmental benefits to undergrounding and that undergrounding could be established at an affordable course with the worst case scenario of &euro;1 per household per year.  Surely this report is worthy of consideration and is one which should cause us to reflect on policy and ask ourselves if we should rush in and invest all the money in pylons of this size and scale when in a couple of years' time, technology may have advanced again.  One should bear in mind what I said about EirGrid's position six years ago and its position now.  What happens in five years time if we are in a position where this can be done even more cheaply and technology has improved even further but we are left with these pylons and not able to do anything about them?  That would be disastrous for this State.<\/p><p>I would like to deal with industrial wind turbines, which are causing major concerns for communities.  Wind turbines will be dealt with when Sinn F&eacute;in launches its Wind Turbine Regulation Bill 2014 tomorrow.  That Bill aims to impose a minimum set back distance for wind turbines of ten times their height from dwellings and it deals with proper zoning of sites for wind turbine developments.  The Bill addresses the export of wind energy to Britain before Irish energy demands are met.  That is central to our motion in terms of the memorandum of understanding with Britain on the export of energy created from renewable sources.  <\/p><p>At a time when we are importing energy from fossil fuels from outside this State, we should not be exporting to Britain, or anywhere else, energy created from the natural resources of this State.  That is a major concern to the people.  The renewable energies of this State should serve the people of this State, who should come first and not people in Britain or anywhere else.  This must be for the benefit of this State and the natural resources must be used for the people of this State.<\/p><p>That goes right to the heart of the argument against the development of massive wind turbines in the midlands region, that is, for-profit wind turbines  exporting energy.  The energy produced from the turbines proposed for the midlands cannot be connected to the Irish grid, meaning that the gross energy produced would be exported to Britain.  Ireland has renewable energy targets to reach and domestic consumers have witnessed their energy bills rising but the Minister is proposing to export our renewable energy production to Britain.  However, it is clear that its development must be in the interests of the Irish people and become part of domestic energy production.<\/p><p>I will listen to the Minister's contribution and those of his colleagues but I am very much of the view that we should reflect on what people and communities are saying and develop an energy policy that makes sense and benefits the Irish people and puts them first.  That is what our motion is about.  I hope we can have a constructive debate on the merits of our motion and view on Government policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200015#R00400","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394627700,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom cuidi&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n seo at&aacute; curtha chun cinn ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Cullinane.

T&aacute; s&eacute; sin mar cheann de na h&uacute;dair a bhfuilimid ag cur an r&uacute;n seo chun cinn inniu.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in will launch the Wind Turbine Regulation Bill 2014 tomorrow.  This Bill deals with a number of failings by the Government to properly regulate the construction of industrial wind turbines.  The Bill also attempts to impose proper regulation of all aspects of wind turbine construction.  This includes proper zoning of areas for wind turbine developments, the duties of planning authorities, set back distances and the responsibility of decommissioning wind turbines.  Many residents in the midlands and throughout the country have been rightly concerned about proper set back distances of wind turbines from property.<\/p> <p>The Bill seeks to impose a setback distance of ten times the height of the turbine from any dwelling for turbines that are higher than 25 m but industrial turbines are not the only issue.  In Connemara, which is probably one of the most picturesque areas of the country, planning permission has been granted for hundreds of wind turbines in an area of scenic amenity.  We are witnessing the privatisation of wind, which is a natural resource.  This has happened because of a lack of guidelines and regulation up to now, a charge which cannot only be levied at the Government, and a lack of action by the previous Government.  One lady bought her dream house in Connemara on a small farm.  Three separate planning permissions were then granted, which means that approximately 70 wind turbines will be built all around her.  This is a disgrace.  It is unfair because it is being done with a sleight of hand and some people think there is collusion between the local authority, the planning people and the private enterprise developing these projects.  A number of the planning applications for projects such as these were supported by people who used to work with the local authorities and who know the inside track on the guidelines in question.<\/p><p>Proper regulation should be in place but the Bill seeks to rectify the mistakes made by the current and previous Governments.  Two Bills were published by Deputy Penrose and Senator Kelly, who has raised the issue on many occasions, but the Government has even turned a blind eye to them.  It is important that there is correct management of renewable energy produced in Ireland.  Ireland has binding targets for renewable energy that it must reach by 2020.  The State still meets most of its energy demand from imported fossil fuels.  Any renewable energy produced here should be used to lessen the fuel bills that are a burden on many households.  The Bill seeks to ensure the State's energy demands are met prior to renewable energy being exported - muid ag seasamh ar &aacute;r gcosa f&eacute;in i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re i dtosach b&aacute;ire agus &aacute; bhflaitheas dh&aacute; choinne&aacute;il.<\/p><p>Proper planning is essential for developments in rural Ireland.  The Government cannot ignore local communities that have concerns about the development of wind turbines.  This Bill also seeks to address many of these concerns and it is our hope that the Government will accept it.  There are also concerns surrounding farmers who have signed contracts with wind energy companies.  This has also involved a sleight of hand where they have been practically gagged and asked to sign with the promise of moneys in the future in order that they will not speak to those living around them.  Divide and conquer has been the strategy of many of the energy companies.  There must be clarity around land access and land use and the farming community must be made fully aware of the consequences of signing contracts with these companies.<\/p><p>There needs to be a diversification of renewable sources and we cannot be dependent on onshore wind energy.  In the EU, hydro power accounts for 48% of electricity generated from renewables; wind, 26%; biomass, 19%; solar, 7%; geothermal, 1%; and tidal and wave, less than 0.1%.  Norway is almost 100% self-sufficient in producing electricity from hydro power.  The country is also exemplary in the way it has treated its oil and gas resources.  The Government still has not implemented the recommendations of an Oireachtas joint committee regarding the oil and gas industry.  The Minister of State might comment on when it intends to do that.  The latest media reports have said that the current and previous Governments have given the most favourable terms to oil and gas companies prospecting off our coast.  If we had the savvy of the Norwegians to ensure national rights were put before those of private companies, we might not be in our current predicament.<\/p><p>No country is self-sufficient in electricity generation from wind.  Denmark now generates more than 30% of its electricity from wind and exports more than 12 billion kW per year.  Achieving self-sufficiency in electricity from renewables is a key target for the country.  There are, however, critiques of the economics of electricity exports, including in Denmark, which may be relevant to future planning in Ireland.

and substitute the following:<br \/>&quot;Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ndash;<br \/>- acknowledges that Irish energy policy is designed to meet the overriding concerns of security of supply, sustainability and cost competitiveness; <br \/>- acknowledges that Ireland has agreed as a binding target under EU law that at least 16% of all energy consumed must be from renewable energy sources by the year 2020; <br \/>- recognises that both the import and export of electricity, including electricity from renewable sources, will be a feature of an interconnected European Single Electricity Market and that the Government, the regulatory authorities and industry must plan accordingly; <br \/>- acknowledges that the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Irish and UK Energy Ministers in January 2013 sent a strong signal of our shared interest in exploring the opportunity to export green electricity from Ireland to Britain; <br \/>- further recognises that any scenario for the future of Irish energy beyond 2020, regardless of EU targets, will accordingly include a vital role for energy from indigenous renewable sources both in the domestic and export markets; <br \/>- acknowledges that renewable energy is a valuable natural resource and that the Government has a duty to safeguard a fair share of any benefits from its exploitation for the people and the State; <br \/>- accepts that exporting renewable energy is entirely compatible with meeting the targets imposed by EU law; <br \/>- believes that a cost-effective ambition for meeting domestic energy demand from renewable sources should be set in line with realistic projections for growth in the generation of energy from onshore and offshore wind, wave and tidal power, and other renewables such as hydro and geothermal; <br \/>- welcomes the recent publication by the Government of the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan which provides the framework for sustainable exploitation of our offshore wind, wave and tidal resource and the commitment by Government of &euro;26m to support research in wave and tidal power; <br \/>- welcomes this Government&rsquo;s close attention to securing value for money in the design and rollout of the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariffs, so that unsustainable supports and unjustified profits are avoided; <br \/>- recognises that the rising cost of fuel disproportionately impacts on those on low income and acknowledges the role energy production from domestic sources could play in reducing energy costs, whilst further acknowledging that improving the thermal efficiency of homes remains the most cost-effective way of increasing energy affordability and reducing energy poverty;<br \/>- acknowledges that the Irish landscape is unique in its natural beauty and a significant national resource in aesthetic, environmental, and economic terms and that the construction of any major infrastructural project must take these factors into account;  <br \/>- welcomes the Government&rsquo;s July 2012 Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure, which underlined that early involvement of the public in energy infrastructure projects and the provision of accurate and up to-date information and transparency is essential; that participation with the purpose of informing and gaining support from the public toward a project is a central pillar of good governance; and that communities have a democratic right to influence decision making; <br \/>- agrees that strict and comprehensive planning regulations must be applied to the erection of wind turbines and electricity pylons; <br \/>- acknowledges that new electricity supply grid infrastructure is both planned for and constructed in accordance with World Health Organisation 2007 guidelines and EU and domestic law, in accordance with the precautionary principle; <br \/>- welcomes the fact that an analysis of options, both underground and overhead, for the transmission of high voltage electricity will be undertaken; <br \/>- welcomes the imminent publication of a Green Paper on Energy Policy that will, inter alia, further develop and build out a comprehensive and progressive suite of policies that clearly state how our renewable energy targets will be reached; what infrastructure is needed for the development of renewable energy sources; how renewable sources can be developed on an All-Ireland basis; and how renewable sources can best serve the energy needs of Irish people; and<br \/>- looks forward to a public debate based on an accurate examination of the facts and issues and rejects ill-informed and populist political sloganeering and scaremongering on issues of such vital national importance.&quot;.<\/blockquote>Will the previous speakers outline what they favour rather than what they are against?  The motion needs to be corrected.  It refers to undergrounding electricity pylons but it should refer to undergrounding cables.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The events of the past few days may have taken the wind out of our friends of Sinn F&eacute;in, given the decision of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources regarding wind turbines.  They have dug up a previous motion tabled last November about pylons and putting cables underground.  The motion is an exercise in playing to the gallery with the upcoming local and European elections firmly in mind.  Sinn F&eacute;in is against everything but in favour of nothing.  Perhaps the party's Senators can enlighten us as to what we can do.<\/p><p>  I welcome the opportunity to educate them about the real world.  The motion contains 16 statements but the Minister has dealt with the first statement in that nothing will happen until everything is agreed in respect of turbines.  I support the Government's aim to allow for the export of electricity to Britain and further afield if it will create jobs and wealth in the State and I have a history of saying that.  I will refer to the motion statement by statement.  I agree with a number of them, including the second statement.  Where resources are bought at a fair price, they become the property of the purchaser.  We live in a free market economy.  There is no argument with the third statement.  With regard to the fourth statement, I prefer the Minister's comments on this matter.  When negotiations are finalised, I envisage that the private sector will fill any void in the production of energy for the domestic market with the surplus available for export but this is a number of years away.  ESB International and Vattenfall, one of Europe's largest electricity utilities, have entered an agreement to develop ocean energy on the west coast.<\/p><p>  Bioenergy and biomass should have been included in the motion but they have been left out for some reason, although Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh acknowledged this in his contribution.  The fifth statement is debatable.  There are serious concerns about the erection of wind turbines in close proximity to homes.  There are also worries about flicker and perceived noise.  The setback distances will be legislated for and many of the concerns can be addressed.  Wind has benefits, as evidenced by the volume of energy created this winter, which has put downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland said renewables have saved the country &euro;1 billion on imported fossil fuels over the past five years.<\/p><p>  The sixth statement is correct.  The Government's better energy warmer homes scheme is having a positive impact on reducing fuel poverty among vulnerable customers and we will continue with the scheme.  A total of 104,000 homes have benefited under the scheme at a cost of &euro;16 million with another 10,000 to be completed this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200017#T00200","speaker":"1134"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628300,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Most of those were completed under the previous Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200017#T00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628300,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Senator Mulcahy without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200017#T00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628300,"counter":184,"content":"<p>But they are being done now.  I cannot accept the seventh statement.  The Minister has appointed an independent panel of experts chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.  I have immense respect for this former Supreme Court judge.  Her work will be transparent and the panel's terms of reference will be above reproach.<\/p><p>With regard to the 35,000 submissions that, I assume, oppose the erection of pylons, we import &euro;6 billion worth of fossil fuels every year and we need to offset some of this with renewables.  However, if we generate electricity from tidal, wave or wind power in the west, how will it be transported to the other side of the country without a robust national grid of lines and pylons?<\/p> <p>Electrons need to flow; they cannot be stored or transported by road, so I think people need to sit down and rethink that one.<\/p><p>The eighth statement is common sense and is a continuation of the seventh statement.  The ninth statement ties in with what I have already said on the fifth statement.  The tenth and 11th statements are related.  It is obvious that EirGrid and the energy providers would not put their customers at any risk through the construction of that infrastructure.  In respect of the 2007 World Health Organization guidelines, the National Radiation Laboratory in New Zealand acknowledged in a 2008 report the results of studies that found a weak association between EMF field exposures and the risk of childhood leukaemia, but considered that the results were too tenuous and lacking support from other sources to form the basis of exposure guidelines.  Furthermore, the report stated that other recent reviews, including the 2007 WHO review, came to the same conclusion, and found that the data currently available did not justify setting more stringent exposure limits.  The WHO also recommended that very low-cost precautionary measures be taken to reduce exposures to magnetic fields.<\/p><p>I can accept the 12th, 13th and 14th statements, but we have to be realistic.  In County Clare, we have two of the biggest power lines in the country.  These two separate 400 kV lines run from Moneypoint and continue across the country, ending up on the outskirts of the capital.  They deliver much-needed electricity to Ireland.  I do not hear anyone roaring and shouting about those lines in County Clare, and I have been living there for the last 36 years, or asking for them now to be put underground.  A 400 kV high-voltage cable can transport three times as much electricity as a 220 kV cable; therefore, we can reduce the number of 220 kV and 110 kV cables by moving to bigger cables.  About 2,000 km of cables are to be upgraded, so the older cables can be removed from lots of places.<\/p><p>No one wants high-voltage electricity cables affecting the landscape, but we have to look at the bigger picture.  Do we want no power lines?  Maybe we should start a de-electrification process here and we can go back to the candle and the oil lamp.  Many people around the country found out how hard it was to operate without power cables 40 or 50 years ago, but when the cables were cut in the recent storms we saw another disaster.  Even this morning in parts of Clare we had power cuts from  7.00 a.m to 9.00 a.m.  Imagine all those parents trying to organise their children and get them out to school without any power.   We have a grid that has to be upgraded and connected to the rest of Europe for security of supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200017#T00500","speaker":"1134","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394628900,"counter":186,"content":"<p>You have run out of power because you are half a minute over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200018#U00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628900,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Just look at the antics of Mr. Putin in so-called democratic Russia-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200018#U00300","speaker":"1134"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628900,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I am sticking rigidly to the time slots today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200018#U00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628900,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I knew it would be difficult to get everything done in six minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200018#U00500","speaker":"1134"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628900,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Well, you have made your point.

We in the Oireachtas must try to shine a light on what is happening and on where the pressure is coming from, because there is a lot of pressure to move this project on.<\/p><p>Wind energy has a huge place in our future and it is necessary to have it, as long as it is not an imposition on the citizens of this country, as long as people do not have to suffer due to turbines beside them, and as long as they do not have to put up with that.  There are many places in this country where turbines can be erected to help our own economic development and our own quest for renewable energy sources, whether we want to export the energy or not.<\/p><p>The issues of pylons and turbines are interconnected, even though each party claims they are totally separate.  When the pylon project in County Meath and County Cavan was first enunciated six and a half years ago, it was specifically for the export of renewable energy.  It was about bringing the wind energy down from Donegal at the time.  Now that has been dropped and it has been said that we do not need it and it is just to reinforce the local and regional grid.  They have chopped and changed.  Senator Mulcahy made the point that we cannot let the lights go out.  EirGrid claimed something similar in County Meath six and a half years ago; the company claimed that if the project did not go ahead, there would be power cuts by 2011 and 2012.  It did not happen, so the question is whether we can believe that.  I certainly do not want to stand in the way of infrastructure development, but the pylon issue has been outlined well by Senator Cullinane.<\/p><p>We were told at the beginning that it was impossible to put the lines underground.  We were then told that it would be 25 times the cost.  Then we got a Government report which stated that it was three times the cost, and I give credit to the Government for carrying out that report.  The technology is constantly changing and should be examined.  I do not know if the Minister can give us any update on the Catherine McGuinness commission and whether that commission is including the North-South line, because I have not heard whether it is.  Perhaps I have missed something, but it seems that was put to the commission some time ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200018#U01700","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628900,"counter":202,"content":"<p>On a point of information-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200018#U01800","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628900,"counter":203,"content":"<p>There is no such thing as a point of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200018#U01900","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628900,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.

I will provide examples in County Meath.  The parish of Kilbeg and Staholmog and the parishes of Oristown and Kilberry, along with all those rural parishes around Kells, are at the intersection of these turbine projects and the pylon projects.  The pylons are going from north to south and the turbines are effectively going from east to west.  That is an issue that has not been examined by the Government.  Certain parts of the country seem to be a magnet for these things, because certain people want to bring them to those areas and many people do not.<\/p><p>Renewable energy must be part of the solution; only yesterday I called for a debate on climate change.  It was outrageous to make a connection between pylons and climate change, and I think the Green Party did that.  There is no connection whatsoever, and we must get it out that we can support serious efforts to combat climate change but not equate that with a necessity to put up pylons.  If renewable energy is obtained from wind, it can be put underground as well, but there are other ways to generate and distribute electricity.<\/p><p>There have been a huge number of applications for wind farms.  It is a crazy situation when three projects are competing with each other.  I presume they cannot all get the go-ahead, but people on each of those projects will individually will say that the others are really unprofessional and do not have a hope.  The reality is that the three projects cannot go ahead.  Certain people are getting their hopes up that it will go ahead, because obviously there is an economic benefit to them, and I certainly have no problem with that.  I have said that at public meetings and I encourage people to have respect for their neighbours and to adhere to the planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200018#U02200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1394628900,"counter":207,"content":"<p>You are just on time.

The London School of Economics, LSE, published a report in February.  The LSE is an entirely independent body which has published several pro-wind-energy reports.  This one examines 1 million property sales over a one-year period.  The value of houses within 2 km of wind turbines was slashed by 11%.  Where I live in Kildare the average house price is approximately &euro;245,000, so that represents a slash of &euro;27,000 per property.  Apart from fears for their health and for the landscape, many people are worried about this.  Will they be compensated?  One Sinn F&eacute;in Senator mentioned a lady who had saved all her life to buy her dream home in Connemara.  What happens to such a person?  Does she get compensation?<\/p><p>  It is a savage intrusion on our enjoyment of the visual beauty of our countryside and a savage threat to tourism.  The problem of wind energy and pylons starts with the citizens who pay tax, not with the Government.  All of us here today, and those who are not here, are aware of this subject because one cannot step outside one&rsquo;s door without somebody talking about it.<\/p><p>  If there was a pylon within 50 m of the Minister of State&rsquo;s home, and his children or grandchildren lived there, would the Minister be happy?  There are many studies about the health concerns, arguing for and against cause and effect.  Writing in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, Dick Ahlstrom said, &ldquo;Many objectors to the Grid25 pylon project will have cited cancer risks as their major cause of concern.&rdquo;  He referred to a study conducted recently in France, published in the <i>British Journal of Cancer<\/i> last April, which included all 2,779 cases of acute leukaemia that occurred there between 2002 and 2007, and went on to say:<blockquote>It showed children had a 70 per cent increased risk of this rare condition if they lived within 50 metres of high voltage power lines of the kind causing controversy in Ireland.  It also showed there was no increased risk for children living 50 metres or more from these lines.<\/blockquote>  I know the Minister of State will respond by quoting some European study, because there are so many studies, but how would he feel if he or his children or grandchildren lived near a pylon?  If there is even a shred of doubt about whether these pylons might cause illness in any citizen, young or old, we cannot even begin to think of letting a pylon be built within 50 m of a home.<\/p><p>  This motion calls for a cost-benefit analysis.  I welcome the fact that the Government has commissioned a report.  We have heard that it costs 3.5 times as much to put the cables underground as above ground.  Can we please see the quotes for both tenders, underground and above ground, in black and white?  When will that be available?  When will the Government study be complete and ready for us to examine? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200019#V00400","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1394629500,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

That is very clear.  We have agreed as a binding target under EU law that at least 16% of all energy consumed must come from renewable sources by 2020.  Those targets were hard-won.  I believe passionately in environmental issues.  I was one of the founder members of Friends of the Earth in Ireland and brought the first climate protection Bill to this House in 2007 as a Private Members' Bill.  I am very proud that the Government is working on the Climate Change Bill.  It is important that we stick to our targets for tackling climate change and carbon emissions.  If we want to meet those targets, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and tackle the problem of fuel poverty, as mentioned in the Government amendment, we must develop the necessary infrastructure to do so.  That is why it is deeply frustrating to hear the Sinn F&eacute;in members talk about their commitment to green energy and meeting our targets while opposing any plans to develop the infrastructure we need to meet those targets and produce energy sufficient for our purposes.

We have to be clear about the need to develop a modern energy infrastructure and to put forward constructive ideas about how to do so.  That is what the Government amendment does.  It recognises that important regulations need to be put in place.  Senator Cullinane mentioned the Bill the Labour Senators introduced on wind turbines and ensuring they are not erected close to residences.  That is fair.  As the Government amendment acknowledges, we need strict and comprehensive planning regulations to be applied to wind turbines and electricity pylons.<\/p><p>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien spoke eloquently about the need to ensure there are no adverse health implications.  That is recognised in the Government amendment.  The infrastructure must be constructed in accordance with the principles of the World Health Organization.  There are regulations that must be put in place.<\/p><p>It is very important, however, that we proceed with the plans to develop the necessary infrastructure.  Energy policy must be allowed to proceed within the reasonable framework of which I have spoken, and public debate on it must be informed.  There has been much ill-informed sloganeering on this issue, which we need to address.  The motion raises other issues which the amendment addresses adequately, such as the development of offshore sources.  On 7 February the Minister published the offshore renewable energy development plan, which will seek to explore the development of those areas.<\/p> <p>It is absolutely clear that we are all in favour of that.  We also need to develop our bioenergy sources.  That is important.  In terms of Grid Link, others have acknowledged the independent panel of experts, chaired by Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness, which is due to report.  That is a fair approach to take to develop infrastructure in accordance with the safeguards I mentioned.<\/p><p>The memorandum of understanding is somewhat confusingly placed in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, which then refers to very different issues concerning EirGrid.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, spoke in this House and also in the D&aacute;il about the memorandum of understanding.  The memorandum was signed in January 2013 by the Minister and Edward Davey, MP, to send a signal of a shared interest in exploring the opportunity to export green electricity from Ireland to Britain.  At all times the Minister made clear that if the export market was to be developed it would have to be done in such a way that there would be clear, realisable and significant benefits accruing to Ireland.  He said that for Ireland to enter any intergovernmental agreement of that nature there would have to be benefits, which would need to include investment, jobs and growth.  Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien spoke about the cost-benefit analysis that would need to be completed.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has said there are potential benefits including jobs created, community gain, interconnection benefits, co-operation on tax receipts and rates paid to local authorities and a dividend of trade.  Significant benefits could be delivered by an intergovernmental agreement for both Ireland and Britain.  It could also significantly increase our renewable energy output.<\/p><p>There are very positive aspects to the proposal but, as the Minister said, there are many unresolved issues.  Last week he made public his judgment that it was doubtful that the project could be delivered as envisaged, bearing in mind the timeframe of the lead-in to 2020 and the need to meet our targets by then, which would mean we would have to start to develop the infrastructure at this stage.  It has been reported that the Taoiseach has said there is still hope that the discussions can proceed, but he has also said it is unlikely that it will be possible to proceed according to the timescale originally set out.  That is an ongoing issue but it is separate.  The export market is separate to the development of our own energy infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200019#V01300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394630100,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Senator Bacik is way beyond her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200020#W00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1394630100,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The Government amendment makes that very clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200020#W00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1394630100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.  Looking at the Government&rsquo;s amendment first, if I may, the second last paragraph states that the Government \"welcomes the imminent publication of a Green Paper on Energy Policy that will, inter alia, further develop and build out a comprehensive and progressive suite of policies that clearly state how our renewable energy targets will be reached.\"  That has been lacking in the debate.  I hope the Green Paper is imminent and that we get it soon, because a number of factors are changing rapidly in this area and we do need the numbers.  For instance, we subsidise the ESB to use peat and then we prosecute individuals down the country who dig up the same peat.  The numbers will show that the use of peat to generate electricity makes no economic sense and we may as well leave it to the small operators who sell it to people for domestic use.  Let us see the numbers in that regard.<\/p><p>One must also bear in mind the success of fracking in the United States.  I appreciate that many Members do not like it but it is still a success for Ireland in that it has reduced the price of coal and gas on international markets.  The Shannon natural energy group says that if it could land the gas in the Shannon Estuary and send it through the BGE network, that would reduce the country's energy costs.  If that is true, one must also take into account how that changes the relative competitiveness of what we have in mind already.  Some of the suggested alternatives are starting to look excessively high-cost by comparison with the new market in energy.  I am sure the Minister of State will expedite the production of the numbers on which we are now working.  Some of the numbers that are published would cast serious doubts on tidal energy.  They have been trying to do that in the Bay of Fundy in eastern Canada for years and it has always proven to be uneconomical.  Technically all of those things are possible, but the question we must ask is whether they make economic sense.<\/p><p>Paragraph 8 of the Government&rsquo;s amendment states that it &quot;welcomes the recent publication by the Government of the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan which provides the framework for sustainable exploitation of our offshore wind, wave and tidal resource&quot;.  I just do not know whether they are sustainable.  Some of the costings we have received suggest that ocean generation of electricity could be twice as expensive as coal generation, three times as expensive as biomass generation and ten times as expensive as hydroelectricity.  There is not much scope for new hydroelectric generation in Ireland.  In addition, according to some estimates, offshore wind farms are extremely expensive to develop.  In addition, there is a network cost.  Let us see the numbers on all of the options.  I do not mind spending money on research but we should not distort the competitiveness of the economy by getting ourselves involved in forms of electricity generation that do not make economic sense.  I appeal to the Minister of State to provide the proper numbers on which we can base informed decisions as to whether various forms of electricity generation are worthwhile.  Even in the United States, solar energy looks to be extremely expensive.  Offshore wind looks to be uncompetitive, and with the reduction in the price of coal and gas, perhaps we have to look at the numbers again.  If the numbers from the United States are correct, one could ask whether we need to change the network that much, because the coal could come in at low cost to Moneypoint, which is already connected up to the network, and gas can come in on the other side of the Shannon close to Tarbert, which is already connected up to the network.<\/p><p>When I hear of plans to build vast wind farms in the midlands, I wonder what are the numbers involved.  Is it dependent on huge subsidies from the Department and from the electricity consumer?  If so, that would damage the overall competitiveness of the economy.  If we found we did not need to change the grid to connect up new wind farms in the midlands and that we could use the existing grid, we could use existing resources more efficiently.  While we all have aspirations to protect the environment and to find sustainable ways of generating electricity, we need the jobs as well.  Loading the consumer and industrial sector with the cost of schemes that are somewhat fanciful in their economics is not the way to proceed.<\/p><p>We really do need to see the numbers with regard to what the various methods of generation would cost and what that would mean for consumers and industry, particularly the new high-tech industries, which are heavy users of electricity.  It is a clich&eacute; to say that we do not need to go tilting at windmills or waves if they turn out to be horrendously uneconomical, but we would welcome the numbers from the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200020#W00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1394630100,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; as ucht an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an tSeanaid.

However, the Sinn F&eacute;in motion is based on a misapprehension regarding the nature of our transition to renewable energy and towards developing the green infrastructure we require as a State.  It is important to recognise that our transition to renewable energy affords us the opportunity to use our abundant indigenous resources to meet our own energy needs, while also ensuring compliance with our legally binding EU targets.  It creates a hedge against the volatility of fossil fuel prices and improves our security of supply.  In view of the situation in Ukraine and the possibility of it getting out of hand, as it almost did recently, and of a threat to gas supplies to Europe and in the face of such geopolitics, the more we can develop our indigenous industry, the better for us.  Clearly, our industry must meet all the legal and other requirements. <\/p><p>EirGrid's plan between now and 2025 is a major initiative which will put in place a safe, secure and affordable electricity system, the purpose of which is to ensure that the country will have a grid fit for purpose, one that will meet the current and future needs of our economy.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about providing for this country and I understand he is opposed to the North-South interconnector.  I believe he is wrong if he is, because the North is very much part of our country.  We are on the same island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200020#W01100","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394630700,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I would love to see it united.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200021#X00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1394630700,"counter":235,"content":"<p>We need to ensure that if we can help each other in terms of energy that we do so.  In particular, we need to develop regions that do not have the grid they need.  This is a major task for all, whether North or South.<\/p><p>We need the grid to ensure reliability of supply to businesses and households.  We need it to take the power from where it is generated to where it is needed.  We need to reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels by putting the infrastructure in place to enable reduce our carbon footprint and enable us to reach our mandatory 40% renewable electricity targets by 2020.  These aims are all based on our determination that Ireland will develop a power system that meets our future energy needs in a sustainable manner.  For this reason we do not accept Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal and the Government side has put an amendment to the House.<\/p><p>Ireland has a target for 16% of our energy to come from renewable sources by 2020, with 40% of our electricity to come from renewable sources.  To meet this target, Ireland must move from 170 MW per year to 250 MW.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, recognised that this makes it necessary to amended the REFIT schemes to extend both the backstop date for REFIT I and the closing date for applications to REFIT II.  This year, work will begin on designing a new support scheme to come into operation in 2016.  These changes will facilitate the cost effective provision of renewable energy and are fully consistent with starting on a trajectory of revising and reducing price supports for new onshore wind projects over time, while recognising the need for a predictable and transparent policy framework.<\/p><p>We have made significant progress to date, as underlined by the recent SEAI publication, which noted that the contribution of renewable energy to overall energy demand rose from 2.3% in 1990 to 7.1% in 2012, with renewable electricity contributing 4.1% to the overall energy demand in 2012.  Figures for 2013 show that 19% of electricity demand is met from renewable sources.  In addition, the level of uptake of connection offers under the Gate 3 process has been very promising.  We require an additional 1,500 MW to 2,000 MW of renewable generation to meet the 40% target.  Approximately 3,000 MW of offers have been accepted.  The rate of delivery under Gate 3 will be a factor of critical importance and will require close monitoring.<\/p><p>Ireland has an abundant source of renewable energy.  The pipeline of projects established through our group processing approach means we have confidence in our ability to meet our target of 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020.  We have an opportunity to enter into an across-state co-operation.  The memorandum signed by the Minister is the first such memorandum in this regard.  Transboundary co-operation makes sense and does not, as implied, represent a barrier to delivery of our own domestic targets.  Such an agreement is above and beyond domestic targets.<\/p><p>With regard to the export of renewable energy, we have made good progress on this innovative and ambitious work since the signing of the memorandum of understanding by the Minister and his counterpart in the United Kingdom in 2013.  The body of work progressed under the memorandum has significantly progressed our understanding of the potential mutual economic benefits to Ireland and the United Kingdom of renewable energy trading and the policy, regulatory and economic framework that is required to support it.  The Minister has said many times that any intergovernmental agreement must be clear, realisable and bring significant benefits to us.  Any rewards must outweigh all potential risks.  The foreseen benefits would need to include investment, jobs and growth.  The local economy would need to benefit through the flow of rates to local authorities and community gain for local communities is important.  Ireland must benefit from appropriate returns to the Exchequer and infrastructure to underpin economic development.<\/p><p>Both states remain committed to making these projects happen.  However, key policy and regulatory design decisions still remain to be taken by the United Kingdom, which means we are still a considerable distance from settling on the specifics of what the Irish Government and the renewable generators believe must be the basic components of any intergovernmental agreement.  For this reason, within the particular timeframe, it will not be possible to deliver the project as envisaged.  Therefore, the shared work with the United Kingdom will focus on the longer term post-2020 period, and both countries will continue to work together towards that.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, we will engage with the United Kingdom over the next three months to attempt to develop a workable architecture for trade, which realistically now must be post 2020.  I repeat what the Minister said.  He stated that whether or not the midlands export project goes ahead, this country will still need a grid that is fit for purpose.  The plans to develop the grid do not have, and never did have, anything to do with the midlands export project. That project remains a novel project which, if realised, will bring jobs and wealth to Ireland.<\/p><p>Looking at the 2030 targets, the overarching objective is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies into the future.  Ireland is very reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs.  While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy.  We are aiming for a new EU energy and climate change framework for 2030 and towards achieving a low carbon economy by 2050.  Following the recent publication by the European Commission of its proposal for a 2030 climate and energy framework, the Department is undertaking analysis to establish the scale of the contribution Ireland can make to meeting these targets, while ensuring that action taken will be cost effective and will not impose an undue burden on our recovering economy.<\/p><p>As I do not have time to read my prepared speech in full, I will make it available to the House and Senators may read it later.  <\/p><p>I wish to make some key points before I finish.  Reference was made to oil and gas by Senators and we are trying to develop our offshore energy also.  I was in Bellanaboy recently, which is a remote area of Mayo.  What impressed me was that in one of the remotest part of the country, there are over 1,000 people working.  The Senator may laugh, but we can look at the number of cars there and see the local economy benefit and how important it is to it.  If we can achieve significant oil and gas finds off our Atlantic coast - there is significant interest in our potential there - this will be important for the country and will bring thousands of jobs.  Any such development will need to meet all our environmental, health and safety requirements.<\/p><p>People cannot put their heads in the sand and go against everything.  To go back to the Senator, I put it to him again that we know what he is against.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200021#X00300","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1394630700,"counter":236,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is being disingenuous.

It happens.  In fact, unfortunately I have been partially responsible for poor Senator Keane being on the receiving end of interesting decisions from the Chair when I was in it as well.  Apologies to her.  <\/p> <p>As my colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne, has outlined, we are supporting this Private Member's motion.  There are a number of issues surrounding it that are of interest to me and perhaps we might tease out some of them.  I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on doing more than just standing up and reading a script of some ten or 11 pages of turgid detail that would have put us all to sleep, with all due respect to whoever drafted it.  I accept that the facts must be recorded, but at least the Minister of State has contributed to a more lively and animated exchange, rather than just reading a long script.<\/p><p>I am particularly interested in the memorandum of understanding between the UK Government and Ireland, in the light of the recent decisions taken about the wind farm projects in the midlands, about which many people in the area are particularly pleased.  These decisions do not change my party's view which is shared by the Government, that it is vital that renewable energy projects be developed in a manner which is sensitive to the environment and which will benefit local communities.  I could not help but reflect on what was happening at the Corrib gas field.  Yet another legal challenge has been mounted against an Environmental Protection Agency study.  Despite the fact that I have read it twice, I still do not fully understand the basis for that challenge.  It has something to do with the manner in which the project is progressing.  Any international investor watching what goes on in this country in the context of mineral, gas and oil developments will note that the amount of time it takes from discovery of a reserve to getting it to the marketplace is unacceptably long.  I say this while fully accepting that energy projects should be developed in a manner which is sensitive to the communities affected.  <\/p><p>When Members of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications met public representatives from Norway about 18 months ago, we asked them about local sensitivities in the context of onshore facilities.  While they had numerous such facilities, they had nothing like the problems we have encountered with the Corrib gas field because they had engaged, from the outset, with local communities.  That is where mistakes were made here.  The Government at the time saw this as an opportunity and decided, within the existing parameters of legislation at the time, to just go ahead.  It decided that it was good for Ireland, but it created a monster that is still with us.  That is very unfortunate, from the perspective of the country as a whole.  I am not for one moment criticising the people who are living in the area and have legitimate complaints.  I do not know what it is like because I am not living there, but I am not going to cast aspersions on the challenges that have been mounted during the years by members of the local community.  However, it seems, on balance, that the majority of the community in County Mayo are in favour of the project.  The amount of money that has been pumped into the local economy is significant.  Belmullet and the surrounding area have been revived by the investment.  I hope the Government will look at the experience with the Corrib gas field and ensure all of the checks and balances put in place since the initiation of the project will mean that we will not have a repeat of that experience.  I am somewhat concerned that outside investors will look at Ireland and ask, &quot;Why bother?&quot;  They will wonder if it is worth the hassle, particularly given that several hundred wells have been sunk in the past 30 years and that there have only been two or three successes.  Those who suggest we should follow the Norwegian regime are living in cloud cuckoo land because we are in a totally different position.  If one drills a well anywhere in the North Sea, one will find oil, but that is not the case around our coast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200021#X01200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394631300,"counter":246,"content":"<p>That is not what the Fianna F&aacute;il representatives said at the joint committee.

The Kinsale field - that is what we have got.  No gas has come from the Corrib gas field in the past 15 years.  That is all I am saying.

The Northern Ireland Executive is a regional assembly, not a government.  It is in no way comparable with the sovereign Government of the Republic of Ireland.  It is under the thumb of Westminster which, through the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has already embarked on the introduction of a series of tax measures to incentivise and encourage companies to come to the United Kingdom and engage in fracking.  County Fermanagh is seen as a potential site for the production of shale gas.

I wish that was possible, but let us sort out the fracking issue first and then we can talk about whether we can have joined-up thinking on an all-island energy policy.  Fracking is the elephant in the room, as Sinn F&eacute;in knows.  Those who live in my part of the country know that it will create enormous difficulties down the line.  All I am saying is that we must find out what is going on in the North of Ireland.  What is the relationship between the Westminster Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly in the context of this issue?<\/p><p>  I commend to the House and the Minister of State a report published by Committee C of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on renewable wave and tidal energy.  I am not sure if it was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, but I do know that it was submitted to the British and Irish Governments.  It makes a number of recommendations, one of which is that an intensified effort be made in the United Kingdom and Ireland to understand, address and remove barriers and constraints on commercial or trade participation in the marine energy sector.  I applaud the Government for its recent initiatives in that regard.  There was a two page report in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> earlier this week gaving an outline of the potential for the development of wave energy projects off the west coast.  I hope this will continue to be a major priority for the Department.  We are at a very early stage and playing catch-up with the Scots who are the leaders in this field.  However, we have the potential to outpace them.  I commend the Government's initiatives in this regard and hope it will continue to support the development of technologies that will lead to the harnessing of wave energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200022#Y03700","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1394631900,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for the debate on this important subject.  Everyone is affected by the need for renewable energy.  All of the new commissioned studies in this area are good.  In line with EU law and our international commitments to reduce carbon emissions, we must ensure we have a sustainable and renewable energy supply.  Decarbonising our energy system is our priority and is required by the EU.  As well as energy efficiency, securing a sustainable energy supply is a cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that between 25% and 30% of capital investment in renewable energy is retained in the local economy.  The Minister spoke earlier about 1,000 jobs created by renewable energy in Mayo.  We have a beautiful and green country, which the Government acknowledged in its amendment by stating &ldquo;the Irish landscape is unique in its natural beauty and a significant natural resource in aesthetic, environmental and economic terms, and [...] the construction of any major infrastructural project must take these factors into account.&rdquo;  The Minister acknowledged that as a central pillar of good governance, communities have a democratic right to influence decisions concerning the siting of energy infrastructure projects.<\/p><p>  It is also important to state the benefits of renewable energy.  In 2007, the EU agreed a new climate and energy target of obtaining 60% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.  The Government has committed &euro;26 million to research the best options in achieving this target.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, as well as the Minster of State, Deputy Dowds, have stated that if there is nothing in terms of jobs or revenue for Ireland from the memorandum of understanding on co-operation in the energy sector recently signed between Ireland and the United Kingdom, there will be no agreement.<\/p><p>  Reports have shown that there is real opportunity to develop wind generation offshore as well as onshore.  Given our proximity, the Irish Sea is ideal for the development of offshore wind farms, even with existing technologies.  Such projects have considerable cost advantages over existing and planned projects in the North Sea, which are also further offshore and in significantly deeper waters.  As conventional energy sources run out, Ireland has an extraordinary opportunity to use its natural resources in a cost-competitive way to achieve energy independence and become a world leader in the use of clean, green energy.<\/p><p>  Wind-generated energy exportation could account for 20% of gross domestic product income in the next 40 years.  This was pointed out by the environmentalist John Travers in his book <i>Green and Gold: Ireland a Clean Energy World Leader?<\/i>.  We must be ambitious in this regard.  Price competitiveness is key to this debate.  Ireland imports 95% of its gas and all of its oil.  Currency fluctuations, together with transportation costs, were factors in driving sizeable price increases in gas and electricity over the past several years.  The Government has taken measures to ensure the customer is protected from higher prices through commercial and residential market regulation, targeted assistance for large energy users and continued support for cost-effective and timely investment in networks.<\/p><p>  Foreign direct investment depends on Ireland's maintaining a 100% reliable electricity supply.  Like Senator Mulcahy, I thank the ESB crews who restored disrupted power supplies very quickly during the recent storms.  The timely and cost-effective delivery of energy infrastructure is important to the country.  An analysis is being undertaken of the cost of placing new pylons over-ground versus the cost of undergrounding.  A previous energy regulator stated that there would be an extra cost of &euro;2 billion if the new transmission network was undergrounded.  The Government will undertake a new analysis of undergrounding, however.  The welcome consultation process on the siting of pylons for the developed transmission network has concluded and will now be considered by the Minister.  I know of a case in which An Bord Plean&aacute;la insisted on the removal of a wind turbine because it interfered with the character of the landscape, as well as having an impact on the archaeology of the area.  Any general exemptions to planning are still subject to certain restrictions, which are outlined in SI No. 600\/2001.  The planning guidelines we have in place are designed to ensure a consistent approach.<\/p><p>  The wind we have is four times more powerful than in any other country in Europe.  We must be proactive in using these resources.  The initial consultation on pylons between EirGrid and local communities might not have been as good or informative as it should have been.  Hopefully that will be addressed in the upcoming consultation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200023#Z00100","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1394631900,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on its introduction of this Private Members&rsquo; motion, and Fianna F&aacute;il is delighted to be able to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200023#Z00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1394631900,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Yet one of the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators will vote against the motion.

Within the constituency in County Donegal in which I live, I was involved in a campaign in the Glen of Glenties, where a major investment of wind turbines was being developed.  Planning permission had been granted by Donegal County Council, the local communities were up in arms and thankfully, An Bord Plean&aacute;la overturned the decision of the local authority regarding that particular development.<\/p><p>I recognise, as a scientist, that there is scientific evidence on both sides of the argument.  That said, I refer to the overwhelming evidence that has been accepted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la both in this case and in respect of a project to put pylons into west County Donegal in the period between 2001 and 2003.  The board listened to concerns put forward at the time by eminent scholars and professors, whereby there were close linkages between electricity pylons and childhood leukaemia.  Regardless of whether they stand up scientifically and regardless of whether the developers of such projects, be it EirGrid or anyone else, can provide evidence to suggest this may not be the case, they cannot provide concrete evidence that it is not the case.  When questions arise in respect of citizens' health, be they children or any other citizens, an independent approach then must be adopted.  While I acknowledge that an independent panel has been established, it does not go far enough.  The views of local communities have been and are being abandoned in this entire process and the consultation process often is left to the discretion of the developers, which is wrong.  Some level of independence must be brought to bear in respect of the development of both pylons and wind farms and there must be some level of independent analysis of the facts.<\/p><p>As for the issue regarding the project with our British counterparts, why should local communities in this country pay the price just because the British authorities wish to meet their Kyoto Protocol targets?  That is wrong, and the Minister who was involved in that particular contract should provide clarity and must outline to the people the facts in this regard.  While Ireland certainly has obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, focusing attention exclusively on the development of wind turbines is not the approach to take.  If he can, the Minister of State might also outline to the House all the funding that has been made available to private investors for wind energy projects nationwide.  He might explain the reason each citizen in the country pays approximately &euro;10 per electricity bill towards the development of wind-related projects, which often goes to multi-million euro projects undertaken by wealthy developers.  Where is that money going and is it being paid to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland?  Members will have noted the amount of money that authority pays to consultants.  Where is that money going?  Why are all citizens, irrespective of whether they believe in wind as an alternative source, obliged to pay this to their electricity supplier under the public service obligation?  Some clarity must be provided in respect of that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200024#AA01000","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1394632500,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State the House.

Speaking of noise, the entire debate on this issue has been characterised by a great deal of noise and very little light on both sides of the argument.  In my own simple way, I wish to clarify the issue for myself and perhaps in so doing might also be of some help to other Members.  One can ask three questions with regard to the entire project.  The first is whether one agrees in the first instance that it is necessary to upgrade the grid.  While I believe most people would, I have heard some public commentary from people who are adamantly opposed to upgrading the grid and who have stated publicly there is no need to so do.  One of those people happens to be a candidate for Fianna F&aacute;il in the European elections.  Therefore, the disparity of views in this regard is evident even within parties, and sometimes the upgrading of the grid might not be necessarily the main point of contention for some parties.  It may be that political and electoral advantage are more important for its members.  However, if one agrees that the grid needs to be upgraded, then it should be done, and those who assert that no upgrade of the grid is required must give a response to a question.  I refer to a scenario in which a major high-energy user of electricity decides to set up here in Ireland and wishes to provide 1,000 jobs in a region like the south east but then decides that because the one thing missing is a safe, secure and sustainable supply of electricity, it is unable to so do.  What would the objectors tell the potential employees in the south east or somewhere else?  What would they do or say?  Would they wash their hands of it and state it is none of their business?  Of course it is their business.  That is the first question.<\/p><p>Second, if one agrees the grid is to be upgraded, one must ask in the course of so doing whether is it prudent and wise to add capacity to the grid that might cater for or accommodate new sources of energy that might be available.  A moment ago Senator Barrett pointed to the idea of fracking in the United States, which has driven down oil prices internationally.

In this context, one can consider the east-west interconnector, which is a cable 260 km in length that connects north Wales to north Dublin.  It was noted in the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann price index of last May that electricity is traded both ways and that the interconnector between north Wales and Dublin has contributed to the reduction in wholesale electricity prices.  Who could be against that?  Does one wish to keep energy prices high or is it a good idea to trade abroad any energy surplus one might have and to import energy when one is short of it?

Should we have overground or underground cables?  The Minister has appointed the former judge Catherine McGuinness to adjudicate on the terms of reference, which are the most important part of any argument.  One could have narrow terms of reference, as perhaps did EirGrid in the past, or one could have objectively set terms of reference for the project, and Ms McGuinness will do that.  EirGrid will make proposals to her that she will examine, after which she will state objectively whether these terms of reference are sufficiently wide.  I note that in the opening remarks to his contribution my colleague and friend Senator Byrne stated that one could not trust the Government, the Minister, EirGrid or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and one now could not trust the former judge Catherine McGuinness, but one could trust Fianna F&aacute;il.  That is the argument Senator Byrne and Fianna F&aacute;il wish people could sustain.  I cannot sustain that argument because people did trust Fianna F&aacute;il in the course of three elections and now look at where we are.

The problem, however, is that they cannot vote according to their convictions.

All of us have seen the map of the proposed corridors for the EirGrid massive pylon project.  These pylons will cut through communities, towns and parishes across our country.  In regard to the proposal to put pylons underground, we need look no further than the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) (Amendment) Bill 2014, which I introduced to the House.  That Bill would require high-voltage lines to be placed underground wherever it is physically possible to do so.  I ask the Government to make time for a debate on the Bill.  Although these issues have been discussed extensively on the Order of Business and elsewhere, the Government has not facilitated an extended debate on how we will meet our renewable energy targets or on high-voltage lines and pylons.  We are now confronted with the prospect that hundreds of turbines, pylons and power lines will become part of the landscape and consciousness of rural Ireland for generations, shaping the way future generations perceive our landscape.  Some of these pylons are only 10 m shorter than Liberty Hall.  Imagine a long line of such pylons across the landscape at intervals of 250 m.  They will be located inside a corridor 1 km in width, with planning applications for final routes to be decided later.<\/p><p>  The all-island grid study of 2008 did not give serious consideration to placing the cables underground.  A commission has now been put together in advance of the local elections to consider placing high-voltage lines underground as an afterthought.  I have the greatest of respect for members and former members of the Judiciary but it may be preferable to stay away from the Judiciary when commissions are established on such an <i>ad hoc<\/i> basis in future.  Members of the Judiciary have an important role in upholding the rule of law but this commission is political in its inspiration and has not been established with the common good in mind.

My colleague Senator Cullinane will respond to the comments made during the course of the debate.  All of us will be aware from constituency meetings and social media of the considerable public opposition to the construction of pylons.  This was highlighted in the large number of submissions made to EirGrid on the issue.  The construction of this infrastructure should be put on hold to allow a plan to be designed that addresses the concerns of residents and exploits our natural resources to their greatest potential.<\/p><p>I commend those communities in Counties Monaghan, Armagh, Cavan, Tyrone and Meath which since 2007 have pursued a campaign against plans by EirGrid and Northern Ireland Energy, NIE, to impose high-voltage overhead power lines and associated pylons on them.  They have now been joined by communities from the west, midlands and the south, because this is an issue that affects communities throughout the island.  I pay particular tribute to the Trojan work done by campaigning organisations in frustrating and delaying the efforts of EirGrid and NIE to ignore the concerns of unwilling host communities and impose their structures on our natural landscape.<\/p> <p>The landscapes that will be blighted by this are tourism resources and of massive benefit to the economy.  Erecting these pylons will do untold damage to our reputation in tourism.  There will not be much of a repeat of The Gathering if we do so.<\/p><p>Real concerns were heard during the course of the debate about health, the landscape, the environment and the economic development of the areas concerned.  To their credit, most of the communities involved have not expressed opposition to the need for interconnectors or an enhanced electricity network.  They have, simply and correctly, demanded that the cables be placed underground.  Many reports clearly prove that putting power lines underground is possible and feasible.  Many argue that in the medium and long term undergrounding is economically beneficial.  To reiterate what Senator David Cullinane said in his opening remarks, EirGrid claims undergrounding would be two and a half or three times the cost of pylons.  It had previously stated it would be ten times more expensive and before that, that it would be 40 times more expensive.  Before that again, it stated it could not be done.<\/p><p>We have heard a lot about the Danish model.  The Danish Government has set in train a process to ensure all high voltage power lines will in the future be placed underground.  It is time the Governments, North and South, followed suit.  We should aim to make Ireland a world leader in underground technology which is evolving fast.  We should aim to enhance our reputation in terms of tourism and our natural environment.

They argue that to protect the consumer properly, all those who play an active part in the construction process should be assessed on their own merits and competence and regulated as necessary on that basis.  The amended buillding regulations zone in on the essence of architectural technology, but they do not provide for the role of those who are trained and experienced in this area.  As a result, their skills set, while relevant to the construction industry and the building regulations, is outside the terms of the Building Control Act 2007.  Although the Act alludes to their role, it is not adequately catered for.  To play a role in this new regime, professional architectural technologists, many of whom have decades of experience in this field, have to deny their primary qualification in architectural technology and claim instead to be either architects or building surveyors to seek entry to the statutory registers.  The insistence that those who operate within the scope of the Act should declare themselves as architects or building surveyors and submit for registration in these fields is flawed and will lead to many unsuccessful registration applications and more problems for the Department.  To present it as a solution to those faced with retraining or an exit from their profession makes matters much worse.<\/p> <p>The irony is the regulations demand that architectural technologists would brand themselves as architects or building surveyors in order to continue doing what they currently do.  The mantra that architects, engineers and building surveyors are those most commonly involved in the completion of construction projects is not entirely accurate, as professional architectural technologists carry out some but not always all the duties of architects and building surveyors on the basis of multiple shared competencies.  Such individuals possess varying degrees of academic training but with a different focus from that of either of the regulated professions.<\/p><p>Many architectural technologists would have successfully completed a wide variety of construction projects but most would have done so on the basis of their particular qualification, often as part of a team and usually without the necessity to use any protected title.  That is why many would now be reluctant to make a declaration regarding the breadth of their duties in comparison to those of an architect or building surveyor on foot of the scope of services provided.  Some would be limited by the scale of the project with which they would be independently involved and others would have limited exposure to specialised areas.  Many simply find the contradiction of claiming to be something they are not to be very difficult and attempts at registration will suffer on the back of this.<\/p><p>For the current system to be fair, specific provision should be made within the registration process for a particular skill set of experienced, professionally accredited architectural technologists as qualified professionals in their own right.  The regulations must include a viable and sustainable role for the country's architectural technologists, and it is vital that those who can bring clarity to this issue for architectural technology professions do so clearly and without fear or favour of any other party.  Architectural technologists should be included in the regulations process, as this is a very big cause of concern.  Over the past decade or more a vast number of architectural technologists have gone through the third level system and there has been an increase in the level of national framework qualifications.  It is important these people are recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200027#EE01000","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394634600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Reilly for raising the issue, which I am happy to take on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Hogan.<\/p><p>I am aware of the role and contribution made by architectural technologists in the design and construction of dwellings and other buildings.  The recent building control amendment regulations empower competence and professionalism in construction activity and, as such, will increase the opportunities available for all competent and qualified persons in the industry, not least the architectural technologist.  The new regulations strengthen the arrangements in place for the control of building activity by requiring greater accountability in compliance with building regulations.  In particular, statutory certificates of compliance must be signed by a registered professional, such as an architect or a building surveyor registered in line with the Building Control Act 2007 or a chartered engineer registered under earlier legislation.  These are the professional groupings typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland.<\/p><p>Depending on their personal circumstances it may be open to individual members of the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists, CIAT, to seek inclusion on the statutory registers and a significant number have succeeded in becoming so registered.  There is no question of persons who are not included on the statutory registers being permitted to sign certificates of compliance for building control purposes.  It is worth noting that registration of title became necessary in order to protect consumers from persons passing themselves off as architects, surveyors or engineers, and this is still happening.  It will be less likely to occur now that statutory certificates must be given by registered professionals.<\/p><p>The Department has engaged openly and constructively with CIAT on this matter and it has outlined a number of options in keeping with the Building Control Act 2007 that may be pursued to develop the arrangements in place for the registration of its chartered architectural technologist members.  This engagement has led to CIAT presenting separate cases for recognition of its chartered members under both the surveyor and the architect registers, based on benchmarking the competence of their chartered members against the existing routes to registration.  The SCSI and the RIAI, as the registration bodies for the relevant professions and as the competent authorities in Ireland for the purposes of the EU directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, are considering the cases put forward by CIAT.<\/p><p>Neither the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government nor his Department has any role in the assessment or the validation of professional qualifications in this manner and they cannot pre-empt the outcome in either case.  However, should the SCSI or the RIAI determine that the competence of the chartered architectural technologist is equivalent to the requirements for inclusion on either register, it would fall on the Minister to bring forward relevant suitable amendments to the Building Control Act 2007.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200028#FF00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","time":1394634600,"counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200028#FF00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1394634600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter, which is of importance to the recovery of this country.  It is the need for a bank to actively lend to the small and medium enterprise sector.  This week we were informed by reports in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> that lending to small and medium enterprises has declined for each of the past three quarters when lending to farms and property companies is excluded from the figures proffered.  This is on top of news from last year, when the Department of Finance told us 24% of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, refused finance were not given any reason and nearly half of applications are taking longer than the Government-recommended 15 days to turn around.  These kinds of statistics make me genuinely fear for a lost decade in Irish society, as we have not adequately addressed the deep-seated problems with competition in the banking sector.  We need to tackle it head on.<\/p><p>  Small and medium enterprises make up 99% of all businesses in this country yet we have a loan rejection rate second only to Greece in the eurozone at 24%.  We have the second-highest level of discouraged borrowers and we also have the worst terms and conditions applying to new credit in the EU.  If people want a commercial loan or mortgage, they must come up with a 33% deposit in order to get the loan and be approved by the bank, and they also need to pay conveyancing fees not only for their own solicitor but that of the bank as well.  Such issues must be addressed very quickly.<\/p><p>  We can compare small and medium enterprise lending against best practice in the western world.  In most First World countries, lending is proffered on a cash flow basis and not on bricks and mortar security, as continues to be the case in Ireland.  As a result of the property crash we must have a major shift in thinking or else we will miss out on the next Facebook or Steve Jobs kind of entrepreneur.  Despite AIB and Bank of Ireland giving the Government an undertaking to lend &euro;3.6 billion to small and medium enterprises for 2013, it seems that to a certain degree we are being duped.  What may not be obvious to some is that banks include in their calculations restructuring of debt, renewal of season loans and overdraft facilities, changing overdraft facilities into term loans, as well as all agriculture, retail and service loans.  The portion relating to the likes of manufacturing is minute in terms of the existing small and medium enterprise book and new finance.<\/p><p>  It is clear we need proper banking competition in this country and if we cannot succeed in making those banks bailed out by the Irish people lend to the small and medium enterprise sector in the way they should, we must set up or encourage a new institution to set up here.  We need a properly focused business bank that would target more than half of lending on the SME sector and commercial enterprises so we can ensure cash flow businesses are being adequately financed.  To give an example, a licence was given to an enterprise called Metro Bank, with over half of its lending targeted at the SME sector only.  The Department of Finance and the Central Bank must bear that in mind when they devise policy in the area.<\/p><p>  We are letting go opportunities to finance Irish businesses and entrepreneurs, and we are not offering money to people based on the strength of business plans but rather bricks and mortar security, with which I have difficulty.  If we do not correct the trend and take remedial action, we will face an issue of paralysis for small and medium enterprises in the country.  Without a working banking system, we will not be able to rebuild Ireland.  SMEs cater for 99% of all businesses, and they have a real role in revitalising local towns and villages.  We must recognise how critical they are for economic development, and we must do everything we can to address what has been inflicted upon them.  For that reason I ask the Minister for Finance, in conjunction with the Central Bank, to consider granting a new licence to a business-based bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200028#FF00300","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1394635200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>The Government acknowledges that SMEs are the lifeblood of the Irish economy and play a crucial role in employment growth in our country.  Since March 2011 Government policy has concentrated on ensuring that viable micro, small and medium sized enterprises have access to capital, equity and debt funding from a more diverse range of sources.  Experience has shown us that not only do SMEs need credit from banks but some SMEs have an appetite to take equity and other investments from market-based funders.  The NPRF has committed to using its funds to help the flow of credit to the SME sector through the SME equity fund, the SME credit fund, the SME turnabout fund and the innovation fund, all of which are up and running.<\/p><p>In budget 2014, the Minister for Finance introduced a number of measures for funding growth in the SME sector including enhancing the Credit Review Office, devising a comprehensive communication strategy on Government supports for SMEs, improving the financial education of SMEs and measures to help SMEs to export.  The Government supports seed and venture capital directly through Enterprise Ireland and has established a credit guarantee scheme.  Microfinance Ireland can also help smaller SMEs and Senators and Deputies can help us to spread that message in their constituency clinics.  The launch of the development capital scheme will help firms with high growth and job creation potential.  The actions outlined above show that the Government is fully committed to maximising the potential of the SME sector in any way it possibly can so that the people will benefit from a thriving domestic economy.  <\/p><p>The Senator should note that it is unlikely that the Central Bank would refuse a license to an SME-focused bank provided such an application complied with all relevant laws and procedures.  As this House will no doubt be aware, the Taoiseach mentioned in the D&aacute;il at the time of the exit from the troika programme that he had held discussions with Chancellor Merkel on ways in which Germany could actively support our efforts to foster economic recovery.  The discussions included a specific focus on finding ways to reinforce Ireland's economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs.  In that context the German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.  Officials of the Department of Finance have already exchanged working papers on this subject with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance.  There have been meetings on this matter in Berlin, Frankfurt and Dublin as well as numerous teleconferences, including two last week.<\/p><p>The NTMA and the Department of Finance are currently working on the details of the debt products to be offered to the SME sector with a view to making them attractive in terms of both cash flow and accessibility.  As we are trying to ensure that any initiative that comes out of this process is as effective as it can be, we will be discussing approaches that meet the strategic objectives of all stakeholders and ultimately facilitate lending to the real economy, in particular to SMEs in Ireland.  In addition, the medium-term economic strategy and in turn, the action plan for jobs, commits the Government to working with multilateral development and national development banks to develop new sources of finance for SMEs.  In this context we will also be exploring how the European Investment Bank's assistance can continue to be leveraged to the maximum benefit of the Irish economy.<\/p><p>Experience in other countries suggests that any lending facilitated by a national development bank like KfW or a strategic investment bank is generally complementary to lending already taking place in an economy and can assist commercial banks with access to cheaper credit lines such as from the European Investment Bank.  Additionally, the Government has decided to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF which will absorb the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF.  Using the ISIF, we will further maximise our resources to enhance growth in the Irish economy and improve key infrastructure to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and to create employment.  As announced, the legislation for ISIF will be introduced in the Oireachtas shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014031200029#GG00100","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1394635200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his answer and acknowledge all of the efforts being made by this Government.  The creation of 61,000 new jobs last year, so soon after taking office, is indicative of the success of its policies.  However, we all know of small businesses in towns and villages all over Ireland that have closed down as a consequence of the recession.  I am trying to draw a parallel with what happened in the 1980s.  At that time, ICC bank and ACC bank were operating here and had targeted lending structures for the agricultural community and the SME sector.  I am opposed to the funds that are potentially coming from Germany through KfW going into our pillar banks which have legacy issues vis-&agrave;-vis their customers.  We need a third force in banking in this country and the Government needs to create that.  That would really assist all of the ancillary work that has been done by the Government, as outlined by the Minister of State.  We need fresher thinking in the context of granting loans to business people.  We need to move away from bricks and mortar security and ensure that the viability of any business is assessed on the basis of its business plan and not on whether it has 30% or 33% of a deposit to invest in a building.
