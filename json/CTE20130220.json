The topic for discussion is social welfare appeals.  When we were setting our schedule of meetings for this year, members looked for this meeting to examine the system for appealing social protection decisions, in particular, the length of time involved.  Members have been provided with some documents from the Free Legal Advice Centres which is anxious for us to note its work on the appeals situation.  I am pleased to welcome officials from the Department of Social Protection to discuss the matter with us.  I welcome Ms Geraldine Gleeson, chief appeals officer, Mr. Ken Kelly, appeals officer, and Mr. Brendan O'Leary, appeals officer.<\/p><p>  I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now invite Ms Gleeson to make her opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000003#C00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1361365200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee for giving me this opportunity to address them on the issue of social welfare appeals.  The issue which members wish me to address today is the delay being experienced by appellants in the processing of those appeals.  In my opening statement, I will outline the current position with regard to processing times and the number of cases on-hand, and also outline the likely outturn for this year.<\/p><p>  As members are aware, the number of appeals submitted to the social welfare appeals office, SWAO, has increased dramatically since 2008 with the number of receipts doubling from an average of 15,000 a year to 35,484 in 2012.  While this number is high, to put it in context, there is now on average in excess of two million claims made for payment across the range of social welfare schemes on an annual basis.  Members will also be aware that as a result of actions taken in the SWAO to address this increase, including the assignment of additional appeals officers whose numbers have increased from around 17 to 40 and improved processes, the number of cases finalised has risen from an average of 13,500 to 32,558 in 2012.  Nonetheless, because of the increase in the number of appeals, our customers have experienced significant and unacceptable delays in the time taken to conclude appeals.<\/p><p>  As of 2012, there are two aspects to the delays being experienced.  One is that the processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process, including many elements which are outside the control of my office.  In the current economic climate when all areas of the Department are under pressure, the reality is that an appeal case may experience several delays along the way.  Delays can be experienced when the appeal is sent to the Department for a submission from the deciding officer who originally decided the case or in the medically based schemes where further examination by medical assessors is required and where most of them would get a second go at the cherry.  In some cases where means might be the issue, there might be a subsequent investigation by a social welfare inspector.  Each of these areas carries its own possible delay.  The schemes which have the highest waiting times are the medically based schemes.  I have provided members with a table showing the breakdown in processing times for these schemes between the Department and my office.  I have picked the past six months of 2012 because that is when our own processing times began to significantly improve.   I have also provided figures for January of this year.  What the table shows is the appeals office significantly improved its processing times.  For example, the first column which deals with carer's allowance shows that in 2011, the time taken in our office was 19.6 weeks.  In 2012, the time taken was 13.2 weeks.  The same is true for disability allowance so members can see that the time taken in the appeals office has diminished while the times for the Department have gone up.  I will address the reason for that in a minute. <\/p><p>  My office is liaising on a regular basis with the Department with a view to improving these processing times.  I understand that the Department is actively involved in clearing backlogs on a number of these schemes.  I am sure some members have been briefed on this.  They include carer's allowance, invalidity pension and disability allowance.  My understanding is that good progress is being made with these backlogs with the invalidity pension backlog fully processed, the carer's allowance backlog on target to be processed by the end of March and the disability allowance backlog on target to be processed by the end of June.  The clearing of this high volume of initial claims has resulted in a large increase in the level of appeals at a time when all available resources in the Department are involved in claim processing.  The Department informs me that as the backlogs are reduced, more resources will be focused on appeals with the intention of reducing delays within the Department.<\/p><p>  Some delays have also developed in the processing of medical assessments and reviews due to a combination of factors including the increased workload for medical assessors and the reduced availability of medical assessors due to retirements.  The Department is addressing this issue and I understand it recently ran a competition to establish a new panel of medical assessors.  Three new medical assessors were appointed from this panel and have been working since November 2012.  It is expected that a further eight medical assessors will be appointed in the near future.<\/p><p>  The second issue relating to processing times was the very significant disparity between the time taken for a summary decision and an oral hearing.  For example, in 2011, the average processing time for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks whereas for an oral hearing it was 52.5 weeks.  This was a result of the operating model within my office whereby files were assigned to an appeals officer who either decided the appeal summarily or returned the file to be listed for an oral hearing, most likely by a different appeals officer.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000003#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361365800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gleeson and call the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, Deputy Willie O'Dea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000004#D00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1361365800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gleeson for her presentation.  I have regular dealings with the social welfare appeals office and take the opportunity to thank the staff of that office for the courtesy I am always shown.<\/p><p>  In the context of the table Ms Gleeson provided, it is disappointing, despite all the work that has been done, that matters have not really improved with regard to the period between the making of an initial application and an appeal.  In some instances, they have marginally disimproved.  I take the point that some of this is outside the Department's control.  I am aware that officers in Limerick dealing with appeals related to supplementary welfare applications still have not received some of the material they require.  This is despite the fact that the appeals in question may have been made between six and eight months ago.  That is outrageous, particularly in the context of making a basic payment.  As Ms Gleeson is aware, supplementary welfare is designed to tide people over while they are waiting for something better to come along or for a decision on their social welfare claims.  It is unacceptable that people are being obliged to wait six to eight months for payment because the Department simply has not furnished the relevant information to the appeals office.<\/p><p>  I am glad that the processing times between the holding of oral hearings and the making of summary decisions have been reduced.  However, as I understand it, there is still a difference of three months in this regard.  According to statistics provided by FLAC for 2011, the success rate in oral hearings was 48%, whereas that in the case of summary decisions was only 25%.  FLAC recommended that appellants be informed of this and encouraged to seek oral hearings.  It has been my experience that appellants are being informed that if they seek such hearings, it will be months before they are held, which is something of a deterrent.  Rather than deterring people or advising them to take a course of action which may lessen their chances, we should advise them on the possibility of achieving greater success through oral hearings.  Will Ms Gleeson provide an indication as to when the gap in time between the holding of oral hearings and the making of summary decisions will be completely closed?  In other words, when will there be a similar timescale for the two?<\/p><p>  In the context of the Department not sending on material in respect of invalidity pension and carer's allowance claims, etc., as stated, I deal with the relevant staff on a regular basis and do not believe what is happening in this regard has anything to do with their competence or ability.  There are simply too few such staff.  A follow-up to the Croke Park agreement is being negotiated.  My understanding was that one of the fundamental terms of the original agreement was that staff would be readily deployable.  In other words, the Government is supposed to be in a position to take staff from places where they are not exactly worked and redeploy them to areas where existing staff have too much work in hand.  This does not seem to have happened to any great degree in the Department of Social Protection.  This provision should be entrenched in the follow-up to the Croke Park agreement.  There has been a great deal of public debate about people who work in certain areas and payments for overtime, working unsocial hours, etc.  From the point of view of customers, namely, those the public service is supposed to serve, a fundamental provision in this regard should be contained in the follow-up to the Croke Park agreement.  This is part of the original Croke Park deal which has not been implemented.<\/p><p>  Some time ago FLAC made submissions at a meeting we attended in the Mansion House and one of the points it made - I do not say this in a critical way - was that, under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the social welfare appeals system was required to be fully independent.  It is not, of course, fully independent because it is actually part of the Department of Social Protection and there is no security of tenure for appeals officers, etc.  Another important point FLAC made was that there was not equality between an appellant and the Department in the event of an appeal.  For example, social welfare appellants are not entitled to civil legal aid to assist in his or her appeal.  This is despite the fact that he or she will be up against someone on the other side who is an expert.  More importantly, there appears to be a problem in that the social welfare officers who represent the Department at appeal hearings have access to more information than appellants who do not have full access to the information on their cases which is in the possession of the former.  That seems fundamentally unfair.  However, I will not belabour the point.<\/p><p>  I thank our guests for the work they are doing.  I do not doubt their bona fides for one moment, but when I consider the totality of the situation in respect of someone on carer's allowance whose application is refused in the first instance - as is the case with many individuals - and who then makes an appeal, I am aware that the duration of the process has been reduced by four weeks.  However, it still lasts for over eight months.  The position on disability allowance applications is much the same.  The situation with regard to invalidity pension applications has worsened because the period has lengthened from 35 weeks to 39.  I appreciate the work our guests are doing, but there is still a long way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000004#D00300","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1361365800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith ag na hoifigigh as an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; acu.  <\/p><p>  I find these sessions both useful and informative in the context of the data provided.

I thank the witnesses for the report.  Progress has been made on appeals but there are still many difficulties in terms of having experienced staff who can deal with cases sensitively and properly for people who are unwell.  Is the moratorium still in place on staffing for the appeals office?  It appears to be the key problem including in relation to the medical panel.  I was on to the appeals office during the week to discuss a case in respect of which the files must be obtained from the Department which will take months.  It is crazy that the appeal has been lodged in the computer and is ready to go but we are waiting for the information to come over from the Department.  Is there any way that can be changed?<\/p><p>  There are strange issues.  Where a person applies for domiciliary care and disability allowance, most of the work will already be done, but there are still difficulties in obtaining the domiciliary care approval and the matter goes to appeal.  I have a case where a 16 year old has had an appeal in D'Olier Street since last year.  I cannot understand what the problem is and why a decision cannot be made more quickly.  The information is already on file from when she applied for domiciliary care in the first place but extra information is needed.  I cannot understand where a case is ongoing why there is such a lengthy wait for an appeal given that the information is already there.  I understand where it is a new application.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh made the point that many people appeal rather than apply for a review which they do not realise is available and which can be dealt with more quickly.  I will leave it at that as many of the points have been covered already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000005#E00200","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1361367000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Gleeson to deal with those questions.

Deputy O'Dea asked about SWA and a delay in papers being sent to our office from the community welfare service.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh also referred to delays in SWA.  My office prioritises SWA appeals.  Once the submission is received, any SWA case is prioritised so that there is no delay from our perspective.  As to the reason for that delay happening on the SWA side, which is quite different to the medical schemes, the community welfare service and the Department were being integrated throughout last year.  As a result, duplication has been corrected but I understand there have been difficulties in some pockets.  One of the benefits of the integration is a reduction in SWA appeals.  Before the community welfare service appeals service joined our service, there were approximately 8,000 appeals relating to SWA.  Last year, the figure was approximately 4,000.  There seems to be better co-operation on the ground between the community welfare service and the Department but I accept that there are pockets where difficulties arose.  Those difficulties crystallised in delays in sending us the papers.  I understand these difficulties are being worked through and we are following up on those cases which have been delayed.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of FLAC, that appellants should be informed there is a better chance of success at oral hearing.  The other side of this point is somewhat of a criticism that the number of summary decisions increased.  That is the case, certainly.  The number of summary decisions have been at 40% of the decisions taken in a given year but this number is now 60% of the total decisions.  However, the key point is that when 40% of decisions were summary decisions, only approximately 18% to 19% were favourable decisions.  Now that figure, overall, is 30%.  What is more instructive is in what I term the subjective schemes, the medical schemes, where the issues are less objective because these are not means cases or contribution cases.  The qualifying criteria can be quite subjective.  The level of positive summary decisions rises significantly.  In the summary decisions on DA, 46% were positive; 41% of the summary decisions on carers were positive; 39% of the summary decisions on domiciliary care were positive.  These figures are much higher than the average figure.  In an effort to be more efficient and to dispose of cases summarily when we can, more emphasis was placed on ensuring that if one was 99% certain that one would make a positive decision in a case, there was probably no need to take it to oral hearing to hear that extra 1% of evidence.  In that scenario we have pushed the level of positive decisions.  I am not as concerned as may have been the case in previous times.  I am very happy to say that the number of positive summary decisions has risen.  It is a complex issue which must be monitored and we will do so.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the timescale.  An appeals officer will be in charge of approximately 100 cases.  He or she will dispose of those which can be decided summarily and the remainder will be taken to oral hearing.  By definition, the summary cases will be disposed of more quickly.  The key difference is that the timescales will become far more similar as they have done over the past year.  This is due to continue over the next year, as the experience of the officers develops.  More experience results in more confidence in disposing of cases summarily.<\/p><p>  Deputy Collins raised the matter of the Department's failure to send the medical scheme papers.  I referred to this in my opening statement.  The Department has great difficulties at the minute.  To a certain extent, I can understand that it is concentrating on the backlogs in the initial claims because those people have had no bite of the cherry.  However, given the significance of the delays for the appellants in my office, three of us meet regularly, the assistant secretary who has charge of the illness schemes, the chief medical officer and myself, to ensure that in so far as possible this is progressed.  The assistant secretary in charge of the medical schemes has given timescales for when the backlogs will be processed.  In the interim he has devoted more resources to clearing the appeals.  The difficulties on the medical side are more protracted because although the chief medical officer will be assigned more medical assessors this year - no more than in the case of our office - the time taken to train them can have an impact.  It is vital that the three of us keep meeting in order to keep up this the agenda.  I will give a brief example.  At the last meeting I was promised 1,600 cases very quickly over the next three weeks.  But for that meeting, we might not have made that progress.  It shows that co-operation is working.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Dea asked about the free legal aid report and the independence issue.  There is no doubt that my office operates independently.  In fact, the process is statutorily independent in that the statute sets out the role and duties of an appeals officer.  The courts have agreed over the years.  I do not think there has been any concerted criticism over the years that the office did not operate independently.  I can understand why FLAC raised the matter.  In general, the criticism has been that there could be a lack of confidence in the office if it were not seen to be structurally independent.  That lack of confidence has not emerged as a criticism up to now.  My own view is that whatever way it is looked at, it will be costly to become structurally independent.  For example, who would be the appeals officers in a structurally independent body?  Would these not still be experienced departmental officers, be they on redeployment or whatever?  Having spent the money on setting up an independent body, will we still be open to criticism that we are too close to the Department?  Many issues need to be considered.  My own view is that people need a flexible and accessible service.  That flexibility exists in the system as it currently operates, probably because we are still part of the Department.  Any appeal is subject to many reviews within the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361367600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I shall commence by saying the nice things first.

I acknowledge the improvements but it does not make for easy reading.

With the help of the Oireachtas line, we got a response for her within approximately six weeks and it was positive.  I do not understand why the system could not have been successful for her.  The witnesses might explain that because people are at their wits' end with these delays.<\/p><p>  What percentage of applications across the various schemes are granted without going to an appeal?  The witness referred to it but perhaps she would go through it again.  How many of those applications are granted on appeal?  I deliberately ask Ms Gleeson this question because I think the new policy of management for managing budgets is to put everything to appeal.  I have grave concern about that.  We are driving people mad.  They are totally frustrated.  Some people are being put on the bread line because of this.  There is a hostility among the public because of this type of treatment.  The hostility is wider than this issue, of course, but it is not good.  What would improve things for Ms Gleeson?

However, if she discussed what would improve matters we might be able to help.<\/p><p>  Ms Gleeson said something that I do not understand.

When they put in the application and it is refused they are told that unless they have new evidence they should not get back to the Department.

It was interesting to note in the Ombudsman's report last year that approximately one third of the complaints to the Ombudsman related to the Department of Social Protection, and many of those cases were successful following appeal to the Ombudsman.

I accept absolutely that it is an average processing time and that there will be people on the wrong side of it.  I notice that we receive many parliamentary questions about individual cases.  When I am clearing them, I see what is going through.  In recent months files with my office have almost invariably been assigned to an appeals officer.  While there would have been a delay in my office owing to cases being put in the press until they were assigned, there is very little delay in my office in that regard now.  However, I accept the Senator's point absolutely that, notwithstanding this, people are left waiting for unacceptable periods, for various reasons.

We are making positive decisions on a significant number of these cases by way of summary hearing.  I hope I get that message across.<\/p><p>  On the point that an oral hearing is the only way to go, an appeals officer is often the first person to meet the appellant on his or her journey.  Even in medical cases, one does not see the medical assessor or deciding officer.  The fact that the appeals officer is the first person one meets makes a difference because the person will present his or her case more cogently in person than he or she can on paper.  The experience of the appeals officer comes into play when he or she examines the medical evidence from the appellant's general practitioner or consultant.  He or she examines the appellant's account of the difficulties that arise.  An experienced officer can see whether he or she is likely to make a positive decision in a case.  All we are saying is that we do not want to bring such cases to an oral hearing.  In general, I do not favour saying to people that they can request an oral hearing if they like because it could give rise to an unreal expectation that they will receive one.  In some cases, there is clearly nothing to be gained from it.  I refer, in particular, to means and contribution cases.

Although there may be in individual cases, in general, there is not a long delay in getting files from local offices.  I will come back to the issue about the community welfare office, but the main delays lie with the medical assessor.  That is the first part.  The second relates to the fact that the Department is working on digital documents.  Unfortunately, in preparing a case for us, these must be printed off and pulled into a file, which results in a delay.  As I said, much effort is going into speeding this up.<\/p><p>  We can make recommendations on the forms and we do all the time.  For example, we made recommendations on domiciliary care allowance and, in particular, the level of information being given to people who are turned down and the wording of the disallowance.  There was a huge improvement in the wording after that recommendation was made.  <\/p><p>  The main development in regard to forms which is very welcome and which I have mentioned concerns the MR99 form designed for the medical schemes.  It looks for the appellants' comments.  For example, in the case of domiciliary care allowance, it asks about the interaction with the child, communication and all of the difficulties encountered on a day-to-day basis.  It also asks for the person's own account.

We are certainly very much in favour of them and they can only help an appellant's case.<\/p><p>  I refer to disability allowance and making the medical assessment but not the means assessment.  That came about because social welfare inspectors were under huge pressure in investigating means.  It was being found that many cases would be investigated for means but were turned down on the medical evidence.  The decision to do it this way was a very practical one to ease the pressure on the inspection branch.  I fully accept that in these cases where it means a second bite at the cherry, it is very difficult.  When they do this, they make it very clear to the person concerned that we have only made a decision on the medical aspects of the claim.  This is something that will be reviewed when there is not as much pressure on inspectors.  The other point is that those involved in this area did not make a desk assessment of means until recently and they have moved significantly.

I appreciate the presentation they have made and the excellent quality of their answers to our questions.  We do not always have that level of insight and openness from delegates.  The level of detail provided can sometimes be a little skimpy, but it has been helpful today.  I acknowledge the importance of the work of the appeals officers which has a significant impact on people's lives.  It must also be acknowledged that the number of finalised cases has increased by 140% since the middle of the last decade.  That is important.<\/p><p>  Like other members, I encounter a substantial volume of people at my clinics and in my office who are frustrated by the delays they encounter as they use the system.  Perhaps this problem is not mentioned in the media as much as one might expect.  The people who are using the system are isolated, rather than being part of a collective group.  Approximately 60% of those who use the SUSI system are in the appeals system.  We have heard a great deal about SUSI, but we do not hear as much about the long delays encountered by many people after they have been dealt with in the SUSI system.  There is a sense of isolation among the users of the system.<\/p><p>  It has been suggested there is not necessarily a problem with the local offices.  Can we get a county-by-county breakdown of waiting times?  If the waiting times of applicants in some counties are much higher than the national average, is a system in place to flag the problem and tackle the issues in question?<\/p><p>  I understand that when payments are reviewed and stopped, priority is given to cases involving disability and invalidity payments in order that they can be reviewed as quickly as possible.  Is that accurate?  If it is, would it be possible for that approach be extended to all payments?  In that context, I would like to mention an issue I have come across in my office.  If a person whose payment has been stopped pending a review decides to submit an appeal, he or she has to wait a long time, which is a difficulty.  The officials might be able to clarify the matter and give me a little more information on it.<\/p><p>  The arms of the State need to be responsive to the needs of citizens.  When people need the State to step in and assist them, they expect it to respond and help within a reasonable timeframe.  The impact that a shock event such as illness, an accident or the loss of one's job can have on a person's life should never be underestimated.  That is bad enough, but it is very difficult for people to have to wait for the best part of a year for assistance.  It is not good enough for citizens who have worked hard and paid taxes for all their lives - honest people who have always done everything by the book and tried to do the best they can - to be refused something they believe they are entitled to and then have to wait a long time for State assistance.<\/p><p>  Has the social welfare appeals office made projections for reductions in appeal times for the years beyond 2013?  While I acknowledge the work done to date, I emphasise that we need to reduce these waiting times further because they are far too long.  We need to ensure the system is as efficient and as responsive to users' needs as possible.  I would be interested to find out more about the projections for 2014.  Are there ambitious targets for that year and the years beyond it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000011#L01500","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1361370000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their presentation.  As Deputy Griffin said, their comprehensive answers are much appreciated.  On my own behalf and that of my staff, I genuinely thank the social welfare appeals office for the service it gives to public representatives.  I acknowledge that it is unfailingly courteous and helpful.<\/p><p>  I was struck by the figures mentioned with regard to invalidity pension and disability allowance.  In both cases, the social welfare appeals office seems to overturn decisions with extraordinary frequency.  The figure is 51% in one case and 46% in the other.  One in two decisions is likely to be overturned.  I am curious to know whether lessons are being learned.  When Ms Gleeson spoke about the connection between the appeals office and the Department, she referred to their independence.  What lessons are being learned?  Do the appeals office and the Department share knowledge?  If half of decisions are being overturned by the appeals office, there is something very wrong.  I am interested to know what steps are being taken to learn from this unnecessary duplication to try to avoid it in the future.<\/p><p>  I am aware that public representatives are and must continue to be a constant pain in the neck with our parliamentary questions, etc.  Those are my words rather than those of the officials.  As public representatives, we demand much of the social welfare appeals office's time and command many of its resources.  We certainly use up much of the time of staff with our constant barrage of queries.  By the same token, we could be a much more useful resource.  The 166 Deputies and 60 Senators offer a great deal of assistance when we meet the clients of the appeals office, but I suggest we could be given more information, advice, direction and guidance.  That suggestion is probably more relevant to the Department than to the appeals office.  The officials who are present can respond to it, if they wish.  I was going to ask whether the officials knew what percentage of their files had representations in them.  I am not sure whether they have information on the inquiries made by public representatives.

The office has demonstrated that it has made considerable progress in processing appeals, whereas the Department is moving in the opposite direction.  The presentation also indicates that 69% of delays in processing invalidity pension appeals can be attributed to the Department, while the equivalent figures for carer's allowance, disability allowance and illness benefit appeals are 60%, 58% and 49%, respectively.  If one was seeking to establish a process to improve processing times, one would tackle the largest problem, that is, delays in the Department.<\/p><p>  Ms Gleeson has indicated that the office is now working more closely with the Department and has held a couple of meetings with officials.  In terms of trying to tackle this issue, a full-time, cross-functional, interdepartmental project team needs to be established in the office.  The chief medical officer, the assistant secretary and the social welfare appeals office are much too busy to rely on infrequent meetings to address this issue.  A permanent project team must be established to work on this issue if the delays are to be tackled.  This team must prioritise the main source of difficulty, namely, the Department.<\/p><p>  With regard to carer's allowance appeals, the two tests for carer's allowance are, first, that the applicant is providing full-time care and, second, that the person being cared for needs full-time care.  The second test is carried out by medical assessors.  Are the medical assessors qualified doctors?  I have examined a number of the decisions the assessors have made and compared them with the condition of the applicants which I have personally observed.  Some of the decisions that, on medical grounds, the person being cared for does not need full-time care are unbelievable.  They suggest a serious medical assessment is not carried out in many cases and that some form of paper exercise is carried out by a person who is either not qualified to assess medical evidence or simply does not care.  It appears the assessors have a quota to fill and once this has been done, they are not concerned about other applications.  This is a major problem.<\/p><p>  I met someone with cancer who is physically incapable of moving and experiencing associated mental health issues.  The interpretation of a medical assessor in this person's case was that full-time care was not required.  This is not acceptable.  I continually advise persons in such circumstances to reapply for the allowance as it is the only avenue open to them.  However, this approach adds to the workload of the office.

Every nine to 13 weeks we examine the files that are with local offices to identify if there are blockages in a particular area.  We have a system with each of the local offices, whereby they are sent a reminder in the case of certain files.  This system works well because there are so many offices that the numbers in a particular office are relatively small.  This means that when one puts pressure on a local office to provide certain files, it is able do so.  The system in this regard is different from that for medical schemes which are all bunched together.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to disability allowance and invalidity pension appeals in the context of reviews rather than initial applications and raised the issue of priority.  I assume priority is afforded within the medical assessment side in order that if a decision is reviewed, these appeals receive priority.  That is the correct approach.  These schemes do not receive priority in my office.  The only scheme that receives priority is the social welfare allowance scheme.<\/p><p>  Every appeals officer will agree that a higher bar is set in a review case, by which I mean that where someone's payment is being stopped, we will hold the Department strongly to account to ensure it shows there has been some improvement in the condition of the individual concerned.  If we do not see such an improvement, that would be the basis on which we would allow a case.  While we do not prioritise such cases, a higher bar is set for cases in which a person who has had the benefit of a payment on the basis that he or she had a certain condition and subsequently has that payment removed following a review.  To uphold such a decision, there would have to be a clear understanding of the reason the payment was removed, which means one would need to see that there has been an improvement in the condition of the person since the payment was granted.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of projection beyond 2013, as I often state, the appeals process, by definition, is lengthy.<\/p> <p>That is particularly the case where it is an oral hearing.  In the good years the oral hearing would have taken around six months for the total process.  Certainly, we would hope to get back to that.  The reason it takes six months is for good reason as there are steps along the way.  There is the review by the deciding officer, the review by the medical assessor back to us, and now an oral hearing must be scheduled.  We examined this some years ago and decided that adds at least eight weeks to the process.  If an appeals officer decides it must be an oral hearing, he has to wait for the oral hearings for that county, he has to schedule them and there must be a premises.  He must give three weeks notice to the appellant and notice to the witness.  There are a lot of logistics that go into setting up a hearing.  To answer the Deputy's question, we would hope to get back to an average of six months for an oral hearing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000012#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361371200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>What about the summary decisions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000013#N00300","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1361371200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The summary decisions in the past would have taken half the time of an oral hearing because under the old method, every case was vetted.  If it was decided summarily, it went back into a second queue for oral hearing.  What that was doing was picking the low-hanging fruit and getting rid of it quickly.  When summary decisions were made then, the disallowance rate was far higher.  In other words, they were easy cases to decide and they were got rid of more quickly, but it is counter-intuitive.  In other words, one is speeding up the cases for people who are less likely to succeed.<\/p><p>  With the new model, summary decisions will be slower for two reasons.  First, we are not picking them off and fast-tracking them and, second, we are deciding more of them on a positive basis, which means the case must get a deeper analysis.  I think my colleagues, Mr. Brendan O'Leary and Mr. Ken Kelly, would agree when I say that under the old model, if one was vetting a case and something appeared to be more complex, there would always have been the temptation to put it out to oral hearing.  Under the new model, one must take it to oral hearing oneself.  Therefore, one will be very clear before putting it down for oral hearing.  That is one of the other reasons the number of positive summary decisions has risen.<\/p><p>  I have given all that information to explain that the processing times for a summary decision will not go back to what they were, which was half the time of an oral hearing.  They will continue to take less than the time for an oral hearing.

Many lessons are being learned and we feed these back.  Often in my annual report I set out issues that have come before appeals officers of which we think the Department should be aware.  Also we meet with the Department's decisions advice area and tell them about issues that are coming up at appeal and particularly where there are problems and what might solve them.  That is fed into the guidelines given to appeals officers.<\/p><p>  Having said that, this is not an easy issue to solve, in the medical schemes there simply is a difference.  The case is looked at by a deciding officer, mainly based on a medical assessor's opinion.  The medical assessor does not see the person.  That was an agreed approach by experts in the field on the basis that they are not a treating physician, are not diagnosing, and this would be the best way to assess them.  That is the way it is done.  They get the best evidence they can.  One could argue that they are looking at it more clinically.  When it comes to appeal, we are concentrating a little more on the care that is actually given.  In any particular case, the care that is given can fluctuate for any number of reasons, even socioeconomic reasons.  If one looks at a case on paper, a child requires X attention.  That same child in one house might need more than in another, depending on the make-up of the household.  There are any number of reasons.<\/p><p>  People have often asked whether a medical assessor should decide and whether a medical person should appeal.  One can look at this in many ways.  This is the system in place.  I think the medical assessors would argue that the submissions they get cover the socioeconomic aspect of the case, or certainly they look for them to do so.  I think our experience would be that they do not always and often do not.  That is probably the aspect that is fed in at appeal.  I do not think that is necessarily a bad thing.  Certainly, we would feed back our experience of that as it is gleaned at appeal hearings.  The system is not perfect but I do not think there is a perfect system for that kind of situation.<\/p><p>  One of the assistant secretaries in the Department has met many Deputies and Senators twice or three times since the Government was formed, because there would have been many new Members, to explain to them what is available, whom they might contact and what is the best approach.  One of the aspects she would be trying to drive home is the TD helplines.  I do not know what the experience is unless it is bad.  Certainly we have a TD helpline in the office.  It is a dedicated resource.  The number is given to Deputies.  The experience within my office and in the Department is that every assistance possible is provided.  I include in this the sessions provided by the particular assistant secretary who brought along information people to help.  It is an issue about which everybody is conscious and they would be aware that if a Deputy is given good information, he or she can help the client and they are clearer on the issues involved.<\/p><p>  In regard to the number of staff, in 2000 the number of appeals officers during all those years would have ranged between 15 and 18.  I do not know what the number would have been for any particular year.  Therefore, a jump to 40 is significant.<\/p><p>  In regard to doctors' letters versus consultants' letters, the appeals officers would confirm that more weight would be given to a consultant's letter for the simple reason that he or she is the expert in the condition that is presenting whereas a general practitioner treats more generally.  He or she may not be treating in the children's cases.  Often a consultant is treating the child and the general practitioner may know the child.  A consultant's letter is certainly given the weight it deserves in the appeals system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013022000013#N00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1361371200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I had two other questions.

Any revised decision made by a deciding officer must, by definition, be favourable.  They are not allowed revise unfavourably while a decision is under appeal.  With regard to cases that have been withdrawn, the majority of these occur in the case of illness benefit.  These cases are different from others in that they concern the only medical scheme where all claimants are seen by a medical assessor.  Therefore, the person who has been cut off has been seen.  When the person makes an appeal, he or she is seen again by a different medical assessor.  At that point, a letter goes out from my office informing the person he or she has been seen by a second medical assessor, has been found capable of work, asking whether he or she wishes to proceed with the appeal and, if so, on what grounds.  The person is given six weeks to respond.  If there is no response after the six weeks, the cases are withdrawn, but would be opened again if the person comes back.  Generally that does not happen.

The number of appeals the office receives remains disappointingly low.  Given the fact that well over 50% of the appeals Mr. Trethowan considers are upheld and that he recommends that the banks' original decisions in such cases be reversed, is this not conclusive proof that the banks are getting it wrong in many instances and are not really meeting the needs of the economy?

I also acknowledged that the banks are lending to low and medium-risk SMEs.  The latter are getting cash without many problems.  The challenge lies with more distressed SMEs which could still be viable, either now or in the future.  It is a struggle for such businesses to obtain credit.  I am of the view that the banks could do a great deal better in respect of the process by means of which people access credit.  At various meetings I attended during the past six months it emerged that in addition to the credit decision that was made, the experience of those involved was poor.  The report indicates that the process has three stages.  To a large extent, the first of these stages involves order-taking in respect of applications for amounts up to &euro;250,000.  A decision on such applications is taken remotely in Dublin, generally in a credit factory and by means of credit scoring.  Then a letter - taken from a previously prepared menu of such letters - is sent out.  A Red C survey indicated that 78% of people disagree with the reason for rejection listed on their letters.  There is a lot more that could be done in this regard.  Perhaps this is part of the reason people say banks are not lending.

So many more credit decisions which would have similar characteristics to those upon which he is adjudicating are just not arriving on Mr. Trethowan's desk.  My concern is that the work of his office represents only the tip of the iceberg in the context of the problems people are experiencing in obtaining credit.

However, for a sustainable service, we need to see more traction.  Much of the focus has been on the number of people who have gone to the office seeking to make an appeal.  However, the statistics about the small and medium business sector and what must be done before that decision to appeal, are just as startling.  Of the cases of SMEs refused by both pillar banks, only 784 have decided to appeal within the internal bank system.  If only 784 cases have applied for an internal review, the Credit Review Office should be receiving a portion of them.  The most number of cases it could have received over the three-year period was 784.  That is where the barrier exists.  The Credit Review Office can be publicised but if every single case went to appeal to the office, there would only be a doubling of the figures and that is still not acceptable.

I propose that the committee write to the Minister for Finance, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the CEOs and chairpersons of Bank of Ireland and AIB stating that we will be requesting them to give the details of the Credit Review Office in terms of appealing any decision of an internal appeals process that they made themselves that has been found to be unsuccessful and that they would do that from hereon as standard practice.

The work he has done and the overturn rate suggests that at a 50% level of overturn, the banks in these cases are only 50% competent in the first instance.  One could take that understanding. I would go a little further than the Chairman's suggestion and say that the Credit Review Office could be retitled a bank credit operations review and audit committee and that Mr. Trethowan would have unilateral authority to go in and examine new lending, restructuring and re-financing of the SME portfolios in the banks.  The reason that is justified is that we own AIB and we and the Eurosystem fund Bank of Ireland.  Together we guarantee their deposits.  Effectively, we should own more than 50% but by a dint of an unhappy 31 July 2011 experience, we raided the pension reserve fund to prop it up at a ridiculous price.  There we are but we still have a leverage over them.  I suggest that the banks show a 50% competence in dealing with the SME sector.  We know they are under a tsunami of distressed mortgages which indicates they need for more capital than the last PCAR indicated - I know that from recent discussions with CEOs of the banks.  In that case Mr. Trethowan's commando small team could be expanded to give value for money by looking at the wheels and cogs within the bank in their operations for approving new lending, restructuring existing legacy loan portfolios and refinancing the customers who cannot continue with their credit arrangements with banks outside the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013022000010#J02700","speaker":"1027","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1361373300,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I am not sure how to answer that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013022000011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Trethowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1361373300,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Mr. Trethowan is not the first witness to struggle with Deputy Mathews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013022000011#K00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1361373300,"counter":317,"content":"<p>It is a pr&eacute;cis of the overview of where we are at.

I had an experience last year with a company that exhausted itself trying to get a loan from the bank.  I strongly recommended that it go to the Credit Review Office but it would not because it was so exhausted.  This company had an offer of orders worth &euro;7 million.  It needed to borrow &euro;500,000 to buy equipment to service those orders and to hire seven people.  AIB was the bank involved, one of the pillar banks.  I have put this on the record already.  The bank refused once and when the company applied for a review the bank refused again.  It then waived the authority so that I could intervene.  After three or four months I got &euro;350,000.  This was despite my recommending that the company go to the Credit Review Office.  It did not want to start the process again because it was so exhausted and time was of the essence.  It is ridiculous that it should have taken that long but it was worth it for what we saved.<\/p><p>  Mr. Trethowan is aware of the pressure on businesses which are refused funding and that they get exhausted.

They are withdrawing from front-line services, possibly to protect their bottom line.  I am aware that in the UK there have been greater moves from German Landesbanks to come into the commercial lending sector.  Has there been any genuine progress in the Irish banking sector's constructive engagement with the SME sector?  I remain to be convinced that there has.  The level of appeals is low.  We all know from personal experience the anger people feel towards the banks with regard to lending.  Can Mr. Trethowan put his finger on exactly why there is not more of an outcry and more people going to the Credit Review Office?  It strikes me that we have a very loyal attitude towards our banking sector.  We are incredibly loyal and do not tend to change bank or shop around for a bank.  Is there not perhaps a fear of complaining in the SME sector, particularly the smaller SMEs?  The owner-directors of some small SMEs take out their personal loans from the bank where they borrow for their business.  That is quite common.<\/p> <p>There is a fear within the sector of putting one's head above the parapet and bringing a bank to book if a person believes he or she has been treated unfairly.

Shopping around is fine, but for a small or medium enterprise, there are only three banks in town.  As some of the banks are contracting physically by closing branches, etc., there is a feeling of remoteness and isolation that does not help one to have courage in a complaints process.  The record of people in Ireland complaining is well known, but the act of lodging a complaint is another aspect.  In the UK counterpart of the Credit Review Office the first year report indicated that it dealt with approximately 60 million people and received 2,177 applications from nine banks.  It received 40 from Northern Ireland.  People do not seem to go the whole way in complaining.  When the Credit Review Office was set up, we tried to ensure customers and bank staff understood there would be no penalty for going to it.  To date, I have heard nobody indicate he or she had been victimised because of lodging an appeal.  People may be wary of the process or falling out with their bank because there is no alternative within 20 miles if they do fall out with staff in the local branch.  They may be afraid of what might happen if they were to go to the Credit Review Office.

Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett mentioned the big picture - the recovery of demand and the economy.  The banking system is like the plumbing system that makes a house - the economy - warm or go cold.  How can we support demand instead of it going flat, as Deputy Mary Lou McDonald mentioned?<\/p><p>  It has been mentioned that exports have survived, with the sector managing to reduce costs and expand revenues.  By definition, it has boosted profits.  It seems that they are mostly from companies which are supported by foreign direct investment.  The legacy debts on bank balance sheets have suffocated households and small and medium enterprises, which is why there has been a net contraction of &euro;2 billion in the economy.  We must pay attention to what some people outside are saying, that a debt write-down is a must.  The indebtedness of the banks to outside creditors needs to be dealt with as an imperative.  This is called creditor contraction by the likes of Professor Carmen Reinhart, Mr. Martin Wolf and Professor Stiglitz.  It would provide the creditor capital cushion needed to allow the banks to spring clean their balance sheets and get rid of the legacy debts which are weighing down on businesses that deal with the Credit Review Office and that have profitable projects that could be financed with credit.  The old stuff is like a gangrenous limb that is killing the banks; the same applies to households and the problem has not been faced.  Households cannot adjust to a sustainable expenditure pattern which would allow an opinion that it makes sense to invest in the economy, employ, produce and distribute goods and services.  People do not get it.  I can see that Mr. Trethowan is a kindred soul and could add his persuasiveness and authority to get the message across to Departments, Ministers and advisers.

We are joined by two representatives of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Steve Aiken, chief executive, and Ms Emily Glen, research associate.  You are both very welcome.  Mr. Aiken and Ms Glen are here to offer the views of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce on trade promotion.  This meeting is in the context of a series of meetings and other activities that the committee will be undertaking in respect of trade promotion and the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in economic recovery.<\/p><p>  The organisation represents the interests of a broad range of businesses on both sides of the Irish Sea focused on Ireland and Britain and the joint economic space within the islands.  Its broadly-based membership allied with a comprehensive approach seeks to understand the influence of the wider environment in which its members operate.  This puts the organisation in a good position to reflect on how official Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in particular can help to improve our trading relationship with one of our most important export markets.<\/p><p>  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce is a relatively new organisation.  This is rather surprising; I had thought such a chamber of commerce would have been in existence for many years.  It has the ambition of becoming the main focal point for British-Irish business and the associated economic community.<\/p><p>  The inaugural annual conference took place last month and was a successful step in the right direction.  Since the British Irish Chamber of Commerce is a young organisation we hope it can bring some new perspectives on the matters the committee is examining.  The aim of the committee's examination is to prepare and publish a report on the strategy and response of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the economic crisis, to the Department's newly-recognised responsibilities in trade promotion and to the programme for Government in terms of trade promotion and economic recovery, and how well the Department is performing in these respects.<\/p><p>  Before I invite our witnesses to make their presentation I wish to advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular issue and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your remarks.  You are directed that only comments and evidence in respect of the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either Houses of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  Without further ado I call on Steve Aiken to make a presentation on behalf of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce.

In the two years since our formation we have grown from a small 22-member organisation to a broad-based chamber with approximately 200 members, representing companies from one or two-person high technology start-ups up to FTSE 100 quoted corporations.  We continue to expand and we expect to double our membership by 2016.

What damage has been done to Ireland in this regard, or are there opportunities for us to increase our beef exports to the United Kingdom?

They represent important players in the business of trade between our two countries.  Will they elaborate on the announcement by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, that a referendum will be held in Britain on EU membership?  What does the chamber or its constituent bodies hear on the ground in regard to that proposal?  I am glad Mr. Aiken mentioned the work of our embassy, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and others.  The embassy has always been a good resource.  Not only does it deal with political issues, which have taken up much of the agenda between Britain and Ireland over the years, but it has always been used as a resource for trade promotion.<\/p><p>  Over the past number of years we have been very fortunate to have currency stability.  However, the fact that we are in a different currency zone from that of our main trading partner has proved a huge headache at times.  Just a week ago, for example, I mentioned the difficulties we had at the end of 2008, when in the last quarter of that year sterling depreciated by approximately 23%.  This caused particular difficulties for our exporters, but thankfully we have not seen such currency fluctuations recently.  Just as Chambers Ireland did last week, Mr. Aiken mentioned the need for the authorities here - particularly the Department - to develop a website comparable to that of the British Trade and Investment Office to help with trading issues.<\/p><p>  An issue that is topical currently is that of food and food security.  One thing often forgotten about in the public discourse is the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy in providing Europe with food security and sustainability.  Too often the commentary on the CAP is that it is concerned with the transfer of resources to the farming community.  It is much more than that and has ensured stability and food security in Europe.  Regardless of who has been in government here or in Britain over the years, we have had contrary views on the CAP.  Perhaps when Mr. Aiken is talking to decision makers in Britain, he will try to get the message across that an adequately and properly resourced CAP is of the utmost importance to food security and sustainability.  These are important issues throughout the world, and in Europe in particular.  Policy on this should be at the base of the CAP and funding for it should not be reduced.  However, this issue is often not given the attention it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013022000004#C00300","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1361376600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Aiken to respond on those few points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013022000004#C00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1361376600,"counter":442,"content":"<p>First, I will talk about the issue of food security, which is tied in with the CAP, and the importance of Ireland as a market and a producer of food for the United Kingdom.  The statistics, which are interesting, indicate that Tesco alone takes 20% of all Irish agricultural output for its supermarkets and distribution system.  Ireland is essential to the UK's food distribution system for both supermarkets and consumers, and Irish beef and agricultural produce have a high value and standard for British consumers.  It is interesting that most produce in British supermarkets is marked as coming from Britain and Ireland or Britain or Ireland.<\/p><p>  There are opportunities for Ireland.  Not only is there an opportunity now, but Britain will continue to look to Ireland to provide a significant amount of its food as the population there grows and agricultural land comes out of production to cater for these growing populations, as well as for various other reasons.  One factor we see as important is that agri-business is beginning to look to the future to see how various developments in beef, dairy and other areas are likely to progress.<\/p><p>  With regard to the CAP, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce is a chamber of all of these islands and we spend significant amounts of time talking to the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Government.  We understand the issues facing the CAP and we understand that the UK focuses more on what it sees as perceived problems with mountains of various produce.  This is something that is very much in the past and has not been the case for some considerable time.  As with many areas, there is no informed debate in the UK on what the EU has been doing.  We as a chamber are fully involved in talking about what the EU is likely to do for the UK and the importance of that.<\/p><p>  This leads to how we will deal with the EU question in the UK and the EU.  The feeling on the ground in the UK is very mixed.  Within the City of London, the senior financiers we talk to are keen to see the United Kingdom remain within the Single Market.  In the regions, particularly those which have had significant EU funding, people again see it as important that the UK remains within the European Union.  However, it would be wrong to dismiss the fact that in some respects there seems to be a visceral anti-European feeling in some parts of England.  The business community needs to get out and talk about the importance of the European Union, what it means for business, how it is likely to help the United Kingdom and the benefits it has brought.  That debate has not happened yet.  We want to be part of that debate and to help inform the process.<\/p><p>  As a chamber, we are an apolitical organisation and are not involved in any political lobbying in particular areas.

Is there a danger that the debate in Britain could backfire?  The same anti-EU feeling does not seem to exist in Scotland, Wales or the North.  The problem in Britain seems to be caused by the Tories looking over their shoulders.  I wonder whether it would be helpful if the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or Irish politicians got involved in this.  Perhaps that would get their backs up.<\/p><p>  How does the British Irish Chamber of Commerce tie in with the Irish diaspora in Britain?

His first question related to anti-Irish feeling.  We do not perceive that at all.  That is not the feeling we get.  We think the CEO of Iceland was badly briefed.  The main thing that has emerged is that this is a cross-European issue.  It is not a question of bad produce coming from Ireland.  One of the most significant things to happen in the UK was that abattoirs in Yorkshire and Wales were raided, because it indicated that this is a much broader problem, rather than merely a one-off problem.  That is very much the informed debate.<\/p><p>  The question of where our food comes from has arisen as a result of the horsemeat crisis.  Many people in Britain want their food to come from secure sources, such as companies in countries that have known agricultural standards.  Ireland has a good reputation in that context.  We were worried that Ireland's reputation might be damaged, but the reality is that it seems it is being maintained.  That is quite important.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked whether the debate in Britain could backfire.  It could, to a degree.  We need to tell people what is important for us.  We need to talk about the Irish dimension of the debate.  When people have an informed debate about Britain in Europe, we need to make sure they understand the full implications of it.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh, to whom I spoke recently, and Carwyn Jones in Cardiff are very pro-European.  Parts of the UK like Cornwall and Devon have a pro-Europe agenda as well.  The problem is that not enough people are saying what the benefits of the EU are.  We can say how Ireland benefits from the EU.  The UK is our gateway and major link to Europe.  We need to have the UK connected to Europe because we need the opportunities associated with that.  That is a very legitimate position for us to hold.  As a business community, we would say that perspective needs to be represented.<\/p><p>  I wish to respond to the Deputy's question about the Irish diaspora.  We spend a great deal of time meeting the fantastic Irish diaspora, which is one of the really good things we have going for us.  The networking opportunities that exist in this regard are underlined by a figure that has been mentioned, which is that approximately 42,000 people at senior management level in British companies are from Ireland.  We regularly speak to a broad range of people with an Irish background or extraction who work at some of the top companies in the City of London, the midlands and the rest of the UK.  It is interesting that nobody talks about the British diaspora here, which is equally as strong.  The young people who are working in Google and in the IFSC constitute another resource that we need to tap into.  We need to work with those people.  The chamber is putting together a group of people who will look at how we can link with the young executives who are working on either side of the Irish Sea.  We think that will be fairly successful.  The embassy has been fantastic in this respect.  We have had a tremendous opportunity to link into various networks.  As the embassy is relatively small, anything that political parties, sporting groups and arts bodies can do to link with the wider diaspora is important.  That is one of the things to which the chamber refers when it talks about partnerships.  We can help in that process, which will be quite useful as we work towards an island plc or one-stop shop approach.  We would welcome any support in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013022000005#D01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Aiken"},{"type":"speech","time":1361377200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Aiken for his presentation.

I am particularly interested in the financial services sector.  Mr. Aiken said he hopes the Department and Irish business will help to assuage doubts among the British population.

He spoke specifically about this sense of why the City of London wants the UK to remain within the EU.  It is because London is a global gateway.  The reason London is so successful is that it is linked to Europe as well as being linked to North America, China or anywhere else.  If one considers the huge amount of money that is pouring into London at present, particularly from emerging markets such as Russia, India and all parts of Africa, the reason it is coming in is not just that London is a secure financial centre but also that there is a great opportunity for linking into another global market, and that global market is the EU.  That is very much the message we are hearing behind the scenes from the senior banking community and also the insurance community.  Yes, they are unhappy that they are being criticised about bankers' bonuses and potential taxation, but they are getting that as much from the British press as they are getting it from a European perspective.<\/p><p>  One of the things that it is moving on with Basel II or Basel III - I apologise if I have the wrong number of Basels - is the importance the banking community sees in regard to improvements in regulation and how regulation works.  We are aware of the conversations we see between Dublin and London and we see a lot of synergy between the two.  Many of our members are looking to see how we can swap functions and make functions work, and how that can continue to grow.  We believe that is very significant.  We see that the City of London in particular will be a continual driver to push Britain towards remaining within the EU.  As the Minister, Mr. Vince Cable, MP, said at our conference, he considered it to be very unlikely that Britain would exit from the EU.  That was one thing, but the Lord Mayor of London, Mr. Boris Johnson, said exactly the same thing at Davos.  There are two key points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013022000006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Aiken"},{"type":"speech","time":1361377800,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Aiken for his complimentary words about the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The trade link is only two years old and I am interested in Mr. Aiken's comments on how he feels this is developing.  He made a comparison between the structures in England and those elsewhere, and argued not just for a one-stop shop but also for an effective restructuring of Irish embassies so that Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Bord Bia might be more integrated into the embassy structure.  He then went on to warn that we should not undermine the established and successful systems we have acquired down through the years.  He might further elaborate on that.  All of us around this table want more embassies opened with increased resources and we want the BRIC countries to be targeted and so on.  However, the economic crisis is not permitting us to do that.<\/p><p>  I and most members would concur with Mr. Aiken's views, which are strongly stated, that business abhors lack of certainty.  Mr. Cameron suggested there would be a plebiscite.  We are well used to plebiscites and not only have we have proven to Europe and the world that we are the poster boy of Europe but we have proven time and again with our referendums that we are very much integrated into and supportive of Europe.  This was seen most recently in regard to the fiscal treaty, for which we gave 60% support.  We are well used to these things.  Given that we are speaking with the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, and having recently visited Northern Ireland, I think it disgusting that the Border that exists seems to be manned by terrorists and criminal elements, and there is abuse of legal trade and businesses, with the laundering of fuel, the smuggling of cigarettes and the culture of the Border country.  Does the British Irish Chamber of Commerce have much of a relationship with InterTradeIreland?  In talking about the bigger Ireland-England-Scotland-Wales relationship, what about our miserable Border that is so fluid and is creating havoc?<\/p><p>  I thank the witnesses for attending.  We are talking about huge sums of money here - &euro;38 billion, &euro;54 billion and then &euro;14 billion in exports.  Wearing our foreign affairs hat, we had the British Ambassador before us recently.  Mr. Aiken spoke about the potential for UK and Irish trade missions in particular areas.  We thought it interesting the British ambassador should mention his belief that there could be greater co-operation between Irish construction companies and the skills base that exists, given the downturn, and the British construction industry in targeting Arab or oil-wealthy cities which have huge capital infrastructure programmes.

The British Prime Minister was in India yesterday, where he spoke about the development of the Mumbai-Bangalore corridor.  This is one of, I think, 100 potential strategic investment opportunities UKTI has been talking about, but British business realises it cannot do it on its own.  How many of those present are aware that the top of the Shard building, the tallest building in London, was built by an Irish company?  How many people are aware, when they look around Crossrail, which is a huge construction site deep in the bowels of London, that the number of Irish engineers and contractors working on that is significant?  How many people realise that those responsible for HS2, the high-speed rail link that will eventually go to Birmingham and beyond, are actively looking for Irish construction companies to go into partnership because they have the skill sets to make that work?  These British companies are specifically looking for Irish companies because they have worked with British companies before, they understand how the process works, they have a similar mindset and they have a project development set of skills that are capable of delivering.  Speaking from my own experience, it came as a bit of a shock to me to discover that UK plc managed to finish the London Olympics on time, on cost and on budget.  However, it did that by being able to reach out to an international network, and a very important part of that international network comes from Ireland.  That is likely to continue to grow.<\/p><p>  I spend a lot of time on early morning flights into London and meet people around London at the Institute of Directors of the Confederation of British Industry or at various meetings, and I know the number of Irish construction companies, specialist engineers and engineering teams talking and working with British companies is very impressive.  That is something that is likely to continue to grow.  They have a success story and they are going to make it happen.  It is an area we, as a chamber, are fairly light on at the moment but we will be doing a lot of work on developing the construction sector over the next year.<\/p><p>  On the question about Northern Ireland, as members can probably work out from my accent, I am from that neck of the woods.  In particular, we want to see an improvement in relationships across the island.  We are an all-islands organisation.  We are helping to encourage Northern Ireland to institute a corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Why?  It is because we want Northern Ireland to move from its current economic model to a much more entrepreneurial and innovative model.  We welcome organisations such as InterTradeIreland and are trying to improve that aspect.  We want to be part of the bandwagon that is looking at this joint business space and how we can improve it.  We are looking at all-islands markets and these are the kind of things we need to make it work.<\/p><p>  I am quite lucky because I am on this side of the table and can say things like \"one-stop shop\" and then say something quite contradictory.  It is as if we were going to consider using a different model.

Scottish independence is coming down the line and is part of the issue.  I know the British Irish Chamber of Commerce does not have an active view on politics but North Sea oil, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the question of who owns that particular basket case when the poll is held, and Scotland's relationship with the EU are all issues.  We know that what the delegation is talking about in terms of UKTI is the correct model.  Ireland opened a new consulate in Atlanta, which the Chairman and I visited.  It is a small version of what we are talking about, with the trade element and the consulate in the one building.  We do that in New York as well, and it works.  Bord Bia and the like are world-class organisations but they tend to be all over the place.  When one has cross-sectoral trade or companies, they do not know to whom they are supposed to go.  Do they go to Bord Bia or the IDA?  That becomes a problem.<\/p><p>  I know the British Irish Chamber of Commerce does not get involved on a political level, but the delegation answered the question on the EU referendum.

Although they are important, we must balance them with human rights, because it is my interest, I suppose.  There is an interplay which is sometimes very positive but sometimes very negative.  For example, I gather the Government has again dismissed the international report on extraordinary rendition as not having any relevance for Ireland.  This report clearly implicates Ireland.  I remember statements being made that this would affect trade.  I did not believe it at the time but I am putting that in context principally for the benefit of fellow members of the committee so that we can continue to have some degree of focus on human rights.  This is not in any sense to minimise the delegation's contribution, which is extremely valuable, particularly in this economic situation.<\/p><p>  I wish to express my admiration for the British Irish Chamber of Commerce because to grow tenfold in two years is quite extraordinary.

Will Mr. Aiken elaborate further on this aspect?  Is it already happening?  We are engaged in a debate on how to pool knowledge and information in the third level sector and a great deal is taking place in that regard.  This is particularly important in the context of the European Union's overall budget and also the budget of the Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  I acknowledge the conversation which took place earlier on the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union.

It is great that they have given such forthright answers.<\/p><p>  The question I wish to pose relates to the banking industry.  As our guests will be aware, economic activity in Ireland has been greatly affected in recent times as a result of austerity and on foot of the lack of lending to SMEs.  Some 99% of businesses in Ireland are SMEs.  The Government has taken a huge step towards addressing the lack of lending to which I refer by earmarking &euro;3.6 billion to be lent to the SME sector by Bank of Ireland and AIB, two of the banks we bailed out.  There have been complaints to the effect that this money has only been used to restructure existing loans or turn overdrafts into term loans.  The latter has given rise to major difficulties.  In recent times the UK Government, through the Treasury, granted a licence to Metro Bank and I understand a considerable amount of this institution's lending is targeted at the SME sector.  Are our guests of the opinion that Ireland could benefit from a similar arrangement?  If any of their members has acquired loans from this bank, perhaps they might be in a position to impart some information on their experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013022000008#G00300","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1361379000,"counter":478,"content":"<p>To deal with Senator Deirdre Clune's point, this conversation started in the agribusiness sector in the context of how the United Kingdom and Ireland might tap into existing and future EU funding.  The idea was that there would be a link between food and agribusiness in academia, agribusiness and the Government and that these entities would work in a tripartite fashion in order to try to progress matters.  A number of questions on this matter emerged at our conference.  For example, if this is going to work in agribusiness, could it not work in other sectors also?  Why can we not tap into likely centres of technology, academia and business in order to make this work and grow?  We understand a great deal of work is being done in making the case for an agribusiness cluster or triangle.<\/p><p>  We are also advocating that particular consideration be given to the area of renewable energy because it is going to be of significance.  As we move towards opening up the markets to renewable energy resources, this will provide an opportunity to take action on the supply side aspect on the island of Ireland.  It will also create opportunities for industrial development.  We must consider how we can take some of the cutting-edge renewable energy technologies being developed in academia, transform them into business opportunities and then make the two work together as a partnership.  In the all-island perspective, that would be another good avenue to pursue.<\/p><p>  Other questions have also arisen.  Ours is a relatively small organisation, but it has very vibrant and innovative members who are asking why research cannot be carried out in the cultural, arts, sport, new media and other areas.  This is another sector of growth to which we are going to continue to give consideration, as it is very important to do so.  It is also important that Britain and Ireland have a success story in order that we can go to the European Union and say, \"This is an area in respect of which we could consider providing funding in order to allow it to develop.\"  That is what we are trying to do.<\/p><p>  Senator Lorraine Higgins referred to banking.  Some 5,100 companies are members of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce and they range from large operations all the way down to one or two-people start-ups.  The reality is that, to some degree, they have all had issues with obtaining funding from the banks, innovative funding and how this issue is dealt with.  We have not really seen much evidence of what Metro Bank is doing.  We have attended the briefings, one of which was addressed by Vince Cable.  We have listened to what has been said and know what the idea is behind what the bank is trying to do.  However, we have not yet seen any evidence on the ground, but it is early days in this regard.  We need to keep a watching brief during the next six to nine months in order that we might see what is going to happen.  What is happening here ties in with the fact that RBS and Lloyds are very much Government owned.  As a result, there is a wider question with regard to how these funds are released and how what is proposed is going to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013022000008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Aiken"},{"type":"speech","time":1361379000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Is there a difficulty in that we are continuing to adhere to the traditional way of assessing applications for credit, that is, in the context of bricks and mortar and other forms of security, as opposed to considering the business plans being put forward by companies which are trying to access loans?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013022000008#G00500","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1361379000,"counter":480,"content":"<p>It is difficult because there are lots of banks that are members of our organisation.

We probably need a new model and to understand how this can be capitalised.  Our members - I refer to everyone from senior banking officials to those involved in small start-up companies - are considering how these things can work.

The concept of an all-island market is a good one and could only be beneficial from the point of view of both the North and the South.

It is interesting because I do not think anyone - particularly in the business community - really thinks that Scotland will vote to leave the UK.  What we think will happen in the longer term is that Scotland will have more devolution, that it will look for much more powers and greater repatriation of powers.  That has an interesting dynamic.  If Northern Ireland had a corporation tax at 12.5% - which we would like to see - Scotland could set its own corporation tax rate, as could Wales.  It means that across these islands we would potentially have a future menu for people who wished to invest and grow high foreign direct investment in these islands.  That is one aspect.  On the other hand, we talk about these islands becoming much more interdependent, more integrated and more interconnected.  The energy sector is moving not so much to an all-island energy market but to an all-islands energy market.  We need to do that because of the benefits of scale, because of geography, and, frankly, because of how the wind blows.  Those are the kind of things that we need to consider and to develop.<\/p><p>  I apologise for the fact that I am answering questions together.  We are also looking towards a much closer integration of our retail markets, our food distribution markets.  We see ourselves moving towards a much greater reliance on a common food distribution system.  We also consider that as we move we will be looking towards a much more integrated communications market.  There are already moves in those areas.  In one sphere we are moving towards a more deregulated set of islands and in another sphere we are moving closer.  How does this fit within the view of the UK and the EU?  We know from experiences of referenda that they do not always give us the answer we want.  However, in the UK this will be a one-off referendum.  I refer to what Vince Cable and the Prime Minister have said.  I consider the UK is most likely to remain within the Single European Market.  No matter what happens, I think there will be a degree of negotiation.  I consider that the UK will regard remaining in the EU as being to its advantage and in its interest.  However, we need to consider the \"what if?\" aspect.  I ask the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs to be part of the debate with the UK.  We need to know what it will mean to us if the UK is not part of the EU.  It is also useful for the UK to understand what it would mean to be outside the closer European body.  The debate has already studied Switzerland and Norway.  Norway is a classic example.  It is the only country in Europe which seems to follow all the EU directives; it is the only country without a say in the EU directives.  I hope I have clarified our views.  We will devote a lot of time to considering and debating this matter over the next five years.  The question of certainty is the key.  Companies making long-term investment decisions are looking and thinking about where they will invest.  That may potentially be very good news for Ireland and we need to be aware of that.  Companies that may be looking at the UK may consider Ireland to be a better bet.  If that comes to pass, we need to ensure that Ireland is in the best possible place to take advantage.  Infrastructure and education are key areas which business and industry will be looking for.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013022000009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Aiken"},{"type":"speech","time":1361379600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>We will be most anxious that the UK stays within the European Union, for many reasons.

The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, represents 34 radio stations of all natures throughout the country.  The stations broadcast to a listenership of 2.5 million people daily.  We are very aware of the importance of the radio sector to Irish life.  We have concerns about fairness in the sector and its regulation and funding.  We want to see changes made in the public interest.  I thank the members for having us today.<\/p><p>  Let me begin by discussing radio in general.  Radio was first introduced in Ireland in the mid-1920s with the launch of 2RN by President Douglas Hyde.  At that stage, Ireland was a different country, and the thinking and model were different.  The economy was very different.  Ireland is a different place but, in many ways, the position of the State broadcaster remains the same in terms of its having a monopoly in many areas.<\/p><p>  Since the late 1980s, with the 1988 Act, independent radio came into being.  Many stations have been in existence for 24 years.  Some, such as mine, are of more recent vintage.  KCLR, which I operate, is in operation for just nine years.  There are 34 different radio stations around the country.  It is a very broad church, ranging from youth stations and full service stations to national stations.  Many members will be familiar with these stations and will be regular contributors to them.  On the economic side, it should be remembered that our radio stations are significant employers.  We employ approximately 1,500 people in the sector and operate in every county.<\/p><p>  People often ask about listenership in general and how it is measured.  An independent survey, the JNLR, is undertaken in co-operation with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the independent stations, RTE and the advertising authority.  The research shows that 2.5 million listeners tune in to independent radio every day.  One can compare this with RTE radio, which includes Radio 1, 2fm, Lyric FM and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  Some 1.2 million people tune in to these every day.  The survey shows that seven of every ten minutes spent listening to radio in Ireland are spent listening to our members, the 34 independent stations.  The document we have submitted shows a breakdown by franchise area of the market shares of our members <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> RTE.  In every franchise area in the country, the combined independent market share far outstrips the combined market share of RTE.<\/p><p>  People wonder why independent radio is so successful.  In many ways, we are the most successful independent sector in Europe.  We believe this is because of our keen focus and awareness of what our audience wants.  It is also because of the very high priority accorded to public service broadcasting by our members.  We are pleased that the public service role of independent stations has been widely acknowledged by successive Ministers, including the current one.<\/p><p>  We provide a wide range of coverage that is not available anywhere else.  This includes the coverage of local elections, local GAA matches and specialist programmes.  My station has an education programme.  This, to the best of my knowledge, is not done by the national broadcaster.  We have business and farm programmes and we are out and about at events.  I refer to coverage and programming that would not be and is not provided by anybody else.<\/p><p>  We are concerned about the future.  I do not intend to go into considerable detail on the overall media landscape, nor do I need to elaborate on the difficulties that the newspaper industry is experiencing.  Owing to the stress the newspaper industry is experiencing, many people are finding that the amount and extent of local coverage is decreasing in many areas.<\/p><p>  In television, for example, the market is fragmenting considerably.  While RTE enjoys a considerable share of the Irish television market, a significant amount of its coverage is actually foreign programming.  Television is very challenging and it is difficult for RTE to compete with the myriad of foreign channels.  We recognise that and believe RTE must be supported to survive in that environment.  The Internet enjoys free access but pay walls will become an increasing feature of it as content migrates online and people seek to generate revenue.<\/p><p>  Radio maintains its considerable popularity in the Irish market.  Approximately 87% of people tune in to radio at some stage every day.  In Ireland, radio provides and broadcasts approximately 100% Irish content.<\/p><p>  The success of radio is because of the unique relationship that has existed.  It is on many different platforms and universally accessible.  However, nothing can be taken for granted.  The radio sector needs to be nourished and encouraged so it can continue to provide the coverage it provides at present.  The local radio network, in particular, and independent radio, in general, make a great contribution to the cultural identity of the country and the individual identities of the communities they serve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013022000003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Purcell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361353200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Purcell for that concise overview, which was very well put together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013022000004#E00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1361353200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation and thank it for the presentation.  There is not a community in the country that is not extremely well served by the independent broadcasters or the local radio stations.  Some excellent work is being done across the spectrum, from the social and economic side to the current affairs side.  It has targeted a market, and if we were to analyse the listenership we would find such programming reflects the lives and concerns of people in urban and rural communities and the information they look for.  Some 1,500 people are employed by the network and many of the local radio stations, to which I have spoken, are finding it extremely difficult to provide what is needed by the public and to generate revenue.  The first thing people in that sector will ask is where the licence fee is going and how will the balance be struck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013022000004#E00300","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1361353800,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Before I pass over to my colleagues, in general it is recognised by Ministers that we provide a huge amount of public service broadcasting.

I hand over to my colleagues to elaborate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013022000005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Purcell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1361353800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The point we should like to emphasis, and which Mr. Purcell has referred to, is that we do not see this as being an either-or situation.  We believe that RTE needs to be properly funded.  We believe there is a major opportunity in the forthcoming legislation, which has been promised in the programme for Government, to introduce a household broadcasting charge, which we support, because of the evolution of the way people are viewing content.  They are viewing it less on televisions and more on laptops and hand-held devices and so on.  In the context of introducing the new charge, it is estimated that there will be an uplift in collection of about &euro;30 million from lower collection costs and from less evasion.  Rather than simply allowing that to disappear into the maw in RTE, there is an opportunity to use that to create a separate fund to support public service broadcasting and independent stations.  What we would like the committee to do is to use its good offices to try to persuade the Government to move the legislation forward.  We have had a positive interaction with the Minister who recognises there is probably no legal impediment to setting up such a fund.  I think we are at the stage where he recognises there is an issue of fairness that could well be addressed in the context of setting up a fund such as that.  We are making progress.  If can move that on and get the legislation on the table that would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013022000005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1361353800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I welcome the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland delegation.  Many of us have met them in recent years and realise the need for change, as in many other areas, and RTE probably recognises the need for change also.  We all acknowledge that the face of Ireland has changed in the past 25 years in the area of broadcasting, particularly in local radio stations.  Coming from Mayo, Midwest Radio is one of the top three local radio stations for the past 25 years.  It is impossible to imagine an Ireland without local radio.  It is about supporting that service and removing the obstacles that are impeding it, without impacting on the national broadcaster and the need to co-exist.  I note the word \"positivity\" is used on three or four occasions in regard to what the organisation does.  In other words, it reflects the good things that are happening in local areas whereas sometimes there is a suggestion, with which we would all agree, that at times if one listens to the national broadcaster throughout a full day one would almost be depressed because of the moaning and groaning.  Sometimes coverage is given to extreme and negative issues.  That is an area that RTE needs to address and we have told it that on a number of occasions.  However, it must be recognised that RTE is going through a difficult phase at present.<\/p><p>  The witnesses said they do not wish to impact on the national broadcaster and that there is a need for a publicly funded RTE as well as a publicly funded independent radio.  Are they suggesting in regard to the new broadcasting charge that there is a very large broadcasting charge that can fund both?  I would appreciate their comments on that issue.  I acknowledge the huge salaries paid to a small percentage of broadcasters in RTE but that is an issue that RTE has to address.  It was stated that revenues have dropped by 40%.  One of the positive elements of local radio is that it employs 1,500 people.  Has that impacted on employment?  How many have had to be let go as a result of that reduction in revenue?  Can a figure be put on it?  While we criticise the huge salaries in RTE is there an issue of low wages in local radio stations for some of the 1,500?  Is that an issue that needs to be addressed from within the local radio stations?  I was aghast at the figures mentioned for Sound  and Vision where I understand 80% goes back to RTE.

What 1988 saw was the provision of a legal basis and regulation for local radio and independent broadcasting.  There is no doubt that over the next decades, broadcasting and the media generally will change completely.

There is a public service element in RTE's activities and in the activities of independent broadcasters.  We need to examine that in the context of the available funds.

I agree with the Deputy that it is necessary in certain circumstances for RTE to chase ratings.  The very successful series \"Love\/Hate\" was huge and RTE got great ratings from it.  RTE looks for ratings also through broadcasting and funding Champions League soccer, \"Grey's Anatomy\" and a lot of other imported content.  Our point is that it might perhaps serve the public interest in a television market that is rapidly fragmenting if RTE were to concentrate on content from and about Ireland.  There are many people in RTE who would agree with that view.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Colreavy that it is impractical in a country the size of Ireland for RTE not to be dual-funded.  While we recognise that it needs commercial revenue, RTE is operating with a massive competitive advantage, which should be constrained in some way.  The first constraint should be that no new service or activity should be permitted for RTE unless it passes a test showing that it is in the public interest and does not unfairly compete with broadcasters already providing that service in the market.  We need a debate on what we want our national broadcaster to do in the public interest.  Perhaps programmes such as \"Wagons' Den\" are not a priority, whereas good drama and programmes such as \"Prime Time\" are.  There are many things RTE does not do, such as educational programming, that it should be doing and would do if it had a different focus.

Many of the people in the national media who think they have a monopoly on everything seem to miss that point.  They get their stories from the ground up.  That is why I have so much respect for the work of our local radio stations in particular, because of the immense service they give in rural areas placing value and importance on every section of the programming, from 6 a.m. to 12 midnight.  There are people who plan their day around their local radio station.  That is not an exaggeration.  There are people who eat their meals to suit what is happening on their local radio station.  That is a fact but many of the arrogant bully-boys in the national media who think they run this country - I have nothing against a lot of them - fail to see that.  That is why it is so important.

I apologise for just arriving but if the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland had some insight on bi-location, it might help a few of us.  I was pleased to receive a copy of the presentation.  It might be helpful to get an overview of the radio stations represented, which are national, regional and local.  Will the witnesses indicate who owns the stations?  In many cases, the stations may not be independent, as UTV owns certain stations.  Some background on the broadcasting landscape in Ireland for local stations might be helpful.<\/p><p>  I apologise if the question has already been asked but the easiest definition of public service broadcasting might be anything that does not make money.  Some radio stations perform some elements of public broadcasting extremely well; for example, many rural stations broadcast agricultural programmes.  We travel around the country, tuning into different local radio stations, and one can nearly replicate different programmes.  It is the same news and information but a different presenter on a different station.  Is there a way of networking or franchising in order to consolidate the work?  I am not just talking about agricultural programmes but also classical music, motorsport or niche interests that people do not hear of from a national broadcaster.  It can be difficult to get it from local and regional stations.  If that could be done, an element of the broadcasting charge could be set aside.<\/p><p>  I do not want to go around the country listening to obituaries or easy listening for 23 hours of the 24 hours in a day.  Local independent and regional stations must show that they are prepared to up their game.  The witnesses have spoken about the challenges faced by local radio stations.  I have mentioned obituaries and I will not focus on them but many people buy the local paper and go immediately to the back pages.  People on the local radio station would spend 20 minutes reading those out.  It is a matter for the station as to whether it is a public service.  The same logic applies to reading out mart prices that are already available in the print media.  The fundamental point is the competition is not just between the radio station and the broadcaster, as there is also competition between the print media and the local radio station.  That does not help either party, and if a broadcasting charge is to go to local stations, they should up their game a bit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013022000008#J00400","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1361355600,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I wish to be excused but I thank the witnesses for coming in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013022000008#J00500","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1361355600,"counter":581,"content":"<p>There is a range of questions and I will endeavour to address them.

There have been job losses and the level of multitasking in a station like KCLR is phenomenal.

In response to the economic downturn in 2008, our sector became highly efficient.  We hollowed out anything that did not have to do with on-air activities.  We protected our on-air activities and, by and large, kept the same number of news reporters, presenters and producers.  We hollowed out management, support staff and so on and reduced part-timers, unfortunately, to a great degree.  What we have now are stations which are highly efficient.<\/p><p>  In my station, we have 20 full-time staff who work a 24-7 roster.  We have few enough part-timers contributing to our schedule because our full-timers now work weekends and nights.  Generally speaking, we do not have a layer of management.  I am the manager in my station.  Two weeks ago I was up on top of a mountain trying to fix a transmitter with an engineer on the end of the phone telling me what to do.  Everybody does everything in the station.  It is quite a unique business in that regard because of the commitment of our staff to the business.  They have done this in an uncomplaining way where we have had to make significant cuts and changes to the way people work.  There are some groups with two or three radio stations which have made efficiencies too.  Most of our businesses are stand-alone businesses which require a chief executive and the various different supports, however.<\/p><p>  There is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to carry out a review of the funding of public and independent broadcasters.  We believe it is probably not necessary to do that because there is clarity on where the funding is.  Both sectors are under pressure but one sector, the independent broadcaster, is totally underfunded.  The other commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a household broadcasting charge should be brought forward and prioritised.  The legislation required to do that should revisit the 2009 Broadcasting Act and examine to limit the commercial mandate of RTE, as well as putting a constraint on RTE opening up new services.  We have a significant concern that RTE, because of its mandate to seek out every little scrap of commercial revenue, is already threading in areas where we are operating and will do more so over the next few years.  That is a significant concern to us.  In the context of that legislation, we would like an independent broadcasting fund.<\/p><p>  I know it is not in the committee's power to get the legislation in place but it has a powerful voice.  We believe the Minister is for moving.  We have had positive interaction with him and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013022000009#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1361356200,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for what has been an informative, interesting and well worthwhile learning exercise.
