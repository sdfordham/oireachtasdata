On 19 July, under S.I. No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act as necessary to get the new Regulatory Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year nominations for membership of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority were duly obtained from the ten prescribed nominating bodies set out for that purpose in the 2015 Act.  Following the relevant procedures, resolutions approving their appointment as members were passed by the Seanad on 19 July 2016 and by the D&aacute;il on 21 July 2016, such resolutions being required under section 9 (2)(a) of the Act.  Following this, the Government, at its meeting of 27 September 2016, duly appointed ten members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  These were: Don Thornhill; Angela Black; Deirdre McHugh; Gerry Whyte; Stephen Fitzpatrick; Dermott Jewell; David Barniville; Joan Crawford; Geraldine Clarke; and James MacGuill.  At the same time, as provided under the 2015 Act, the Government agreed the appointment of Dr. Don Thornhill, being an approved lay member, as Chairperson of the new Regulatory Authority.  Under the 2015 Act, the Authority has a total of eleven members including a lay majority and lay Chair.<\/p>  <p>  It was also agreed at that time, following the relevant procedures of the 2015 Act, that Eileen Barrington SC be put forward as an alternative nominee of the King&rsquo;s Inns for membership of the new Authority.  This arose from the fact that their initial nominee, who had also been approved in July, was no longer available.  The relevant resolutions of both Houses approving the appointment of Eileen Barrington SC were passed on 6 October 2016.  Her appointment will, therefore, complete the eleven-person membership of the new Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  Initial briefings and secretarial support are being provided at official level for Dr. Don Thornhill as Chairperson of the new Authority and he is engaged in ongoing consultations with his incoming colleagues on the Authority.  Initial office accommodation for the Authority has been identified that will accommodate a small start-up team of three or four staff.  This is intended to provide a bridge-head from which a permanent premises and additional working capacity can be secured.  The first formal meeting of the Authority will take place on 26 October.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the Legal Services Regulation Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers.  Following on from the setting of establishment day, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year - with some carry-over anticipated into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings such as the start-up of the Authority&rsquo;s critical public complaints function.  The current phase will, therefore, include the phased commencement of Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.<\/p>  <p>  Following this, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The managed commencement of these functions is considered essential in order to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300043#WRA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":7,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300043#WRA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":8,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[30017\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300043#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the outstanding EU directives that her Department or agencies under its remit are responsible for implementing, in tabular form; if the implementation of any of them require specific legislative change; and the details of same.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":9,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Directive (full title and number)<\/th><th>Subject matter<\/th><th>Implementation<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Directive 2014\/42\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council <\/td><td>The freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime in the European Union<\/td><td>The requirements of this Directive are largely already met in Irish law by the Criminal Justice Act 1994.

Both the Irish and British Governments have made it clear that it is their wish to maintain the CTA arrangements after the UK leaves the European Union.  Both Governments have also expressed their commitment to ensuring there is no return to a so-called 'hard border' between both parts of the Island. <\/p>  <p>  There have been a number of misleading media reports on these matters in recent days.  It has always been the case that Ireland and the United Kingdom cooperate closely on jointly securing the external border of the CTA and we will continue to cooperate, and to strengthen that cooperation, in the future.  In that regard a central feature of the operation of the CTA has been that each State enforces the other's conditions of landing for non-EEA nationals, thus protecting each other's borders.  In addition, cooperation extends across a number of other areas including the sharing of information and at an operational level on enforcement.  For example, on the information  front, earlier this year new arrangements to allow for the sharing of Advanced Passenger Information between Ireland and the UK in order to further enhance the integrity of the Common Travel Area were introduced.  The development of the British-Irish Visa System was facilitated by this arrangement and indeed could not have happened without the electronic sharing of information such as biometrics.  <\/p>  <p>  The impact of 'Brexit' on the right to free movement of EEA citizens will ultimately be a matter that will feature within the negotiation process that will take place following the UK's formal notification to the European Council that it intends to leave, and it is therefore not possible at this juncture to say what arrangements will apply between the UK and EU in the future in respect of such persons.  What I can make clear is that, while we will continue to maintain and enhance cooperation with the UK in relation to general immigration and border enforcement, Ireland of course remains a committed member of the European Union and will continue to uphold the right of free movement for all EU citizens after the UK leaves the Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300043#WRA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300043#WRA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[30146\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300043#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding Garda whistleblowers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1275","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p>On 3 October, 2016 I received two protected disclosures under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.

The Reserve perform policing  duties as determined by the Garda Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;.  Their role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas.  Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;.  In recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected<\/p><p>As I announced earlier this week the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Funding has been provided for the recruitment in 2017 of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300 in 2017.<\/p><p>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of the commitment to double the Reserve to 2,000 and what steps might be taken to ensure that the expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office.  I understand that that Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 789 members to 2,000.  As part of the planning process, I understand that the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered.<\/p><p>Recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute;  to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involves a competitive process undertaken by PAS on behalf of the Commissioner and, for successful candidates, further fitness, medical and vetting tests undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 2013.  Under these regulations the age ceiling at which any candidate may apply to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a full time member is set at not more than 35 years and there are currently no plans to change this regulation.  <font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/p><p>The Regulations provide that special recognition may be given to Reserve members in the context of the selection process as they have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have gained experience in operational policing.  The recruitment campaign for 2016 included for the first time a special stream for eligible members of the Reserve.  This special steam was continued in the most recent campaign announced on 8 September 2016.  To be eligible for the special Reserve stream a reserve member is required to have completed their probation, performed their role to a satisfactory standard, and served a minimum of 150 hours per year for two of the previous four years.  The Reserve stream is essentially a fast-track stream in that it allows the eligible reserves to skip stage 1 (unsupervised on-line tests) of the competitive assessment process and move straight to stage 2 which consists of supervised assessment tests taken in an assessment centre.  Those who meet the required standard are then called to a competency based interview.  Successful candidates are then fast tracked through the medical, fitness and vetting assessments undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first successful candidates to enter the Garda College from the 2016 recruitment campaign last June were all from the Reserve stream.<\/p><p>As I have already stated the Reserves consists of voluntary unpaid members.  Reserve members who work a minimum of 208 hours in a 12 month period receive a non-taxable allowance of &euro;1,000 per annum as a contribution towards their expenses.  They are also reimbursed for expenses incurred while attending court in respect of their service as a Reserve member.  <b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>The  Commissioner, with the aim of recognising the efforts of the Reserves and increasing their visibility within the organisation, is introducing an annual event to recognise them.

The Working Group has met with representatives from the Law Society, AA Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association, the Irish Car Rental Council, the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Consumers Association of Ireland.

In that context, my Department has made a commitment to AHBs and local authorities that CALF assessments would be completed, and determinations made, within 6 weeks of receipt.  In relation to the 7 proposals on hand, my Department is working very closely with all stakeholders including the AHBs, Louth County Council and the Housing Agency to ensure prompt consideration of the applications.  5 of the proposals are within the 6 week time-frame and the remaining 2 are with the local authority for additional consideration.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has no SHIP projects currently awaiting approval from Louth County Council. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300050#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Maintenance","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300050#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[30170\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300050#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the position in regard to the restoration, refurbishment and replacement of houses at St. Patrick's Park, Rathangan, County Kildare, in respect of which funding and approval may be required from his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>My Department approved funding of &euro;7.58 million in January 2016 for a Remedial Works Scheme at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Park, Rathangan, County Kildare, with 10% of the cost to be provided from the local authority&rsquo;s own resources.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with Kildare County Council on various aspects of the scheme which is being delivered in 3 phases.

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.<\/p>  <p>  Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of organic fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and groundwaters.  In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations include provisions regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited.  In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or heavy rain is forecast.   <\/p>  <p>  Specified closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers, including slurry, are a key aspect of the Nitrates Regulations.  They are a requirement of the Nitrates Directive and are mandatory in every Member State.  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was being introduced.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice.  The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s on-going Agricultural Catchments Programme has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the prohibited spreading periods in reducing nutrient losses to waters.<\/p>  <p>  The Nitrates Action Programme will be reviewed again in 2017 and my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is now commencing the review process prior to formal engagement with the European Commission.  The ultimate aim of the review process is to gain approval for a 4th Nitrates Action Programme for Ireland by the end of 2017, including the renewal of Ireland&rsquo;s derogation.  An important aspect of the review process will be a public consultation exercise in early 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland faces considerable challenges in meeting the requirements of the Water Framework Directive to bring all waters back to good status at least.  Taking those challenges and the evidence in support of the benefit of closed periods into consideration I have no plans at present to extend the spreading periods for organic fertilisers in 2016 but am monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300050#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Policy","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300050#WRH01800"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[30181\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101300050#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the measures he is taking to address the disparity where domestic violence occurs in a local authority tenancy and both adults are named on the tenancy meaning that one cannot access housing supports needed on exiting a refuge or leaving a violent relationship; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that such cases exist; the direction he is providing to local authorities to ensure that persons escaping violent relationships are given the appropriate housing supports despite already being named on a tenancy and while they are named on a tenancy pending a family court hearing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the development and provision of services to support victims of domestic abuse rests with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the delivery of such services is managed through the Child and Family Agency, Tusla.<\/p><p>A housing authority may provide short-term emergency housing to persons who are forced to leave their homes because of domestic violence, without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support or include them on the authority&rsquo;s housing waiting list.

The review was undertaken by Dr Niall Herity, a highly respected, Belfast based NHS cardiologist.  It is a comprehensive report which reflects the fact that Dr Herity consulted widely and met with all of the key stakeholders including the management and staff of both UHW and Cork University Hospital.<\/p>  <p>   Dr Herity has made clear recommendations that a second cardiac cath lab at UHW is not justified and I accept this.  However, he also recommends investing in UHW to enhance the existing cardiology services including increasing the number of weekly sessions currently provided, in order to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients.  He also recommends that new specialist equipment be provided to improve contingency for radiological equipment failure during a procedure.  I am happy to provide the additional resources necessary to implement these recommendations.  This investment will be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan for 2017.  During this period of investment and enhancement of services, the situation will be closely monitored.  A further independent review will be carried out in early 2017 to assess the impact that these improvements have had on the volume of patients attending the cath lab.<\/p>  <p>  Dr Herity also recommends that some services be provided elsewhere.  I want to be certain that any change to how a service is delivered will result in improved services for the patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of ceasing primary PCI services at UHW by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access to a 24\/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017. <\/p>  <p>  I intend to visit UHW next month and I will take the opportunity to speak with staff and management on a broad range of issues.

The other ABC sites are funded through the following lead agencies or consortia: Clondalkin Behavioural Initiative; Louth Leader Partnership; Barnardos; National College of Ireland; Bray Area Partnership; Northside Community Health Initiative (Cork) Ltd; Dublin Institute of Technology; Ballyfermot\/Chapelizod Partnership and People Action Against Unemployment Ltd.<\/p><p>The services provided by the ABC sites in each area are set out in the table.  These services include parenting supports and interventions, early years practitioner and primary teacher training and the delivery of programmes to expectant mothers, parents of infants and children and their parents from the early years upwards.<\/p><p>The Government is fully committed to ensuring that learning from all sites funded under the ABC programme will inform other services and supports for children in the area of prevention and early intervention.  Such an approach would offer a greater reach, in scope and depth, which will in turn enhance outcomes for children throughout the country.  As there is effective work being done on a range of themes across all 13 ABC sites, a key focus over the next year will be to determine the high-impact programmes and provision across these areas so that a more strategic approach can be taken to mainstreaming such learning. <\/p><p><b>ABC Programme &ndash;
