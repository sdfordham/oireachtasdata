We have already seen the policy decision to devalue sterling cost the agrifood industry some &euro;470 million in the last few months alone.  Today, the UK Government publishes its White Paper on Brexit which might give an indication as to how it proposes to manage the Brexit negotiations when Article 50 is eventually signed next month.  Despite the platitudes on all sides, it is clear that we are not prioritising Brexit to the extent we must to address the effect on our economy.  Yesterday, we had to depend on listening to the debate in the House of Commons to find out what the plans and the effects on this country will be.  The Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, addressed the House of Commons and agreed with the DUP's Sammy Wilson that to give Northern Ireland a special deal would be the wrong approach.  It is clear that there will be a hard Border.  This morning, Mr. Lux of the EU Commission went into extraordinary detail to outline blue and red channels for goods crossing the Border.  This situation is totally unacceptable and comes within 48 hours of Prime Minister May talking here about the need to avoid a return to the old Border situation.<\/p>  <p>  The question is what we are going to do about this.  Does the commentary of Mr. Lux this morning not clearly underline the need for Ireland to build an alliance against what is a very fast emerging hard Brexit for this country with a hard Border and red and blue channels where heavy goods vehicles and others will have to be called in and checked?  He said some of it will happen with the benefit of technology while it will also require Border posts and staff.  This is a seriously retrograde step.  Brexit has the potential to wreck the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and to impact seriously on Border communities which are already struggling in the context of damaged trade.  We have had constant platitudes from the Government about an all-of-Government approach.  We need a Minister for Brexit, appropriately resourced, and the Government must immediately publish a plan about how bilateral negotiations with Britain will go and, more particularly, how negotiations are going to go with the EU Commission.  It is essential that Northern Ireland is granted a special deal to secure the future of this entire nation economically, socially and politically.<\/p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that there is a very real and serious risk facing Ireland with the implications of the Border controls confirmed this morning by Mr. Lux?  Is the Government accepting that Borders are going to be put in, which Mr. Lux suggested this morning?  Can the T&aacute;naiste outline the position to the House?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200003#A00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1486036800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>We are under absolutely no illusion about the nature and scale of the Brexit challenge and we have a clear and comprehensive plan.

We are absolutely clear.<\/p> <p> To continue to talk about a lack of preparation is not the approach that the main Opposition party should take, from a reputational point of view as far as Ireland is concerned.  It is very clear that the Government has done deep analysis across all areas of the Brexit network.  There are 11 working groups.  A significant amount of work has been done in my Department.  I will meet the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, on Monday to continue the discussion.  It is very clear that the top-level priorities have been identified, namely, trade, economy, Northern Ireland, the peace process, the common travel area and the future of the EU.  We have examined the risks, the mitigating factors and what is needed.<\/p> <p> The House of Commons has now passed the first stage of the Bill, allowing the Prime Minister to notify the European Union of the intention of the United Kingdom to leave.  We are now in a different situation, in that the first formal step has been taken and more is to come in terms of the legislative process and the publication of the White Paper.  It will be useful for us to deepen our preparations and, at EU level, detail our priorities.  There are ongoing meetings with different sectors, industry and civic society.  The all-island dialogue will continue.  Another meeting will be held very shortly.<\/p> <p> I do not have time to go into the enormous programme of engagement that has been undertaken by the Taoiseach and other Ministers.  Let me reassure the House that it has been very intensive and detailed work has been done on all of the implications.  Until Article 50 is triggered, formal negotiations will not begin.<\/p> <p> Our plan is having an effect.  Chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has named four initial priorities.  Deputy MacSharry referred to Northern Ireland, which is one of the priorities.  I met Mr. Barnier and his team, as did the Taoiseach and a number of other Ministers, and had detailed discussions about our priorities for Brexit.  We made our position on not returning to any type of a hard border very clear.  His other priorities include protecting the common travel area, which is one of Prime Minister Theresa May's 12 negotiation priorities.  As there is greater clarity from the British side, we will be in a position to continue to ensure that our headline priorities are centre stage in our contact with the UK and across the EU and in all the meetings we will continue to have with EU heads of state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200003#A00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486037100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is time that we were honest with the people.

The ballot was held because of major issues surrounding teachers' pay as well as issues surrounding supervision and substitution duties.  Despite some minor concessions on the Government's part, the deal put to teachers remains largely the same as that proposed before teachers went out on strike last October.  The ASTI executive has recommended that its members should reject the deal on offer.  If they do, industrial action will resume and schools will close again.  As any parent will tell the T&aacute;naiste, this will be very disruptive.  As any student, particularly those in exam years, will tell her, it will also be very stressful.<\/p>  <p>  Teachers have legitimate concerns about their pay and conditions.  Their concerns are justifiably shared across the public sector following seven years of pay cuts, but the teaching profession in particular has been affected as it is the one area in which a large number of new recruits had to be employed over the past ten years because of demographic pressures.  Teachers and the rest of our public sector workers want and deserve fair pay restoration.  They are not looking for a pay increase, but pay restoration, that is, to be simply given back what was taken away.<\/p>  <p>  The demands of teachers are not insurmountable but they remain unresolved because the Government has its head stuck firmly in the sand.  The issue of pay equality, which was a central reason for industrial action in October has not been addressed in the slightest, but it must be addressed.  New entrants - those who started teaching from January 2011 - start on a pay scale that is on average 10% less than their colleagues.  The Government has no plan to address that situation.  Worse still, there is no commitment to equal pay for equal work.<\/p>  <p>  I am of the firm view that this issue must be resolved before the scheduled ending of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The clock is ticking and kicking the can down the road will not resolve the problem.  Will the T&aacute;naiste, on behalf of Government, today commit unequivocally to the principle of pay equality for teachers?  Will she agree that the issue of pay equality - equal reward for equal effort - for post-2011 teachers must be addressed and confirm that it will be addressed before the scheduled ending of the Lansdowne Road agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200005#C00100","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1486037400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that the central executive committee of the ASTI took a decision to put the outcome of the recent talks process to a ballot of its members.  We should await the result which will be announced later today.<\/p>  <p>  On the points raised, it is critical to note that three quarters of the gap for new entrants described by the Deputy has been closed in this deal.  It is a good offer that was made following negotiations with all the trade unions.  This was a final offer and we should respect the ballot process.  A new pay process is starting under the Public Sector Pay Commission which will address the issues raised by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  There are immediate benefits to individual ASTI members in accepting the offer.  The current deal on the table would see new teachers get a 15% to 22% increase in their salaries, beginning in January; immediate backdated payments for supervision and substitution for all teachers; restoration of increments; and increased flexibility in how the Croke Park hours are used in schools.  Acceptance would also mean that ASTI members can avail of a new voluntary opt-out from the supervision and substitution scheme and would provide for earlier permanency for those on fixed-term contracts as well as new arrangements for securing additional hours for part-timers.  The Deputy will see why I say the deal on offer is a good one.  I hope the result of the ballot later today will be positive.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that under the package announced in the recent budget, which was also significant, there will be greater promotion opportunities on offer in schools for new teachers coming into the system.<\/p><p>These benefits are only available to ASTI members if they vote to accept the package.  The proposals also include arrangements for addressing concerns about the junior cycle, including arrangements for ensuring that no current third year students miss out on marks in their English examination. <\/p> <p> I accept that the ASTI has outstanding pay demands and that the deal does not travel the full distance it set out to achieve.  However, it represents significant progress, as I indicated.  The door is certainly not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of our public service pay talks when they get under way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200005#C00200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486037700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste's response, while not unexpected, is nonetheless alarming and I am sure it will cause alarm among teachers, students and parents alike.

Nobody expects pay restoration to happen overnight and it is accepted, including by teachers, that no one has a magic wand.  Why can the Government not make a commitment for new entrants who are currently disadvantaged, employed on a discriminatory basis and do not receive equal pay?

This week, we learned that the National Asset Management Agency will pay an additional &euro;158 million in tax on profits made by the agency from the sales of property held through section 110 companies.<\/p><p>Today, it is reported that Matheson has closed three charities that were used by vulture funds to avoid paying tax.

This investigation shows the depth and extent of lobbying activity by vulture funds of the Department of Finance to ensure that changes to our laws did not inconvenience their elaborate tax avoidance structures.<br\/><br\/>The statutory lobbying register shows a lot less activity.  The lobbying returns for September-December 2016 show that only a small portion of those meetings were required to be declared and that much of the lobbying by these companies is carried out with junior officials so that it flies under the radar.  It is clear that lobbying rules in regard to tax matters need to be strengthened so that all activity is captured.  In at least one case letters from a vulture fund directly to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, have not been declared.  In other cases, it may be that vulture funds avoided the necessity to declare their interactions by channelling their contact to more junior officials with whom contact does not have to be declared. <br\/><br\/>Tax policy is a particularly important part of public policy.  Our tax must be just and fair.  Continuing to allow vulture funds to influence tax policy under the radar is unfair to families and small business across the country who have no such access.

In recent weeks, Tesco has decided to take the extraordinary action of bypassing its workers' union, Mandate, and unilaterally imposing the terms of a contract.  These terms, if accepted, would mean a pay cut of more than 15%, in addition to an attack on terms and conditions for the company's longest-serving workers.  This is only the beginning.  Tesco's union-busting activities are part of a broader plan known as Project Black, which was drawn up by a specialist international legal team called Eversheds.  It aims to get rid of 1,200 of the most secure and well-paid jobs in the company, critically undermining the union in the process.  If this plan succeeds, it will be a big step towards bringing Tesco into line with the low-hour, low-wage and insecure employment that is rampant across the retail sector.  The company intends to enforce these changes by bullying its workers, trying to turn them against one another and disciplining those who speak out.  This is both deeply worrying and unnecessary.<\/p>  <p>  Tesco is no pauper.  Research estimates suggest the company makes between &euro;200 million and &euro;250 million in profit per year in Ireland.  Only a few years ago, Tesco was calling Ireland \"Treasure Island\" in its internal documents, a clear indication of the big money it made here.<\/p><p> In recent days in Britain, Tesco agreed to shell out &pound;3.7 billion to buy Booker, the food wholesale company, and it plans to pay dividends to shareholders at the same time that it imposes cuts on workers.  Tesco is no pauper.  It is a serious player.  It is the largest private sector employer in Ireland.  What happens to its 11,000 retail workers in the coming days and weeks should be of high priority to every Deputy.  It will also tell a story about the reality of work in modern Ireland.<\/p> <p> Figures show that Ireland is second in the OECD in terms of low pay at 25% of the workforce.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to yesterday's Survey of Income and Living Conditions, SILC, report but it also mentioned that 105,000 people were working poor.  Everyday, hundreds of thousands of people go to work in low-pay jobs on insecure terms and unpredictable hours, struggling to get by from day to day.  In many cases, the public subsidises this.  For example, 10% of Tesco's workforce is in receipt of family income supplement.<\/p> <p> Will the T&aacute;naiste condemn Tesco's latest actions?  Will she defend the rights of workers to be represented in their workplaces and not to be bypassed by super-rich multinational corporations that try to impose terms unilaterally?

We want to see well-paid jobs.  We are seeing that across the country.  We are seeing a huge reduction in unemployment from 15.7% down to just over 7% now.  Clearly, we want to continue that.  We launched our new jobs action plan just this week.  We want to see that improvement being reflected right across the country and we want to see well-paying jobs being available for individuals and for families because that is the best way out of poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the Deputy has outlined a situation that she has concerns about in respect of Tesco but, in the first instance, it is for discussion between employers and employees.  We have well-tested labour relations mechanisms available where there is conflict, and I would hope that they would be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200009#G00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1486038600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste is ignoring the fact that the jobs debate is not simply about quantity, but also quality.  It is not just about establishing commissions.  We need robust legislation.  The Government is allowing us to become a low-pay Ireland.  According to the OECD, one in four Irish workers is low paid.  According to yesterday's SILC report, there are more than 100,000 working poor.  The same report stated that consistent poverty among the children of lone parents, who are disproportionately retail workers, has increased to 26.2%.  These figures do not even count those people who are underemployed or the prevalence of short contracts and low, insecure hours.<\/p>  <p>  What action will the T&aacute;naiste take about this?  Tesco is one of the few employers in the retail sector that still has thousands of decent jobs in which workers earn enough on which to live, and it has these jobs because workers organised.  Research shows that, in the retail sector, those in unions earn approximately 30% more than those who are not.  I urge the workers in Tesco to stay strong, stay together and remember that if the company is given the right to impose terms unilaterally on one group today, it will do so to another tomorrow.<\/p><p>This week is the 70th anniversary of the death of Jim Larkin.

As the Deputy is aware, we were in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards and, as a result, fewer people are dependent on transfers.  For example, the number of people in receipt of working age income and employment supports continues to fall, to just under 405,000 people in December 2016.  I accept that is still a large number.  However, it is 10% less than the number claiming those allowances in the previous year, thus showing the rise in income.

In other words, it can close down the fund and leave accumulated liabilities to the detriment of members.  This situation has been resolved in the United Kingdom for the past 20 years.  Unfortunately, the UK legislation is running into some difficulties so we do not propose to repeat that here.  We must take a more nuanced approach in our Bill, which we have done.  It will meet many of the objections raised to the British legislation or to a proposal along the lines we are suggesting.  I will outline the details of that when the Bill is being discussed on Second Stage.<\/p><p>In addition, the method of calculation of liabilities for defined benefit pension purposes grossly inflates liabilities.  We are obliging the Pensions Authority to do a study of how liabilities are calculated and to report back to this House within six months.<\/p><p>In addition to this, a pension protection scheme has been in operation in the UK for more than 20 years.  I do not know whether a similar arrangement would be appropriate here but we are asking the Pensions Authority to report to us on this within six months.  I refer to where the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme make an application to the Pensions Authority under section 50 to change the terms of the scheme.  We have had many complaints that in some cases a particular group of members, whether deferred pensioners, future pensioners, etc., might be more adversely affected than others and they have no redress.  We would provide an appeal mechanism to the Pensions Authority in such a situation, provided the majority of the members of the scheme who vote in a particular ballot to deal with the situation propose to do so.  I will recommend the Bill to the House during Private Members' time next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200013#L01900","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486041000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200014#M00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486041000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200014#M00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486041000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1486041000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200014#M00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486041000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200014#M00600","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486041000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"European Communities (Brexit) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1486041000,"counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200014#M00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1486041000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the amendment of the European Communities Act 1972, so as to ensure the Government reports to the Oireachtas on negotiations regarding the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union; and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh go gcead&oacute;far dom Bille a thabhairt isteach chun Acht na gComhphobal Eorpach, 1972 a leas&uacute;.

am introducing amendment No. 17 to provide for a review of the operation of the new provision contained in section 25 of the Bill to criminalise the purchase of sexual services.  A number of amendments have been tabled by Deputies proposing similar provisions and that are alternatives to amendment No. 17.  I am referring to those tabled by Deputy Coppinger and the Anti-Austerity Alliance, amendment No. 18 from People Before Profit, amendment No. 19 from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, amendment No. 20 in the name of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, amendment No. 23 in the names of Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace and amendment No. 24 from Deputy Pringle.<\/p>  <p>  My amendment states that the report shall include information as to the number of arrests and convictions in respect of the new offence under section 7A as created by this Bill.  This is the provision that targets the demand for sexual services and I have limited the review to this particular provision, as it is this that has given rise to some concern regarding the impact on the safety and well-being of sex workers.  A review of prostitution legislation by an Oireachtas committee three years ago recommended the introduction of this offence, and there is nothing to stop a similar review from happening in the future.  It does not require legislative provision.<\/p>  <p>  However, in focusing the review provision in the Bill on the single offence of criminalising the purchase of sexual services rather than including it in a large review of trafficking legislation and prostitution legislation generally, which can be the subject of a separate review, we can concentrate more deliberately and forensically on the impact of the offence with less risk of it being minimised in the context of a much larger review.<\/p>  <p>  I have set a date for the review being completed within three years of the section being commenced.  I am recommending this because it is pragmatic and will afford the best opportunity to ensure that the legislation has been embedded for a sufficient period to measure its impact adequately.  To begin the review at too early a point may result in an inconclusive report.  Northern Ireland committed to reviewing its legislation after three years, and it would be useful to have a comparable period to measure the impact of the offence in this jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  I remind Deputies that, under Standing Order 164A, the Minister with responsibility for implementation of an Act shall provide a report that shall review the functioning of the Act and must be laid in the Library.  This must be done 12 months following the enactment of a Bill.  Therefore, a report will be prepared within one year because that is the normal statutory provision.<\/p>  <p>  The Opposition amendments, including amendment No. 1 to the Government amendment, are too broad.  The Deputies are familiar with their own amendments.  Some seek to include in the review the impact of our existing human trafficking offences under the 2008 Act on the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.  The existing laws relating to human trafficking target those who traffic human beings for the purpose of exploitation, be it labour exploitation, sexual exploitation or exploitation of some other form.  No one is suggesting that our human trafficking laws have impacted on the safety and well-being of sex workers and require a review in that light, yet that is the implication contained in some of the Opposition amendments.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make a general point about the work that has been done in monitoring the State's response to human trafficking.  Last October, I launched the second national action plan to combat human trafficking in Ireland.  It has been published and is available on our website.  It is extensive in terms of setting out the goals and work, including interagency work, that are required if we are to deal with this issue.  The goals include the identification of victims of trafficking, protection and support for its victims and ensuring an effective criminal justice response.  The plan outlines many initiatives across the agencies, including NGOs and the Garda, to monitor the provision of support to victims and so on.  The plan is being overseen by a working group and was sent for evaluation by the Council of Europe in December.  I met the Council of Europe and it will revert to us with its assessment.  If it has recommendations, I will be open to implementing them.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that my amendment achieves the purpose that was debated on Committee Stage, namely, that we needed to review this legislation.  I am happy to do that.  We should examine the impact of the new offence of purchasing sexual services in the context of prostitution.  Regardless, there will be an overall review in the usual statutory way after one year.  I hope that the Deputies will consider accepting this as a way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200022#V00900","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1486044300,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

He referred to human trafficking.  The justification for the campaign on the criminalisation of the purchase of sex was based on the concerns we all rightly have about human trafficking, in particular for the purposes of sex, where such unfortunates are, in effect, being kept in prison against their will and trafficked across borders.  They are expected to carry out sexual activity to make lots of money for their traffickers.  That is a concern for all of us.<\/p>  <p>  However, as I said last night when I introduced our amendments, there has been a lot of conflation in this debate.  The argument is fundamentally about whether criminalising the purchase of sex will deal with human trafficking.  I do not believe that is the case and I have not seen any evidence to convince me otherwise.  I have read lots of documents from Sweden, Norway, Amnesty and others that show quite the opposite is the case.  Criminalisation of the purchase of sex does nothing to deal with the plight of those who are the victims of human trafficking or the criminality in that regard.  We are in danger of conflating issues, which is the reason we specifically mention in our amendment that we want to see the impact of the legislation on the level of human trafficking.  Whether the review is in two years or three years it must specifically focus on the impact on human trafficking.  The Minister's amendment does not do that.  I intend to press my amendment.<\/p>  <p>  I will also press the Minister further on the question of timing.  It will be three years and probably four before we get a report if we opt for the Minister's amendment and the issue is too urgent to leave it for that length of time, not specifically just on the trafficking issue but because there is a plethora of issues we have tried to amend.  For example, the definition of a brothel is being taken to include a case where a number of sex workers work together in an apartment.  They could be considered to be running and brothel and could be shut down.  If I was a sex worker vulnerable to all sorts of creeps out there with money to buy services I would much rather operate alongside a companion in the same apartment.  Working together is not just a sign of being organised in an industry, it about the health and safety of sex workers.  Health and safety at work is a big part of legislation no matter what job one performs, whether a firefighter, nurse or sex worker.  The health and safety of sex workers must be given a certain degree of priority, in particular because they are already extraordinarily vulnerable.  The issue of working together does not necessarily mean people are running a brothel, it may just be a case of safety in numbers.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the heavier penalties for loitering that are contained in the Bill.  We must also examine the impact of that on the human rights of the sex workers involved.  Crucially, we must focus on health.  I have just been going over the report on the Swedish model carried out by HIV Ireland and it is very worrying how such a measure could impact on the health of sex workers.  As we said last night, very often sex workers are searched to see whether they are carrying condoms and the implication is that they are carrying them in order to facilitate the purchase of sex.  There is evidence in the report that sex workers are less likely to carry condoms, which help protect their safety.  There is evidence that the level of HIV is on the increase among sex workers in Sweden.  There have also been statements from people connected with the Swedish department of health that they refuse to issue condoms to sex workers.  I have two young nephews who have grown up in Sweden and I am aware that every school there has a nurse who provides condoms to teenagers if they request them because they are concerned about their sexual health.  However, it seems all of a sudden we disrespect the sexual health of people who are engaged in sex work.  That must be taken into account and in the shortest possible time.  Two years is much healthier than the three years proposed by the Minister.  A reference to human rights and human trafficking must be contained within the review.  I intend to press amendment No. 18.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200023#W00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1486044900,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I intend to move amendment No. 23.  We have looked at this entire issue the wrong way around.  Rather than start with data, evidence and research and then deciding what policy to adopt, we started with a model that was an alleged solution and we are talking about carrying out a review after the event.  That is regrettable.  It contrasts sharply with the approach taken in the UK where a significant body of research was undertaken in advance of any proposals being put forward to alter legislation, which to me is a far better way.  Interestingly, the Home Affairs Select Committee interim report found disadvantages to a sex buyer law based on the fact that provisions already exist for criminal offences associated with the sex industry.  The finding is that demand is not reduced, just displaced.  The committee also very worryingly cited harassment and other negative effects on sex workers.  That bolsters the point I made last night that already sex workers are very vulnerable to exploitation by the Garda who are in a position of power.  There were 70 reports to GSOC of threats and demands for sexual favours from the Garda.  The health and policing implications are important as well.  The conclusion of the British report is that the sex buyer law is based on the premise that prostitution is morally wrong and therefore illegal, whereas the law at present in Britain makes no such moral judgment.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge that the intention of many of the supporters of the sex buyer law is to protect sex workers, especially women, from the harm, violence and exploitation that can occur in the sex industry but we also note that the sex buyer law makes no attempt to discriminate between prostitution which occurs between two consenting adults and that which involves exploitation.  Much of the rhetoric also denies sex workers the opportunity to speak for themselves and to make their own choices, which is absolutely critical in terms of our amendment because we have devised the Bill while excluding the voice of the sex workers themselves.  Our amendment calls for any review to put those people, and the organisations which work on the front line in harm reduction, as the core component.  That is absolutely critical.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the points made by Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien.  Given the Minister's proviso is \"not later than three years\" I hope she will commence the review earlier.  We, like many of the others who proposed amendments suggested a two-year provision.<\/p><p>A review of this type is not expensive.  The representative organisations for sex workers and harm reduction agencies have their own records and data and publish yearly statistics, as do the garda&iacute; in some instances, so it is just a matter of centralising data.  However, we need to engage with the sex workers themselves.<\/p> <p> The only contention put forward by those supporting the so-called Swedish model is that if we criminalise the purchase of sex, we will reduce demand and therefore have an impact on trafficking.  This proposition is nonsense and I would love to see the evidence for it.  There are already laws dealing with trafficking, which is the abhorrent forced bonded labour, abduction, kidnap, false imprisonment, rape and exploitation of women.  Human trafficking is abhorrent.  I am intrigued in some ways by the over-concentration on sex trafficking in contrast with the coercion and exploitation of people who are trafficked for other purposes, which is an interesting point.  Given that we are talking about the health and vulnerability of a very marginalised group of people, we need to move far more quickly than three years.  Our legislation should have been about enabling those vulnerable people to take control over their own lives and protect their health but we have disempowered them through this legislation by putting the power of negotiation, place of work and so on much more into the hands of the buyer by criminalisation.  Our starting point should have been the health and human rights of sex workers.  Part of the problem with the legislation is that if all sex work is exploitation and there is no room for distinguishing between forced and voluntary sexual activity between consenting adults, in essence, you are saying that all women are victims and that the women or gay men involved do not know their own minds and cannot make a rational decision.  We might not like that decision, it might not be one we would pick for ourselves and it might not be one that those people would pick for themselves if they had an alternative but it is a valid decision and choice for them to make and it is wrong for us to say that they do not have that right or do not know their own minds.  People may say that only a few people are in these circumstances.  Is it the case that minorities do not deserve protection and that just because somebody is in a minority, we should exclude their voice and silence them?  It is completely wrong.<\/p> <p> Our amendment puts the focus on the sex workers themselves.  A very worrying trend in other jurisdictions that I could see happening here is moneys being diverted into organisations that worked with people to help them exit the industry.  We are all in favour of people exiting the industry when they have choices and alternatives but the problem has been that much of the energy has been taken away from groups engaged in harm reduction which has put people's lives at risk.  This part also needs to be analysed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200023#W00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486045500,"counter":150,"content":"<p>There is general agreement that there should be a review of this legislation and that a report should be produced.  That is a good idea.  When we introduce new laws, it is important that we review them on an ongoing basis and come back with recommendations where they might be improved.  It is important that we are not too prescriptive with regard to the legislation in terms of setting out what needs to be done when the review takes place.  I know very many people in the Chamber have strong and certain views about what they think the outcome of this legislation will be.  I think the legislation will be to the benefit of sex workers and Irish society.  I am not certain about that nor am I certain about what the definite consequences of this legislation will be.  I do not think anyone can be sure about what the consequences will be.  For that reason, I think it is important that we leave any report and review open so that things that may happen which we did not expect to happen can be properly considered.<\/p>  <p>  For that reason, I think the amendment put forward by the Minister is probably the best one.  It states that the review will commence not later than three years after the commencement of this Part.  We need to give legislation some time to settle down in order to get a good overview of its impact.  I know that the Defamation Act 2009 has a review section that provides for a review after five years.  We need to give the legislation some time.  I also note that the amendment put forward by the Minister does take into account some of the concerns referred to by Deputies Clare Daly, Br&iacute;d Smith and Jonathan O'Brien.  Under the Minister's amendment, section 27(2)(b) would provide that the review would conduct an assessment of the impact of the operation of the section on the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.  An appraisal of people involved in sexual activity for sale will be at the forefront of the review to see the extent to which this legislation has affected them.<\/p>  <p>  We need a broad overview of that.  We cannot just have a situation where we just review a piece of legislation from the point of view of one or two sex workers.  We have to look at legislation in general to examine its impact on society and whether it has achieved the benefit for which it was designed and introduced and if not, what are the proposals to change it.  With respect to Deputies Clare Daly, Br&iacute;d Smith and Jonathan O'Brien, I think it is appropriate to go along with the amendment put forward by the Minister.  In reality, the difference between all the proposals that are being put before the House is not huge.  I would be concerned that if we had a very detailed section setting out what the reviewing body or section within the Department should do, it would find itself limited to what is set out in the statutory regime.  Any review is better when it is given broad parameters because we do not know with certainty what the consequences will be as a result of the introduction of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200024#X00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1486045500,"counter":151,"content":"<p>This is the first debate in which I have engaged since the new rules were introduced by the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform.  Essentially, we are meant to cover between five and six very complex amendments in seven minutes.  This needs to be reviewed in light of the practical application of it because I think everybody agrees that this is an extremely complex Bill.  It is unfortunate that many different things ranging from sexual offences to prostitution and sex work have been put into one Bill.  They are huge and complex areas with many differences between them.  To try to speak on particular amendments and the entire Bill in effect in seven minutes is extremely difficult.<\/p>  <p>  There have been some important progressive changes in this Bill, some of which we argued for.  Examples would be a legal definition of consent, for which rape crisis centres argued; the deletion of the criminalisation of sex workers with regard to loitering, for which many people, including myself, argued; and increasing penalties for criminal gangs which organise trafficking or prostitution.  Those are positive elements in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  However, many other amendments for which we have argued have not been taken on board.  For example, there has been no change in the definition of brothel keeping so that one or two sex workers not living off each other's earnings could still be harassed.  Another example is the refusal to rule out going after the finances of sex workers.  The amendments we are approaching will have a bearing on how people vote on the Bill.  In respect of amendment No. 17, there is a difference between what we are proposing and what the Minister is proposing.  The Minister proposes to review the ban on the purchase of sex but not to take up anything broader than that.  Our amendment to amendment No. 17 proposes reporting within two years on arrests and convictions for all existing prostitution-related offences, the new offences created under Part 4 of the Bill dealing with prostitution with information aggregated by gender and offence, the nature and extent of prostitution that may be linked to human trafficking and the impact of all laws on prostitution-related offences and the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.<\/p><p>We are proposing a much broader review to see what the impact will be, particularly of the criminalising of the purchase of sex.  The Minister has not agreed to that.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 21 is extremely important and I will be pressing it.  This amendment calls for a review and an outline of exit services for sex workers who want to get out of prostitution and sex work.  People have suggested this is the Nordic model, of which I have criticisms, but it is not even the Nordic model because that model was accompanied by a number of supports that are not even envisaged by the Bill.<\/p> <p> I believe that buying sex is an expression of power over another person.  Some 99% of buyers of sex are male; it reflects the gender inequality in society.  Therefore, I would be sympathetic to women, trade unionists and others who are calling for the criminalisation of the purchase of sex.  However, the Bill provides zero exit strategies to accompany that move.  No special measures are being introduced and no social services are in place to ensure that criminalisation does not make conditions more dangerous for sex workers.  On that basis, I cannot support the Bill and will abstain on it.<\/p> <p> Obviously, we need a transformation in our society's cultural attitudes.  We have a male patriarchal society which objectifies women.  We also have massive economic inequality which leads to many women and vulnerable transgender and LGBT people engaging in prostitution, which will persist until we eradicate those attitudes.  It is very unfortunate that the Minister is not willing to countenance very important amendments and for that reason it is very difficult to support it.  While the Bill contains progressive elements, the Minister should have taken on board the amendments we proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200024#X00300","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486046100,"counter":153,"content":"<p>We also tabled an amendment calling for a review within two years.<\/p>  <p>  On the trafficking issue, it is important to note that Norway, which has a similar system in place, carried out a review of its legislation in 2014.  It found that its law was actually leading to sex workers becoming increasingly dependent on traffickers and exploitative third parties.  The number of cases of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation reported in Norway did not change significantly between 2006 and 2014 after the change in the legislation, with 34 cases reported in 2006 and 37 in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien was probably being nice to the Minister in saying that the Government was allowed to review it in less than three years.  However, she would forgive us for suspecting that the Government would wait for the full three years before looking at it.  Given that there are so many issues with the Bill from our point of view and from the point of view of the sex workers, and given the serious lack of sound evidence that the Nordic model has a positive impact on the people it claims to protect, I would rather see it being reviewed no later than two years after enactment.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed Government report will include information on arrests and convictions made in this regard and an assessment of the impact of the operation of the section on the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.  However, no details have been provided on how this assessment will be made or who will be consulted.  We have repeatedly made the point that the voice of sex workers is absent from the Government's work to date, which is disappointing given that this is the very group the Government claims to want to support.  The law should make specific provision to include sex workers and their representative organisations in any review.<\/p>  <p>  Last night, I mentioned the Queens University survey of sex workers in Northern Ireland, which has been ignored by our Government and sadly also by the Northern Ireland Executive.  Obviously, the findings are not in tune with the ideology driving the legislation down here.  That Queens University report found that 98% of sex workers surveyed opposed the Swedish model; 61% felt this model would make them less safe; and 85% said this legislation would not reduce sex trafficking.  The PSNI also expressed concern that this legislation would be unlikely to be effective against exploitation.  Only 8% of clients surveyed said that criminalisation would stop them paying for sex.<\/p>  <p>  We should review it earlier.  Too many issues are at play, mostly relating to the fact that the sex workers have not been given any voice.  I reiterate some of their main points.  They insist that the Swedish model negatively impacts on the human rights of sex workers and further pushes people away from the police.  That has to be a big problem.  We are not taking on a harm reduction approach.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said earlier, forcing people to work in isolation cannot be good.  I do not understand the rationale.  People who even use their own home can be addicted and obviously the legislation will not make it safer for immigrants who face the potential of being deported.  Given what we are going into, there does not seem to be much evidence to suggest this is a good idea.  It should be reviewed earlier because it is totally unfair to the sex workers, who also have rights that are sadly being ignored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200025#Y00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1486046100,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Everybody has said there should be a review of the legislation and I agree.  Three years is the appropriate time to begin to see the impact; that is the right approach.<\/p>  <p>  I point out to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that the offence of loitering has been removed from the Bill.  We build in reviews to legislation all the time.  We do not define in legislation all the different aspects of the review.  That would be quite an unusual thing to do, but I am happy to put the following on the record of the House.  Obviously when doing a review of this new offence we would seek submissions from everybody, including those involved in sex work.  I met representatives of the association and heard their views.  People keep repeating that I have not taken into account the views of that group.  I did take them into account, but I still think the approach taken in the legislation is the right one.<\/p>  <p>  I will not repeat all the research I have used.  Deputy Wallace keeps talking about an online anonymous study that was done; that is one study.  I can quote to him the work of the Swedish Government, and the most recent report from the European Commission done by the University of Lancaster.  I can also quote the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality all of which suggest this is the direction to take.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, we have to review it.  This is a very important issue.  I note there has been much focus on the individual independent sex workers.  There has been a focus by some Deputies, but not by others, on the wider exploitation associated with prostitution which is driven by demand.<\/p><p>All of those studies refer to reducing the demand and the very close link between human trafficking and prostitution.  We see that repeatedly.  All of the statistics indicate that the vast majority of people involved in prostitution now have been trafficked, and also that they are extremely vulnerable.  I ask Deputies to accept that the review will involve all interested groups including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those involved in helping people to exit prostitution.<\/p> <p> Deputy Coppinger should know that I have outlined a series of initiatives under the national action plan to support people to exit prostitution.  There is greatly increased funding to the organisations working on the front line.  The Deputy's amendment seems to imply that those supports are not available.  Obviously, they are not written into legislation but all she has to do is look at the website of the Department of Justice and Equality to see the work we are doing.<\/p> <p> I make the point that the statistics Deputies say they want to insert in the legislation are available from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and from the Central Statistics Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200025#Y00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486046700,"counter":156,"content":"<p>On the Minister's last point about exit strategies, the type of strategies needed genuinely to assist people who want to exit prostitution are financial support, language support and treatment for those who may have an addiction.  A range of supports would be needed to allow those who want to get out of prostitution do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister would argue that the reason criminalisation of the purchase of sex is being introduced is to send a message from society that buying sex is not acceptable, and that it will reduce demand for the purchase of sex.  That is fine but if there are no real ways for people to get out of prostitution, they have to remain in it.  The question arises that if we criminalise the purchase of sex without ways and avenues to help people get out of prostitution, we may make it less safe.  That is a genuine concern.  People are not saying that the buying of sex is wrong, but it is wrong.  That message should be discussed in schools and in workplaces.  It is an expression of power over another human being.  On the idea that 99% of it is male, why are 50% not female?  Obviously, it is related to gender and power in society.<\/p>  <p>  It is all very well giving money to an organisation but the Minister is not allowing women who, for example, report traffickers, illegality and criminality to be dealt with in a very fair way.  It is very likely, therefore, that it will continue.  In any case, the Minister is not bringing in the Nordic model but if she were, I would look at it in a different way.  I am not surprised by that.

Substantial bodies of legislation already exist to deal with people who are coerced or trafficked into this activity.  The Minister, I or other people may not like the fact that some people choose to engage in that activity or the reality that their choice is restricted by their economic circumstances does not make it a less valid choice.  It is a choice people will be making today, tomorrow and the day after that.<\/p>  <p>  We are putting forward this legislation against the backdrop of the week when the report on consistent poverty levels in Ireland was produced, which showed that the children of lone parents are three times more likely to be in consistent poverty than children who were not the children of lone parents.  Deputy Collins highlighted earlier the statistics on the number of low paid workers in the State.  Economic circumstances are the reasons people end up in prostitution because of the nature of work that is available and their status.  It is laughable to say that giving money to organisations that will tell people to exit the industry will solve that problem.  It will not solve the problem, and the current economic circumstances will mean that more people will be involved in prostitution.<\/p>  <p>  We urgently need a review of this for the safety and welfare of the people involved.

The formal review, however, would be after three years during which we would get the submissions.  Data is available all the time and we will be gathering that together.

Increasingly, we are putting supports in place to have that kind of practical initiative so that the exit routes can be clear.  Women find themselves in a very difficult situation when trying to seek an alternative if they have got enmeshed in prostitution or sex work.  There is much talk about free choice.

Since I joined the D&aacute;il I have been on my feet, along with other Deputies, defending workers' rights, from Luas drivers to teachers to nurses to Tesco workers to Dunnes Stores workers.  There is a system of exploitation of workers that is at the heart of this society and beyond.  This leads to people being impoverished and living in the circumstances exposed by the report on inequality published yesterday.  It leads to people taking measures to find an income which are often distasteful to many of us, not necessarily always distasteful to those who take the measures but distasteful to broader society.  We should not have to see anybody put in this position.  We need far more equality in society and this is not just something that we legislate for by passing nice words, it is how we implement it in deed.  These deeds must be about sharing the wealth and economic opportunities available to anybody.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about the exit strategy for those engaged in sex work and the opportunities that should be given to them through education.  Twice yesterday, a serious cohort was mentioned as there is a rise in sex work by students.  If we were to graph it we would probably find a similar trajectory on the graph with the rise of student poverty.  Students are being impoverished because of enormous fees, including registration fees, the lack of grant support and the enormous rents they must pay to be able to live in a city or town to be a student.  Many of them supplement their income with sex work.  I regard the legislation as a whole as being totally inappropriate.  I will vote against it and against the amendment on the three-year report because I do not think it is sufficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200027#AA01600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1486047300,"counter":193,"content":"<p>We will not have a meeting of minds on this.

We hear many different views on whether it works or not and much research has been done.  We will not resolve it here on Report Stage of this legislation.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, as are three other Deputies who are present, I propose the committee examines this issue, including all the research, and issue a report.  I would like to think if this report comes back with information contrary to the Minister's research that it would feed into any report under the legislation.  The drafting and rationale of the legislation is based on the Turn Off the Red Light campaign.  If there is significant research to contradict it the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has an onus to look at it, compile a report and feed it into any report under the legislation.  We will not come to an agreement on whether it is done after three years or two years, but the important work will be done by the committee between now and the report on the outworkings of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200027#AA01700","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1486047300,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Deputy Wallace may speak if he wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200027#AA01800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486047300,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Why can he speak but I cannot?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200027#AA01900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1486047300,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Because he has spoken only once.

The total financial allocation for the period is approximately &euro;4 billion, of which EU support amounts to &euro;2.19 billion with the Exchequer funding the remainder.  This significant financial commitment is a key component in our overall strategy to enhance the competitiveness of the agrifood sector, achieve sustainable management of our natural resources and ensure more balanced development in our rural areas.  The allocation of Exchequer funding is part of and subject to the annual budgetary process.  As part of that process, some &euro;600 million has been allocated to the rural development programme for 2017.  I emphasise that within the structures of the annual budgetary and Estimates process, we are fully committed to the allocation of sufficient Exchequer funding to ensure the full draw-down of the EU co-funded amount over the lifetime of the programme.<\/p><p>In terms of 2017 funding priorities, the funding allocation of &euro;600 million provides continued support for the following: our flagship environmental scheme, GLAS, which now numbers over 50,000 farmers, and the associated GLAS traditional farm buildings measure; the Burren programme, a locally-led initiative focused specifically on the conservation of the unique farming landscape that is the Burren and a third tranche of which will open in 2017 to bring the number of farmers taking part to approximately 400; areas of natural constraint, or as the Deputy and I know them better, disadvantaged areas,\u00a0with some\u00a0 90,000 farmers receiving support because of the constraints to farming which they face; the highly innovative beef data genomics programme with 24,000 active farmers; the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, which funds fully completed on-farm capital investments; knowledge transfer groups which cover some 20,000 participants; targeted training for agricultural advisors and farmers who are engaged in the implementation of the rural development plan; the organic farming scheme, which has over 1,800 beneficiaries; legacy schemes from the previous rural development programme, including AEOS and the early retirement from farming scheme; the collaborative farming measure which contributes to the legal, advisory and financial services costs incurred by farmers in drawing up partnership agreements; technical assistance in respect of, among other things, the running of the national rural network, which promotes and monitors the rural development plan; and support for an evaluation of the GLAS scheme.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>As well as continuing to support the schemes that have already been rolled out, two new measures will be introduced and funded in 2017.

This scheme has been widely welcomed and fulfils a promise made in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  Projects under the European Innovation Partnership, EIP, measure will also commence in 2017.  This initiative brings together farmers, researchers, advisors and scientists to look at new and traditional practices, develop ideas and research and co-operate in their own local areas.

From 2018, eligible areas must instead be designated using a list of biophysical criteria.  In cases where a member state\u00a0does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must be phased out on a digressive basis.

They provide support to Irish farmers aimed at enhancement of biodiversity, water quality and mitigation of future impacts of climate change while allowing Irish farmers to improve their agricultural practices in a sustainable manner.  To date, support valued at over &euro;120 million has been provided to Irish farmers in respect of 2016 payments under these schemes.<\/p><p>The number of farmers active in GLAS is almost 37,500, of which 25,825 are in GLAS 1 and 11,667 are in GLAS 2.  Almost 20,000 farmers in GLAS 1 and almost 8,700 farmers in GLAS 2 have successfully completed the GLAS prepayment checks in respect of the 2016 scheme year and a first payment instalment of 85% has issued in these cases.  The balancing payment due to farmers who have received 85% of their 2016 payment will issue later in the year when the last of the required on-the-spot inspections have been initiated.  The most recent payments issued on 30 January 2017, with &euro;4.2 million issuing to just under 1,200 participants. <\/p><p>The year, 2016, was an exceptionally busy one as an additional 11,500 farmers were processed to approval in GLAS 2 and a further 14,000 new applications were submitted under tranche 3 and are currently being processed to approval stage with a view to increasing the overall numbers in the scheme to in excess of 50,000 scheme participants from 1 January 2017.  It is acknowledged that payment targets have not been fully met, with under 3,000 GLAS 1 and under 6,000 GLAS 2 payments remaining to be fully processed.  This is due, in the main, to unanticipated outcomes of the checks required to be carried out on each individual application.<\/p><p>Outstanding payments under both GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 are delayed due to a variety of issues, including declaration of incompatible parcel usage on the basic payment scheme, BPS, application for a chosen GLAS action; changes in parcel boundaries on which a GLAS action is chosen, including splitting or merging of parcels; an applicant no longer claiming a parcel on their 2016 BPS; incomplete documentation such as incorrect information on low-emission slurry declaration; incomplete interim commonage management plans; and incompatible data and parcel history on Department databases.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>Just over 8,615 farmers in the agri-environment options scheme are due a payment in respect of 2016.

Payments will continue to be made on a regular basis as files are cleared.<\/p><p>Outstanding payments under AEOS 2 are largely delayed due to rechecks which must be completed on payments made for all scheme years before the final contract payment can be processed.\u00a0 Outstanding payments under AEOS 3 are delayed by stocking density checks.  Farmers had until 31 December 2015 to meet their stocking density on commonages and a density check must be completed before payment can issue.<\/p><p>I also point out that a number of payments under both schemes are held up due to incomplete documentation and all participants are reminded to submit any outstanding documentation as soon as possible to facilitate payment.

Greyhound racing is a traditional industry that plays an integral role in rural society and the economy.  Successive Governments have recognised the importance of both the\u00a0greyhound and horse racing industries for our country and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives down through the years. <\/p>  <p>  In 2010 a report by Jim Power Economics, commissioned by\u00a0 Bord na gCon, estimated that the greyhound racing industry was responsible for sustaining in excess of 10,000 full and part-time jobs directly and indirectly, many in rural communities,\u00a0and injected an estimated &euro;500 million into local economies.  The greyhound breeding industry is very export orientated, with over 75% of greyhounds now running in the UK being Irish bred.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2002, well in excess of 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.  Annual attendances at greyhound race meetings have\u00a0declined over the course of the recession.

Over the period of the recession, Government support for the industry\u00a0was reduced significantly, which coincided with the effects of the economic downturn.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has informed me that consumers and fans of greyhound racing\u00a0are now consuming the sport differently.

The information revealed from the site investigation report indicated that certain of the dredge material would not be suitable for conventional disposal at sea.  <\/p>  <p>  In June 2016, a firm of consulting engineers were engaged to prepare a report on a potential dredging project at Howth to include the possible scope of the project, various disposal options for the dredged material at Howth and permitting requirements.  This report is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2017.  A draft preliminary report indicating initial dredge quantities and cost estimates is expected by end February 2017.  Depending on the outcome of this process, and as is the case for all developments in the six fishery harbour centres, any possible future dredging project at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future capital programmes on the basis of available Exchequer funding and competing priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200038#MM00900","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1486053600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Is it possible to include it in the 2017 capital programme?

Normal lending assessment criteria will apply although the loans will be unsecured in nature, thereby facilitating a more straightforward application process.  Potential applicants should note that the loans will be disbursed on a first-come, first-served basis and will need to be allocated by late summer 2017 to comply with the requirements attaching to the European Union funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200038#MM01400","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486054200,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Four Deputies are offering and they are all entitled to speak.

I have submitted numerous parliamentary questions in the past eight months and I have been getting mixed messages from the Health Service Executive, HSE, on this issue.  I was first led to believe that it had been actively worked on for Cavan General Hospital and that it was the aim of the HSE to provide this essential scan to pregnant women in Cavan, Monaghan and across the region.  We then heard that the equipment was in place in the hospital but that the management is unable to fill the vacancies with the required expertise.  I have now been informed that scans will be provided for within the RCSI hospital group because staffing cannot be secured to have them carried out at Cavan General Hospital.  That is cold comfort to expectant mothers in Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  The hiring of professionals across all Departments within the HSE appears to be a recurring problem.  One must ask why that is the case.  Is it just an excuse to get out of the original commitments to provide this anomaly scan in Cavan General Hospital and force pregnant women to travel up to two hours away to have the scan they need?  Why should women in Cavan and Monaghan, and across the general area, not have this scan made available to them?  I have to say they are being treated differently and discriminated against, and we are back to the same old story of only looking after those living in the big cities.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, too many harrowing cases have been reported in recent years regarding these scans.  We had one only this week in County Cork.  I do not know the reason the HSE is not listening to the women who have been crying and concerned about this issue.  Why will it not accept and implement the recommendations of previous cases taken against the HSE?  When something goes wrong during pregnancy or, even worse, when there is a fatality, it has a devastating impact on the families involved and on the staff in hospitals.  To hear that this anomaly scan, if available, could prevent and change the outcome in some way adds further insult to injury.  To the families that have been bereaved, it is incomprehensible.<\/p>  <p>  Having a scan available to expectant mothers at any other site apart from Cavan General Hospital is not good enough.  It is not enough to cherry-pick certain areas and only provide in the big cities.  To further compound the families' grief, misinformation has been given to the media by the professionals leading the public, and me, to believe that the scan would be made available in the hospital.  That is simply not true.<\/p>  <p>  I requested a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Harris, regarding one particular family, the Whelans, who have suffered terribly.  In requesting the meeting for the Whelan family, the Minister's answer, which I will paraphrase, was that it would be better for them to meet the HSE.  That is not what the Whelan family want to hear.  They want to meet with the Minister to express their concerns and to ensure that this is implemented in Cavan General Hospital.<\/p><p>When and why has the plan changed from providing the scan at the hospital to providing a regional maternal foetal medicine service with the RCSI group?  Why does the HSE think this model would give greater recruitment success?  Why has the HSE given up so easily on requiring the staff of the hospital to provide the scan, particularly when we believe all the equipment necessary for the scan is in the hospital?<\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State outline what are the long-term plans of the Department and the HSE for the unit in Cavan General Hospital?  It is a fabulous department which just requires this one scan, which has been recommended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200040#PP00300","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486055100,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I apologise for arriving late and delaying proceedings.  Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Harris, cannot be here.  I thank Deputy Smyth for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the position on foetal anomaly scanning at Cavan General Hospital.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is advised that while the provision of routine foetal anomaly scanning for all pregnant women has been a key target for Cavan General Hospital, despite every effort having been made the hospital has not been successful, to date, in recruiting the necessary specialists required to provide a routine 20-week anomaly scanning service.  However, the Minister is advised that those maternity hospitals and units currently providing anomaly scans will accept referrals from other maternity units, if requested.  This occurs where the medical team in the referring maternity unit considers that an anomaly scan is clinically indicated.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, accepts that the provision of anomaly scanning is not uniform throughout the country but we are working to address this.  The national maternity strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services.  The strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years and this work will be led by the HSE national women and infants health programme.  The programme was recently established, and the Minister anticipates it will drive improvements in maternity service delivery.  On behalf of the Minister, I am pleased to confirm a programme director was seconded into position on 3 January.  A clinical director has recently been appointed and will take up position on 1 March.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has been assured the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority for the programme.  As a first step, clinical guidance on routine detailed scans at 20 weeks will be developed.  In the meantime, the programme will continue to work with the hospital groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability.  Of course, one of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers.  In this context, it is expected the establishment of maternity networks across hospital groups will assist in the development of a sustainable service model that ensures that all women in each hospital group can access anomaly scans.<\/p>  <p>  The maternity strategy recognises that smaller maternity services cannot, and should not, operate in isolation as stand-alone entities.  Those units cannot sustain the breadth and depth of clinical services that the populations they serve require without formal links to larger units.  Accordingly, maternity networks are being established across hospital groups.  The Deputy can be assured the Government is fully committed to the progressive development of our maternity services.  Last year saw the publication of Ireland's first ever national maternity strategy as well as the HSE's national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death and HIQA's national standards for safer better maternity services.  In addition, each of our 19 maternity units now publishes a maternity patient safety statement on a monthly basis.  I am sure the House will agree these developments represent key building blocks to enable us to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200041#QQ00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1486055100,"counter":382,"content":"<p>It is a fundamental piece of equipment and a fundamental service in any maternity ward.

In recent months, an urban practice in my town has advertised a vacancy through the HSE three times, but no applicant has come forward for the position.

This must be reversed and improvements must be made in the payment structure.  With regard to the pensions received by doctors, they qualify for &euro;17,000 under the GMS pension.  This is a very small pension and it must be examined.  It pales in comparison to what is available to managers in the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a focus on building primary care centres but the reality is that most GPs in rural areas and small urban towns have their own facilities.  Pouring money into primary care centres if we do not have GPs available is like putting the cart before the horse.  I appeal to the HSE to examine each area before it builds primary care centres.  Doctors with their own facilities should be allowed to use them and the extra resources should be put into trying to attract young doctors into rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Another anomaly is that doctors in a county such as mine must pay for 24-7 cover.  They must contribute quite significantly to services such as Shannondoc.<\/p><p>In large urban areas, however, there is no charge on GPs for 24-7 cover.  This is an anomaly that needs to be addressed urgently.<\/p> <p> Training places need to be increased because there are not enough for GPs at the moment.  When GPs graduate it should be mandatory for them to spend a number of years working in this country.  We have a very sought after education system for medical doctors but when they qualify a lot of them head to other shores to practise and the country gets no benefit from the investment that has been put in.<\/p> <p> Locums are another huge issue for rural practices.  The tax treatment of locums has to be looked because it is virtually impossible for a rural practitioner to get a locum to help him out in his practice.  One can expect no man or woman to work 365 days a year so it should be made attractive for locums to work in rural and small urban practice.<\/p> <p> Community care teams have to be properly funded as these can take a good bit of pressure off local GPs, whether it is through the physio calling to a person's house or community care teams calling to dress a person's wound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200041#QQ00600","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486055700,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  At the outset I would like to assure the House that the Government is committed to enhancing primary health care services, including GP services.  The development of primary care is central to the Government&rsquo;s objective to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost-effective health service and to reduce the numbers coming into hospitals.  The goal is to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country and move away from a system which is too dependent on hospital care.  In a fully developed primary care system, 90% to 95% of people&rsquo;s day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  The winter period is one where particular pressures occur in the health service.  For this reason the Minister for Health ensured that considerable planning was undertaken by the HSE ahead of the peak period.  A sum of &euro;40 million was provided to assist in the management of winter pressures and to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care in an integrated way across primary, acute and social care.  As part of the winter initiative, South Tipperary General Hospital has been identified as one of the nine focus sites experiencing the greatest challenges in terms of ED pressures.  Consequently, under the initiative additional measures have been put in place to support the hospital in responding to surges in demand for emergency care over the busy winter period.  These include actions to improve early discharging; increase access to community intervention teams, CITs; and increase access to diagnostics.  The winter initiative has allowed for the provision of three additional home care packages per week at the hospital until the end of February 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The winter initiative also recognises that there are specific challenges in relation to capacity at the hospital.  The HSE is working towards providing extra surge capacity through the fit out of additional space on the first floor of the hospital to alleviate pressure on the ED.  This extra capacity is expected to be available from early May and could be used to accommodate space for up to 11 beds.  I acknowledge, on my behalf and that of the Minister for Health, the tremendous contribution of all the front-line staff to meeting the heavy demand on our health service during the peak winter period, both in our hospitals and in our communities.  The management by GPs of seasonal pressures, which include many patients presenting with exacerbations of chronic conditions, is an example of how primary care plays a critical role in our health care system.  In fact, our GPs were at work over the Christmas and New Year period dealing with a substantial workload while many other people were able to enjoy a few extra days off.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the commitment of GPs to ensuring a responsive, accessible and high quality service to patients on a year-round basis.  Recent data from the HSE indicate that in 2016 there was an increase of around 5% in emergency department attendances nationally.  In addition, early January 2017 saw continued significant pressure on our EDs due to high demand, increased incidence of flu and respiratory illnesses across the country, which have been disproportionately affecting at-risk groups such as the elderly, as well as ongoing bed capacity restraints due to staff shortages. <\/p>  <p>  GP out-of-hours services also experienced large volumes of patients in attendance.  I understand that the number of contacts with these services increased by 13% in December compared to the previous month.  In fact, there were over one million contacts with GP out-of-hours services in 2016, an 11% increase over 2015.  The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity and in 2017 the training intake will increase for the second successive year, from 172 to 187 places.  Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry and retirement provisions for GPs under the OMS scheme, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200042#RR00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1486055700,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Despite the Minister's reply, I do not believe the scarcity of GPs is being addressed.  We spoke about health services the other night and about giving people the option of being cared for in their own homes.  The preferred option of most people in their old age would be to be looked after in the security and comfort of their own home but if we do not have a proper GP service in rural Ireland that cannot happen.  I can give examples of seven different locations in my county which are now without a GP.  This is a career choice for young graduates coming out of medical school but it is not financially viable for them to go into practice.  A doctor who practised for 15 years in a rural town in Tipperary has decided to emigrate to Canada and it is obvious that there is something seriously wrong with the way GPs are funded by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The issue has to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  A lot of the infrastructure in rural Ireland is under huge pressure but if we lose our GP infrastructure it will be a death knell for people.  We just cannot do without it.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the pay structure but other things can be done to alleviate some of the pressure on GPs.  Paperwork is a huge burden and if a group of practices were given a project manager to look after the paperwork for them it would be a great help to them.  It has to be recognised that rural practitioners are different from practitioners in the large urban centres and have to be catered for accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200042#RR00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1486055700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>There has been an increase in home care packages.  I am a Dublin Deputy but I recognise that the GP service in rural Ireland is in crisis and needs to be supported in more ways.  The Deputy referred to emigration but a lot of young people, whether nurses or GPs, want to travel and experience other types of hospital care across the world.  It would be unfair to prevent young people from leaving the country once they had finished their training.  There was huge difficulty over Christmas, even in Dublin, over GP call-outs but there are commitments by this Government.  In respect of new GP contracts, the Minister is very clear that future contractual teams should enjoy the support of a broad community of GPs and be informed by the input of key stakeholders.<\/p><p>To achieve this the Minister has put in place a process that will honour the framework agreement of 2014 with the INMO and include formal consultations between the State and the NAGP.  The Minister is pleased that this arrangement has commenced and hopes for constructive and positive engagement.  Something is happening, therefore, but, unfortunately, it is probably not happening for many small rural communities.  We hope, however, that in the coming months there will be an increase in GP services across the country, particularly locum services.

The best way I can articulate this matter is by reading a letter I received last weekend from one mother.  She says:<\/p><blockquote>I am writing this letter as a very upset and concerned parent of a daughter who is attending the Kerry Parents and Friends Association in Listowel.  We were informed last week that they are reducing respite in north Kerry in our facility, The Haven.  There is little respite now as beds are being used for residential clients with high medical needs.  A house was purchased last June in the Kilmeany, Kilmorna, Listowel area for respite.  My understanding is that this is a four-bedroom house.  We expected this to be up and running within three months, as the urgency of lack of respite was already causing problems.  The house still remains empty and we are now heading into February.  Funding for staff was promised by the HSE but none has been released.  After a phone call to the head of the HSE disability services, we have been informed that there are no funds available, so the house remains empty.  Once again we are badly hung out to dry regarding our sons, daughters and siblings.  We have to join together now and let our voices of protest be heard once again.  We have done it before and we can do it again.  There are parents and clients at present who have never had respite.  We are all getting older and we should definitely not be having this worry now - too scared of getting sick or old.  We need to contact anyone and everyone we can - TDs, councillors, the HSE and Ministers - to tell them in no uncertain terms that we and our sons, daughters and siblings are entitled to respite.  It is not a luxury.<\/blockquote><p>I was also contacted by another woman and her husband.  He is 75 years old and she is 70.  They have a 46 year old son with autism and other intellectual disabilities.  He is over 6 ft tall and a big and powerful man.  Their difficulties are exacerbated because of their age and his physical strength.  They have no access to respite care services.  They are at their wits' end in trying to access some service.  I am asking the Minister of State to make staff available at the four-bedroom house in the Kilmeany, Kilmorna and Listowel area to provide respite care for four people at any one time.  Will he make this happen in order that some of those in desperate need will have some source of comfort?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200043#SS00300","speaker":"1317"},{"type":"speech","time":1486056300,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the position on services for people with disabilities who need respite care support in County Kerry.  I know that he has been a long-time, strong campaigner for people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  I am acutely aware of the changing needs of people with disabilities and understand many people require additional or alternative services.  The provision of respite care services has come under increased pressure in the past couple of years.  There is an increase in the number of children and adults seeking access to respite care, while there are increasing levels of changing needs owing to an increase in the age of people with a disability, as noted by the Deputy in the two cases he mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  The way in which residential respite care services are provided has also changed as agencies comply with HIQA standards and the national policy on congregated settings.  This affects the capacity of services in County Kerry to respond to the growing need for respite care.  In some instances this means that beds are no longer available.  For example, vacated beds for residents who go home at weekends or for holidays can no longer be used to provide respite care.  This is a major problem.  Currently, there are 12 beds available in County Kerry to provide respite care services for adults with an intellectual disability.  These beds are provided by St. John of God and the Kerry Parents and Friends Association.  On average, 426 nights of respite care are provided in County Kerry each month for children and adults with an intellectual disability or autism.  A further 52 days, on average, of day respite care are also provided each month.  The HSE acknowledges the current level of provision does not adequately meet the identified needs in the area.  I totally accept that reality, but we have to do something about it.<\/p>  <p>  The expansion of respite care services for people with disabilities is recognised as being essential to enable families to continue to care for individuals with disabilities and, in particular, those with significant disabilities.  The HSE supported the Kerry Parents and Friends Association in 2016 by providing capital funding to purchase a house in Listowel to be used as a respite care facility.  Unfortunately, no revenue funding is currently available to progress the opening of the facility.  By the way, I do not accept this.  The Kerry Parents and Friends Association recently reported that, owing to HIQA compliance requirements, it has had to reduce the number of respite beds available, leading to a decrease in respite care services for some.  The need for increased respite care and residential facilities in County Kerry is acknowledged.  The HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to meet this need in line with the budget available.  Where a residential service is not available, the HSE endeavours to work with families and service providers to increase the support available through the provision of home support hours and day services.  Of course, we have to act on and do something about this matter.  I will make it a priority issue in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200043#SS00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1486056300,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and welcome his comment that he intends to do something about the matter in the weeks ahead.  Can he tell me how many beds were closed by HIQA?  If the four bedrooms were available, would they meet the shortfall?  Will the savings made by HIQA in reducing bed numbers be used to provide a respite care service in the house purchased by the HSE?  The Minister of State needs to make this issue a priority, although I know that he also has to deal with priority matters raised by other Deputies concerning respite care services for parents and their children with intellectual disabilities.  The people to whom I am talking are coming to end of their lives.  As I said, one of them is 75 years old.  They have looked after their children and watched them grow into adulthood.  The respite care service they received was of some comfort to them.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The fact that it is no longer available is causing huge alarm and fear.

As far as I am aware, the figure he is looking for is between four and six beds.  His proposals on the funding, costs and savings are something we should look at clearly.  In the negotiations for this year's social care and disability service plan, the overall budget was set at &euro;1.688 billion, which is an increase of &euro;96.3 million or 6% on last year.  I am going to go back to the people involved in the distribution of funding.  Under that budget, we managed to secure 8,400 residential places, 182 respite overnights, 1.4 million PA hours for 2,400 people, 24,800 day places, 41,000 day respite sessions and &euro;2.7 million for home support hours for 7,500 people.  A service is there with a budget of &euro;16.2 million to deal with emergency cases and within that sum there is funding for the new home supports in home respite for emergency cases.  That is the approach I will be taking.<\/p>  <p>  We need to ensure that when we provide funding for a house like the one Deputy Ferris mentioned in Listowel, we have the resources to provide the service.  I will continue to pursue additional funds to increase the level of respite provision in Kerry.  The HSE will continue to work with the service providers to explore all options regarding the provision of respite for all the adults in Kerry.  Where residential respite is not available, the HSE and I will endeavour to work with those families and service providers to increase the support available through home support hours and day services.  Of course, I will go back and make Deputy Ferris's issue a priority.

It is one on which I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will agree with me.  There are three schools in the Curragh Military Camp.  The Curragh post-primary school is a Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board school with approximately 170 pupils and to say the school building is Dickensian would be a fair description.  It has great staff and pupils but they are operating in a building that has not been upgraded since the time the British were around.  Across the road is the Curragh girls' primary school with a little over 100 pupils.  Again, it is housed in a very old building with significant problems.  A summer works application is in for roof repairs, but since it was made problems have emerged with heating and plumbing in the school.  Down the road a little further but still within the camp is the Curragh boys' national school with 89 to 90 pupils.  That school has made another summer works application to address a long-standing problem with its plumbing which is causing significant problems.<\/p>  <p>  I called out to visit the principal of the Curragh boys' school last year.  It happened to be just after the Minister's predecessor had opened the Educate Together primary school in Kildare town.  Within the space of an hour and crossing the short distance from Kildare town to the Curragh Camp, I went from a brand new school with the best of provision for the children of Kildare town to a school with a bucket in the middle of the floor under a leaking roof.  I saw a very big difference between the haves and the have-nots.  It is incumbent on us to address the structural deficits in the three schools.  There is a common denominator here.  All the schools have great staff and pupils but an excellent education is being provided in sub-standard accommodation within the Curragh Camp, which is under the remit of the Department of Defence.<\/p>  <p>  I want the Department of Education and Skills to develop a vision for the future provision of education in this area.  I want the Department of Education and Skills to share my vision for a new school campus at primary and secondary level on a greenfield site in the Curragh.  I have had initial discussions with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and flagged with him the deficit that is there and the need for an upgrade.  This comes under his remit because there are ambitious plans for the Curragh Camp.  The peace and leadership institute will be a fantastic development in the coming years as a result of significant investment by the taxpayer via the Department of Defence in the Curragh Camp itself.  The freeing up of the three school buildings might well suit the Department of Defence and encourage it to offer us a greenfield site somewhere else.  It could be argued that it is not really appropriate to have school provision at the heart of a military camp.<\/p>  <p>  It would be much easier to talk to the Minister for Education and Skills and his officials about the provision of a new school building in this area if there was a greenfield site to start with.  As such, I ask him to help me with discussions and that his officials would engage directly with their counterparts in the Department of Defence to talk about these issues and see if a solution can be found.  To develop a primary and post-primary campus would address three schools that are currently in substandard accommodation and it would also address the very significant capacity issues for the greater Newbridge area, which I have raised with the Minister previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200044#TT00400","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1486056900,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin Heydon for raising this issue.  What he has stated there goes considerably beyond his originally tabled issue which was on the improvement of the school facilities in the Curragh area.  My reply, which deals with summer works programme approvals and applications, is available to him and is being circulated.  However, he has raised a much wider issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Department approaches a proposal like this from the perspective that the patrons are in a position to develop it.  No such proposal has been put forward by the patrons at this stage.  If an amalgamation of the primary schools was being considered, there would have to be considerable consultation.  In terms of the development of new schools, my Department is obliged to consider not only the individual school, conditions and enrolment in respect of which the application is made but also the broader context of schools in the area.  While recognising that the Deputy and Ceann Comhairle represent an area where there is considerable and growing pressure on schools, I have not seen a proposal from these schools and my Department has not had a chance to consider any such campus against the context of other provision and needs in the area.  As such, I am not in a position to respond in detail to what the Deputy puts forward.  Clearly, if there was a desire on the part of the patrons to put forward such a proposal, the Department would discuss it against the context of the planning model we have to apply.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the demand for new places is running at about 20,000 net additional places every year.  That is occupying more than 80% of our budget, which places a significant constraint on the Department in terms of considering any application.  It has to apply the slide rule to determine how we meet our first responsibilities to ensure there are seats for everyone who wants to attend school.  There is no doubt that if the Deputy feels there is an interest in the community in developing this proposal and that the capacity exists to do some sort of swap, I will get my officials to discuss it with the appropriate patrons and consider it in the context of other capital demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200044#TT00500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1486056900,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed response and for outlining a roadmap for us.<\/p><p>I can assure the Minister that all three boards of management are very keen to address the structural deficits.

I welcome his announcement last weekend of engagement between Kildare and Wicklow ETB and Educate Together on a possible partnership.  This comes after a very long campaign, as the Ceann Comhairle is aware, by the South Kildare Educate Together campaign.  The Minister's announcement did not refer to a specific school.  Locally, the ETB would have argued that St. Conleth's was the preferred option.  I ask that the Department maintain an open mind on a possible partnership as those discussions continue.<\/p> <p> The Educate Together campaign in south Kildare had a two-pronged approach.  It fought for increased provision of choice in the south Kildare area, which is needed and desired by a number of parents and constituents.  The second element concerned the pressure on space in Kildare, in particular the Newbridge area at second level where there is a lot of pressure in terms of capacity.  There are three schools listed on the building programme which require extensions, the Patrician Secondary School in Newbridge, Cross and Passion College in Kilcullen and at Athy Community College.  Spaces in those schools were needed yesterday.  There is significant pressure and I want the projects to be progressed as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> A new school building on the Curragh site would address some of the capacity issues in Newbridge town.  It would deal with all of the feeder schools in the rural hinterland.  In the overall context of the pressure on school spaces in south Kildare, a new school on the Curragh campus would fit.

She was accompanied by deputy commissioner Donal &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in and assistant commissioner Eugene Corcoran, assistant commissioner Jack Nolan, Joe Nugent, the chief administrative officer, and Gurchand Singh, head of the analysis service.<\/p><p>During the course of the evidence heard, it became evident that the legislative powers governing the oversight bodies needed to be strengthened to ensure more effective oversight and accountability.  Our report contains nine recommendations which are set out on pages 20 to 22.  The first three recommendations relate to GSOC.  The legislation underpinning GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, has been in operation for over ten years and the committee recommends that Part 4 of the Act should be amended and updated to facilitate GSOC in functioning more effectively and efficiently and recommends a number of reforms such as informal resolution, improved oversight of complaints referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, enhanced powers in regard to reviewing investigations and extending the power of GSOC to investigate former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>Recommendations 4 and 5 relate to the Policing Authority.  Recommendation 4 recommended that the regulations and commencement order to allow the Policing Authority to appoint persons to the senior ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be completed without further delay.  I understand that this provision came into operation as of 1 January this year, which I welcome, and I thank the T&aacute;naiste for acting on this important matter.<\/p><p>  Recommendation 5 is recommending that the statutory remit of the Policing Authority be expanded to include the following functions and responsibilities: supervise the function of the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s Office and the discharge of functions by the Commissioner; appoint, supervise and, where appropriate, discipline senior management within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; establish policies or procedures for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; cause to be published and made accessible to the public all sections of the Garda code and Garda operational policies and procedures; and review the adequacy and appropriateness of the policies and procedures which underpin the operation of an effective policing service.<\/p><p>Recommendation 6 is calling for the Garda Inspectorate to be given statutory power to make unannounced visits to Garda premises, as is the case in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p> Recommendations 7 and 8 relate to whistleblowers.  The committee acknowledges the importance of the role of whistleblowers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the important role they play in highlighting inappropriate actions or behaviour, helping improve accountability and enhancing the service provided.  In that regard the culture within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must develop and mature in order that the true benefit of whistleblowers who identify malpractice and-or wrongdoing is properly recognised and respected within the service.  Furthermore, sanctions should be introduced and applied to serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, up to and including demotion, where they are found to have interfered with and-or obstructed legitimate whistleblower claims and evidence.  In the most serious of cases, sanctions up to and including dismissal from the Garda service would apply.  I want to state very clearly that the committee members adopted this and the previous recommendations because they, individually and collectively, want to see emerging from this period of great uncertainty within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of great disquiet among the public a police service that will have the deserved confidence, respect and support of all citizens.<\/p> <p> The final recommendation relates to resources.  The committee is of the view that to ensure effective oversight and accountability of the policing service, it is imperative that all the bodies engaged in Garda oversight are adequately resourced to enable them to carry out their functions efficiently and effectively.  The determination of the required additional resourcing should be carried out in consultation with the respective bodies.  The committee is of the view that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report will result in significant strengthening of the oversight powers and thereby will help restore public confidence in the service which will benefit both the public and the serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> It is the earnest hope of the members of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality that all the recommendations are accepted and acted upon by the Minister.  I hope that she will reflect positively on the report and its recommendations and advise a timeframe for action.<\/p> <p> I thank the oversight bodies and the Garda Commissioner for the evidence they presented to the committee.  We were very appreciative of the time given by each of the delegations.  On behalf of the committee, I express to all concerned our gratitude.  I urge everyone to read this report in conjunction with the transcript which is available on the committee page of the Oireachtas website.  I commend the report to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200045#UU00400","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486058100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I welcome the report on Garda oversight and accountability, which is a critically important area.  The report was published by the joint committee.  It represents a significant contribution to the ongoing debate on policing in this country.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who chaired the committee, and the committee members for the production of the report in such a timely way.  It will make a contribution to reforms in this area.  I look forward to working with the committee and engaging with it on the various recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have overseen a significant programme of reform.  There are many different elements to it.  I have made it clear that the process of reform does not end and must continue.  It must be ongoing.  It is not all done at once, however, nor is it done overnight.  It needs to be an ongoing process and engagement about reform and these important issues of oversight and accountability.  Reform must be our watchword.  There is no question but that change is the order of the day at present.  However, it must be managed and carefully considered, which is what happened in the report.   Reform never stops and we must end bad practices wherever they occur, which is why oversight and accountability are so important.  They lessen the chances of that happening and, more important, of it continuing.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to take the opportunity afforded to me by this debate to inform the House that I intend to seek Government approval shortly to prepare heads of a Bill to amend Part 4 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which concerns the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to improve its operation.  This was recommended in the report.  I will return to this presently.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the programme of reform which I initiated, there have been very significant legislative changes related to policing in this country in recent years.  Any reasonable observer of these changes would acknowledge that.  When we consider the history of policing in the country, some of these changes have been quite dramatic and include the establishment of the Policing Authority, which is at an early stage of development.  Therefore, we must be careful in trying to evaluate the contribution of these changes before they have had enough time to make their full impact.  When we set up new organisations such as the Policing Authority, it is important to be aware that we have to give it time to settle in and develop its resources and staffing expertise, its programme of work and its strategy.  There has been an excellent start under a chairwoman who is doing an excellent job and board members who are totally committed to the work in hand.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated, it is very important that we restore and maintain confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a central part of our democracy, so it is critical the public has confidence in it.  Garda&iacute; put their lives on the line when they go out to do their work every day.  We have seen that some have paid the ultimate price while doing their job.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that it is important we show our appreciation for the work they do day in, day out, that is, the everyday work they do.  We have seen some excellent examples of operations in recent weeks that challenge and interrupt crime and bring criminals to justice.  There was Operation Hybrid and Operation Thor and there was a huge reduction in burglaries as a result of targeted policing in recent times.  This was very striking targeted policing that has really made a difference to the quality of life of our citizens.  As a Government, we have also dedicated huge resources in this regard.  I believe that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the organisations are entitled to take credit for those achievements.<\/p>  <p>  The report addresses a number of specific issues related to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself and those other bodies that have a role in oversight, accountability and reform.  I will say a few words on each aspect.  GSOC has a very important role in ensuring public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded.  It has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.  Significant changes were made to the powers of GSOC in the past two years, including making GSOC a dedicated body for receiving protected disclosures.<\/p><p> I am committed to ensuring that we have in place the most effective mechanism for the investigation of complaints.  I met the chairperson and other members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in early January in the context of considering what changes are necessary.  In her contribution to the joint committee's work and her meeting with me, the chairperson - and other members - called for changes to Part 4 of the 2005 Act which deals with the investigation of complaints in order, as she sees it, to allow GSOC to function more effectively.  The chairperson also referred to minor service issues, which are also addressed in the report, that she felt should be managed by Garda line management rather than GSOC.  I fully agree with her on this issue.  The chairperson also sought changes to the powers of GSOC to require the Garda authorities to provide it with information and documents in the context of investigations.<\/p> <p> Similarly, the joint committee report recommended, among other proposals, that service level issues be handled more efficiently; informal resolution, mediated by GSOC, be used more widely; and further measures to improve the timelines of conducting investigations be pursued.  Recent reports show improvements in these timelines and this has been acknowledged. <\/p> <p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has been operating for ten years now and it is time to examine fundamentally the legislative provisions relating to the manner in which complaints are made to and dealt with by GSOC.  Accordingly, I informed the chairperson that I propose to seek Government approval soon to prepare heads of a Bill to amend Part 4 to enable GSOC to carry out its functions more effectively and efficiently and help to continue to ensure proper accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in providing a service to the public.  I expect the forthcoming changes to mirror very closely the recommendations in the joint committee's report.  I must and will consult all relevant stakeholders during the preparation of the heads of a Bill.<\/p> <p> Resources and funding, which have been increasing, will continue to be kept under review to ensure these oversight bodies are enabled to continue to operate effectively and efficiently and in accordance with their statutory remit.<\/p> <p>The establishment of the Policing Authority has been one of the most significant and progressive reforms to the justice system in recent years.  The recent transfer to the authority of the appointment function for senior ranks is a particularly important signal of this reform and not one that should be underestimated given the history of this issue and the change it signifies.  There are suggestions that the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 are too limited and should provide for the full removal of the Government and Minister for Justice and Equality from any role In the area of policing.  I repeat the general point I made that some changes need further time to embed themselves.  We also have to be mindful too of the constitutional restrictions, as advised by the Attorney General when I was doing the legislation, on the extent to which it is open to the Government to delegate to another body important functions relating to the executive power of the State.  This matter was considered very carefully when I was doing the legislation.  The provisions in the Act are designed to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, the exercise by the Policing Authority of effective and meaningful oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, on the other hand, the retention by government of essential residual powers in regard to policing.  I accept fully that we need to monitor how these new arrangements are working.<\/p> <p> The Garda Inspectorate performs a very valuable service in seeking to ensure the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is maintained.  I know the joint committee also heard evidence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The modernisation and renewal programme 2016-21, published in June 2016, is the vehicle for the implementation of the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s wide range of recommendations aimed at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As Deputies will know - this is important - I have asked the Policing Authority to monitor implementation of these agreed recommendations.  This creates another level of oversight.  The Garda Inspectorate will make recommendations which the joint committee will examine from time to time.  I have also asked the Policing Authority to monitor their implementation and I will receive the first report in the coming days.<\/p> <p> I note the joint committee&rsquo;s recommendation on access by the Garda Inspectorate to Garda stations.  I agree with this recommendation and I would like to progress it.  It may be helpful to mention that we are considering what arrangements might be put in place for independent access to all places where people are detained in light of international developments in this area.  I note the joint committee's report points out that this is done in other countries and I do not see any reason it could not be done in the context described in the report.<\/p> <p> I note and accept fully the joint committee's reference to the important role played by whistleblowers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In 2016, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na published its protected disclosures policy and it has been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure whistleblowers are protected and supported.  As Members are aware, in June I asked the Policing Authority to examine and report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with protected disclosures and make any relevant recommendations.  The revision of the protected disclosures policy was finalised on 13 December 2016 and the revised document was published to the Garda internal portal on 14 December 2018.  This is an area which is being kept under independent review by the Policing Authority.  These matters have been the subject of public engagement between the authority and the Garda Commissioner and her team.<\/p> <p> A new code of ethics has been prepared by the Policing Authority.  People have spoken about a code of ethics for a long time and its launch two weeks ago is an important milestone.  I also welcome the commitments in the policing plan to embed this code into the day to day thinking and actions of the organisation.  The code is an impressive document to read and I want every new recruit in Templemore, from which several hundred garda&iacute; graduated today, to know, understand and implement this extremely important code of ethics.<\/p> <p> In the area of protected disclosures, it may be helpful to mention that I have received a report from Mr. Justice larfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill relating to two protected disclosures I received in October last year.  While I am still consulting the Attorney General on a number of complex issues which arise, I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to government in the very near future.<\/p> <p> I hope it is clear from what I have said that the Government and I are committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to provide a modern, efficient and accountable policing service.  The new structures which have been put in place are a significant contribution to that.  As I stated, reform is ongoing.  I welcome the report and I have given my initial reaction to a number of the recommendations it makes and the progress I intend to make on them.  I thank the chairperson and members of the joint committee for their report, which provided a valuable input into the discussions I had and will no doubt have in future.  It will also help in progressing some the changes I have outlined to the House.<\/p> <p> It is very important that we continue to work together to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is as accountable and effective as possible.  The considerable resources the Government has committed to the Garda in recent years have resulted in the reopening of Templemore, the recruitment of new garda&iacute; and more civilians to a force that will have 21,000 people, new vehicles and more information technology resources.  All this will contribute to efficiency and accountability.<\/p> <p> I thank the joint committee for its report.  The recommendations cover the activities of the Garda, GSOC, the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate.  Each of these bodies has its own functions and objectives.  I have tried to be as comprehensive as possible in the time provided and to give as clear an indication as I can at this stage as to how I view the recommendations in the report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200046#VV00200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486058700,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who played a very proactive role in compiling this report.  I also thank the other members of the joint committee for their input and welcome those who are present.  The report was primarily based on engagements the committee had with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority.<\/p><p>These discussions and engagements were invaluable in gaining a better understanding of the existing oversight and procedures within and outside the operation of the country's police force.  There are many strengths and weaknesses currently being practised and the report addresses these in good measure.<\/p> <p> The report and its recommendations should be considered in the current environment of the ongoing efforts to reform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na following a number of recent controversies.  I was pleased to hear contributors stress that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is first and foremost a police service and its primary objective is to serve and assist the people of this State.  It is of fundamental importance that the focus of the Garda charter is on communities and community interaction.  Public confidence in upholding the law of our country and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's role in developing proper public confidence will be critical into the future in the context of what has happened in recent months and years.<\/p> <p> The report is intended to ensure there are robust oversight structures and mechanisms in place which will ultimately help garda&iacute; to carry out their duties in an effective way and ensure they are receiving the necessary supports to do so.  However, ink on a page alone will not achieve this.  The onus is now on the Minister to ensure these recommendations are implemented.  It will be to the detriment of the hard working men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if this is just another report left to gather dust.  The shelves of Government Buildings are already groaning under the weight of inaction.  I sincerely hope this report will not end up on a shelf.<\/p> <p> The meetings with the four agencies were beneficial, although I concede I am still unclear in some areas, including where one agency&rsquo;s remit ends and the next one begins.  There seems to me be a crossover and some grey areas.  Some of the recommendations aim to remedy this.  I was surprised to learn from my own meetings with the Policing Authority on the issue of its engagement.  In my view, it should be critical engagement.  There should be greater separation between the Policing Authority and senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In saying that, I am not personalising anyone within or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Policing Authority.  A proper oversight mechanism must be such that the auditor or anyone who provides oversight does not have a collaborative, constructive input into the making of a policing plan.  In my view, its role should be to analyse and engage critically on policing plans and then to bring those plans to senior management who will then bring them to the policing authority.  It was mentioned that the issue in this regard is one of time and efficiency.  In my view, it would be better if the Policing Authority had a greater degree of separation and oversight competencies such that it does not involve itself in the act of making a police plan because were it to be the scribe of a plan it would be difficult for it to provide adequate oversight of it.<\/p> <p> Many of the recommendations are aimed at freeing up resources.  We learned that one in five complaints dealt with by GSOC are minor in nature and could be more effectively dealt with in-house by Garda line management.  It is also recommended that mediation be more widely used, where appropriate, to resolve disputes quickly.  I welcome the Minister's statement in regard to the additional powers to be provided by way of amendment of Part 4 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  I hope this can be progressed expeditiously through the House.  As a committee we were all agreed on the need to for GSOC to be empowered and resourced to play its role as set out in the legislative framework.<\/p> <p> The provisions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act in regard to appointments within the service need to be commenced to allow the Policing Authority to appoint Garda to senior rank.  I know this matter is also being progressed.  Promoting young officers who have shown promise in their fields is crucial to maintaining high policing standards.  This is especially true in the current climate of retirement of many senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> I also welcome the recommendations relating to whistleblowers, which were suggested by members across the committee, including my party colleague, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan who will be in the House later to speak on this issue.  In all organisations and institutions, transparency is paramount and whistleblowers play an important role in this regard.  Garda&iacute; should feel confident to raise matters of concern and such practice plays an invaluable role in improving accountability and enhancing services to the public.  Officers who raise concerns should be supported, not inhibited, by management and colleagues.  It should be a matter of pride for a garda to know that he or she and his or her colleagues are doing their best to serve the people.<\/p> <p> During the hearings, I raised important issues around helping garda&iacute; on a day-to-day basis as they tackle ruthless criminals who are well-resourced and use the latest technologies to evade the Garda.  The need for modern technologies was also recognised by the Garda Inspectorate during its appearance before the committee.  Garda&iacute; have had many recent successes in combatting criminals and their empires.  It is no coincidence this has come about because extra resources and personnel have been deployed in sophisticated, intelligence-led operations.  The recent high profile drugs seizures and arrests in relation to the ongoing feud in Dublin are to be commended.  However, further success is dependent on garda&iacute; remaining one step ahead of these subversives.  The most up to date technologies need to be made available.  I would like to see greater roll-out of automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, technology.  I do not believe this is being as progressed as quickly as it should be, although I acknowledge that allocations in this regard have increased.  We are way behind a number of countries, including the UK, in relation to ANPR technology.  This must be to the fore in tackling many issues.  As I said, this technology and the roll-out of other IT infrastructure will greatly assist the Garda in their investigations.  I have previously raised that issue with the T&aacute;naiste.  In addition, there is no reason why garda&iacute; should not be utilising real time information on their mobile phones.  Specialist units, focussing on the rapidly developing world of cyber-crime, also need to be set up.<\/p> <p> I again call on the T&aacute;naiste to ensure that officers have the necessary resources to continue to keep our streets safe.  Additional budgetary allocations should not be a once-off response to the ongoing feuds in Dublin and elsewhere but a continual funding model to tackle serious crime.  Other important measures going forward include the hiring of civilians with appropriate skillsets to allow increased visibility of Garda on the streets and enhancing the role of community policing teams.  Unfortunately, owing to years of cuts and disregard the morale amongst many garda&iacute; is now very low.  Most worryingly, young garda&iacute; appear to be among the most disenchanted.  These are the officers who should be the most excited and invigorated in their work.  We all have a lot of work to do to rectify this and I hope adoption of this report will go a way towards this goal.<\/p> <p> I thank the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for his work in relation to this report.  The committee has an exciting work programme this year.  I look forward to hearing the contributions to this debate of other members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200047#WW00200","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486059300,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is probably tiring of being complimented and told how wonderful he is.

It is pretty much commonsense that that should be allowed because any notice in respect of a visit allows for preparation for it.  It does not make any sense for someone in an inspectorate capacity to have to give notice of a visit.<\/p><p>I would like to address a couple of the recommendations.  One of the recommendations states:<\/p><blockquote>Enhanced powers for GSOC in relation to reviewing investigations.  In unsupervised investigations, a complainant has a right to have GSOC review the investigation.  However, the outcome stands.<\/blockquote><p>That certainly needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>Just how the Minister will do that will be interesting.  One can introduce rules and regulations until the cows come home but they must be implemented.  Will there be sanctions if there is non-compliance?  In light of how the Garda relates to GSOC, there is much speculation on how it will relate to the Policing Authority and Garda Inspectorate.<\/p> <p> It goes without saying that we are still raising many issues that we find unsatisfactory in respect of how things are done but, being an optimist, I am of the view that change is coming, albeit very slowly.  I acknowledge it is not easy to implement change.<\/p> <p> In 2012, Deputy Clare Daly and I put a lot of time into examining how we do policing in Ireland.  That is when the first whistleblowers came to us.  There definitely has been some change in the past four and a half years, but probably not as much as we would like.  When the former Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and the former Minister, Mr. Alan Shatter, departed the scene before mid-2014, we felt there would be serious change.  There was a lot of talk about change.  There was some but not nearly enough.  I will address a few points in this regard in a minute.  We have been raising many issues in respect of the new Commissioner.  Obviously, from our perspective circumstances are far from what they should be.<\/p> <p> Sadly, serious change is still to be made in the organisation.  A huge cultural change is required.  To achieve this, there will be a need for a change to the hierarchy in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When Northern Ireland considered replacing the RUC with a new organisation, which became the PSNI, Mr. Patten was adamant that the desired change would not occur until the authorities got rid of the hierarchy.  They literally did so.  They more or less paid off the staff in the top sections, moved on and created a new field of players at the top.  That will have to happen here also.<\/p> <p> In 2013 and 2014, we introduced policing Bills.  In 2013, our recommendations were laughed out of this House.  In 2014, our Bill was allowed to pass through the House but it did not get any further.  Looking back at this matter today, I picked out a few points.  Our Bill at the time proposed to set up an independent policing board similar to that of Northern Ireland in its powers and level of independence from Government interference.  The Bill provided that the new policing board would appoint and remove the Garda Commissioner and deputy and assistant commissioners following consultation with the Minister, and that it would appoint superintendents and chief superintendents in consultation with the Minister.  The Government's Policing Authority Bill, however, left the appointment of the Commissioner and deputy commissioner in the hands of the Government and allowed the authority the power to nominate in accordance with the recommendations of the Public Appointments Service, which provides us with one name only.  That Bill also allowed that the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would determine the number of appointments to assistant commissioner, chief superintendent and superintendent levels, but that the authority could may make these appointments subject to a selection competition.  This left the system under the 2006 and 2014 regulations intact such that the selections are by the promotions advisory council and board, controlled by the Commissioner and Minister and which choose candidates for the authority to rubber-stamp.  We are of the opinion that the Policing Authority needs to be made more independent of the Government.  We still believe we need to further the depoliticisation of our policing service if we are to have the sort of service we would love to have.<\/p> <p> Like Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring when she appeared before the committee, I believe GSOC is not yet in any way fit for purpose, as it should be.  The Minister has agreed to make some changes.  Every recommendation in the committee's report should be considered strongly.  I acknowledge the Minister will implement some of them.  When the Garda Inspectorate produced 200 recommendations approximately two years ago, the Commissioner said she would take some of them on board.  She did but it is a pity she is not compelled to take all of them on board.<\/p> <p> The Minister said she would publish the O'Neill report in the very near future.  Could she confirm that she will publish it before the end of this month?  What are her plans in this regard?<\/p> <p> We can bring in various measures and make things better, which is good.  Circumstances are improving.  It is important to note that the people now expect a different police service.  That places extra pressure on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to consider how it operates.  If we are really to have the police service we want, it is imperative to have cultural change.  We need a change to and a clean sweep of the existing hierarchy in order to bring about that cultural change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200048#XX00400","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486059900,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Like everyone else, I thank the industrious Chairman of our committee who has us here again on a Thursday evening.

In some ways, it is not accidental that this is the topic we chose first because it is of enormous interest to society and the Garda.  We have all been educated over recent years and I will not repeat the points on the committee's recommendations except to say we regard them all as a package.  This report is not just aspirational, containing ideas we have circulated for the craic; these are serious observations, made in part on the basis of the engagement we had with the oversight bodies and the Commissioner and her team and in part from our experience over recent times.  In that context, I welcome the fact that the Minister will take on board some of the committee's recommendations.  That is a very welcome development.  Without in any way being churlish, I believe it is an awful pity some of the recommendations were not taken on board previously.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It is a matter of record that many of the recommendations contained in the report and the Minister's Bill were made by us a number of years ago during the debate on the first GSOC and Policing Authority Bills.  I am not saying this to score points, but people have suffered as a result of some of these provisions not being available during the two years since the most recent GSOC Bill was implemented.<\/p> <p> GSOC has been unable to do the job expected of it as a Garda oversight body.  When we first heard of or came into contact with it, we knew that many members of the public who had approached it believed - they still do - that it was a part of the conspiracy and was only there to whitewash the Garda's activities, not uphold complaints.  They believed this because of the low follow-up levels.  Perhaps we also believed this at first, but it has not been our experience.  Our engagement with GSOC in recent years has led us to believe that it has capable personnel within its ranks, but that they must work within deficient structures.  While they have a desire to hold the Garda to account and investigate complaints, the Oireachtas has not given them sufficient legislation to do so.  That is what the committee is asking the Minister to do.  Legislation is necessary if GSOC is to do the job that it is supposed to do.  It also needs the ability and, importantly, the resources to fill vacancies when they arise.<\/p> <p> We must be realistic about why the concept of oversight has gained popular currency and is being talked about by the dogs on the street.  There is just one reason, that being, the heroic stance of a number of Garda whistleblowers who shed a light on an insular blue wall of silence, an organisation in which, contrary to what the Commissioner says, dissent was deemed to be disloyalty and punished accordingly.  The order of the day was rats, death threats and serious intimidation of people who tried to do the right thing.<\/p> <p> The public perception of what a whistleblower is has been stood on its head.  Now, being a whistleblower is identified as a position to be lauded, and one that makes a valuable contribution to improving the situation for all garda&iacute; and members of society.  There are many good garda&iacute; and, for some time, they have believed that the situation will change.  They stepped forward accordingly to join the ranks of the whistleblowers and improve matters.<\/p> <p> We have engaged with ten serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have made protected disclosures of one sort or another.  Under a change in the previous legislation, GSOC is now the confidential recipient and the vehicle through which garda&iacute; make complaints.  That service needs to be beefed up radically because GSOC does not have the time or resources to provide it adequately.  It does not have the legislative power to compel Garda co-operation that it needs.  Many cases have stalled because of delays in the Garda handing over material that GSOC needs to conduct its investigations.  This non-co-operation continues today.  It can be covered up as administrative delays and so on, but it impacts on the work being done.  A number of the whistleblower cases in question are in the public domain, but others whose cases are with GSOC - in the instance of Keith Harrison, for more than two years - have had relatively limited meaningful engagement with GSOC because of delays with documentation and so on.  In Nicky Keogh's case, the GSOC investigation has practically concluded and disciplinary recommendations have been made, but the Garda has not agreed to GSOC's involvement.<\/p> <p> These serious matters are ongoing.  One must ask, if the situation is improving, why all these garda&iacute; bar one are out sick.  All have made allegations about bullying and harassment since coming forward, which is in direct contrast with the public statements of the Commissioner that she does not know of any harassment.  We know that she has been directly informed of that harassment, as has the Minister.  Most recently, serious allegations were made, and were widely covered in the provincial media, during an assault case after Christmas.  In open court, evidence was produced of doctored witness statements.  The people involved in the assault were also involved in a case in which a garda had been accused of involvement in the drug trade and so on.  Criminal prosecutions are being impacted.<\/p> <p> The situation cannot be right if so many people are out sick.  The case of the only garda who made a protected disclosure but who is not out sick is appalling.  It involves a family law case.  He received information to the effect that the judge, who was a family friend of his former wife, had held a meeting before the court case and then granted a protection order against him.  He then made a complaint to the Garda.  Not only was his complaint not investigated, but the senior garda involved initiated criminal proceedings against him for interfering with the judicial process when the circumstances clearly did not meet the criteria.  That person, albeit a member of the Garda, was a victim, only to be revictimised by what the senior garda did.  To add insult to injury for him and a number of other Garda whistleblowers, the very man who did that was brought by the Commissioner to attend our committee's hearings into oversight as a witness for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Confidence among serving members is not developed if this type of behaviour is happening.<\/p> <p> The Minister will see from the committee's recommendations that we want the Policing Authority to have more control over the Commissioner.  This is not a new idea.  The authority needs to be beefed up.  This relates to the Minister's remarks about the O'Neill report.  It is not acceptable that she has had that report since October.  It is now February.  It is not a large report and is pretty straightforward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200049#YY00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486060500,"counter":417,"content":"<p>December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200050#ZZ00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1486060500,"counter":418,"content":"<p>The process was initiated in October and Mr. Justice O'Neill was supposed to have concluded it quickly.

The report is a comprehensive document that provides an outline of the Garda oversight mechanisms currently in place, with the committee hearings functioning to review these powers and identify how they could be strengthened to make oversight more effective.  The committee engaged in extensive questioning of GSOC, the Policing Authority, the Garda through the Commissioner and the Garda Inspectorate.<\/p>  <p>  On the face of it, we have an extensive oversight structure, with GSOC investigating matters of alleged misconduct by garda&iacute;, public complaints and matters referred to it by the Policing Authority or the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda Inspectorate has inspection powers over the operation and administration of the Garda and advises the Minister and the Policing Authority on best practice.  The Policing Authority has oversight of the Garda's performance.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 was a landmark law, but it came after what was arguably the greatest scandal ever faced by the Garda.  The Morris tribunal identified gross misconduct and corruption within one Garda division.<\/p><p>It is unfortunate that the reforms to oversight in this jurisdiction have been driven by intermittent crises of confidence in the work the Garda is doing.  We must take this report now and strive to do better, not because of a national scandal but because we want the police service to be human rights compliant.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that reforms have been made to at least introduce a theoretical model allowing for the independent investigation of complaints, but there is clearly a problem concerning the level of public confidence in how complaints are handled, and there is often a lack of transparency.  The members of GSOC are appointed on the nomination of the Government.  However, the practice is that it is the Minister who chooses and there are no independent applications, interviews or competition.  The European Human Rights Commissioner has stated that is not fully compliant with human rights based practice which stipulates that the ombudsman should be accountable to the legislative assembly.<\/p> <p> As far back as 2013 when GSOC was under the spotlight regarding a failure to investigate certain complaints expeditiously, it resulted in the submission of a special report to the then Minister for Justice and Equality on its public interest investigation of Garda compliance with informant handling procedures.  The report was at pains to outline the commission's dependence on Garda information and the barriers that existed to it in accessing the information.  Accessing such information was necessary for the organisation to be able to fulfil a core function effectively.  The report explicitly stated that it \"reflected a serious weakness in the independent investigation of complaints\", leading to questions being raised over the oversight investigative function of GSOC.  That was reiterated in a subsequent report that same year.<\/p> <p> One of the difficulties regarding complaints procedures is that they are often not as independent as they need to be.  Research conducted in this and other jurisdictions has suggested that the habit of garda&iacute; investigating garda&iacute; leads to a lack of public confidence.  While the policing skills of the Garda are valued and the experience of members should not be disregarded, they can often be prone to viewing a matter through the eyes of another garda as opposed to a complainant member of the public, and even where they are absolutely professional and do not engage in that practice, there is the risk that they appear to be biased.  That is relevant at the grassroots level of the Garda as one of the committee recommendations is that the minor complaints should be investigated through standard Garda line management rather than soaking up GSOC resources.  Clearly, there is merit to this idea.  However, careful attention must be paid to how that would be implemented in order that people who have legitimate grievances can have faith that the senior garda to whom they complain will investigate the matter effectively.<\/p> <p> The Garda in general is well respected by the public.  One only has to examine the esteem in which people in rural areas hold their local stations to see that.  However, that connection with the public does not automatically equate to accountability to the public, and as this committee report outlines, there is much more to be done in this regard.  Policing structures throughout Ireland can only benefit from maximum openness, accountability and oversight.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to working within the existing structures of accountability and oversight throughout Ireland, to strengthening accountability structures where they do not work properly, and to creating new structures where they do not yet exist.<\/p> <p> It was important that the committee report referred to the Patten commission report and the Good Friday Agreement.  It was, and remains, our view that the model of oversight that emerged from Patten, namely, an independent civilian management board, independent community policing partnerships operating at district level and an independent ombudsman to handle complaints, offers the greatest potential for ensuring policing is non-partisan, that it can be held to account in the event of wrongdoing, and that its primary focus is on policing within the community.<\/p> <p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is not actually independent.  It is almost entirely dependent on the Garda to conduct its investigations for it.  A number of key staff are seconded from the Garda, others were transferred directly from the old Garda Complaints Board or simply retired from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take up a position immediately in the ombudsman commission.  Complainants' reported experience has involved huge delays in responding to and progressing complaints, failure to return calls, failure to keep complainants updated on the progress of investigations, despite express commitments to do so, and a failure to provide reasons for decisions.  Some but not all of that can be explained by resource issues.<\/p> <p> All of the above significantly undermine any semblance of transparency or openness in the complaints process, making confidence in the current system impossible.  The report found that there is a lack of proper oversight and accountability in formal disciplinary investigations.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that only by achieving high standards of discipline based on honesty, integrity and transparency will a police service earn the confidence and support of the community.  Without that confidence and support, all other aspects of policing are undermined.  An effective system for disciplinary proceedings for misconduct when necessary and prosecutions for criminal behaviour where warranted are therefore an essential complement to the oversight mechanisms outlined.  That is necessary for enforcing human rights compliance and ethical conduct standards.<\/p> <p> The analysis of complaints, discipline and civil actions against the police provides important information for monitoring the PSNI's and the Garda's compliance with human rights and equality legislation and the European Convention on Human Rights in particular.  Both the number and content of such complaints are an effective measure of the relationship between the police and the community and the efficacy of police policy and practice.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that less serious complaints, involving rude conduct or unprofessionalism, for example, should be resolved informally but, as stated previously, work needs to be done to ensure public faith in the process.  Further, given that the Garda disciplinary regulations date back to 2007, it is clear they should be reviewed and updated where necessary.<\/p> <p> During every discussion concerning Garda oversight and the Garda Inspectorate, the issue of not being able to carry out unannounced visits to Garda stations has arisen.  That should be rectified as a matter of urgency and it should be noted that this report refers to a previous committee report that stated any protocol requiring advance notice of inspections should be removed by amending the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act of 2005.<\/p> <p> There is no barrier to doing so, bar the lack of political will to carry that out.  That is just one legislative measure that is needed.  We welcome the recommendations in the report stating that GSOC should be given enhanced powers in reviewing investigations and that measures must be taken to provide a penalty for failure by the Garda to deliver reports back to GSOC, as well as allowing GSOC a statutory framework in which it can report back to the Garda on systemic issues it may need to rectify.  I urge the Minister to bring forward the inspection of places of detention Bill, which is on the legislative programme, to enable the ratification of the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  It is accepted that different jurisdictions will be at different junctures in a process of developing police accountability and human rights compliance, and demands have been made from political representatives, activist groups and non-governmental organisations, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which has said that we should look to the Six Counties in reducing the democratic deficit of police accountability.  Regrettably, the Garda still cannot be held fully to account under the existing structures of accountability in the Twenty-six Counties.  The gap between oversight structures North and South should be removed as a matter of urgency.  The Nl Criminal Justice lnspectorate has been in place since 2002 and the matter should not be delayed any further.  We welcome the report and its recommendations and look forward to the robust discussions that will take place during their implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200050#ZZ00400","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486061100,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Approximately 50% of my time as spokesperson for justice and equality is devoted to issues concerning An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is not surprising when one considers that it is a force of up to 13,000 members who interact with members of the public every day.  One of the downsides of discussing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this House is that we only really get to focus on issues affecting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when things go wrong.  One of my first debates as justice and equality spokesperson was in respect of the O'Higgins report that highlighted a number of failings within the Cavan-Monaghan division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it correctly received much discussion in here and publicity in the media.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important, however, to acknowledge the good work An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does every day of the week.  One could say that is just a platitude and we are not here to discuss that, but in recent times An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had considerable successes in terms of the investigations it does.  The guilt or innocence of any individuals who are subjected to a Garda investigation is a matter for the courts, but what is apparent in recent times is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has achieved considerable success.  On behalf of myself and Fianna F&aacute;il I commend and congratulate the Garda on those recent successes.  It deserves to be commended in respect of them.  When garda&iacute; make mistakes, overstep the mark or engage in wrongdoing, it is important that this House discusses and refers to that.<\/p><p>Similarly, when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does excellent work, it is important to refer to it.<\/p> <p> I also refer to the work of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality chaired by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  The process we went through last year for the purpose of appraising and evaluating the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was an excellent piece of work.  Representatives of GSOC, the Policing Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate appeared before the committee, as did the Garda Commissioner and her senior officers.  It was an excellent example of how the democratic process and the representative body that is the Houses of the Oireachtas keep an overview of the statutory bodies we create.  Sometimes laws are passed and statutory bodies created and we wave good-bye and have no more to do with them.  It is essential that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality continues to review the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to see how the system can be improved on a ongoing basis.  I commend the Chairman and members of the committee.  The process that took place was very useful.  It did not involve interaction with any Government Ministers but it was an illustration of how the Oireachtas can fulfil its very important functions pursuant to its oversight role.<\/p> <p> When one looks at the committee's report, one will see that it has produced many recommendations relating to the specific statutory bodies established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 that are responsible for Garda oversight.  GSOC appeared before the committee.  I welcome its chairman, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, and other persons from GSOC to the Public Gallery.  GSOC plays a vital role in Garda oversight.  As Fianna F&aacute;il justice spokesperson, I am frequently contacted by people who complain that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not provide them with a good service.  Sometimes they claim that there was Garda wrongdoing.  As a politician, I cannot assess that.  I can listen to them and give them advice but it is essential that we have a statutory body that is responsible for investigating allegations of Garda wrongdoing.  We have the correct statutory system in place by having GSOC there to do it.  I am concerned that sometimes when complaints are made to GSOC, and serious ones have been made regarding members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it can take a very long time for those reports to be completed.  I refer, in particular, to the report into a complaint made by Lucia O'Farrell about the death of her son.  I suspect the reason it takes so long is a question of resources.  If we are serious about these statutory bodies fulfilling an important oversight role, it is important that they are properly resourced so that they can carry out their functions.  Without the necessary resourcing, we are doing them a disservice.<\/p> <p> The statutory body with the most opportunity for development and the most potential is the Policing Authority, which is chaired by Josephine Feehily.  She came before the committee and gave a very good presentation in terms of the functions of the authority.  It is a body that is just starting out.  I welcome the fact that the authority now has responsibility for senior appointments and promotions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This can bring about a very significant change in the manner of promotion within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will be an important oversight mechanism in terms of how garda&iacute; will be promoted, what competitions will be run, whether people from lower levels can jump one or two levels to be promoted if they show excellence and whether we are prepared to allow recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through some graduate promotion at higher levels rather than by means of the traditional route through Templemore.  This would require the intervention of the Minister and Oireachtas but it is something on which I will be interested in seeing the Policing Authority work.<\/p> <p> The third relevant body the committee spoke to was the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which produces reports on how the force can be more efficient and effective.  It was a matter of some concern to me when somebody mentioned recently that the inspectorate's website used to have a display of its recommendations and information on whether they had been implemented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand this has now been taken down.  It is extremely important that if the inspectorate is to make recommendations that will have the effect of improving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we ensure that they are followed up.  There is no point in bodies making recommendations and everybody being satisfied with them but there being no review process to appraise whether the relevant changes have been implemented.  If we are serious about changing the force for the better, we need to ensure the inspectorate's recommendations are properly implemented and we need to be able to see what ones have not been implemented.<\/p> <p> The fourth body that came before the committee was An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself.  I know that one of GSOC's recommendations, which I support, was that some minor complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be handled within the force.  They could be complaints about discourtesy or a Garda not being particularly polite to an individual.  People are perfectly entitled to make those complaints but we are clogging up GSOC by requiring it to investigate what I would refer to as minor complaints.  They are matters that should be dealt with by the employer, which is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> The Garda Commissioner came before the committee and discussed the changes that are taking place at senior level in the force.  This is something we must keep under constant review.  We sometimes we allow personalities to take the place of the important priorities.  We need to ensure that Garda reform continues at a pace.  It is important, as Deputy Louise O'Reilly mentioned, that we recognise that the Irish public has faith in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This does not mean that when a complaint is made or where we have serious concerns as to potential wrongdoing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we turn a blind eye.  We would be doing the public a disservice if we did so.  However, it is important to recognise that we, as legislators, have a duty to apprise the public that this House has confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but that there are mechanisms in place to ensure that any wrongdoing by the force is identified and that we can improve its operations by means of the inspectorate and the Policing Authority.<\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste indicated that she proposes to amend Part 4 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act to enable GSOC to carry out its functions more effectively and efficiently and to help continue to ensure the proper accountability of the force in providing a service to the public.  In doing so, I hope and presume she will take on board the recommendations in the committee's report.  The Committee on Justice and Equality is the first committee of which I have been a member, and it could be the last, but it represents what is best in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  People leave their party affiliations outside and work together.  I commend all the members of the committee, particularly the Chairman, who is very efficient, thorough and always on time and who has produced a series of reports.  The last time I spoke about one of these reports which came before the D&aacute;il, I praised the fact that the committee was heading the stakes in terms of the number of reports produced.  I think we are now up to four.  I will wait to see other committees come in here to introduce their reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200051#AAA00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486061700,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I have wanted to say few words about this issue for a long time.  I congratulate the Chairman, members and secretariat of the committee for compiling the report, which they obviously took very seriously, as is indicated by the result.   Garda&iacute; have a right to be proud of their force and to take pride in their job, responsibilities and the public trust in them in anticipation of the latter's confidence being well founded.  Over a period, a number of incidents throughout the country raised certain questions.  There were countless debates inside and outside this House and a number of court cases took place.  One thing that became obvious was that a gradual chipping away erodes public confidence in any system.  This took place, as we in this House all know from observing events.  It was unfortunate that this happened but a number of issues that were raised chipped away at that public confidence.  As a result, garda&iacute; are now said to have low morale, low confidence and low self-esteem.<\/p><p>That is not good.  It is now incumbent on everybody - us, as public representatives, garda&iacute;, management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister - to recognise the importance and seriousness of ensuring issues that cause concern to the general public which are raised time and again are investigated thoroughly to the satisfaction of the justice system.  That is without pillorying or victimising anybody or in any way dumbing down the organisation or individuals in it but to be sure to be sure we all have confidence in the system and the investigative procedures in order that we can relax in the clear knowledge that whatever is required of the Garda will be done impartially and in accordance with best practice.<\/p> <p> I understand how garda&iacute; feel from time to time when they receive criticism which is sometimes unjustified.  They will say they are on the front line and they are in facing criminals and everything that could be thrown in their direction.  Very often they are treated with contempt by some members of the general public, which can be very demoralising.  They raise the same questions repeatedly, yet nobody says, \"Apart from that, you are doing a great job,\" because we tend to pick out the issues that irritate us and look at where things go wrong.  Every aspect of our society has been tried and tested in the past 20 years or so and all have been found wanting in one way or another.  There is no aspect of our society that has not been checked and tested in the courts by way of investigation or inquiry in the past 20 years and the reason is different standards are now expected.  There are different standards of transparency and accountability which did not apply many years ago, notwithstanding the fact that all those years ago garda&iacute; had to stand up and put their lives at risk on a daily basis in carrying out their jobs.  Some of them paid the ultimate price.  In the course of this debate, therefore, we need to acknowledge the things that have happened and recognise the sacrifices made by the individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all ranks and their families in the job they took on in very challenging circumstances.<\/p> <p> I want to comment on the new procedures.  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste and previous Ministers on introducing GSOC, the Garda Inspectorate, the system of investigation and the new Policing Authority, all of which should serve to underline the importance of having public confidence in the system.  When in difficulty, following a robbery or something more serious, a member of the public will ring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the first point of contact, but the telephone is not always answered.  That is a fatal flaw.  I know that there may be a difficulty with resources, but there should be no difficulty in ensuring the telephone is answered.  That is the first time a member of the public who very often is vulnerable gets to measure his or her confidence in the system which he or she expects to protect him or her.  We need to be certain that issue is addressed, but it is not always addressed and I am being as kind as I can in the circumstances.  The Ceann Comhairle knows what I am talking about.<\/p> <p> Within every big organisation there are victims and there are people who victimise others.  There are people who bully others and there are people who have done the same thing for years and got away with it.  I will not go into too much detail.  Suffice it to say I recognise the importance of the whistleblower and the role he or she can and must take in current circumstances.  That person should not be abused either, but there could be a tendency to do so.  There is management or there is not and a whistleblower is not a manager but somebody who says something has gone wrong and needs to be addressed.  Such matters need to be investigated and put right.  However, it should not follow that the whistleblower should take on himself or herself executive powers because that is not his or her function but of somebody else in the pecking order.  I emphasise this because we all have had experience of working with big organisations and people know what I am talking about.<\/p> <p> In the context of the report, we should recognise the huge complementary work done by the Garda during the years.  We should also recognise the challenges facing it and the growing demands which will only increase those challenges further.  We should recognise that modern policing methods will help to make its job easier.  Harking back to what happened in the past under the old system and how workable it was is a waste of time and energy.  The Garda needs to adopt modern policing methods in concert with all other police forces throughout Europe and across the globe.  We have to recognise that members of the general public can often point to various people who have committed horrendous crimes over a period of time and apparently walk away.  There is that perception among the public.  In many cases the Garda has pursued such persons endlessly and still seems to be thwarted and frustrated by the fact that somewhere along the line they seem to receive bail, get off with a warning, a suspended sentence or whatever the case may be.  I am not making reference to any particular case, but we all know what I am talking about.  We also need to address these issues because they are part of the delivery of the system.  In the final analysis, members of the public expect the Garda to serve and protect them.  It is the Garda's job to do this impartially, fairly and without fear or favour.  When we get to that stage - we are on the way - we will have done a great job and justice to the system and need for accountability and transparency.  We will also have done ourselves justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200052#BBB00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486062300,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank all Members for their contributions to what has been a very balanced debate.

I thank them publicly for their work and leadership.<\/p>  <p>  As everyone has agreed, oversight and accountability are extremely important.  Equally, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have to be allowed to get on with the task of meeting the daily challenges in their work, as Deputy Bernard J. Durkan, in particular, emphasised.  We have to acknowledge the challenges and demands posed by that work.  As any objective person would conclude, at this point there is considerable oversight.  There is the Garda Inspectorate, GSOC and the Policing Authority.  Of course, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has its own disciplinary measures and there is the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  It is important to have an appropriate balance.  We have to have the right bodies in place.  As a number of Deputies said, we have to be absolutely sure the recommendations they make and the changes to which they point are implemented.  We will need to spend a considerable amount of time examining the issue of implementation.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality will undoubtedly also be doing this.  Clearly, change within these organisations and the legislative changes we can make are an important aspect.  Following my most recent meeting with GSOC, I highlighted that it was time for a review.  It will be a ten-year review which will, of course, be informed very considerably by the work of the committee.  I intend to go to the Government very shortly to get permission to produce the heads of legislation in that regard, on which I have no doubt we will have detailed discussions.<\/p><p> I want to make a general point about oversight bodies, and I saw this in the work of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, when I was Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The relationships that are formed between, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and these bodies will go through different stages.  To take the example of the Policing Authority, the relationship between the two bodies is at a very early stage and we have to give it time to bed down and to see where it goes in the future.  The point I am making is that these relationships are developmental, and they need to be developmental.  We must assess and monitor them and, as I said, reform is an essential part of that.  It would be surprising if we did not talk about changes and developments in the legislation, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was suggesting, in the report with regard to the various bodies.<\/p> <p> Suffice it to say that I fully endorse what people are saying with regard to transparency, accountability and oversight.  We have come from a period some time ago where that was not the case.  Undoubtedly, we have seen poor practice and the need for change.  The more transparency and accountability that comes into the system, the better the service the public will get and the more satisfying it will be to be a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Quite a number of members have emphasised the need for cultural change, and management have to lead that cultural change.  It is challenging, but I know from dealing with management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it has a huge amount of experience.  With regard to talk of a clean sweep, I believe cultural change is necessary but we must also recognise the level of experience and the contribution that has been made by so many people.  That is not to sweep anything under the carpet or to say that change is not needed but we should take a balanced approach to this.  We are all very aware that if one operates in a climate of constant criticism and undermining, it can be very hard to do one's job and the citizens of this country need the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be out there delivering effective services.  Quite a number of Deputies spoke about the regard with which the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are held but it is clear that changes are necessary.  We have seen examples of poor practice in reports we have discussed in this House in very recent years, so there is work to be done.  I believe that is recognised by all.<\/p> <p> I thank the bodies involved in oversight and accountability.  They do an incredibly important job.  There is very good leadership in each of them.  At the same time, we will examine if there are things we as legislators should do to ensure that they can do their job more effectively.  That certainly will be in the interest of citizens as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200053#CCC00200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486062900,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I could not see our visitors, who must be in the Gallery behind me, but I would like to join with colleagues in welcoming Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, the commissioner, Mr. Mark Toland, and colleagues who I understand may be with them here this evening.<\/p>  <p>  I would again like to record my thanks to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality for attending and engaging with us in this debate this evening.  I want to thank all the members of the committee and the other colleagues who are not members but who took the time to join us over the course of these couple of hours.  I note the Minister's welcome for the report at the outset of her contribution and I agree that reform is an ongoing process but I would add that there is a body of steps that can and should be taken now, and I hope she would recognise that many of those are contained in this report.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's confirmation that she had a specific meeting in this regard last month with the chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and I am happy to note that the Minister is shortly to go to Cabinet to secure approval to prepare heads of a Bill to amend Part 4 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act of 2005 in line, she advises, and I note with some encouragement, with the recommendations contained in the joint committee's report.  I noted from the Minister's contribution that the changes will mirror closely the recommendations in the committee's report.  That indication is welcome and hopefully will be realised in the not too distant future when all of us will have the chance to again address these matters in the course of the progress of the facilitating legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the recent transfer of the senior Garda appointments function to the Policing Authority.  It came into effect as of the first day of last month.  I again urge the Minister's acceptance that oversight and accountability, in real supervisory terms, and especially of the higher ranks, should be vested in the Policing Authority.  That it is a relatively new body is not an acceptable excuse for not giving the authority the responsibilities and powers it needs to be the force for change it can and must be and, I emphasise, the guarantor of a police service into the future that has, as I stated earlier, the deserved confidence, respect and support of all citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Unannounced visits to Garda stations and related functional areas is a necessary reform in the context of the role of the Garda Inspectorate.  I urge that this provision is introduced as soon as possible.  It should be noted that the inspectorate does not expect to employ this power on a regular let alone a continuous basis.  It is a power that would be employed on an occasional or reserve basis, and it should be provided for.<\/p>  <p>  I emphasise the importance of a change in the sadly all too evident skewed view of the actions and intentions of whistleblowers from within Garda ranks.  It is imperative that this cultural change is not only encouraged and promoted but insisted on with, I state again, penalties applying where there is a failure to respect or worse the actions of a colleague who reports or brings to public attention wrongdoing or inappropriate behaviour by members of the Garda service.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referenced that resourcing and funding will continue to be kept under review.  It is fine to have a watchful eye on resourcing and funding but the oversight bodies need to be recognised as the critical bodies to ensure the achievement of the goals we have all declared we wish to see achieved in regard to policing in this jurisdiction.  In consultation with the respective bodies, resourcing and funding should be increased and, in line with any additional roles and responsibilities provided either by legislation or regulation, as the case might be, there should be a commensurate increase in resourcing and funding to ensure that the bodies entrusted with these roles and responsibilities are able to function, and I repeat the words, efficiently and effectively and as we would all hope that they will.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude by thanking whatever process it is that allows for the selection of a committee's report.  This is the second such bite of the cherry we have had from the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, and I very much welcome it.  I also add, with some humility, that I believe we also deserved it.  That is a tribute in return to my colleagues who are no longer in the Chamber, and I thank them for their kind words in the course of their contributions.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on these matters in the coming period of time.  I wish the exercise she has indicated a fair wind.  I extend very best wishes to each of the three bodies, GSOC, the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate.  I hope the exercise in which they were very important participants will prove rewarding and worthwhile to them in their roles in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020200054#DDD00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1486062900,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Am I to take it that the report is agreed?
