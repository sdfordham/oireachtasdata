On the basis that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, was a State body operating with a commercial mandate, the audit of the authority's financial statements was carried out by a commercial auditing firm up to and including 2009.  The first financial audit of the authority by my office was carried out for the financial year ending 31 December 2010.  In that context, the special report before the committee was prepared to give a full account of the overall financial position of the authority and significant events that had contributed to its difficulties.<\/p><p>  The authority's financial statements for 2010 reported a deficit of almost &euro;2 million for the year.  At the end of 2010, the authority had current liabilities of &euro;32 million, including a bank overdraft of &euro;12 million.  Its capacity to fund itself depended on the continuing availability of banking facilities until such time as it could liquidate its property assets and collect its debts.  Because it had limited cash reserves, any failure to realise projected income or any requirement to advance the timing of payment liabilities would have required the identification of other sources of funding.<\/p><p>  The authority reported a surplus of just over &euro;1 million for 2011 and had liabilities at year end of more than &euro;26 million.  The audit of the financial statements for 2012 has not yet commenced because draft financial statements have not been provided.  <\/p><p>  A key factor contributing to the authority's strained financial position was its participation in a joint venture with private developers to buy and develop the Irish Glass Bottle site.  In October 2006 the authority and its partners in a joint venture company, Becbay Limited, agreed to bid &euro;412 million for the Irish Glass Bottle site in Poolbeg.  Other related expenses brought the total acquisition cost to &euro;431 million, of which &euro;291 million was borrowed.  The authority provided equity and loan funding for the joint venture company and guaranteed the repayment of loans by Becbay Limited which were initially provided by the then Anglo Irish Bank.  Subsequently, Becbay Limited's loans, which I understand by then were in excess of &euro;345 million, were taken over by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  A settlement was agreed between the authority and NAMA in 2011 under which the authority agreed to transfer to NAMA a portfolio of property assets to settle sums due under the guarantee.  Ultimately, the cost to the authority of its involvement in the Irish Glass Bottle site purchase was around &euro;52 million.<\/p><p>  The examination noted a number of concerns regarding the authority's decision to become involved in the Becbay Limited venture.  In October 2006 the authority's management presented to the executive board an assessment of the level of investment, benefits and risks of the project, but there is no evidence that a detailed analysis of these factors, commensurate with the scale of the proposed investment, was carried out.  Management advised the board that the property market was overheated, but it nevertheless recommended the investment for strategic reasons.<\/p><p>  The authority did not obtain its own independent valuation when it was deciding on the bid that Becbay Limited should make for the site.  After the bid had been lodged, Becbay Limited engaged professional valuers who confirmed, for bank borrowing purposes, that the value of the site as at 3 November 2006 was &euro;412 million - the exact amount of the bid.  The authority had to seek ministerial approval to increase its borrowing capacity up to the statutory limit of &euro;127 million and engage in the joint venture.  The information submitted to support the application stated the value of the site was approximately &euro;220 million.  It appears that the authority did not update the Department when it decided to bid almost double that amount.  Consequently, consent by both the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for increased borrowing and the authority's participation in the joint venture was evidently given on the understanding an investment to the value of approximately &euro;220 million was being contemplated.<\/p><p>  The critical factor in the Departments' assessment of the application for approval of increased borrowing and participation in the joint venture was the authority's capacity to service the borrowing involved.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government received assurance from the authority that it had the capacity to service the borrowing without recourse to Exchequer resources.  The audit found no evidence of a formal analysis by the Department in that regard, or any testing of the sensitivity of the authority's servicing capacity to different outturns for the joint venture.  The Department has stated it would have undertaken a full assessment if Exchequer funds had been sought.<\/p><p>  In the course of the examination my office reviewed the management by the executive board of conflicts of interest around the decision to invest in the joint venture.  Clearly, there is a risk of conflicts of interest occurring in any situation where boards of State bodies include persons either with an interest in a business that is regulated by the body, or which provides services for the body.  In the case of the decision to purchase the Irish Glass Bottle site, some board members disclosed their connections as directors of banks that were providing project finance and these were handled as provided for in the authority's code of practice.  The executive board minutes do not record disclosure of any other personal, professional or business interests of board members that could represent a conflict of interest in relation to the decision to acquire the Irish Glass Bottle site.<\/p><p>  The examination looked at the response of the authority to the findings of the High Court in October 2008 in a case taken against the authority regarding a section 25 application, which is a form of planning permission.  In response to the case the authority amended its section 25 application process in December 2008.  Owing to the substantial reduction in the number and scale of planning applications received by the authority since the conclusion of the High Court case, there was limited scope for my office to examine the effectiveness of the revised procedures in the course of this examination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013050200004#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1367485800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am very grateful for the opportunity to make a statement and relate the facts from my point of view in regard to the IGB site.  I was the assistant secretary in the planning division of the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government from June 2000 to October 2007.  I was appointed by the Minister to be a director on the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority for the same period.  I had no executive functions as a member of the board.<\/p><p>  The authority had been established under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997 to secure the social and economic regeneration of the Dublin docklands area on a sustainable basis and had the power to acquire, hold and manage land for these purposes.  The authority was self-financing with a commercial mandate.<\/p><p>  In early October 2006, the executive of the authority recommended to the board that the authority should get involved with a development partner in the development of the IGB site to achieve its statutory objectives for the social and economic development of the whole docklands area and the objectives in the authority's 2003 masterplan.<\/p><p>  The Poolbeg peninsula area was clearly underdeveloped.  The authority had previous experience that where it owned land, it was better able to influence the delivery of the less commercial land uses such as social infrastructure.  The authority's Grand Canal Dock development was seen as very successful.  I believed that acquisition of an interest in the IGB site fitted in with this policy and, therefore, was an appropriate objective for the authority and in line with the objective of the masterplan.<\/p><p>  The CEO of the authority wrote to me in my capacity as assistant secretary on 2 October and 12 October seeking ministerial approval under the 1997 Act to borrow up to the statutory limit of &euro;127 million and approval under the code of practice for the governance for State bodies to participate in a joint venture to acquire the IGB site.  I referred the correspondence to the business section to consider the applications and consult the authority and the Department of Finance.  <\/p><p>  The Department wrote to the Department of Finance seeking the consent of the Minister for Finance.  On 19 October 2006, the Department made a submission seeking the Minister's approval for the authority to incur borrowings up to the statutory limit provided for under the 1997 Act and purchase shares in a joint venture company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013050200006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Moylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367487600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Thank you Ms Moylan.

The Secretary General was correct in her opening remarks when she said it is impossible to get a full picture until some of the key stakeholders appear before us.<\/p><p>  To counter that, Ms Moylan has given evidence to this committee which was frank and honest but she highlighted that she herself was a key stakeholder.

I apologise if there is any repetition but I am not clear on some points, and they all originate from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The first one is the conclusion in section 3 on the case for investment.  It states:<blockquote>The Executive advised the Board of the Authority that the joint venture bid for the Irish Glass Bottle site would be made in an over-heated commercial property market.

I would refer to it as being &quot;pulled together&quot; and it is offered in that vein.<\/p><p>  As Ms Moylan stated, a clear decision was made at the 24 October board meeting to limit the authority's liability to &euro;29 million in shareholders' loans and equity, plus &euro;7 million in recourse finance, totalling &euro;36 million.  On 9 November and as Ms Moylan indicated, the banks raised the issue of a further guarantee of borrowings by the shareholders.  In effect, the banks were seeking shareholder guarantees to cover &euro;100 million of the debt financing.  As a 26% shareholder, the authority would have taken on &euro;26 million of the overall guarantee.  The intention was to cover that amount, plus a <i>pro rata <\/i>share of interest for a period of two years, and that the total liability should not exceed &euro;35 million.  This was in the shareholders' agreement between the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, Donatex Limited and Mempal Limited as the three shareholders.  The actual guarantee into which the authority entered with the bank provided for a &euro;26 million capital guarantee and a guarantee on 26% of the interest, but there does not seem to have been a reference to the overall &euro;35 million cap on liability, as there had been in the shareholders' agreement.  Obviously, the bank was not a party to the shareholders' agreement and was not bound by it.  The conclusion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report seems to outline how the exposure increased before ultimately settling on foot of the engagement with NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013050200021#U02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1367496000,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The authority did not honour its agreement with the shareholders when entering into the agreement with the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013050200021#U02200","speaker":"1034","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367496600,"counter":435,"content":"<p>No, what I am saying is that the shareholder's agreement that was entered into between the DDDA and the other two shareholders seemed to have greater protection built into it than the guarantee entered into between the authority and the bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013050200022#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1367496600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Did the DDDA have representatives on the board?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013050200022#V00300","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367496600,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013050200022#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1367496600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I have spent more than enough time on the point.

I will open by providing an overview of the way in which marine issues are being handled at present across the Government.  Some time ago, in recognition of the need for co-ordination and integration among Departments with an interest in marine issues, the Government established a high level marine co-ordination group.  It is chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and includes representation from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Representatives from the Marine Institute also attend.  Under the auspices of the group, the integrated marine plan for Ireland, Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, was developed.  Its vision is to ensure that the oceans contribute to economic recovery while generating benefits for citizens and this vision is underpinned by three high-level goals, namely, a thriving maritime economy, healthy ecosystems and engagement with the sea.<\/p><p>  The aforementioned plan recognises that managing the seas requires a national marine spatial plan, which should be underpinned by effective planning and licensing frameworks.  To this end, the group established what we refer to as the enablers' task force on marine spatial planning.  It is regarded as a key action of the Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth plan and the group's terms of reference include the consideration of emerging European Union policy in this space, the need for legislative change that may be required to support a national marine spatial planning framework, international best practice in the area and consideration of a national spatial planning capacity and responsibility for data co-ordination and exchange.  This task force is carrying out its work programme at present and is due to conclude and report to the marine co-ordination group in September.  In this regard, the publication of the draft directive is timely as it will give the group an opportunity to consider both initial member state views and institutional views of maritime spatial planning across the European Union, which it will then consider in the context of its wider work programme.<\/p><p>  I should clarify that four Departments are represented here today and pending the outcome of the enablers' task force on consideration of marine spatial planning for Ireland, no lead Department has been identified as yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013050200004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1367483700,"counter":510,"content":"<p>For clarity, the Commission proposal COM (2013) 133 was sent from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for its consideration.

The proposal itself aims to establish a common framework for marine spatial planning and integrated coastal management among the member states with a view to ensuring the growth of marine and coastal activities, as well as the use of resources at sea and on coasts, remain sustainable.  Marine spatial planning is a process based on stakeholder involvement.  It analyses and plans best use of the seas and where and when human activity should take place.  Integrated coastal management is a separate tool that is used to co-ordinate all policy processes affecting the coastal zone.  It addresses land-sea interaction in a co-ordinated way, again with a view to ensuring sustainable development and use of those resources.  The Commission perceives maritime spatial planning or marine spatial planning and integrated coastal management to be complementary tools, which, when applied jointly, can improve the land-sea interface planning and management.<\/p><p>  As for the national position, as I mentioned discussions are at a preliminary stage.  There have been a small number of working group meetings at official level in Brussels but as I have outlined, from the work that is going on nationally under the Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth plan, it is clear that Ireland supports the concept of marine spatial planning.  Ireland currently holds the Presidency of the European Council and given this role, which continues for a further two months, as matters stand we are obliged to maintain a neutral position on the discussions.  However, suffice it to say the directive is regarded as a framework proposal.  Its objectives are operational in nature and ultimately, if adopted, I expect the outcome would be that member states would be required to develop and implement marine spatial planning across the European seas to ensure sustainable management of the coastal areas and to ensure cross-border co-operation in areas of mutual concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013050200004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1367483700,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Does Mr. John Quinlan have anything to add?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013050200004#D00500","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367483700,"counter":513,"content":"<p>No, my colleague, Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue has covered the general issues on behalf of all of us and we have nothing further to add.

We operate two sawmills in Ireland, in Fermoy and Longford, and two sawmills in Scotland.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for inviting the Irish Timber Council to discuss the implications of the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights.  The Irish Timber Council was founded in 1918 primarily to represent the sawmill industry in Ireland.  Today, we represent 2,500 people working in ten sawmills throughout the country.  I would like to outline our key concerns for the sawmill industry and the threats that it faces as a result of the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights.  The Irish Timber Council is completely opposed to the sale.  We will also discuss a number of guarantees we are calling on the Government to put in place in order to protect the security of sawmill operators should the sale proceed.  However, these safeguards should only be seen as a last resort.<\/p><p>  The forestry and forest products sector generates &euro;2.2 billion annually, or 1.3% of the country's GDP.  The forestry sector is a vital employer, with 12,000 people working in the sector.  Timber is one of our most valuable indigenous natural resources and in 2011 alone we exported forest products worth &euro;308 million.  Forestry is also part of our heritage, as is obvious from the 18 million visits made annually to the Coillte estate.  Ireland has a strong history associated with timber and we need to guarantee future supplies.<\/p><p>  The Irish sawmill sector converts logs into products predominately aimed at the construction sector but also for the pallet and packaging market and fencing sectors.  Our residues - bark, sawdust and wood chip - supply the horticulture, energy and board mill sectors.  The sawmill sector provides much needed employment for 2,500 people, practically all in rural areas where job prospects are otherwise extremely limited.  In 2011, sawmills in the Republic of Ireland exported sawn timber to the value of &euro;83 million.  In recent years the sector has invested over &euro;200 million in creating a modern, efficient and customer focused industry.  It is the main supplier to the board mills and the energy sector.<\/p><p>  We commissioned a report with EPS consulting to examine the impact of the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights on the sawmill sector.  We have supplied a copy of this report to the committee.  The report underlines our members' concerns and sets out reasons for not proceeding with the sale.  The Irish Timber Council is opposed to the sale for several reasons.  The net realisable value from the sale of harvest rights will be so small as to be completely disproportionate to the negative impact on the sawmill sector.  The ten sawmills that comprise the Irish Timber Council have purchased 100% of the logs produced by Coillte since the formation of that company and, indeed, the Forest and Wildlife Service before that.  As this accounts for 80% of our raw material supply, we are almost entirely dependent on Coillte's harvested output.  There is no viable alternative supply source.  Naturally, therefore, the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights is a significant concern for the council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013050200006#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Glennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367485200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>We will take a group of questions and our guests may arrange among themselves how they answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013050200007#G00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1367485200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation which has made a powerful presentation.  The unusual feature of the proposal to sell Coillte's harvesting rights is that I have not heard anyone, other than members of the Government, speak in favour of it.  I hope the indications given this week that the Government is rethinking its proposal are correct.  The Irish Timber Council has outlined succinctly, from the perspective of the sawmills, the reason this proposal is wrong.  It would be useful for the joint committee if our guests were to outline how the industry managed to overcome the downturn without any significant loss of jobs in the sawmill sector.  I understand that at one stage 70% of the output of the major mills went into the domestic market and that this figures has now reversed and with 70% of output being exported.  This means the sector has shifted from a position in which a small proportion of finished saw logs were being exported to one in which the vast majority of output is being exported.  Will the delegation briefly outline how the industry managed to achieve this turnaround during a rapid collapse in the housing market?  This development illustrates the resilience of the industry in Ireland and its capacity to survive an utter disaster, particularly as the downturn was so connected to construction.<\/p><p>  I ask the delegation to elaborate on the effect of the proposal on employment.  Where is employment in the sector located?  One of the major challenges we face is to protect rural jobs.  Different figures were provided on direct employees and ancillary employment for harvesters and so forth.  How many of those employed in the sector live in rural areas or within 20 or 30 miles of the forests they harvest or the mills that employ them? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013050200007#G00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367485800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their presentation.  I wish to place on record the fact that my party completely supports their position.  For many years we have taken a consistent approach in respect of the exploitation of Coillte harvesting rights for the benefit of the Irish people and those in the industry.  The debate relating to this matter has been ongoing since it was first proposed that we should sell off the harvesting rights to Coillte lands in order to try to deal with the current economic crisis.  Sinn F&eacute;in and others have been consistent in their opposition to such a sale.  We are of the view that it is an extremely amateurish and negative way of allowing a national capital asset to be exploited by outside investors to the detriment of the Irish people and of producers and timber merchants such as our guests.<\/p><p>  It was stated earlier that our guests are responsible for 2,500 direct jobs.  What is the knock-on effect of those jobs?  I am sure said effect is quite considerable, particularly in the context of the spending power created in the areas in which people are employed and the benefit this brings to local economies.<\/p><p>  We understand the Government may be having second thoughts about proceeding with the initial proposal relating to this matter.  We would like it to state definitively that it will not be selling off the harvesting rights to Coillte forests.  The arguments put forward by our guests are valid and I completely concur with and support them.  I am of the view that those from the Government parties who are present at this meeting should indicate their wholehearted support for our guests' position.  Obviously, however, the members to whom I refer will speak for themselves when others have completed their contributions.  It is imperative that we should retain the harvesting rights and protect Coillte, the sawmilling industry and the jobs of Irish people.<\/p><p>  Our guests also referred to the rate of growth of trees in this country as compared with the position elsewhere in Europe and highlighted the opportunities for further investment in this regard.  Will they elaborate further on that matter?  Obviously they are referring to the planting of other areas and so forth.  In many parts of the country where there is marginal land, the people who own it and who are struggling to survive could become involved in forestry.  This would benefit the individuals to whom I refer and the communities in which they live.  Such a development would also have a knock-on effect in terms of the amount of product being sold to the sawmills, etc.<\/p><p>  I again thank our guests for their presentation.  As stated, they have the wholehearted support of my party, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v also indicated the support of his party.

As we face into dealing with the challenges posed by climate change, Coillte and the forestry for which it is responsible have a massive part to play not only in the context of the production of raw timber but also in respect of the provision of alternative, carbon-neutral sources of heating for homes throughout the country.  Coillte's role in this regard is vital.<\/p><p>  I am in complete agreement with everything contained in our guests' presentation.  The only difficulty I have with it is with the inclusion of safeguards.

It is important that certainty be brought to the issue soon.<\/p><p>  I welcome the delegation, particularly Mr. Patrick Murray, who is from my part of the country.  When I had cause to visit the Murray Timber Group I was impressed with the facilities.  I had not visited a saw mill for many years, although the one in question was not far from me.  Amazingly, a piece of timber that arrives in the yard is not handled until it exits on the other side.  This is due to the technology and number of people involved.  The timber business is important for areas such as Ballon, County Carlow, and others that have been mentioned.  It creates employment in rural areas where there are no alternatives.  It is essential that the sector be maintained.  The issue boils down to how much money can be derived from the sale.  It makes no economic sense to sell the harvesting rights.  It will not generate the amount planned and will provide no benefits.<\/p><p>  The Government has requested a significant investment in SmartPly in the south east.  Have the delegates an opinion on how such an investment would affect their businesses?  According to the presentation, businesses are already paying Coillte a premium price of 29% compared with the English equivalent.  This is a significant amount.  Why is it so high?  Can it be pared back?<\/p><p>  The Opposition parties do not have a monopoly on this issue.

If so, how did Coillte get on the list of State resources to be considered for privatisation?  When the Government came to power, a list was drawn up of what was going to be flogged.  Coillte was on the list commissioned by the Minister for Finance of the previous Government.  I come from County Clare, the third most afforested county in Ireland in terms of the size of its estate and the proportion of the county that is afforested.  I would have many concerns about the impact of the sale of harvesting rights.  However, the <i>status quo<\/i> is not good either.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to Coillte's remit as a national forestry board, but Coillte does not perform that function as matters stand.  Forestry's social and economic dividends in Clare do not reflect Coillte's supposed function.  There is no requirement to provide a social dividend to communities in which there are forestries.<\/p><p>  I appreciate the importance of harvesting, but does any witness have a long-term supply contract with Coillte, that is, one of more than ten years?  If so, do those set a particular price?  Companies in my hometown and throughout Ireland would operate tomorrow morning if they received a security of supply guarantee from Coillte.  Not only will Coillte not provide security of supply, but it will not agree to supply at a particular price over ten years.  Who would invest in any sector if there was no security of supply or price?<\/p><p>  I share the concerns of witnesses and am opposed to the privatisation of Coillte.  I would also be concerned by any proposal on the sale of forestry rights.  That said, I do not support the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The State forestry sector is not properly managed.  There is no evidence of proper management where I live, which is on the edge of one of the country's largest plantations.

If one puts land into afforestation, one takes it out of what is available for Food Harvest 2020.  Is there not a contradiction about the future direction of the country?

I am utterly opposed to the sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte, which is not just, as has been explained, a hugely valuable economic asset but a priceless cultural asset.

We had a big demonstration against the proposal at the weekend in Avondale.  As soon as people know that it is being considered, they are utterly appalled.  Do the witnesses take heart from the comments of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, on foot of the campaign of the Irish Timber Council and IMPACT and the big protest at the weekend that the Government has moved from a commitment to sell our harvesting rights to saying it is unlikely or it is being considered?

Some of it, as hinted at in the previous comment, suggests that it is being used to justify the move towards privatisation.  Even under the previous Government, the McCarthy report referred to the possible disposal of Coillte.<\/p><p>  To my mind there are problems with Coillte but they would be made significantly worse if the company were privatised.  The issue is about reforming Coillte not selling it.  Could someone comment on the problems?<\/p><p>  I wish to inquire about the sustainability of current forest strategy.  The Bacon report suggested that we need to plant approximately 20,000 ha per year to have a sustainable forest strategy while we have only planted approximately 5,000 ha.  How do the witnesses think we can improve the situation?<\/p><p>  Concerns have also been expressed about monoculture and the overdependence on citrus spruce rather than diversifying forestry towards hardwoods.  Do contractors need assistance, first, to move towards a more diversified forest strategy and do sawmillers and contractors need assistance from the State to shift away from a dependence on citrus spruce?<\/p><p>  Could the witnesses comment on the 2010 report in which Irish forest contractors painted a very bleak picture of Irish forestry?  They said the industry was utterly doomed because of over-harvesting and under-planting.  It was suggested to me by one of the forestry NGOs that the level of harvesting was 1.5 million tonnes, whereas the optimum amount of harvesting to maintain a sustainable forest strategy should only be approximately 1 million tonnes, and that if we keep going in that direction we are going towards deforestation which would ultimately be bad for the sawmill sector.  Someone might correct me if I am wrong.  I would welcome a comment on what I have said and what the witnesses think is behind the sale of 40,000 ha of Coillte land in recent years, even before full-scale privatisation was considered?

This industry is not looking for a hand-out.  We have come through one of the toughest recessions the world has ever seen and we are still here.  Any industry that is still functioning despite the fact that its market has gone from 90,000 units to 8,000 units, its energy costs have increased by 70% in two years and its transport costs have increased by 35% in two years is an industry worth holding on to.  In a country with over 400,000 people unemployed, I would encourage the Government to protect and grow this industry.  I wish to make it clear that we are not looking for hand outs.  Ours is a vibrant, tough industry that is able to compete.  However, we do not want to go into the boxing ring with one hand tied behind our back.  <\/p><p>  There are 2,500 people employed in the industry at present.  Page 5 of the report we prepared and circulated to committee members outlines the employment potential in the industry in the future.  Every 15,000 hectares planted will generate another 490 jobs directly and every 100 jobs in a saw mill will generate another 70 full-time jobs in other sectors of the economy.  A steady supply of raw material from Irish forests could generate another 7,000 jobs by 2025.  All of those jobs would be in rural areas, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v pointed out.  On average, the typical haulier would live within a 50 km to 60 km radius of the saw mill being supplied, although that can change depending on where the logs come up for sale.<\/p><p>  There is quite a good recreational link between Coillte and walking groups, including Mountaineering Ireland and others.

Forestry is a totally sustainable industry where trees can be grown, felled and replanted.  Going forward, with all of the new carbon-reduction demands for new houses, wood is the preferred product.  In terms of climate change and carbon sequestration, there is no other product on this planet that actually absorbs carbon dioxide, stores it when it is cut and continues to store it when it is used for a building.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013050200011#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Glennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367488200,"counter":565,"content":"<p>With regard to the proposed investment in smartply, if harvesting rights are sold, will a contract be given to the two board mills for supply?

Luckily, there is a successful McHale farm machinery plant in Ballinrobe but, apart from that, one could travel in a 30-mile radius to Galway without passing another factory giving the kind of employment we do.  Most of the workers are from the local community, and this type of rural employment is replicated across the industry.  The contractors employed by us would typically come from a fairly close distance to the sawmill.  These people work in forestry in rural parts of the country, and they may stay in local bed and breakfasts and support local shops.  Their work feeds into the rural communities.<\/p><p>  There are spin-off companies from a typical sawmill.  We operate in an estate with two other companies.  One deals in the sale of timber products and the other utilises bark and residue from our process.  It is mulched for garden products, etc., and the company has up to 15 people working on the process.  The number of people employed in such spin-off companies exemplifies the multiplier effect, and one can see it in the employment of engineers and maintenance personnel.  It is a multiple of the 2,500 people employed by the main industry.<\/p><p>  Five years ago construction industry activity fell off a cliff and at that stage our industry exported approximately 15% to 20% of output.

Our company currently has 80% of output going across to the UK.  We achieved this in a two-pronged fashion.  We had major capital investment and in our company we invested over &euro;7 million in the past five years, without any subsidy coming from the State.  The second element came from workers, and to get to get to the stage where 80% of output was going abroad, our staff had to be very versatile.

At the end of the day, it will be the consumer who will pay for this.  I agree with the comments on land sales.  Bottlehill landfill, which is close to where I live, is a &euro;50 million white elephant.  The land was sold by Coillte to the county council for &euro;15 million.

The common thread in this regard is the age profile of the farmer.  Farmers who have good land are no longer leasing it but are getting involved in planting.  We will be faced with a huge issue in terms of Harvest 2020 if we do not take account of land being used for forestry.  While I am a great supporter of forestry, it is increasing for all the wrong reasons.  We need to be careful and to monitor this closely.

The witnesses and others outlined some of the problems.  Whatever difficulties there are, they will be made worse if we sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte.  The point I am trying to get at is that some of the underperformance of Coillte is related to the fact that it has been preparing for privatisation for some time and has had a commercial focus which is not necessarily at one with the best interests of the forestry sector in Ireland as a whole, from the point of view of the sawmilling sector, public access, planting or whatever.  It has a commercial mandate.  That would seem to be borne out.  The witnesses did not really answer the question; maybe they do not know the answer.  Why did they sell off 40,000 hectares?<\/p><p>  As I acquainted myself with this issue over the past while, I was shocked that a country that can grow trees twice as fast as any in Europe has the lowest level of forest cover anywhere in Europe.  That is an extraordinary indictment of the failure of forestry policy.  I stress that I do not blame this on ordinary Coillte workers, who do fantastic work.  I pay tribute to the staff in Avondale Forest Park and all the rest of them.  However, it indicates a failure of Government and the top management of Coillte that, instead of realising that potential, the main activity in which they seem to have engaged in the past few years is selling land.  It seems that the threats to the Irish Timber Council's sector are directly related to that failure because, in a country that should have a plentiful supply of wood, the sector does not have it.  The answer to that is more public investment in planting, rather than privatisation, because a private company will merely asset-strip our forests.  They will not have any interest in the sector, in public access and in the wider economy.  They will only want to take what they can get and, possibly, sell it on further down the road.  I wonder how the council sees the committee addressing these matters in the future, because it seems there is significant unrealised potential.<\/p><p>  Could the council briefly comment on the question of deforestation?

Coillte does the replanting, in fairness.  However, we are talking about new planting basically.  We need between 15,000 ha to 20,000 ha per annum of commercial forestry coming in, which would make a very viable industry.  In Sweden one in four people works in the forest products industry.

The review of the forestry sector and the consideration of the potential sale of the harvesting rights are two different but entangled pieces of work that are being done.

That is not to say there are not equally concerns that something needs to be done by way of reform.  In our exercise we hope the committee can receive contributions that will help to inform consideration of a reformed Coillte.  Should it be a semi-State organisation?  Should it be commercial or should it just have overall management of the forest estate?  I cannot predict what options we might come up with.  There is certainly a body of work to be done and this committee can play a central role in that.<\/p><p>  We chose this time for this because we were told in November that the Goodbody report was to be completed and forwarded to the steering group for consideration in the first or second quarter and it would take to the end of the second quarter before there would be any recommendation.
