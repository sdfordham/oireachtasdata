I will attempt to respond to the questions, which I was asked, on a range of economic issues. <br\/><br\/>Over the period 2001-07, in a wide range of publications, together with my colleagues, we repeatedly warned about the dangers posed for the Irish economy by the growth of a property market bubble and of the need to use fiscal policy to defuse the situation.  If the advice on fiscal policy had been followed, Ireland would probably have escaped much of the damage that was suffered over the recent crisis.  However, we did not draw the connection between the growth of a property market bubble and the risks to the financial system.  In 2008 in our medium-term review<i>, \\ <\/i>failed to foresee the impending financial collapse.  The review had a short shelf life because six weeks later we published the quarterly economic commentary which carried headlines that Ireland was in recession.  I am afraid its shelf life was short.<br\/><br\/>I was asked questions about the economic recovery of the 1990s.  Having spent the 1980s dealing with a major budgetary crisis, the economy entered a period of rapid growth in the 1990s.  The ground had been prepared by a very substantial improvement in competitiveness and the restoration of order to the public finances in the 1980s.<br\/><br\/>There were a number of underlying strategic factors in the Irish recovery.  These included the completion of the EU Single Market which was particularly important for us at the end of 1992.  In addition, there was the effects of investment in education because Ireland had lagged behind the rest of northern European for a long period.  Finally, the rising participation of women in the economy was important.  These factors helped to produce a sustained rapid period of growth in the 1990s.  <br\/><br\/>Due to the fact that growth was fuelled from outside of Ireland, it resulted in a substantial movement into a current account surplus of the balance of payments.  That meant that savings were enough to fund investment.  We did not need a capital inflow to the banking system to fund the very rapid growth because we were living within our means.  <br\/><br\/>A significant part of the growth of the 1990s represented a catch up on the rest of the EU 15.  There is an interesting article by Cormac &Oacute; Gr&aacute;da which was published in the ESRI's quarterly economic commentary which brings this matter out.  The interesting thing about Ireland was that bad policy, over a very long period, managed to keep us down.  Then we had a recovery in the 1990s which acted as a catch up to probably where we should have been otherwise.<br\/><br\/>By the end of the 1990s, and into the first few years of the 2000s, the catch up phase was completed and the rate of productivity growth slowed rapidly.  While exports continued to grow, domestic demand began to rise quite fast.  People reacted to their higher living standards by spending more on consumption and, in particular, investment in housing.  This rise in domestic demand was further fuelled by stimulatory fiscal policy which going back to the medium-term review of 1999-2001, and so on, we felt was unwise and a fueling of an already very rapidly growing economy.  Rising expectations saw a gradual disimprovement in competitiveness due to wage inflation which adversely affected exports.  The current account of the balance turned negative.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor John FitzGerald:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I expressed serious concerns about the nature of fiscal policy, in particular in 2001, but it was probably only in 2003 that growth really began to outstrip the potential of the economy, giving cause for real concern.  The bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2002 took the steam out of the economy, which we were worried about in 2001, and that postponed the turning point.<\/p><p> I was asked to say something on the external policy environment.  With the advent of monetary union in 1999, the ECB took over control of monetary policy so that interest rates were not set to meet the needs of individual economies.  They were set as they are today to meet the needs not of Germany but of the EU economy as a whole.  Monetary union also facilitated the free movement of capital, as anticipated.  It reduced the risk premium, which is the cost of capital.  In the 20 years between 1979 and 1999, Ireland paid 2% more on average than Germany, controlling for everything else.  There was a risk premium which meant investment was more expensive.  We were less competitive than Germany.  That risk premium disappeared with monetary union.  Prior to monetary union, Ireland and Spain had probably under-invested in housing as we had a higher cost of capital than in countries like Germany or France.  Given the demographic profile, we needed to invest in housing.  In permitting a more rapid adjustment to the housing stock, the lower cost of capital was beneficial.  However, it was the failure to appropriately control this surge in investment which eventually proved fatal.<\/p><p> Monetary union had its benefits, but it required governments to act differently.  In our case and in the case of Spain, governments did not act differently.  When the property boom got out of control in the period 2003 to 2007, the intensity of the investment went well beyond domestic savings and the counterpart to the deficit was the inflow of funds through the banking system.  The demand for credit to fund investment ran well ahead of the ability of the banks to meet from their own domestic funds.  However, it proved easy and cheap to borrow additional funds abroad.  In the period before monetary union, a constraint on such expansion might have been the exchange risk involved in such borrowing but the experience of EU countries outside monetary union shows that a change in the world economy had taken place.  This was partly due to US policy and meant that cheap money was available not just because of monetary union.  Estonia and Latvia were not members of the eurozone, but they suffered exactly the same experience of a massive property bubble fuelled by very large investment through the banking system of very cheap money.  One should not blame monetary union as it was a worldwide phenomenon of cheap money which governments and central banks failed to manage appropriately.<\/p><p> The turning point was 2003, but one can argue about it.  The current account of the balance of payments was in deficit that year, though the size was small, but wages had been rising rapidly for a number of years and the loss of competitiveness was beginning to take a toll, notwithstanding that it was not yet that serious.  House prices in 2003 returned to growth at more than 10% a year and the demand for credit was outstripping the ability of the banks to fund it.  One began to see the banks borrowing abroad in the inter-bank market to fund the expansion of credit.  The demand for housing, however, had a real basis in terms of the rising population.  House completions at nearly 70,000 were running ahead of the actual increase in population and there was no sign of the rate of increase in house prices slowing.  An important factor driving that was what I call the \"user cost\".  People expected house prices to rise in future which made buying a house much better than renting because rents would go up.  That proved self-fulfilling and produced a bubble effect.  Over the period to 2007, the current account deficit ballooned reflecting the fact that domestic savings were not enough to fund the investment boom.  We had to borrow from abroad, which resulted in increasing vulnerability for the banking system and a rapid rise in household indebtedness.<\/p><p> It is impossible to identify when the bubble became irreversible.  The last chance to stop it without disaster was probably in 2006.  By the end of that year and moving into 2007, house prices were far above their equilibrium level and collapse became inevitable.  I have provided the committee with a detailed appendix which I will not go through here.  It shows that the dangers were apparent, even if disaster was not certain.  One further factor which aggravated the cost of the collapse was the fact that the building and construction sector was like a tumour which grew and grew, squeezing the rest of the economy.  Fortunately, it turns out not to have been cancerous and we are getting over it.  However, real jobs were squeezed out in the rest of the economy.  This contrasts with the situation in the UK, which also had a property bubble.  However, they did not allow any building so that when prices collapsed, there was not a collapse in a large part of the economy.  The expansion of the building sector in Ireland meant that it had to bid resources away from the rest of the economy.  This was done through inflation which made the rest of the economy uncompetitive.  This killed off a significant number of firms and jobs in the exporting sector.  These jobs did not seem important at the time and nobody noticed they were going in the absence of news headlines, but they have proved crucial.  We really need those jobs today.<\/p><p> I turn finally to the policy response.  The dangers the economy faced as a result of the over-inflation of house prices, the build-up of debt and the loss of competitiveness in the economy were foreseeable and foreseen.  The build-up of the bubble could have been prevented by appropriate fiscal policy or by appropriate prudential action by the Central Bank and the regulator, or both.  Either one of these policy instruments, if appropriately deployed, could probably on its own have prevented disaster.  Both together would have prevented disaster.  On fiscal policy, I note that from 2001 onwards in many publications, I and my colleagues pointed to the need to tighten fiscal policy.  Instead, in an economy that was growing strongly and well above potential, fiscal policy pumped money into the economy in six out of eight budgets.  There is a graph which shows this.  When the economy was growing rapidly, successive Governments pumped money into it, which greatly aggravated the situation.  If instead the Government had run a deflationary fiscal policy, as we recommended repeatedly, and built up a substantial surplus, it would have taken the steam out of the housing market and reduced pressure on the labour market.  The case of Finland is instructive.  Having experienced the same disaster we did only 20 years earlier, it ran up a current government surplus of 5% to prevent a repetition.<\/p><p> In addition, to operating a much tighter fiscal policy in the 2001-07 period, I recommended using specific fiscal instruments to take the heat out of the building and construction sector.  We recommended getting rid of all building incentives and, possibly, taxing mortgage interest payments.  The UK Treasury visited us and published a paper in 2003 which said that if the UK joined monetary union it would need to use fiscal instruments to manage the housing market.  The Treasury recommended using stamp duty, but the problem with that is it would lead to higher household debt.  My feeling was that taxing mortgage interest payments would discourage people from taking on debt.  As people would end up with lower debt, it would be a better instrument.  Either way, one could have used fiscal instruments to take the heat out of building construction.  A further result would have been a smaller balance sheet in the banking sector.  If the building sector had not been allowed to grow and fewer houses had been bought at lower prices, the banking sector would not have been vulnerable.<\/p><p> I will not go into banking regulation and macro-prudential policy in detail.  It was the other instrument which could have been used.  There were a range of ways the Central Bank and the regulator could have stopped the growth in credit, as demonstrated by research from within the Central Bank itself by Kieran McQuinn and Gerard O'Reilly.  They wrote a number of papers on how credit growth is important in fuelling house prices.  If the credit channel had been choked off in 2003 to 2007 by the regulator, it would have halted the rise in house prices or, at least, achieved an appropriate moderation.  Policy instruments were available.<\/p><p> By 2007, it was probably too late to prevent a major crisis from occurring in 2008.  However, if urgent action had been taken in the form of a tightening of fiscal policy or regulatory action, it would have reduced the subsequent damage.  It would have reduced the indebtedness of the household sector by stopping the boom earlier.  If people who bought in 2007 had not bought, they would not be in difficulties today.  The bloated balance sheets of the banks would have been smaller.  However, if policy makers ever considered such action, which I do not think they did, they might have decided that bursting the bubble deliberately in 2007 or early 2008, with serious consequences, was much less attractive than hoping for redemption by delaying action.  It became politically difficult even at the best of times to take action once things had gone that far.  If any action had been taken in 2007, it would probably have left a smaller problem to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423612800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Before I turn to our lead questioners, Deputy Pearse Doherty and Senator Michael D'Arcy, I will do some scene setting with Professor FitzGerald to provide some clarity on the role of the ESRI and its relationship with the Department of Finance.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor John FitzGerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2165\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Ciar&aacute;n Lynch\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BIJ&amp;amp;memberid=2165&amp;amp;pid=CiaranLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Ciar&aacute;n Lynch\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The ESRI is often described as the Government think tank.

Professor Joe Lee in his <i>Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society<\/i>, commented on the fact that universities were not producing useful research at the time.  It was an initiative led by Dr. Ken Whitaker, the then Secretary of the Department of Finance.  To guarantee its independence, he sought funding for it from the Ford Foundation.  He told me that he discovered that the person responsible for funding in the Ford Foundation served mass in a church in New York.  He went to mass and nobbled him after it to get the money for the ESRI.  For the first four years, it was totally independent of the Government.  That was the intention of both the Government and the Secretary of the Department of Finance.<br\/><br\/>The ESRI is legally a charity.  The Department of Finance took over giving it 100% funding when the Ford Foundation money ran out in the middle 1960s.  The ESRI was about 80% funded by a direct grant from the Department of Finance until the late 1980s.  Then there were pretty dramatic cutbacks, as we know, and the ESRI chose to survive by looking for research contracts from the EU, other Departments and so on.  Today, approximately 30% of its funding comes from grant-in-aid from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the other 70% coming from a range of sources such as public research funding from the EU, SFI, Science Foundation Ireland, Departments and public bodies, with a limited amount from the private sector.  The ESRI insists on publishing everything it does without censorship.  The private sector is not generally prepared to fund public good research.<br\/><br\/>The ESRI is governed by a director who is responsible to a council.  The council is not appointed by the Government but co-opts its membership.  Until the late years of the last decade, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance was always a member of the council.  It is now an assistant secretary from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Central Bank Governor has generally been a member.  There is a range of people broadly representative from civil society.  The council is not appointed by the Government, a provision which is there to ensure its independence.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Finance has been party to these ground rules.  Generally, it has been good to deal with.  It understands we kick them and they grin and bear it.

If one looks at the 2007 April spring quarterly commentary, we did mention the financial risks.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor John FitzGerald:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In addition, we mentioned this in papers back to 2004 in the Dublin Economics Workshop.  While we were conscious they were there, because we had not done research, we did not go into detail on that.  Looking back on it, had I even looked at the data on the balance sheet of the banking system, I would have known there was a major problem.  I would not have needed a lot of research to conclude it was not just fiscal policy.  I feel that I made a serious mistake in not looking at the data on that.  I suppose a lot of people relied on the fact that the Central Bank had the biggest number of economists doing research.  As they were doing research on that area, were we to go out seeking funding for such research, the response would have been the Central Bank was doing it.  The lesson for the future is that there is a need for two people or bodies to undertake research on any given area.  However, what happened is a cause of regret.  It is not because we were told not to, rather it is why I did not look at the data, as it would have stood out.  Even though we had not done research, I think I would have said something on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423612800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>In respect of research carried out and published by others in newspaper articles - Morgan Kelly is one who springs to mind for example - was such research simply ignored by the ESRI in its forecasts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#D00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423612800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>No.  I think the first discussion of what Morgan Kelly was producing was in September 2007.

In particular, it stated that lasting damage would be done to the tradeable sector, that is, the export sector.  Were one to plug in the right numbers in terms of the financial sector, the model we had of the economy actually explained what happened to the real economy and we can see the real economy is recovering now.  However, what it did not see was the catastrophic damage done by the financial collapse, in which one had a dramatic fall in output.  I believed then that the economy would recover from whatever happened and I think that actually is what is happening.  Nevertheless, that does not excuse the fact that we did not see the financial collapse.  We published an article in 2011 in which we considered how the economy's behaviour was in line with previous behaviour, if one put in the right external numbers into our way of understanding the economy.  In an updated medium-term review in 2010, we published a high and low scenario for Ireland out to 2020 on the basis that the real economy was not broken and that the business sector would respond in a recovery.

Immediately after the publication, I became aware that the rest of the world was contemplating matters being much worse and then, six weeks later, in a quarterly economic commentary, we stated we thought there was going to be a recession and that it was clear we were wrong.

I discussed it with the director and it seemed to me that the Department's comments were political and should be ignored.  I checked this and note that the first set of chapters of the medium-term review were finalised, on my machine in any event, on 1 October 1999.  Some time between then and 15 October, we published the medium-term review.  Unfortunately, I was not able to check that date with the ESRI.  The author changed the text to meet the Department of Finance's suggestions, or made some changes, and when I came back I discovered this had happened.  We had put the thing to bed.  However, what John McManus in his story did not realise was the role <i>The Irish Times<\/i>played in this.  A few days after we published on 15 October, all of the things that had been taken out were published in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.

I was not in a position to talk to him when I came back from Warsaw and I had other things on my mind.  That would be most unusual.  On that medium-term review, we received a letter after publication from a senior official in a different public institution saying the ESRI had committed treason in it.  I think the word used was &quot;treason&quot;.  That was because we had suggested that corporation tax should be raised from 12.5% to 15% or 17.5% between 2011 and 2015.  The official asked that we withdraw the medium-term review.  That is my memory.  There was a much more normal Department of Finance reaction.

In a paper on budget perspectives 2012 or 2013 - I have updated it since - I looked at the approach taken in Ireland and the approach taken in Spain.  I think we got it broadly right.  Basically, we under promised and over delivered whereas in the Spanish case it over promised and under delivered.  We have done roughly the same and got to roughly the same position.  What makes Ireland different is that the outgoing Government decided to take a pessimistic view of the public finances, three months before the election in its paper of October-November 2010, and set targets which have been difficult to reach but were politically possible so that the incoming Government was handed a plan that was deliverable within target every period.  By contrast, in the Spanish case what happened was that the outgoing government continually raised the bar and promised it would get the deficit down to 3% even faster, something the incoming government finds it is impossible to achieve.  People say Ireland meet its targets and Spain does not.  It mirrors what happened in 1986, 1987 and 1988 where the political system across party boundaries delivered a resolution which produced a better adjustment for Ireland.  The bailout in terms of the plan was an Irish plan developed by an Irish Government.  The troika bought into it and said it was okay.  The incoming Government said it did not like features of it and the troika agreed that so long it stuck to the broad parameters it could change it.

However, over the summer and into the autumn it became clear that the hole in the banks was going to be much bigger and we ended up putting &euro;64 billion into the banks.

How did such a tumour go undetected by the ESRI on the basis that it produced reports for the Department of Finance in 2003 on the national development plan, where it was very critical of the growth in the property sector, and a follow-up report in 2006, where it said exactly the same thing?  Professor FitzGerald took part in the Kenmare conference in October 2004 and subsequently followed it up with \"Future Shock\" on RTE in April 2007.  He used the same term on both occasions.  He said that the economy was out on a limb due to the property market.  With the benefit of hindsight, why did the tumour of the property bubble and the banking stream of funding go undetected by the ESRI?  Why was it not highlighted in the 2008 medium-term review report considering that up to April 2008, taxes were behind by &euro;700 million and &euro;1.2 billion by May 2008, we were running a deficit of &euro;3.6 billion and taxes in all areas were behind?

I ask the Professor FitzGerald to comment on Professor Kelly's article dated 28 December 2006 in which he said:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>If, however, we look at what has happened to other small economies where sudden prosperity and easy credit drove house prices to absurd levels, we should be very worried indeed.<\/blockquote>Then he mentioned the potential for house prices to fall by between 40% and 50% and a collapse of the housing building industry.  He referenced Finland and continued:<blockquote>With low interest rates, and loans available for the asking, house prices soared.  Then, as the Soviet Union collapsed, unemployment rose and house prices started to fall, creating problems first for builders, then for homeowners, and finally for banks.  But why can't we just have our soft landing, where prices stay fixed or rise slowly for a while?  Definitely not: a soft landing is not so much unlikely as contradictory.<\/blockquote>On construction, he continued:<blockquote>In Ireland, if and when the fall occurs, it will be from about 18 per cent of all national income.  We could see a collapse of Government revenue and unemployment back above 15 per cent. <\/blockquote>He concluded:<blockquote>Pilots define a soft landing as one that you can walk away from.  Looking at the collapses in Finland and The Netherlands and the building bust in Arizona, Ireland could be heading for what they call CDIT: controlled descent into terrain.  You are happily descending through cloud, thinking yourself at a safe altitude, until suddenly you smack into a hillside.<\/blockquote>The article was published on 28 December 2006.

Direct funding is low in the ESRI - if you look at the best in Europe, the Central Planning Bureau is wholly funded - and there are advantages and disadvantages to the funding model.  The advantage is that the policy output and policy relevance of what we have done has been doubled or trebled since we were totally funded.  The productivity increase in the institute over the last 20 years is dramatic.  We are funded to do research on energy and it is policy-relevant, whereas if you are an ivory tower with money to spend and you decide what you are going to do, some of the time you will indulge yourself and do things which might not be of great use to policy.  So the funding model has an advantage, but the disadvantage is there are areas that fall through the cracks that are not funded.  The funding of macroeconomics would have been very limited and the funding of the financial research undertaken in the 1990s came from banks.  They stopped funding it, however, and it would probably have been a major problem if the funding was still coming from banks in the last decade.  They would not have continued to fund because you would have been saying there is a real problem and the banks would have been upset.<\/p> <p>  I think the model is too much in contract and in block grant whereas the untied funding should be substantially larger.  Looking at other institutes across Europe, a 50:50 model would be a better model.  It would combine incentives to be policy-relevant with the independence to pick areas that nobody else is interested in.  For example, the ESRI was a leading area of research on poverty over the last 20 years but there has been very limited research funding for poverty, so staff have got to move on to other areas, and there are areas like demography that nobody wants to fund but which I think are important.

Most methodologies for estimating potential GDP do not incorporate information about unsustainable credit developments, housing bubbles, interest-rate movements, and other financial developments that can result in longer-term deviations of GDP from its potential trend.

It is just taking the current EU methodology for establishing structural deficit and potential output, which is wrong and inappropriate for Ireland and gives the wrong answer.  Adding in the financial variables, you may get a better fit but it is not going to come up with the right answer so I think there is a problem with this simplistic approach to estimating potential output.  I can go down this route.  I published an article in April of last year on this with my colleague, Edel Bergin, but it is taking us rather far from what Senator Barrett is talking about here.

I mentioned earlier the papers by Kieran McQuinn and Gerard O'Reilly in the Central Bank, a number of which showed that credit was very important in terms of explaining what happened to the housing market.  One of the problems, of course, is that that was a single equation, or small model, and credit is itself endogenous.  You need to embed it in a larger model in order to understand the full role.  That is one of the things the ESRI is working on in collaboration with the Central Bank in developing the CoSMo model to include the financial sector.  However, just because a particular model does not have the financial sector does not, as I said earlier, excuse you from looking at that.  It is a very important part of the economy.  The HERMES model does not have the financial sector in it but we have used it to very good effect since the crisis to look at what is happening in the Irish economy because we bring our own human capital, our own understanding of the role of the financial sector, and add it on to the model.

What should have happened was that, yes, we had to raise taxes and cut expenditure dramatically, as did Spain, but the rest of Europe - France, probably Italy, Germany, Netherlands - should have stimulated the economy.  That is what should have happened.  The problem is that all the fiscal rules that have been put in place are about making sure that debt is repaid.  None of them is about co-ordinating fiscal policy.  Also on rules, one of the reasons we got into a mess was that we had the Stability and Growth Pact.  In dealing with the EU Commission and the IMF in the run-up to the crisis, in 2004-06, they would come and visit us and I would tell them they needed to give the Government a speeding ticket.

How many research institutes of that kind one can support in a society is a problem.<\/p> <p>  Looking at, say, the Netherlands, the central planning bureau, which I think is the best in Europe, is in a dominant position, a monopoly, and they do a great job, but they are very conscious of the fact that they are in a responsible position.  In the ESRI in the 1980s, one would publish something and nobody might notice.  It has become much more of a responsibility when the media are going to take everything very seriously.

Therefore, taxing the profits was not going to prevent a bubble.

I am not hung up on a particular mechanism, but we need some fiscal mechanism to take money out of the property market.  Taxing the profits will not do that.

One of the things I was not sure about was whether the Central Bank - I now know what powers it has and it has powers in this area - had power to regulate the banks.

It was a failure of regulation.  It is unclear how it would have operated in a world with banks from different countries with different regulators.

The Government should encourage diversity of opinions.  Undertaking research across a wide range of areas of the economy is important.  Models need to develop continuously.  Although we will soon have a model of the financial sector, the next problem to hit Ireland will be something different.  How do we know what it will be?  We should not be too reliant on the past and should think outside the box, and this is one area in which we have failed.  I do not know what will be the next major policy challenge.<\/p> <p>  In fiscal policy, I am concerned that we lack the infrastructure to sensibly operate the rules we have put in place regarding the management of fiscal policy and structural deficit, and which are embedded in the Constitution.  As long ago as the early years of the last decade, the Department of Finance said the current EU methodology for calculating the structural deficit and potential output was an unwise method.  Although the methodology was telling the Government it was doing a great job and should continue to stimulate the economy, the Department of Finance still said it was a bad method.  Whereas the European Commission is now saying Ireland has a substantial structural deficit and needs more cuts, my assessment, using my methodology published last April, is that we are in structural surplus and do not need further cuts.  However, in the medium term, using an appropriate methodology, we may find ourselves in the next five years having to run an increasing surplus because there is a chance we might get rapid growth, moving beyond potential output.  There is a need to improve our methodology and we have put forward a methodology for assessing fiscal policy which is better than what is there.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission officials accept that the methodology does not work.  In 2010 and 2012, I was at conferences in Amsterdam and Brussels, and at the Amsterdam conference my colleague spoke about this problem, that the methodology is inappropriate.  The European Commission official became furious, not because my colleague had said the methodology was wrong but because she had said it was a Commission methodology.  The official's view was that it was an EU methodology and that, although the Commission implemented it, he agreed with us.  In monitoring fiscal policy, we must develop more appropriate methodology that will give the right answer.  There is a danger that in the short run it may tell us we need &euro;2 billion more in cuts when we do not, and that in the long run it may tell us to stimulate the economy when we should take money out of it.  I have suggested a methodology.  I do not have a monopoly on wisdom and it is open to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the Department of Finance and the ESRI to develop an alternative.  We need better guidance for the future in light of the mistakes of the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#X01700","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1423612800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank Professor FitzGerald for his participation in today's meeting.

In prefacing my remarks, I read the transcript of last week's proceedings with the HEA and found it very interesting.  I thank the committee for the opportunity for myself and colleagues to address you here today.  By way of brief introduction to the proceedings, we are here to talk about the impact of the universities and higher education more generally and the challenges and opportunities facing the sector in regard to its future impact and sustainability.  We surfaced and debated many of these issues at our international symposium, to which the Chair referred, 21st Century Universities.  I thank the clerk for his attendance at the symposium on behalf of the committee.  Time precludes us from going over all the ground covered on that day, but we will address the main themes.  I should say that matters have progressed since the symposium following the commencement of the work of the expert group on the future funding of higher education, chaired by Peter Cassells.  That group produced the first of its background papers and recently held a highly interactive consultation session with a wide range of stakeholders including enterprise, the trade unions, regional authorities and higher education.  Where relevant we have drawn on the evidence from the background paper that was presented for that initial consultation.  There will be two further consultations, I understand, as the group progresses its work.<br\/><br\/>Our testimony to the committee is structured as follows: following my own presentation where we will address the sustainability and future challenge aspects, my colleagues, academic affairs director Lewis Purser will talk about human capital impacts in conjunction with Sinead Lucey, who is our international education manager.  Then, Dr. Larkin and Qiantao Zhan will address the economic impact of higher education, a piece of work they have been doing under the Tionchar project.  It is good to be able to report on the positive financial and human impacts of higher education.  No aspect of human endeavour is perfect and in any event, in a world where change is endemic, we must constantly strive to progress and to improve.  What we aim to show here today is a snapshot of the outputs and the impacts of higher education.  To secure those outputs and impacts we need inputs in the form of talented and motivated students and staff and we need the appropriate financial and regulatory environment.<br\/><br\/>The legacy of experience of higher education during the economic crisis as we face into a period of economic growth leaves us with a number of challenges and conundrums that I will talk about.  The first of these is summed up by the intersection of the movements of student numbers and staff numbers.  According to the Cassells expert group, the higher education participation rate has been relatively steady over the last years, and any future rise in the higher education student cohort will be driven primarily by growth in the primary and secondary school population.  High birth rates in Ireland over the last 15 years have led to a very substantial increase in the numbers going through the school system.  Both increased numbers, and an increased retention rate at second level, result in projections for second level enrolments growing from 338,000 in 2014 to a peak of some 405,000 by 2025.  As a result, the latest projections suggest that by 2028 the number of new entrants to higher education will increase by 29% over 2013 levels.  We have charted that out in our background submission.  These projections are based on participation rates remaining constant at 56% over the period.  The relevant chart is included in our submission.<br\/><br\/>While new entrants into higher education have increased, core staff numbers have fallen in consequence of the employment control framework.  The net effect of this - of rising student numbers and decreasing staff numbers - has been a change in the negative way in the student to staff ratio.  Pre-crisis, the ratios in Irish universities were already on the high side by international standards at circa 1:16 or 1:17 on average.  During the crisis, ratios have increased quite significantly from 1:20 to 1:23 in the universities - that is an increase in the ratio and a deterioration of 12%.  These are very significantly higher - and I would just pause on that figure of 1:23 - than the OECD average which stood at 1:14 in 2012.  To put this into context, the president of UCD, Professor Andrew Deeks, has remarked that in comparison to his former university, Durham in the UK, he had the same staffing complement there as he has here, but UCD has ten thousand more students than Durham.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned the word conundrum and this is because this change represents a gain in efficiency in pure statistical terms, but it also has implications for quality and for sustainability in terms of the long-term ability to support such large class sizes.  This evidence suggests that we have a sustainability problem now arising from the ratios which needs to be tackled.  This is before we get to the matter of future demographic impacts which, if nothing is done, would push the ratios very significantly higher, given the scale of increase in the student population that is projected.  It should be noted also that the projections referred to are based on holding participation rates steady at 56%.  All things being equal, improving access from socio-economic groups that are currently disadvantaged would increase participation rates further and further increase enrolments.<br\/><br\/>I will now briefly address the funding context for these developments.  The expert group paper sets out the current annual funding of public higher education institutions which unsurprisingly is in decline since 2007 - 2008.  Despite an increase in the student contribution of &euro;1,925 or 233% &mdash; from &euro;825 in 2007 - 2008 to &euro;2,750 in 2014 - 2015, total income per student decreased by 22% for the higher education system overall.<br\/><br\/>Increases in student contributions along with general reductions in overall State funding have resulted in a steady reduction in the proportion of total recurrent funding for core activities of higher education institutions funded by the State.  That reduction is from 78% in 2008 to an estimated 64% in 2016, because there is a further decrease in our allocations in the estimates for this year.  This compares to an OECD average of 68%.  For universities specifically, the core recurrent grant allocated to universities declined by &euro;261 million between 2008 and 2014, a decline of just under 53%.  When we look at the fall in the unit of resource which includes not only the core grant but also fee income, the unit of funding went from &euro;8,734 in 2007 - 2008 to &euro;6,970 in 2013 - 2014.  The cumulative decrease in the unit of resource in this period has been in excess of 21%. <br\/><br\/>Looking at university funding in an all-island context, we recently undertook a comparison of the unit of resource per student in an IUA university <i>vis &agrave; vis<\/i>a student in one of the Northern Irish universities.  For the academic year 2014-15 the funding per undergraduate student in a typical non-lab discipline - that is, arts, humanities and social sciences - is &pound;7,997 in Northern Ireland or approximately &euro;10,663 at current exchange rates.  That compares to &euro;6,876 in an IUA university &ndash; a difference of 55%.  We understand that the Northern universities would not consider themselves to be particularly well funded by UK standards.<br\/><br\/>In addition to that, we should also mention the matter of capital funding. Capital funding for universities effectively ceased in 2008.  That was partly as a result of the need to build new schools at primary and secondary level for the demographic bulge that was happening there.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Ned Costello:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Over the period of the financial crisis, apart from the run out of some Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, PRTLI, investments, there has been no capital investment of any significance in universities.  When one takes planning and build time into account, that means that even with a decision to start funding capital in universities now, it would take a number of years for funding to come on stream and we could be looking at virtually a decade of no capital investment.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Larkin will mention in his presentation that methodologies for evaluating economic return do not deal with the matter of efficiency.  In that regard, I have already commented that our system is highly productive and while productivity and efficiency are not entirely the same thing, they are sides of the same coin.  In regard to the efficiency of operations and costs to the State, one of the significant features of recent years is that universities have grown non-Exchequer income.  That income, excluding research, has increased by 24% from &euro;695 million in 2008 to &euro;865 million, helping to offset the significant reductions in public funding.  Total income, excluding research, per staff member has remained largely stable, increasing marginally to &euro;155,000 while non-Exchequer income, excluding research, per staff member, has increased from &euro;71,000 to &euro;93,000, an increase of almost 30%.  Staff are doing significant amounts to improve the non-Exchequer financial position of universities.  Significant work has been undertaken on shared procurement under the aegis of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  Significant internal changes have also taken place, including a revised academic contract and a performance management and work load allocations system but more needs to be done on the HR toolkit to ensure the competitiveness and efficiency of universities is maximised.  I know that Mr. Bowman spoke about that last week in the context of the generation of overseas income.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, regulation is important for the purposes of financial probity, accountability generally and to underpin public confidence.  However, for regulation to be effective, it must be well considered and proportionate.  Regulation in a university context has a particular perspective for several reasons.  Universities are producers of both public and private goods and their funding reflects this.  In addition, unlike the majority of the public service, universities are in an internationally traded marketplace, both in terms of students and staff.  There is a high expectation for universities to be innovative and to contribute to national and global stocks of knowledge.  Part of that innovativeness is based on academic freedom and an appropriate degree of university autonomy.  Trends in this regard are monitored by the European University Association, EUA, through its autonomy score card process.  As part of our symposium we requested the EUA to update the score card for Ireland.  It found as follows:<blockquote>This 2014 update of the Autonomy Scorecard for Ireland reveals a decline of university autonomy, in particular in staffing matters.  In some areas it is quite subtle and can only be captured partially by the scorecard metrics.  It appears clearly though that there is an entrenchment phenomenon, with governmental control over human resources and finances having been consolidated over the period considered.  The measures that the government took at the beginning of the economic crisis have neither been halted nor reversed.  <\/blockquote>I must stress, in conclusion, that this is not about a blanket approach to deregulation.  The IUA has put forward proposals to strengthen institutional governance and has welcomed the HEA system performance report and appraisal process.  It is, rather, about ensuring that institutions whose contribution to the economy and society depends on agility and flexibility are appropriately empowered to make that contribution.  The two key issues are the need for sustainable funding and sensible regulation.  I will now pass over to Mr. Lewis Purser, who will deal with the question of whether that funding is justified and who will also talk about the human capital impacts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423659600,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to present to the committee.  In this statement I will draw out the salient points from the supporting documentation supplied to the committee which is much more comprehensive and which contains a number of graphics that I hope are helpful.  I will address the contribution of the universities to the development of human capital in Ireland.  This human capital is widely acknowledged as our single most important natural resource and is what our entire national economic strategy is developed around, for both indigenous and export-led growth.  I will begin by looking at the growth in the numbers of university students over the last ten years at all levels - bachelor, master and doctorate - as well as the numbers in areas of specific national targets, including, for example, under-represented domestic student groups and international students.<br\/><br\/>The overall number of university students grew by 14% during the period 2004 to 2014, with an increase of 54% in PhD students.  Additional overall growth of 5.5% is planned by 2016-17, in line with the strategic compacts agreed between the Higher Education Authority and each university.  The numbers of students admitted to universities and other colleges through the DARE and HEAR schemes which target students with disabilities and those from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, have increased by over 200% during the period 2009 to 2014, to the extent that now one in every five applicants to the CAO is also applying to DARE and-or HEAR.  Both these groups of students are national priority target groups.  In addition, there has been an overall growth of 45% in the numbers of international students in Irish universities.  There are three main categories of international students: full-time international students who come to Ireland for a full degree programme; offshore or distance students who are studying on a programme provided and-or accredited by an Irish university, but delivered outside Ireland; and short-term exchange and visiting students such as Erasmus students from other European countries, Junior Year Abroad students from the United States and more recently, from countries like Brazil.<br\/><br\/>Following this discussion of student numbers, our submission looks at the quality of outputs from the university education process, using various indicators.  The first is graduate employment and other graduate destinations.  This looks at the success of graduates in obtaining employment and-or other successful destinations following completion of their degree programme.  The next indicator is employer feedback on higher education outcomes which looks at employer satisfaction with the quality and employability of recent graduates, as well their future skills requirements.  Another indicator is student engagement and student experience, which looks at the feedback from students regarding their educational experience and satisfaction.  The final indicator is completion rates and average duration of studies, which looks at whether students completed their degree programme and whether they completed it on time. <br\/><br\/>In terms of graduate employment and other graduate destinations, the data gathered by the universities and published by the HEA shows that since 2008 the proportion of the honours bachelor level 8 graduate cohort in employment has remained stable - 50% in 2008; 51% in 2013 - while the proportion seeking employment in 2013 was 6% or half the national unemployment rate at that time.  While the relative employability successes enjoyed by university graduates are clear compared to the general population, a number of challenges remain.  For example, the proportion of recent graduates employed overseas has more than doubled from 5% in 2008 to 12% in 2013.  Likewise, the numbers of level 8 graduates entering further studies or training has increased from 34% in 2008 to 40% in 2013.  These figures reflect the difficulties in obtaining employment in Ireland but also the demand for more advanced or specialised education or training for specific sectors of the labour market. <br\/><br\/><font color=\"#212100\">  In terms of e<\/font>mployer feedback on the quality and employability of recent graduates, <font color=\"#212100\">some key findings of the 2012 and 2014 National Employer Surveys by IBEC and the Higher Education Authority are relevant.  The surveys found that over 75% of companies were confident that graduates have the right workplace and transferable skills and relevant subject or discipline knowledge.  This confidence was particularly <\/font>pronounced among foreign-owned employers, that is, among multinational companies in Ireland.  <font color=\"#212100\">The surveys further found that over 80% of companies were satisfied with the calibre of science and maths graduates.<\/font><font color=\"#212100\">The majority of PhD graduates were employed because the job required doctorate-level skills or qualifications. <\/font><font color=\"#212100\">However, large numbers of graduates - approximately 15% - from outside Ireland continue to be recruited by employers, both multinational and indigenous.<\/font><!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Lewis Purser:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are lower levels of satisfaction among employers with recent graduates&rsquo; foreign language capabilities and entrepreneurial skills.  These are areas that can be addressed by the universities through better integration of skills and competences in internal curriculum development and quality assurance processes and through the continued promotion of study abroad opportunities and high-quality work placements.<\/p><p> In terms of feedback from the students themselves regarding their educational experiences, engagement and satisfaction, all Irish universities conduct surveys of their students on a range of specific issues, for example, course and module feedback, library usage, sports facilities and many other topics.  In addition, for the past two years, all Irish higher education institutions - universities, institutes of technology and a number of other colleges - have conducted a national survey of student engagement to which nearly 20,000 students responded in 2014.  The survey is aimed at first year undergraduate, final year undergraduate and taught post-graduate students.  I will not go through all of the results, but some of the highlights are as follows: some 63% of all participating students selected \"often\" or \"very often\" when asked if they were improving knowledge and skills that would contribute to their employability; 67% of all participating students reported positive relationships with teaching staff, finding them to be available, helpful and sympathetic; 80% of all participating students selected good or excellent when asked how they would evaluate their entire educational experiences at their institutions; and 65% of all participating students selected \"often\" or \"very often\" when asked if they used an online learning system to complete an assignment.<\/p><p> The feedback from our Irish survey also allow us to compare what students in Ireland are telling us with the feedback from students in Australasian countries and the US, where similar surveys are conducted and where we have sourced and adapted our Irish survey tool.  The results for Ireland are broadly favourable compared with those for Australasia - mostly Australia, but also New Zealand and a couple of smaller countries - but still have some work to do to catch up with the US benchmark, the obvious leader in this field.<\/p><p> The feedback is important for universities that can use this information, often in detailed ways, in combination with other sources of feedback, for example, from employers and through the quality assurance processes, to take appropriate action.  The data coming through the Irish survey provide a useful evidence base for further discussions at the level of each individual university, which is where the changes must occur, as well as at national level.  This usefulness will increase over time following further iterations of the survey.  We have conducted two already and are gathering an evidence base.<\/p><p> Regarding student completion rates and the average duration of studies in Irish universities, evidence shows that we compare favourably with other countries across Europe and the OECD.  This is in terms of overall student completion rates and students completing their studies on time.  The average time to completion in Ireland is 4.02 years while the EU average is 4.59 years and the OECD average is 4.4 years.  This demonstrates that the system in place in Irish universities is more efficient, thereby encouraging students to complete their studies on time.  This is better for individual students and the State, which contributes large amounts of public funding.<\/p><p> Our submission also provides a summary of quality assurance procedures used across the university sector to ensure and enhance quality in the education processes.  We describe the variety and extent of these processes and mechanisms; they are designed to ensure the fitness for purpose of study programmes as well as academic and administrative structures.  During the past ten years, all units of all universities have been reviewed, in most cases twice, by expert panels involving external international and Irish expertise as well as by students, resulting in quality enhancement plans with formal monitoring and follow-up.  All of this information is on the websites of the individual universities.<\/p><p> In addition, all of the universities have been through two full rounds of institutional review by expert panels external to Ireland.  These panels have made a series of useful suggestions and recommendations for each university, all of which are available on the website of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, the State agency that organises these reviews.  The institutional reviews have confirmed that each of the universities has been in full compliance with its quality assurance obligations under the Universities Act 1997 and, possibly more importantly, with the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area, the European benchmark in this regard.  Irish universities are seen by other European partners as leaders in this area.  These external validations of quality in our system provide confidence to the national authorities, students and national and international partners regarding the quality of academic programmes and other services provided by the universities.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and look forward to discussing these and other issues of concern to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Purser","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423659600,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to contribute to this important discussion by presenting recent evidence relating to the economic impact of higher education institutions in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We have found that the higher education sector represents good value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  In most circumstances, it will return much more than &euro;1 for every &euro;1 invested.  In the 2010 to 2011 period, for example, the gross income of higher education institutions in Ireland was &euro;2.6 billion, generating a gross output of &euro;10.6 billion.  Investment in higher education in Ireland generally has greater impact than does similar investment in the UK.  The accompanying illustrations in my supporting documents bear this out, for example, figures A1.1 and A1.2.  This testimony is supported by four appendices.  Appendix I contains materials and diagrams related to this discussion.  Appendices II and III are academic papers outlining the impact, input-output analysis methodology and the Keynesian multiplier methodology.  Appendix IV is a brief biographical note.  I will attempt to answer all of the committee's questions today, but if it has further questions, I have provided contact details.<\/p> <p>  This research, entitled TIONCHAR, is funded by the Irish Research Council under the theme 2 research projects grant scheme RPG 2013-6 - SFI-HEA Assessing the Impact of Publicly-Funded 27 Research, Development and Innovation - based in the school of business at Trinity College Dublin.  The funding was granted to a consortium of academics: Professor Brian Lucey, Professor Poul Holm, Ms Niamh Brennan of Trinity library and myself.  Mr. Qiantao Zhang is our post-doctoral fellow and is soon to receive his doctorate in economic geography from Cardiff University.  Without his work and great skill, this presentation would not have been possible.<\/p> <p>  We have received generous assistance from people within the higher education sector.  It is the first time that this type of analysis has been done since the late 1960s.  The Irish Universities Association, IUA, Institutes of Technology Ireland, Mr. Tom Boland of the Higher Education Authority and his staff, Ms Mary Doyle of the Department of Education and Skills and her staff, the presidents, secretaries and registrars of the institutions, Dr. Stephen Kinsella of University of Limerick, Professor Colm Harmon of University of Sydney and Ms Siobhan Phillips and Mr. Martin Hynes of the European Science Foundation have all been invaluable in their support.<\/p> <p>  Economic impact is a broad concept with many components.  When discussing the economic impact of higher education, we usually refer to a component of national industrial policy where higher education provides a method of improving a country's human capital endowment.  My contribution today will focus primarily on the role of higher education institutions as entities existing within the economy, which can be considered in the same way as one would describe an Exchequer-financed investment such as roads or public administration.  This is exclusively concerned with the demand side of the economy whereas human capital is the supply side.<\/p> <p>  I warn members that, while this study highlights immediate value for money, it does not comment on returns beyond the present.  Since human capital returns are made manifest over a 45 to 65-year time horizon, it would be unwise to consider immediate returns the entire result of investment in human capital.  Policy makers should note that long-term horizons and information asymmetries present in all forms of education delay by many years the effects of policy changes on long-term economic growth.  These impacts ultimately are about expanding the supply side of the economy and yield long-term, non-inflationary and stable equilibrium expansions in output and employment.<\/p> <p>  Many analytical techniques exist to evaluate immediate returns.  To offer the most accurate results in the time allowed, I shall focus exclusively on the input-out method.  The results are described in figures A1.1 and A1.2 of Appendix I.  They illustrate how Irish higher education institutions as a body outperform most UK institutions, with the exception of London-based institutions, while netting out the effect of Government investment, that is, the balanced budget multiplier.<\/p> <p>  The TIONCHAR project is a multidimensional one.  Not only do we examine immediate impacts through the Keynesian and input-output methods of analysis, but we also consider a Solow or economic growth analysis as well as the impact on innovation and industrial policy.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Dr. Charles Larkin:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The input-output method treats higher education institutions as a sector or firm, as if we were discussing the construction industry, for example.  It involves asking, for a given level of income and expenditure, what level of additional economic activity is generated in the economy.  Higher education is considered solely as a sector of the economy made up of producers and consumers, with no comment on the wider effects on the economy's human capital endowment or on non-economic contributions.<\/p><p> The input-output technique takes a matrix of raw economic data collected from the public and private sides of the economy to study interdependencies between suppliers and producers and the economic impact of the import or export of producer goods to meet consumer demand in the national and regional economy.  The analysis illustrates that the output of one sector can in turn become an input for another.  This method was created by Professor Wassily Leontief during the 1930s, for which he received a Nobel prize in 1973, and involves treating all sectors in a linear fashion.  Supply is taken as exogenous in its environment, that is, it does not respond.  Firms function by consuming certain products and producing outputs which are in turn consumed at a later stage.  The data we use in our analysis is from the Higher Education Authority and the Central Statistics Office.  The input-output tables date from 2010 and, as such, may include latent Celtic tiger effects.  We have tried to provide the best analysis possible.<\/p><p> The disaggregation of the input-output tables, which represents the key parameters for the Irish higher education sector, is shown in figure A1.4.  The data show that 68% of the costs for higher education institutions come from staffing.  Expenditure by these institutions translates at minimum to 77% of all purchases taking place within the domestic economy.  Income is slightly less diverse than one might expect, with 65% of the sector's income coming from Irish Exchequer sources.  It is important to note the distinction between universities and institutes of technology with respect to diversity of income, a distinction which has serious implications for the balanced budget effect.<\/p><p> With this data, we can calculate type I and type II multipliers.  Type I multipliers relate directly to the purchases of goods and services by the higher education institution itself.  Type II multipliers are related to the induced effect, that is, where household consumption responds to changes in wage income.  Type II output multipliers, as set out in figures A1.7 and A1.8, show the results for the institutes of technology and the universities all being greater than one - meaning they get back more than &euro;1 for every euro invested - and much higher than their Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish and London counterparts.<\/p><p> Since the higher education system is supported so extensively by the Exchequer, it is important to calculate a balanced budget effect.  This figure takes into account the opportunity cost of Exchequer funds.  In any environment involving Exchequer financing, one must consider the effect of taxation in reducing the disposable income of those taxed.  While Ireland continues to borrow for day-to-day finances, that practice is set to end by 2018.  As it stands, the Exchequer is in primary surplus, such that all public money expended on higher education crowds out funding to other areas of public expenditure unless tax receipts increase.  The balanced budget effect subtracts Government funding and the associated multiplier effect of that funding.  We use a relatively high multiplier effect given the level of support to the sector.  It is important to note that any funding that comes from the European Union constitutes an external injection into the Irish economy.<\/p><p> As depicted in figure A1.9, institutions heavily reliant on Exchequer funding have their multiplier effects sharply reduced.  Diversity of income in the university sector allows them to maintain strong multipliers relative to the institutes of technology.  Table A1.2 provides a clear comparative illustration of the performance of Irish higher education institutions compared with their UK counterparts.  It is only in particularly specialist institutions in London, such as the London Business School, the London School of Economics and the Institute of Cancer Research, that we see higher returns.  It is important to note that Irish universities, as comprehensive institutions, consistently perform above their UK counterparts.  As figure A1.11 illustrates, there is no clear relationship between overall income and the balanced budget multiplier.<\/p><p> The input-output technique also allows us to make a comment on employment by way of a consideration of the number of jobs generated for every &euro;1 million of expenditure.  Through direct effects of the universities, or type I effects, the sector generates 1,731 jobs.  Induced effects, or type II effects, generate 66,470 jobs within the sector.  These findings are in keeping with US studies.  The fact that direct employees of the higher education sector are relatively well remunerated has a knock-on effect in the economy.  I would, however, urge great caution with respect to these figures given the nature of the Irish data.<\/p><p> Overall, our investigations so far have found that the higher education sector represents value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  In most circumstances it will return more than &euro;1 for every &euro;1 invested.  When balanced for the opportunity cost of Exchequer funds, it remains very high, especially compared with the UK sector.  I will, however, highlight some caveats.  The analyses to date have treated the sector as an industry and do not consider some of the more important aspects of higher education investment and outputs.  In addition, it is important to note that economic processes in reality are not linear.  Supply does respond to demand and typically in a non-linear fashion.  The TIONCHAR project hopes to progress towards a \"solow\" impact, or the improved human capital endowment effect.  Although data limitations in the Irish context have complicated the process, we are beginning to use surveys to try to fill those gaps.  Our intention is to do a comparative benchmark analysis comparing Ireland with other European countries.<\/p><p> Our method says nothing about institutional efficiency, which is a reasonable concern given the state of the public finances.  Our later research will use a data envelopment free disposable hull technique, a form of operations research that looks at what is achieved versus potential activity within a sector.  Effectively, one is looking for the production possibilities frontier of a sector and where the sector is at.  This method is commonly used in health research.  Figure A1.13 5 provides a graphical representation of the technique.<\/p><p> The more complicated questions relate to individual returns to education and the non-monetary and societal returns to education.  I highlight this since returns from investment in higher education are crucial to our understanding of its role in the economy.  Higher education does afford a wider return to society, but this is very difficult to capture in empirical data.  Professor Walter McMahon of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Professor Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Professor Edward Glaeser of Harvard University have produced initial estimations of the health, family, social cohesion, happiness and income equality effects of mass participation in higher education.  This analysis of the complete economic and non-economic returns from higher education is complex, data intensive and requires careful interpretation.<\/p><p> I have attempted to highlight the initial results of the first comprehensive study of the economic impact of Irish higher education institutions since the 1960s.  It is clear the sector represents value for the taxpayer, given the consistently strong multiplier effects and taking account of the caveats I indicated.  I look forward to questions and comments from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Charles Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Larkin.

Much of what he had to say seemed rather depressing, whereas the contribution from Mr. Purser made me feel elated.  That was somewhat confusing in terms of what we should be taking away from this meeting.  Mr. Costello referred to the deterioration in the student-staff ratio.  Mr. Tom Boland of the Higher Education Authority told this committee how that deterioration can lead to a deterioration in student performance as a consequence of the lack of mentoring, the isolation aspect and so on.  Will Mr. Costello comment on that?

That seems to be a major part of it.  There also is a significant disparity in what one needs to pay to go to university in the South and what one needs to pay to go to university in the North.<\/p><p> Are there too many staff sitting in rooms doing research and writing books that nobody will read and not enough staff teaching?  I mean teaching in a thousand different ways.  I mean mentoring, for instance, an MIT system of teaching.  Last week I telephoned two colleagues whom I know well and both of them teach one hour a week.  Would the delegation comment on that?<\/p><p> Mr. Purser spoke of good news, and it was excellent.  He stated that 75% of companies were confident that graduates have the right workplace and transferable skills.  What was the outline of the companies?  Were they technology or scientific companies?  What kind of companies were they?  What was the cross-correlation of the 20,000 students who were assessed on this?  From where did they come?  From what disciplines did they come?  What was the balance of the disciplines?  Were they mainly from the sciences and the technology area or from biotechnology, or were they from the arts and humanities?  What was the balance?<\/p><p> Mr. Purser made an interesting point about the lack of language teaching at primary education.  He found in the study that there was a lower level of satisfaction from companies in the ability to speak foreign languages.  The lack of language teaching in primary education outside of Gaeilge is something that we have brought up in this committee.<\/p><p> Mr. Purser's paper is extraordinary.  I would have to admit that in listening to him I might have been in, what as Gaeilge we call \"rang a haon\" - it means first class - in that I would not have had his genius and the knowledge of an economic background.  However, one of the most interesting points is what many of the professors of economics he mentioned say about how important education is for education's self, that we do not always necessarily need an economic graph because there is such a thing as family happiness and social cohesion, and that the idea that we all go to university to get a job is a given.  Of course it is a major factor but education is for and by itself.  Are there a lot of studies on that?<\/p><p> The presentation was so considerable followed by our contribution that I will stop now, and maybe come back in later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021100002#H00500","speaker":"1170","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Senator O'Donnell may come back in.

If I am wrong, he should correct me, but I think it is the first major study on what is going on in third level in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Does Dr. Larkin plan to extend that into the IOT area?  One of the areas I am concerned about is the marrying up of the different sectors in Irish education.  I brought this up with those who were here last week.  I refer to the progression from further education through to third level education, whether in a technology university, an institute of technology or a university.  I wonder whether there is any information on the fact that students in Ireland at a further education college can transfer directly to UK-based universities and get credit for the year's study that they would have undertaken in an Irish further education college whereas, traditionally, Irish universities want one to go back two years and start all over again and regard further education as an add-on to a poor leaving certificate.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021100002#J00300","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their interesting input.

I will ask the question bluntly.  Was the sector, with the decline in Exchequer funding, forced to be innovative in seeking out and securing such non-Exchequer funding, from where did it come and is there more funding in that space?  How good are we at looking at the tradition of other universities, particularly in the United States, of going back to the alumni to see can they make some sort of contribution?<\/p> <p>  Ireland earns &euro;1 billion per annum from international education, the vast majority of which goes into the sector.  Have we fully exploited that?  Some universities are especially adept at securing investment through international education and have done extraordinarily in the past number of years.  How can we encourage a best-practice approach across the sector, learning from the wonderful examples that are emanating from some universities and, indeed, some excellent institutes of technology?  How can we take that learning and apply it across the system?<\/p> <p>  Finally, and this is something of a hobbyhorse of mine, what opportunity is there in the future to use technology to deliver learning and education, not alone here in Ireland but globally, particularly in emerging economies on the African Continent?  There are some governments, for instance, Zambia, through the World Bank, investing significant amounts in further education and third level education, looking at best practice internationally and, essentially, seeking out providers of such education, and Zambia is looking at technology as being one of the conduits through which that education can be delivered.  Is there any opportunity for us there?<\/p> <p>  We have an exceptionally strong brand abroad, and an especially strong reputation, as the land of saints and scholars and with the tradition that has grown down through the centuries.  Other countries, such as New Zealand, are doing extraordinarily well and having a multiple of our output in international education, and yet I would argue that such tradition has been built up over the past 20 or 30 years.  We have a far older and far stronger tradition or, if one wants to call it that, brand.

What we have tried to show is that the system has come through the crisis in many respects fitter and stronger, which is in line with the Deputy's point regarding income.  It has also done it by drawing on internal resources and drawing on a huge amount of dedication on the part of the staff in the system.  Whether the student-staff ratios, which is the point to which I was speaking, is a sustainable position in the long term is a big question.  The quality aspect is complex and, as Mr. Boland said last week, we will not see the position regarding that until it is gone and then it will be too late.  That is a concern.  Arising from the increase in student numbers and the decrease in staff numbers, there is less time available for the one-to-one element with students.  That is an inevitable consequence of what has happened.<\/p><p> Senator O'Donnell mentioned the research issue.  That arises but one has to examine where research in university fits in the round.  There has been a very significant change in the make-up of Irish universities in the past 20 years, and in past 15 years more particularly, where they have moved from being predominantly teaching institutions to being research and teaching institutions.  That has been necessary because the world the universities serve now is much more innovative and dynamic.<\/p><p> An interesting aspect of the exporting sector in Ireland is that employment in that sector has tended to stay pretty much at around 350,000, but the companies that are part of that sector and that generate the 80% of our GDP, or whatever the percentage is, are completely different companies now from what they were 15 to 20 years ago.  It is a completely different cohort of companies.  Those companies and companies throughout the economy have much different expectations and universities need to respond to that.  That is from where the impetus for research has come.  On the one hand, it is to benefit companies directly because universities collaborate with companies on research.  Furthermore, it is to make sure that teaching in universities is at the cutting edge of knowledge and that the people who are teaching are fully informed by research.  It creates the issue of the balancing of research and teaching loads, to which the Senator rightly referred.  That needs to be done through a workload allocation system whereby, to take the example of a school, the head of the school can ensure that there is an equitable workload across all staff and that some staff do more research and less teaching and some staff do more teaching and less research.<\/p><p> The final point on that aspect is the issue of postgraduate teaching.  It can be questioned whether postgraduate education is education or research but, in reality, it is both.  We heard about the increase in postgraduate numbers which has been a big part of the increase in income.  Teaching and research are two sides of the same coin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021100002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I was thinking of it at undergraduate level and in the context of the deterioration in the ratios that Mr. Costello mentioned.

There is an interesting point regarding regulation.  When the second ECF was produced, we negotiated a flexibility within it for non-core funded research staff.

There had to be a 20% contribution to take account of the continued liability of pension costs but the staff associated with it were outside the confines of the framework.  Non-core funded research has done relatively much better but it has an impact in that the principal investigators are predominantly tenured academics.  The ECF has bitten on that side.

I have given it the slightly more positive heading in our background paper of completion rates rather than attrition rates, but it is same thing.  From page 20 onwards there is some discussion and data about it.  The universities have an attrition rate of 9% from first year to second year and that has been stable over recent years.  The Higher Education Authority uses the data submitted annually by every institution and then it does the studies.  It can check details through tracking students, use of personal public service numbers etc., and that shows why national databases are extremely important.  It can get the national averages and all the national data.  That rate has held firm.  A 9% rate compared with the EU or OECD average is very good.  From the data I could find from the OECD publication, Education at a Glance, and I referenced this in our paper, the average is 30%.  Therefore, a 9% rate in the university sector is not bad and that is across all disciplines.  I will not shy away from pointing out that the challenges are in some of the science,  technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, areas.  Computer science in particular has always been a challenge.

However, as a <i>sequitur <\/i>to what Mr. Purser said, the Senator correctly adverted to the variation in non-progression rates across the higher education system as a whole.  There is evidence that they are worst in the institutes of technology sector.  While it is not for me to speak for the IOT sector, representatives of the sector would say that obviously the socio-economic profile of entrants to that sector is different and that inevitably has an effect.  The same pattern is evident with computer science in the IOTs as in the universities.  The more difficult courses, particularly those with lower points requirements, tend to be the ones that people come into.  They tend not to have the capability to succeed in the course and then they drop out of it.<br\/><br\/>On the question of technological universities, our position has always been that it is one of standards.  If an institution deserves the title of university, then it should look, walk and talk like a university.  Therefore a technological university should be of a university standard, but with a different disciplinary focus from a comprehensive university.<br\/><br\/>Inevitably, however, if technological universities are created, there will be bits of the technological aspect of comprehensive universities that look like a technological university, if I can put it that way.  I think we want that because we want universities to be as engaged with technology and with companies as technological universities are.  However, there is also a regional dimension, which the Department's policy would require to be stronger in the case of technological universities.  There is an SME element that the Department would maintain is to be stronger as well.<br\/><br\/>I hate bringing everything back to resources, but as Mr. Boland did it last week, I am probably allowed to do it.  The big worry is that creating new universities will not be a cheap process.  Where will the money come from?<br\/><br\/>There is also significant challenge on the employment contract on the TU side.  The employment contract is very different because in the IOT sector, as the Senator knows, it is predominantly a teaching hours-based contract.  As the sector wants to do more research, it is struggling with that.<br\/><br\/>Fundamentally it is not a question of principle.  It is really a question of more practice.

This is a difficult one with which to deal because everyone knows what we have been obliged to go through to maintain coherence in the public sector and so on.  As Mr. Tom Boland mentioned last week, if we want staff to go out and really win significant amounts of international business, for example, or to go to teach in branch campuses abroad, it is reasonable to say that one must be in a position to incentivise them to do so.  The same is true in the context of continuing professional development, which is the other area in which a market exists.  If one wants staff to do stuff out of hours and provided one has the quality assurance system in place to ensure that this is not done at the expense of their day jobs, which is critical, then the regulators should be open to this.  At present, they are not open to it.  This is a matter of ongoing debate between ourselves and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costello"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423659600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>The Deputy quite rightly pointed out the strength of Ireland's brand in international markets.

The New Zealand Government's level of investment in the country's national brand is significantly higher than the corresponding level of investment here.

How far away is the provision of a university in the midlands?  The cost of coming to the city to study is a huge factor for students in the midlands, in terms of seeking accommodation and so forth.

That was driven entirely by survey data.  There was no CSO component in this except what came from the census.

As was highlighted by Mr. Costello, there is a constant tension between what the Department of Education and Skills and DEJI hope to achieve as policy objectives in the higher education sector.  That is sometimes difficult to reconcile because universities are seen as elements of the national industrial policy.  If one were to go back to the mid-1950s and examine higher education policy and the analysis of human capital policy, they were not seen as much as part of the national industrial policy but as part of a wider social and manpower policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021100002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Charles Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1423659600,"counter":537,"content":"<p>When will the research be completed?

They are looking at their analysis now and the NESC work for the Cassells group will probably have to use some of the work we have done because on the issue of diversification of income, it is clear that institutions that have more diversified income have a stronger economic impact because there is less of an opportunity cost unless one is talking about areas with profoundly slack aggregate demand.  The stimulation provided by a higher education institution in such areas is more a reflection of the fact that there is above average unemployment and below average economic activity than anything else.  In the UK, these types of studies have begun to be used by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to bring about new campuses in locations referred to by the Minister there as economic cold spots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021100002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Charles Larkin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423659600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I would like to make a number of closing comments, including on the issue raised by the Chairman.

It has also been a less well co-ordinated system and the direction is national policy is towards a diverse but better co-ordinated system.  Two aspects are important in that regard.  The first is that there used to be a great deal of talk about parity of esteem among institutions.  The benefit of the HEA's strategic dialogue and compacts process is that it asks institutions how well they fulfil their chosen mission and their standing will ultimately be determined by how well they do so within a system of diverse but co-ordinated institutions.  We do not want institutions all doing the same thing.<\/p> <p>  However, we would like to provide the committee with an additional note on the question of access and diversity of entry routes, which the Chairman raised, because there has been significant activity in that space in the university sector.

From the Office of Public Works I am joined by Ms Clare McGrath, chairman; Mr. Tony Smyth, director of engineering; and Mr. Michael Long, accountant.<br\/><br\/>As Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I am pleased to set out some of the priority programmes of work to be funded from the 2015 Revised Estimate for the OPW.<br\/><br\/>As members will know, the OPW is responsible for a wide variety of functions, with an overall budget of &euro;397 million in 2015.  The principal areas of responsibility reflect two priority areas of the Government's programme - flood risk management and estate portfolio management.  Before I address these two areas, I take the opportunity to remind committee members that the funding presented to them today, as part of the Revised Estimate, does not represent the full extent of the OPW's activities.  In 2014 the OPW also incurred expenditure on behalf of other Departments and agencies which amounted to some &euro;126 million.  The main areas of this expenditure were the provision of schools for the Department of Education and Science, the newly developed national children detention facility in Oberstown for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the delivery of the Intreo programme for the Department of Social Protection and the leasing of accommodation on a repayment basis for numerous Government clients.  In addition, the office's professional and technical staff also perform in an advisory capacity across a wide variety of functions which include energy conservation, architectural matters and property management.<br\/><br\/>On the topic of flood risk management, members of the committee are well aware that the OPW is the lead agency in the management of flood risk in Ireland.It has invested over &euro;400 million in flood risk management measures to provide protection for homes and businesses across the country.  Under the framework for capital investment up to 2016, the Government committed &euro;225 million to flood risk management, a substantial capital allocation which is enabling the OPW to continue its flood risk management programme in conjunction with the local authorities.  Despite regular reductions in capital funding, the OPW has made every effort to prioritise this area of investment in recent years.  A capital allocation of &euro;60 million is provided for the programme in 2015. <br\/><br\/>In order to implement the State's strategy for flood risk management , the OPW has developed a catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme in recent years.  The CFRAM programme lies at the core of the assessment of flood risk management and will allow Ireland to meet its commitments under the EU flood directive.  The programme is focused on 300 areas of potentially significant risk.  These areas are known as areas for further assessment, AFAs, within the programme.  A comprehensive suite of flood maps is being produced for each AFA which will represent a significant addition to and complement the existing flood mapping produced by the OPW.  The ongoing programme is looking at all possible options to address flood risk in each AFA and will identify the optimal measures for inclusion<font color=\"#0000E0\"> <\/font>in the flood risk management plans to be produced under the programme.  Members are probably well aware of this in their constituencies from ongoing consultations on the matter.  The programme will set out the medium to long-term strategy and, subject to resources, prioritise a programme of work to achieve the effective and sustainable management of flood risk in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>For members' information, the current position is that flood maps are being produced by the OPW.  It is only through the clear identification of the risk now and in different climate change scenarios in the future that all of the main stakeholders concerned, both nationally and at local level, can work<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>together towards implementation of sustainable measures to manage that risk.  In line with this approach in recent years, numerous major flood relief projects are being advanced by the OPW and at various stages of completion.  The schemes in Bray, for the River Dodder, in Fermoy, Waterford and Ennis are just some of the ones under construction, with considerable investment committed to in 2015.  Many other schemes are at various stages of planning, with a view to starting construction this year.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Simon Harris\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FI2&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Simon Harris\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Many areas of the country, mainly coastal areas, were impacted on during the adverse weather in December 2013 and the early months 2014.  To repair the public infrastructure that was damaged, the Government allocated funding to various Departments, including &euro;19.1 million to the OPW.  The chairman of the Office of Public Works wrote to the committee last month providing details of the funding and payments made by the OPW to local authorities in 2014 in respect of damaged coastal protection infrastructure.  Provision is included in the 2015 OPW Estimate to meet the storm damage funding allocations which some local authorities were unable to draw down in 2014.<\/p><p> In tandem with its major capital projects, the OPW has provided almost &euro;27 million in funding for local authorities since 2009 to carry out localised minor works where a requirement for such works is identified and they meet the eligibility criteria set out under the scheme.  The OPW has established excellent working relationships with the local authorities and this, together with the considerable funding provided for them, has proved to be a key factor in maximising the capacity of the minor works scheme, with approximately 460 projects completed to date under the scheme. <\/p><p> The estate portfolio management programme, on the other side of the Vote, encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio, including the conservation, protection and presentation of national monuments and national historic properties in State care.  Property represents the second highest administrative cost to the Government in the provision of public services after pay and pensions.  The Office of Public Works has been given the considerable task by Government of rationalising the State's property portfolio in order to reduce that cost and reflect the substantial fall in staff numbers across the Civil Service in recent years.<\/p><p> The ownership of State property is legally vested across many State authorities and agencies, which can at times result in an independent approach by each State entity to managing its property portfolio.  Changing this approach by legislation to a more centralised model would be an onerous undertaking and thus the Government decided that a collaborative and consistent approach by State property managers in dealing with property would be the most effective manner to progress this particular reform.  With this in mind, the Government appointed the Office of Public Works as lead of the steering group on property asset management to co-ordinate and drive this reform.<\/p><p> As protocols for streamlining intra-State use of public service property are being developed within the group, we are already seeing more effective engagement by public property holders.  Optimising value for money and the enhanced use of State properties for the public good continue to be pursued through an ongoing property disposal programme and a more streamlined administrative and legal process for the valuation, transfer and sharing of property.  Strategic property related decisions are being facilitated by an intra-State property register, developed by the OPW, which is being populated with property data from all State property holders.  Ministers have given their full commitment to ensuring their Departments and agencies will co-operate fully.  The plan will, over time, promote agreed targets for space allocation per full-time equivalent employee to be achieved by Departments.<\/p><p> From the OPW's perspective, office accommodation was recognised a number of years ago as one area where significant savings could be made.  I am glad to update the committee that, since 2008, the OPW has undertaken a major rationalisation programme that has resulted in the surrender of over 1.2 million sq. ft. of office accommodation and yielded a cumulative reduction of over &euro;111 million in rent.  In that period the OPW has surrendered 276 leases, with an annual rental value of &euro;34.7 million, while rent reductions were negotiated by the OPW on 121 leases between 2008 and 2014.  The annual rental value of reductions achieved is &euro;8.59 million. <\/p><p> The drive to further optimise office space needs to continue and will be facilitated by establishing a revised workplace definition for the public service based on space allocation required for the functions being performed by staff.  Departmental accommodation requests will be addressed through examining alternative, flexible modern working practices and encouraging Departments to review records management processes and storage needs in order to optimise space requirements and achieve best value for the money invested.<\/p><p> As part of the project management service provided, the OPW will continue to deliver both major and minor works to a variety of Government clients.  This year will see major Garda accommodation projects on site at Wexford and Galway and on Kevin Street in Dublin, while the development of Kilmainham Gaol and courthouse will be completed in time for the commemoration of the 1916 Rising.  <\/p><p> In the area of property maintenance the OPW has assumed funding responsibility in recent years for the provision of a shared service for Departments.  The funding for works relating to building maintenance of State property to the value of almost &euro;20 million transferred to the OPW in 2013.  This allowed the OPW the opportunity to manage maintenance on a prioritised, whole of government basis and initiate a planned preventive maintenance works programme, which will produce savings in the medium term and deliver better care for the fabric of the State's buildings. <\/p><p> Within the area of estate portfolio management, heritage services manage the conservation and presentation of 760 national monuments and 30 national historic properties, with a combined provision of 70 visitor centres across the country.  Through targeted presentation by the OPW, visitor numbers to heritage sites have increased by 33% since 2010.  The free first Wednesday initiative, for example, has contributed greatly to the increase in visitor numbers.  Visitor numbers at staffed heritage sites continue to grow, with 4.4 million visitors recorded in 2014 and multiples of that number visiting open sites around the country.  The focus of heritage services in recent years has been on the protection and maintenance of structures, with a greater emphasis on minor improvements works, rather than on major capital projects.  Any investment funds available will go to sites most in need and, importantly, to where capacity has been identified that will generate increased business and receipts.  The planned reinvestment of surplus receipts generated from creating such additional capacity will support a strong incentive to increase activity at heritage sites and improve business opportunities.  It is a key initiative.<\/p><p> On staffing, I am pleased to inform the committee that, after an absence of some years, the OPW has reintroduced the apprenticeship programme.  This topic came up at Question Time this morning.  The national monuments division has recently recruited 21 apprentices in the crafts of carpentry, joinery and stone masonry.  They will be the first participants in the inaugural SOLAS stone curriculum.  This is a valuable development in the field of conservation and will maintain and sustain these skills to the benefit of the OPW, the wider State sector and the country into the future.  In tandem with this initiative, the OPW continues to demonstrate its commitment to training and work placement through its ongoing programmes that enhance the professional development of professional graduates, while making a contribution to the work of the office.  <\/p><p> I acknowledge and highlight the substantial contribution the OPW's staff play in these programmes of work for the State.  Since my appointment as Minister of State, I have had the opportunity to experience at first-hand the professionalism of many staff cohorts across the office, ranging from the engineering staff dealing with drainage maintenance and flooding crises in communities to the exceptional guiding staff at heritage sites who are ambassadors for tourism in many parishes and communities.  I compliment all staff of the office on their work and ongoing commitment in the challenging environment they continue to face.  <\/p><p> I thank committee members and look forward to taking questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#A00800","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Will we hear a short opening statement by each member before dealing with the individual subheads?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#B00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I have some specific questions to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#B00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>We will, therefore, go straight to the first subhead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#B00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

I will concentrate on a few issues, one of which is flood risk management and the State's portfolio.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State says the OPW does a lot of work on behalf of other Departments.  It manages the Leinster House complex, Government Buildings, Dublin Castle and many other places.  There used to be an issue of being paid by the relevant Department.  How much money is due to be paid by Departments and how much is owed for longer than 12 months?  Are there amounts for which the OPW has billed Departments that have not been paid?  It may be on a sheet of paper in someone's drawer in the OPW or on a sheet of paper in someone else's drawer at the other end, but it is relevant in considering the financing of the OPW.<\/p> <p>  I was disturbed by one newspaper headline on an article written by a journalist about paintings missing in the Leinster House complex.  It gave the impression that it had happened after the previous general election.  In fact, it almost gave the impression that some Deputies had run away with them.  It could be seen in the light that paintings could not be located after the previous general election.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Sean Fleming\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FI2&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Sean Fleming\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Will the Minister of State provide an update on this issue?

Why is it involved in this regard?  I thought most of the PPPs relating to these projects would involve the Department of Education and Skills or individual school boards of management.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister of State expand on the position on the OPW's delivery of Government initiatives in terms of commemoration projects?  There is only a 1% increase in this regard.  There is a very big centenary coming up next year, namely, that of the 1916 Rising.  I would have liked to have seen a significant increase in the Estimate for 2015 in preparation for next year's events.  An increase of 1% in the entire subhead for heritage services does not give the impression that sufficient planning is taking place in the commemoration of the 1916 Rising.  Perhaps the Minister of State might outline the position in greater detail.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister of State provide a rundown iof the Intreo public offices managed by the OPW?  This is a relatively new project and remains a work in progress.<\/p> <p>  The next issue to which I wish to refer relates to the old decentralisation programme and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's offices in Portlaoise.  This matter has been discussed by the joint committee and I tabled a number of parliamentary questions on it.  Essentially, the Minister of State confirmed in reply to one of these parliamentary questions that sanction had been given for an extension to the offices in Portlaoise.  There are 11 offices leased in the town and the Minister of State provided information on all of them.  Having already sanctioned the extension, it appears the OPW is now going to conduct a space audit in the coming months.  Does the sanction still obtain or will it have to be amended in the light of the results of the space audit?  Why was sanction given, particularly as the OPW is now obliged to engage in such an audit?  If the Minister of State does not have the relevant information to hand, he can forward it to me.<\/p> <p>  My final point is on subhead B10 - unitary payments.  The OPW is managing the National Convention Centre in Dublin on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport by way of a public private partnership.  It is indicated that the costs to be borne by the State will be met by means of single unitary payments from the OPW Vote over a 25-year period which commenced in mid-2010 and that the final capital payment will be made in 2015.  The briefing note we have received indicates that for the period 2012 to 2015, inclusive, capital payments amounted to &euro;75 million.  The total is probably even greater, particularly if earlier payments were made.  The capital payments on the National Convention Centre are running at approximately &euro;30 million per year.  Over a period of 25 years, this amounts to &euro;750 million.  Therefore, the total involved will be over &euro;800 million.  What was the total cost involved during the lifetime of the PPP for the National Convention Centre?

Frankly, matters in this regard have become silly.  There is no view within the OPW that anybody went off with a load of paintings in the back of his or her car.  Let us be very clear on that point.  However, there are lessons that need to be learned about the inventory of State art.  We have adopted the necessary procedures.  Any Deputy with an office in Leinster House or any public building is entitled to hang State art on the wall.  There is a perception that such art is locked away in vaults, but that is not the case.  It can be found in Garda stations, Intreo offices and Leinster House.  Some of it could be hung in the Deputy's offices if he was so minded.  As he is aware, there tends to be a significant churn of personnel in these Houses.  Members lose their seats, while others are promoted and demoted.  There are those who will leave pictures on the walls of their offices when they leave, while others will take them with them when they move offices.  That is our understanding of what happens.  However, 21 artworks remain listed on the OPW art asset register.  These may have been moved to different office spaces within and outside Leinster House without the Superintendent's staff being notified.  Several artworks have been located in other Departments or offices during inventory checks in recent years.  The issue is not particular to Leinster House, although referencing the Parliament tends to make for a good media story on occasion.  My officials had discussions with the Superintendent on this matter and he has agreed to circulate images of the unlocated works to assist the inventory process.  During the summer months I expect my staff to dedicate a little more time to this matter in order that we might try to bring it to finality.  There is no assertion on my behalf or that of the Office of Public Works that anybody ran off with the paintings in question.  However, there are lessons to be learned.  The OPW, as an agency, is eager to ensure State art is displayed.  There are a number of peace initiatives, as part of which we take State art on tours, both North and South.  We are very eager that State art be accessible, that it should not be locked away in vaults and that it should be displayed in public buildings.  I am happy to debunk that myth.<\/p> <p>  A decision was taken by the Government that the OPW would directly contract work in order to assist in the delivery of schools.  This was viewed as a speedier method of proceeding.  The projects are directly contracted from us and I can supply the Deputy with the details.<\/p> <p>  As all Deputies will be aware, a number of Departments are involved in planning next year's commemorations.  The lead Department is the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It would be useful to provide the Deputy with an overview of the OPW's involvement in the process.  As stated, Kilmainham Courthouse is going to be renovated and integrated into the Kilmainham Gaol visitor attraction.  This is going to be of major benefit to what is one of our most popular and heavily visited tourism sites.  Since taking up my position, one of the most common complaints I have heard is that, such is the level of demand, tourists are obliged to queue for lengthy periods to obtain access in Kilmainham.  If not actually in Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's constituency, this attraction is located close enough for her to know it well.  The idea is that a new visitor space and entrance will be created at the former Kilmainham Sessions Courthouse, which will greatly expand capacity and the value of the experience.  The Government has made &euro;5.5 million in funding available for this project, as one of the signature capital developments associated with the 2016 anniversary.  There were 328,886 visitors to Kilmainham Gaol in 2014, 326,200 in 2013 and 310,910 in 2011.  Urgent repair works have been undertaken to protect the fabric of the courthouse and prepare for the more significant works to be carried out by our property maintenance services which will be completed in quarter 1 of 2015 at a total approximate cost of &euro;3 million.  In addition to the courthouse project, the OPW is also undertaking work to adapt and refurbish the gaol museum, which is obviously also a key part of the visitor experience.<\/p> <p>  A restoration programme has been put in train at Glasnevin Cemetery.  Works to be undertaken on memorials are funded from the general grant to the cemetery.  Obviously, however, we provide any co-operation and assistance we can.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioners of Public Works have statutory responsibility under the National Monuments Act to undertake the care and maintenance of national monuments.  There are a number of historic properties under the care of the OPW, including Kilmainham Gaol, Arbour Hill, the Garden of Remembrance, Pearse Cottage in County Galway for which significant funding has been provided, Dublin Castle and the Pearse Museum at St. Enda's Park in Rathfarnham.  We will be fulfilling our statutory remit in protecting these properties.  As the Deputy is aware, a new Cabinet sub-committee charged with dealing with this issue has been appointed and on which the OPW is represented.<\/p> <p>  I have an update for the Deputy on Intreo offices.  The Government set the OPW and the Department of Social Protection a very ambitious target-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#C00800","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I want to give everyone a chance to come in first.

The first ten Intreo offices were delivered in May 2012 and a further 35 offices were handed over in 2013 and 2014.  The remainder are targeted for delivery in 2015.  In a number of towns Intreo has been delivered across two locations.  The Intreo programme is estimated to cost in excess of &euro;40 million.  Where possible, the OPW and the Department of Social Protection will work within existing available space.  However, at 20 locations, additional accommodation or leases will be required.  Many of the projects targeted for completion in 2014 have rolled over into early 2015.  I am happy to acknowledge that fact.  Given that it has been an ambitious programme, property solutions have been found, on occasion, to be complex.  This has involved the splitting of the Intreo offices into two locations.  However, the majority of Intreo offices are complete or will be complete by the end of this month.  I can provide more detail if the committee wishes.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fleming knows the history of the issue of Portlaoise far better than I do.  While there was a decision taken, there is no funding to make that decision a reality. As a result, the OPW has been considering the scenario.  We have given a commitment to carry out a space audit.  I reckon that is the prudent thing to do at this stage.  I know from my colleagues across Government that several public servants and civil servants working in various Departments are based in Portlaoise.  We are going to carry out the space audit.  The current annual rent for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine lease in Portlaoise is a little short of &euro;634,000.  The rent has been reduced from approximately &euro;926,000.  There is one matter I am somewhat concerned about, which comes up from time to time in parliamentary questions, although not necessarily from Deputy Fleming.  It is the idea that if we have a lease, it is not a permanent building.  Sometimes, the OPW uses leasing as a more appropriate way of providing a permanent facility.  It is not necessarily a short-term lease.  I am happy to continue to engage with Deputy Fleming on the matter.  Anyway, we are carrying out the space audit.  That is the most up-to-date position.<\/p> <p>  The unitary payments in respect of the National Convention Centre will be phased out over time.  Committee members will note there were significant payments in 2012, 2013 and 2014, but they have been decreasing each year.  The capital payment in 2012 was &euro;20.221 million, whereas in 2015 it is &euro;13.5 million.  The project cost is &euro;380 million.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#D00800","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions.

I realise the Minister of State may be limited in the nature of his commentary overall.  However, I call on him to set out the role of the OPW in this as well as anything he may be able to do by way of finding a solution.  To my mind, any solution requires entirely new planning permission as well as a new concept for Moore Street and the historic buildings.<\/p> <p>  I note that under subhead B8 the Department is paying more than &euro;86 million in rent.

It is a substantial budget.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to raise the issue of the National Convention Centre as well.  The Minister of State will be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a rather damning report on that project.  He found that the high cost of the project would outweigh its public benefit over the next century.  Obviously, he wrote that when we were approaching the new century.  Anyway, it is rather shocking.  In fairness to the Minister of State, the unitary payments have been scaled down, but they are still very substantial.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland reckons the potential benefit of the Conference Centre to the economy over the 25-year period when the payments are being made will be somewhere in the region of &euro;170 to &euro;255 million, well short of the investment by the State.

My predecessor established a memorandum of understanding between Insurance Ireland and the Office of Public Works.  The understanding was that the Office of Public Works would make available all details of flood mitigation works carried out by it.  In turn, Insurance Ireland would make that information available to its member organisations.  The information could then be considered by them in assessing risk.  As everyone knows, the OPW does not have a role in regulating the insurance industry.  However, the OPW is the lead body in respect of flood mitigation and it can make all the information available.  That is what we are doing.  Insurance Ireland representatives have come back to my officials in recent days with the first progress report on what it has done with the information it has been given.  As soon as that is analysed I would be glad to come back to the committee with it.  I may be broadening my remit somewhat as Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, because we do not have a policy role, but I am a Minister of State at the Department of Finance as well.  Anyway, I believe that as a country we need to have a serious discussion about flood insurance.  I have looked at examples in other countries.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Simon Harris\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FI2&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Simon Harris\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There does not seem to be a magic wand solution.  They are doing something in the UK.  We need to watch and see if that works.  We could learn from that.  They have started a few initiatives in France which have not worked and which have been unwound.  We are unlikely to get into a detailed flooding discussion because we had one at the previous meeting, but if the State is gearing up to invest even more significant amounts of taxpayers' money in flood mitigation over the next decade, we need to have a scenario in which people can obtain flood insurance for both commercial properties and residential homes.<br\/><br\/>A dual approach is needed.  The first approach, in which I have a direct role, is that the OPW gives the information to Insurance Ireland to pass on to its member organisations, which should let us see an increase in insurance coverage and good faith in return.  However, if that does not work, I have an open mind on what we should do.  While I do not wish to give the committee more work, I would be eager to engage on this on a cross-party basis.  I will revert to the committee with the first progress report from the industry's point of view on flood insurance in the coming weeks.  I would appreciate its help on that.<br\/><br\/>I do not have a role in the Moore Street issue.  My role covers property taken into State care.  There is then a duty on my office to maintain it.  These buildings have not been taken into State care and, therefore, it is a policy matter for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<br\/><br\/>We have had significant success on rents over recent years.  A total of 1.2 million sq. ft. of office space has been surrendered, which equates to 276 leases.  Department rents have fallen from &euro;131 million in 2008 to an expected outturn this year of &euro;87.4 million through a programme of lease renegotiations and surrenders.  The OPW continues to progress the property asset management delivery plan to ensure further opportunities.  We have plans to further reduce leases this year.  We have a surrender target of 16 leases, 15 of which are in Dublin.  This will amount to 349,717 sq. ft.  This work is not finished, though we have achieved a great deal.  There are also plans to move to OPW-owned properties.  There will be lease surrenders, for example, by Department of Social Protection local offices.  The headline target is further lease surrenders, the overwhelming majority of which will be in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>I have inherited a legal reality where the convention centre is concerned.  The contracts are signed and it is a legal agreement.  The decision was not mine or the Deputy's but it was taken in the context of the ancillary benefit to the State of having this facility available and attracting conferences.  It is my office's role to administer that legal reality and that is what we are doing.  As the Deputy acknowledged, the cost is decreasing.  With regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's comments and whether lessons have been learned, it is a matter for the National Development Finance Agency, but I will revert to the Deputy on that as well because serious issues have been raised.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the issue of Government public services, the increased requirement in 2015 is for additional printing costs of approximately &euro;65,000 relating to the publication in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>by the Department of Justice and Equality of the details of approximately 66,000 non-nationals to whom citizenship was granted in 2010 and 2013.

None of us believes that insurance companies are not mapping risk.  If the fact that Ireland and other European countries are complying with an EU floods directive in the interest of their citizens to map flooding on a methodical basis, make it public and set out in a systemic way a list of projects that need to be done, it would be regrettable if the industry suggested that would create new risk in any shape or form.  I have spoken to industry representatives about this.  I told them that we will continue to make available the information we have and keep them in the loop.  They are involved in a number of CFRAM stakeholder groups.  I am disappointed when I hear the feedback the Deputy has given, because we are not creating new risk, but I hear it from time to time.  Nobody is at a greater risk of being flooded because the OPW is mapping the risk.  We will lessen the risk by being able to seek funding from Government to properly address it.  However, we have been clear that the maps are preliminary.

It has not moved and is not likely to move, given the new information the Minister of State has provided.  He has quite rightly said it already had information he will continue providing.  There are people in every constituency who cannot get insurance and who continue to be at risk of flooding, for example in Baltrasna Lane, in my own neck of the woods, on 13 November.  These people are out of their homes for months on end and suffer &euro;30,000 worth of damage every time there is a flood and they cannot get insurance.  What steps will the Department take?  Does it need to bring in new legislation?  There must be at least a minimal level of insurance that insurers must be obliged to provide to certain people.

I cannot speak for my predecessor.  He put in place this arrangement, which has been very good, to establish the sharing of information.  We are now at crunch time.  We have the first progress report.  We need to see whether all that engagement and time-consuming effort by the Department&rsquo;s officials in meeting with the insurance industry yielded results for the citizens.  We told the insurance industry we had reduced the flooding risk in an area and asked it what it had done.  We will have the initial overview of that shortly.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct to ask where do we go if there is no co-operation.  I do not want to jump that hurdle or to presume.  I want to engage in this in good faith.  Co-operation is the easiest way from every perspective, including that of our constituents but I genuinely appeal to this committee to work with me on where we go if that does not happen.  Before I worry the chairman of the OPW and others, the OPW does not have a mandate in respect of flood insurance or insurance policy or regulation.  However, across Government, be it in the Department of Finance, or through a Government decision, there are policy options.  When I started exploring options, out of curiosity and frustration for my own constituents, I found that the policy options I thought might work did not.  It was difficult to find a perfect model.  I would be very happy to engage with the committee on this issue.  Insurance Ireland, OPW officials and officials of the Department of Finance will have a round table discussion on this issue because it is a question of wanting to work and to co-operate with people but we also have to ask what happens if the State spends nearly &euro;1 billion putting in place schemes.  In fairness to the industry, it is important to say there will be several new schemes coming on stream &ndash; pardon the pun - for flood mitigation.  We continue to roll them out.  We will continue to provide that and to engage.  I am not in the business of an engagement that does not yield results or of deploying public time and resources should it not.  I hope it does.  I am entering into it in good faith but I would really appreciate the input of everybody on the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#F00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Before we move from that point, the committee has decided as part of its work programme to consider the insurance issue.

I assure the Deputy it is not window dressing.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question about where all the people are gone, there are fewer people working in the public service and that has been reflected in property choices and decisions made by this office in consultation with Government clients over recent years.

Subsequent conversations and correspondence revealed that would be pushed forward.  It is not mentioned anywhere in this year&rsquo;s budget.  No further discussion has been held about it.  We have one of the most precious sites in the country in Meath and there is not even a toilet there for people who visit it.  There is not a visitor centre there to open five days a week, let alone seven days a week.  It is an absolute shame that there has been near on zero investment in one of the most beautiful sites in the country.  What are the plans in that regard for this year?

I have tentatively raised this issue with the local authority and it has no objection in principle.  It would also assist in shrinking the timeline involved in getting a project like this, critical local infrastructure, to a stage where it can proceed to construction.  Could the Minister of State confirm that there is not a problem from his side in working with the council, notwithstanding previous hiccups the OPW has had with the council, to resolve a single design team?  There could be two very fine designs done by the respective design teams that might not be compatible on a single site and it would be better if one team was designing the fire station and the new Garda station.

There are a number of reforms.  I have to say this sincerely.  In this role over the past seven or eight months I have had the opportunity to travel to an awful lot of OPW sites, many of which I had never been at before.  The dedication and commitment of the staff, who, like so many right across the public service, have had to deal with fewer colleagues in the workplace, pay reductions, harder work and all that sort of stuff, is something of which we can all be really proud.  That is seen in the visitor numbers.  Even in a scenario with fewer staff on the sites and given the challenges for anybody working in the public or private sector during an economic crisis, to actually see these people continuing to increase visitor numbers is something of which we can be really proud.<\/p> <p>  From an economic point of view, the OPW has managed to take on a substantial body of extra work and it is important to say that it is extra work.  The Government makes decisions and the OPW then has to get on and deliver the decisions.

We are seeing a lot of each other today.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the 2015 Estimates for my Department&rsquo;s group of Votes.  The group, as the Chairman said, comprises a significant number of Votes.  It contains the Vote for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Vote for the Office of Government Procurement, the Vote for shared services, the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of my Department, namely, the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the Valuation Office and the Office of the Ombudsman, the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances, which covers Civil Service pensions, and the Secret Service.  The Vote for the remaining element of the public expenditure and reform group, that for the Office of Public Works, is handled separately by the sub-committee.<\/p> <p>  In total, we are seeking for these Votes just short of &euro;504 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;30 million, or 6%, compared with the original 2014 Estimate.  Almost &euro;19 million of the &euro;30 million increase is due to the timing of the 1 January 2015 pay bill, which had the effect of creating an additional fortnightly pay bill in 2015.  If we exclude this item, the actual increase is 2%.<\/p> <p>  The Public Expenditure and Reform Vote comprises two programmes, as sub-committee members will know, public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform.  In regard to the first programme, the sub-committee will recall my appearance before it a fortnight ago, on 28 January, to discuss the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015-2017.  My statement on that day dealt in detail with the areas covered by the first programme.  In the circumstances, I do not think that it will be necessary to go back over the same territory today, but I am of course willing to answer any queries which might arise.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the provision for Vote 11 for my Department, we are seeking a net funding allocation of &euro;40.61 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;4.7 million compared with 2014.  The increase is required primarily for the second programme of my Department, public service management and reform, where additional funding is required to progress the ambitious targets set out in our recent public service ICT strategy.  ICT has been recognised as a critical component for the successful delivery of many existing public services.  The public service ICT strategy which has been approved by the Government will enable the public service to build on these successes and use ICT to operate in a more efficient, shared and integrated manner across all Departments.  The increase will also support the implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan, which is a key programme for Government commitment.<\/p> <p>  As set out in the public service reform plan, public service reform has been, and will continue to be, a key element of the Government's strategy for recovery.  I acknowledge that the level of reform we have delivered would not have happened without the efforts and commitment of public servants, and I commend all of them on their contribution to date.  The Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 has a strong focus on service improvement and the delivery of improved outcomes for service users.  In addition, it maintains the emphasis on efficiency measures which was a key element of our first reform programme published in November 2011.<\/p> <p>  Implementation of the reforms set out in the plan and in the complementary departmental and sectoral integrated reform delivery plans will facilitate ongoing service improvements and cost savings into the future.  Substantial progress has been made on public service reform across a range of areas in terms of reducing costs, delivering better value for money and improving services.  Details of this programme will be set out in the annual progress report on implementation of the reform plan which is due to be published next month.<\/p> <p>  Staff numbers have been reduced, as members know, by around 10% since 2008, and the pay bill has been reduced by more than 20% since the peak of 2009.  Our programme of public service reform has delivered significant efficiencies and increased productivity.  It has also enabled us to maintain and improve public services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets while meeting increased demand for services.<\/p> <p>  Examples of measures to reduce costs include reforms in the areas of public procurement, shared services, alternative models of service delivery, ICT and digital government, and property management.  A core principle of the reform plan is to use some of what I have classified as the reform dividend from increased efficiencies to reinvest in new or improved services.  Savings made have already facilitated the recruitment of extra staff in key front-line public services, as I indicated to the House today.<\/p> <p>  Sub-committee members will be aware that, together with the Taoiseach, I launched the Civil Service renewal plan on 30 October 2014.  This innovative plan incorporates a vision and a three-year action plan.  It represents a fundamentally new direction for the Civil Service.  Renewing the Civil Service is a key part of the overall public service reform programme.  The plan has been crafted to build on the existing strengths of the Civil Service and to take actions where required to improve the capacity and capability of the Civil Service to meet existing and future challenges.  All of the actions in the plan will support a higher performing and more open and accountable Civil Service.<\/p> <p>  The key themes of the programme are for the Civil Service to be unified, responsive, professional, open and accountable.  The immediate focus now is the work involved in delivering on the six priorities for implementation by the summer.  The priorities are: the establishment of an accountability board, which is well in train; the creation of a Civil Service management board, which has already been done; the establishment of the first performance review process for Secretaries General; identifying available options to strengthen the disciplinary code, in particular to address underperformance; to extend open recruitment in key areas to fill the skills gaps that are now emerging; and to undertake the first Civil Service-wide employee engagement survey.  I am looking forward to overseeing progress in the implementation of the renewal plan this year and working with my colleagues across the Government to support the changes.<\/p> <p>  The reform and delivery office, or RDO, within my Department is overseeing and driving the reform programme across the Civil Service.  It is, of course, often necessary to invest in the short term to facilitate change and ensure savings will accrue in the medium term.  For this reason, the RDO has been allocated &euro;1.99 million in 2015 from the reform agenda fund.  The funding for the RDO will be used to support a number of reform initiatives and projects, including the implementation of the public service reform plan, as I said, implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan and funding for investment in the reactivation of the Irish non-profit knowledge exchange, INKEx, database.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Howlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=535\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Brendan Howlin\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FI2&amp;amp;memberid=535&amp;amp;pid=BrendanHowlin&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Brendan Howlin\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will happily give more details about the database because it is a very exciting project.  We will also provide support <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">for external service delivery projects and seed funding for new shared services projects.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Overall, I am satisfied that the progress we have made on public service reform is very significant.  Of course, I am very conscious that we need to maintain a strong focus on the delivery of reform to ensure that we continue to have a sustainable and flexible Civil Service into the future.  To this end, my Department will continue to work with all Departments and offices, particularly with larger sectors, to ensure that services are delivered efficiently and that outcomes for services and service users are improved.<\/font><br\/><br\/>I shall now discuss public service pay.  The Haddington Road Agreement forms the cornerstone of pay policy up until 2016 when it is due to expire.  The recovery in the economy is in no small part due to the contribution made by public servants in keeping the cost of the public service pay bill at a sustainable level. <br\/><br\/>The public service gross pay bill was reduced from its peak of &euro;17.5 billion in 2009 to an estimated &euro;13.8 billion net of the pension-related deduction last year.  The cost reductions and the substantial productivity increases, including additional hours worked, which the Haddington Road Agreement and previous public service agreements have facilitated, have allowed the Government the scope to reinvest in key front-line services such as education, health and policing by recruiting additional staff to deliver those services.  This is a reform dividend that will help sustain the public service reform agenda by reinvesting some of the efficiency savings we are delivering into improved services. <br\/><br\/>Effective management of our fiscal affairs also requires us to plan for and address the public service pay and pension reduction measures which are based on emergency based legislation.  I refer to the so-called FEMPI legislation.  As our fiscal position improves, the emergency basis on which the financial emergency measures are singularly based no longer forms a secure legal basis for the continuation of the legislation in its present form.  <br\/><br\/>Nevertheless, I have made it clear that public service pay rates will continue to be frozen this year.  It is the seventh successive year in which there will have been no pay increases for public servants.  As we know, there have been two or in some cases three cuts in wages.  <br\/><br\/>While there have been some comments on the issue of increases to public service pay, it is important, as I have said this morning, that expectations in this regard are realistic.  I have identified that at a minimum, my preference is to have the first quarter Exchequer returns available to me to inform any response to pay claims submitted by public servants and their unions which will form part of discussions in coming months.  Any such discussions on pay will take place in the context of the State's fiscal position and the pace of financial recovery for this year and next.  The current financial stability, which was hard won, will not be jeopardized.<br\/><br\/>One of the most notable features of the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements is that both the Government and the public service unions strove to find a negotiated solution in very difficult circumstances, where public servants were being asked to contribute so much both financially and in terms of real and genuine reform.  I expect that future negotiations, including any discussions that might take place this year, will also be carried out in good faith and in accordance with the industrial relations machinery in place.<br\/><br\/>In addition to progress in public service reform, we have been pursuing a wide ranging political reform programme &ndash; the other strand of my Department's second programme of work.  This is aimed at delivering open, accountable and ethical government underpinned by a transparent, efficient and effective public administration system to help rebuild trust in government and in the institutions of the State.  <br\/><br\/>Many of the commitments in the area of political reform, set out in the programme for Government and in the public service reform plan, are now in delivery phase and real progress has been made on a number of fronts.  These include, for example, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, which was enacted in July and commenced in September of that year; the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 which is now the law of the land; the Freedom of Information Act 2014 which was enacted last year; and the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014 which was enacted last year.<br\/><br\/>Turning to other Votes in the PER group, I am aware that the chief procurement officer in my Department, Mr. Paul Quinn, briefed the committee in recent weeks regarding the reform of procurement across the public service and the development of the Office of Government Procurement.  The development of such an office is an important innovation. <br\/><br\/>The procurement reform programme is an important element of Government's overall reform programme.  The procurement reform programme is tasked with delivering increased value for money, more accurate and timely data, and an improvement in the capacity and capability of procurement across the public service.<br\/><br\/>The net funding allocation for the Office of Government Procurement in 2015 is estimated at &euro;18.974 million, compared with &euro;12.431 million last year.  That is a significant increase.  A portion of this funding reflects budget transfers from the national public procurement policy unit and national procurement service, functions that previously resided on my own Department's Vote and on the Vote of the Office of Public Works.  They have migrated into this consolidated Vote.  Further budget reductions will be achieved, across the wider public service, as procurement functions migrate to the centre.  That means there will be savings in a number of other Votes that will be added to the Office of Government Procurement Vote over time.  Procurement of supplies and services represents a very significant portion of overall Government spending.  It is essential that the public service achieves economies of scale and maximum value for money that it expends.<br\/><br\/>We have talked about shared services many times.  Shared services is an innovative business model and a key element of the reform plan that takes advantage of the latest technologies to drive better value for money.  It frees up departmental staff to focus on more strategic areas and core services.  It reduces complexity and duplication across organisations and greatly improves efficiency.  Shared service centres typically take two to three years to become established and stabilised.<br\/><br\/>The national shared services office, within my Department, is leading shared service strategy and implementation of shared services projects within the overall reform and renewal context.  The new office is directly responsible for overseeing shared service projects within the Civil Service.  As part of its wider leadership role, it provides expert guidance and support to other public service sectors in progressing their shared service commitments such as local government.  <br\/><br\/>Solid progress continues to be made across all aspects of the shared services transformation agenda.  PeoplePoint and the Civil Service human resource and pensions shared service now services more than 26,000 employees across 21 different public service bodies.<br\/><br\/>The payroll shared service centre services 20,000 payees across 21 bodies.  It is envisaged that the financial management shared services project will be progressed further this year.  Shared services projects are also being advanced across the wider public service.  As Deputy Fleming will know in particular, Laois County Council is leading the roll-out of a payroll and superannuation shared service for the local government sector which is known as My Pay<i>.  <\/i>Payroll and financial management shared services for the<b><\/b>education and training boards are proceeding as a priority in the education sector<i>.<\/i>A feasibility study and business case for a single integrated financial system is<b><\/b>advancing in the health sector, together with work on e-invoicing. <br\/><br\/>A provision of &euro;39 million is sought for Vote 18 - Shared Services.  The increase, compared with 2014, reflects the ongoing migration of transactional human resources, pensions and payroll processing within the Civil Service to the shared services Vote, together with the advancement of the financial management shared services project.  A significant portion of this increase is mirrored by offsetting reductions on the votes of the originating Departments.  These projects, by their nature, require a certain amount of upfront investment but will yield economies and efficiencies in the medium term.<br\/><br\/>PeoplePoint will become fully operational this year.  The transitioning of payroll shared services will reach a conclusion next year.  The financial management project will return to Government for final decision during the course of this year.<br\/><br\/>In regard to Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, sub-committee members will have received a short summary briefing note on the Vote and its various subheads.  As recorded in that note, the Vote primarily provides for pension and retirement lump sum costs for civil servants, including prison officers, and pension payments for dependants.  The sub-committee will recall that there was a Supplementary Estimate for this Vote last year.  As I emphasised at the time, this is a Vote that is particularly difficult to estimate year on year as expenditure is primarily driven by the variable numbers of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age, and whose years of service and grade-pay level will determine final payment which is variable and uncertain. <br\/><br\/>The majority of persons covered by the Vote, once they reach the age of 60, may opt to retire at any stage before reaching compulsory retirement age, which is generally 65 years of age.  Eligible persons may opt to retire even earlier than 60 years under the terms of cost-neutral early retirement scheme, CNER.  In addition, there will be levels of retirements due to ill health as well as persons becoming eligible to claim preserved pension benefits arising from previous employment within the Civil Service.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Howlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=535\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Brendan Howlin\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FI2&amp;amp;memberid=535&amp;amp;pid=BrendanHowlin&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Brendan Howlin\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are people who are already out but did not qualify for the age until this year.  To illustrate the volatility of personal decisions to voluntarily retire before reaching minimum pension age, in 2012 more than 600 persons opted for CNER, cost-neutral early retirement, while in 2013, just under 80 persons did so.  Approximately 130 persons did so in 2014.<\/p><p> Members of the sub-committee will be aware of the announcement yesterday of an extension to June 2016 of the period within which public servants can retire under the terms and conditions which they held prior to the pay reductions under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  As I stated in my press release, the main considerations for the extension relate to workforce planning and impact on services.  This Estimate, involving a net provision of &euro;370 million, represents a decrease of &euro;14.8 million or 4% on the 2014 net Estimate.<\/p><p> The sub-committee has been supplied with a detailed briefing by my Department&rsquo;s officials on the various Votes in the Public Expenditure and Reform group, including those for the sub-offices of the Department.

What were the specific savings on that?  The lottery regulator is answerable to the sub-committee and this is the first opportunity we have had to discuss this issue.  The Estimate has a figure of &euro;150,000 for the office.  The Minister stated it is anticipated that the new licensee, Premier Lotteries Ireland, will be will be in a position to commence funding the office in 2015 and, therefore, a relatively small budget is required to cover the early costs of the office.  This sub-committee has been asked to provide funding for that office as part of this Estimate.<\/p> <p>  It is extraordinary, however, that as soon as we give the new licence to Premier Lotteries Ireland, for the first time in 30 years the lottery did not take place due to some problem.  What is the role of the lottery regulator in the process?  Will the Minister give us a report from the lottery regulator&rsquo;s office as to when it became aware of the difficulties before the recent &euro;10 million draw had to be postponed?  On the day it occurred, what actions did the lottery regulator take?  Was the office informed of all procedures?  Was the decision not to carry out that Wednesday night lottery taken by the regulator or by the operator?  Whose function is it to make that decision?  I want to know the power of the regulator.  We have seen right across the Oireachtas regulators established which then have become just poodles.  We have seen this with the communications regulator.  The energy regulator has control over Irish Water.  However, when the Government made a decision on water prices, the regulator heard about it just like everybody else.  We have established regulators but ensured they have little power because we have circumscribed their functions.  If the lottery regulator&rsquo;s office is to be funded through this Vote, we need to know why a draw was not held for the first time in 30 years.<\/p> <p>  The Minister stated the State assets disposal programme was brought to completion in 2014, yielding special dividends to the State from the sale of assets of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB of &euro;350 million in 2014 and approximately &euro;1.4 billion in total over 2014 to 2016.  Will the Minister inform us what funding is expected to come through in 2015 and 2016?  If the programme has been brought to a conclusion, does that mean there will be no decision to sell the Government&rsquo;s 25% shares in Aer Lingus?<\/p> <p>  There has been a significant increase in subhead B5, consultancy and other services, from &euro;100,000 last year, with an outturn of &euro;102,000, to &euro;450,000 this year.  The increased allocation in this subhead reflects several new expenditure pressures including legal costs.  The budget has been allocated in respect of costs awarded on foot of a legal challenge taken by the Garda Representative Association on the inclusion of garda&iacute; in cuts to sick leave entitlement for public servants.  Will he explain the background to this case?  Why is this Vote being used to pick up the costs?  Whose decision was it to take this challenge to the courts?  Was it necessary to defend it?  Could common sense not have prevailed before getting into these legal costs?  Are we paying costs for both sides?  What is the practical outcome of this?  Did the Attorney General have a role in this case?  Is that the same Attorney General that the Oireachtas was meant to rely on yesterday?  If it was, the Attorney General may have got this badly wrong too.  We want some details on this particular issue.<\/p> <p>  On the reform agenda, the outturn last year was approximately &euro;700,000 but this year the Minister is looking for &euro;2.4 million.  What reforms will happen this year?  Why is the reform agenda three and a half times more expensive this year compared to other years?<\/p><p>Under the National Lottery Act 2013, the full cost of the lottery regulator is to be borne by the licensee.  Obviously, when we were preparing the Estimate in October, we had to make a provision for &euro;150,000 to cover the operation of the regulator in the course of 2015.  I am advised that it is unlikely that any of these moneys will be used because the full cost of the regulator, including the provision of premises and support staff, will be borne entirely by licensee in accordance with the Act.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Howlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=535\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Brendan Howlin\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FI2&amp;amp;memberid=535&amp;amp;pid=BrendanHowlin&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Brendan Howlin\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have made a provision in case of a carryover of a few thousand euro from last year.

Apparently he has asked for measures to be taken by Premier Lotteries Ireland, PLI, which is the licensee, to avoid a recurrence.  He has also demanded details of testing and any other measures taken to provide assurances.  All of this is being done, I am advised, by the regulator.  The Deputy will recall that during the passage of the Act last year we made the regulator amenable to the House, so it may be worthwhile when the full investigation has concluded to invite him before the committee to go through it in detail and give reassurance, because it is important that people have confidence in the operation of the Lotto as it is a very important national institution <\/p><p> The State asset disposal programme was brought to a completion last year, yielding special dividends of approximately &euro;350 million last year to the State from the sale of assets of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB.

I will not go back over the previous discussion but the Estimate last year for this Vote was &euro;362 million.  The Minister brought in a Supplementary Estimate in December for another &euro;22 million because it is hard to predict the numbers.  We are told the outturn was &euro;368 million which meant the Minister required an additional &euro;7 million, even though he came to us in December looking for &euro;22 million.  I know it is hard to predict but looking for &euro;22 million with only a couple of weeks to go to the end of the year when only &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million was ultimately required seems a good bit off the mark.  It is more of an observation and I acknowledge how difficult it is.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Government announcement yesterday on the extension of the grace period in respect of retirements, to which Deputy McDonald referred, the Minister said he got approval from the Government to extend it to June 2016, which is fine and it probably makes common sense to extend it to the end of the agreement.  I wish to ask about the modalities more than anything else.  That deadline was in the Financial Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  Will this require legislation or a statutory instrument?  <\/p> <p>  The Minister said he was concerned there would be an exodus of senior staff if he did not make this change.  He also stated that an exodus of senior staff would also carry with it the short-term financial effect of once-off superannuation costs.  It is probably asking too much but given that the Minister said in his press release yesterday that a short-term financial effect would have arisen had he not made this change, was he able to advise the Government of what that effect may have been or of the lesser effect, having got that sanction?  I presume that when he went to Government to ask for this sanction, he said it made sense and that there was a financial effect.

I will not mention them by name but one RTE correspondent outside a hospital on the first grace period night was expecting Y2K to happen, everyone to down tools and a mass exodus of people.  However, that did not happen.  We have done something unique in terms of cutting people's pay.  People have had 40 year careers with an expectation of a pension at the end of it.  There was an immediate burden in regard to the actual take home pay they were getting and that we would reduce the impact of that on the pension into which they paid over 40 years.  That is why we had the grace period in the first instance.  I mention those who were not caught by the grace period but who were still caught by the Financial Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  People within the grace period between now and 2016 will, if their pay is impacted - if their pension is more than &euro;32,500 - be caught by the Financial Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 on their actual pension calculation.

Perhaps the Minister will supply a detailed note to the committee on these subheads.  The Estimates never before provided a figure for liabilities under Chapter 2C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Although nobody can predict the ultimate figure, the estimated figure is &euro;1 million.  The Act places joint liability for taxes due on the trustees of pension schemes where an individual's pension benefit from all sources exceeds &euro;2 million.  While this liability has not arisen to date, a provision of &euro;1 million is being made for 2015.  The threshold value for a pension scheme has decreased enormously from &euro;5 million, to &euro;3.5 million and now to &euro;2 million.  The pensions value for retiring senior civil servants is probably far higher than &euro;2 million.  Some people will retire on pensions of &euro;100,000 - I am not saying that includes anybody in this room - and the ultimate value of that pension could amount to more than &euro;2 million depending on the individual's life expectancy.  We are into a new era in which legislation that rightly applies to people in the private sector is correspondingly applying to those in the public sector.  However, the idea that the taxpayer should be liable for any tax due because an individual's pension is valued at more than &euro;2 million is difficult to accept.  Surely the liability for any tax due on an individual's pension fund should fall to that individual rather than the junior clerical officers who are paying for it through their taxes.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps I am misreading the matter but I ask the Minister to clarify why he is making this provision and the circumstances behind his decision.  He is probably taking a prudent approach, and the liability might arise this year.  I do not mind if he takes the time to prepare a detailed note on the matter.  Has he estimated how many public servants in retirement have pension funds valued at in excess of &euro;2 million?  There must be some because this provision would otherwise not be necessary.  I suspect he has information on the matter given that it is a new provision.  I will take whatever cursory evidence he has available now but I also ask for a comprehensive note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#P00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I will provide the committee with a comprehensive note on the matter.  It sounds complicated but it is exactly as the Deputy has indicated.  It is Government policy that significant pension pots shall be liable for tax.  The threshold was very large under the former regime.  People could accumulate an extraordinarily large pension pot on a tax-free basis, that is, subsidised by the taxpayer.  We have reduced that substantially for the private sector and an analogous reduction has to be made for the public sector.<\/p> <p>  Under the Act, once the liability crystalises, it falls to the fund to pay.  If, for example, Deputy Sean Fleming is entitled to a pension of that scale - please God, in due course - he could decide whether, in accordance with the Act, the fund should pay the tax and the tax would be rebated out of his pension entitlements over a period of 20 years.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the estimate of &euro;1 million, it is not a token figure.  I am advised that five individuals are anticipated to come within this category, and there is also contingency for three higher paid civil servants with chargeable excesses in or around &euro;150,000.  In each case, the individuals concerned would be opting to repay the relevant amount over the full 20-year period.  If they take the option of taking a reduced pension payment over the qualifying 20-year period rather than paying the tax out of their lump sums, that is the sum of money for which the trustees - my Department in this case - are liable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#P00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":711,"content":"<p>Does the money have to be remitted to Revenue in the meantime?

Sometimes it does not progress quickly and we must slow the pace.  We are consolidating a range of services while continuing to provide them across the public service.  The incremental budget in 2015 reflects the migration of payroll services to the centre.  Some &euro;5 million of the increase is mirrored in the budget reductions in the originating Vote.  As it migrates into a shared service, there is a saving in the parent Vote, with further budget transfers to be achieved and the migration of all payroll, for example.<\/p> <p>  Client Departments paid &euro;2.5 million for the PeoplePoint service in 2014.  It is intended that this charge will increase to the point where the cost of the service is fully recouped from each Department.  Departments will be required to absorb this cost within their existing resources.  This is something that they have achieved to date.  The 2014 underspend that the Deputy pointed out was driven by a later than anticipated decision on the financial management shared service project, which in turn impacted on expenditure on licensing costs, combined with a later phasing of waves to the other shared services.<\/p> <p>  The provision in this Vote necessarily includes a one-off set of costs that will taper off once the various services become operational.  The committee will see evidence of this in programme B3 on PeoplePoint and programme C3 on payroll shared services centres, PSSCs, where projects are processing at the set-up stage.  Regarding external services and consultancies, the Estimate includes a provision of &euro;7.5 million this year spread across current and capital budgets.  This reflects the procurement of essential IT and project expertise across the three projects, namely, human resources, payroll and financial management transactional services.  The number of staff also increased from 596 to 649, reflecting the redeployment of payroll staff from originating Departments.<\/p> <p>  To be blunt, we did not progress in 2014 as quickly as we would have liked, so we did not use the Estimate.  Obviously, we will not use the money until we are ready to make the transactional change.  We are confident that we will expend it all and have the consolidated shared services in place during the course of 2015.

There is a substantial increase in the Estimate.  Given the new bodies, that is understandable.  However, it came to light during the year that the office made a case concerning the troubling situation in nursing homes in County Mayo.  That morning, the Ombudsman stated on radio that he had the authority to investigate individual complaints relating to the situation but also indicated that he had the legal authority to investigate complaints relating to private nursing homes.  I imagine that, if he were to be busy in that regard, the amount of money we are providing his office would not cover it.  Does this Estimate cover much in the health area?  According to the Ombudsman's office, it receives few complaints in this regard.  I am not referring to processing medical cards or other administrative difficulties, but to complaints about health services, in which regard the Ombudsman probably feels that people are reluctant to take on hospitals, consultants, doctors or nursing homes.  Has the Minister an opinion on how many complaints are being made on that front?

I assure the committee that the Latvian Presidency intends to work in full conformity with the provisions of the Lisbon treaty, respecting the competences and prerogatives of all the parties involved in the EU decision-making process, which is collective by default.  The priorities of the Latvian Presidency have been developed in close co-operation with the other members of the trio, namely, Italy and Luxembourg, as well as all the European institutions and member states, duly respecting their interests and positions.<\/p> <p>  The general priorities of the Latvian Presidency have been presented in Dublin on several occasions.  Committee members will recall that the Latvian Presidency has two broad objectives.  First, to steer the work of all relevant council formations to fully overcome the economic and financial crisis.  Second, to promote stability, security and development in the neighbourhood and the world in close co-operation with the European Commission, the European External Action Service and all the member states.  To reach these two objectives we intend to promote three main themes, namely, competitive Europe, digital Europe and engaged Europe.  Naturally, while speaking before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade I will focus on the external dimension and the major issues pertinent to the common foreign and security policy, the common security and defence policy, external trade, economic relations and the enlargement process.<\/p> <p>  The Presidency will extend all possible support to the President of the European Council and the High Representative in her role as the President of the Foreign Affairs Council, to help her to conduct the common foreign and security policy and co-ordinate all external action of the Union.  This will be done through chairing appropriate meetings upon invitation from the High Representative, organising numerous events in Latvia and lending our knowledge and expertise in specific fields of external relations.<\/p> <p>  During the coming five months the Latvian Presidency will put particular emphasis on EU relations with the Eastern Partnership countries and central Asian countries.  As committee members are aware, the European neighbourhood policy will remain the key EU instrument when it comes to framing relationships with neighbouring countries.  Ongoing conflicts and instability in the broader neighbourhood are a cause of great concern for all member states and institutions.  More than ever, the neighbourhood countries need EU attention and support.  Hence, Latvia is keen to enhance the effectiveness of the EU policy in addressing political and security challenges in the eastern and southern neighbourhoods.  To achieve this, we will support a comprehensive review of the European neighbourhood policy aimed at better effectiveness through increased differentiation.<\/p> <p>  Latvia intends to contribute to the strengthening of the Eastern Partnership as an inclusive platform and the promotion of a more individual approach to each partner country, respecting their ambitions and objectives.  We are keen to strengthen political association, economic integration, enhanced trade, improved mobility, people-to-people contacts, education co-operation, and engagement with civil societies, as appropriate.  In co-operation with the President of the European Council and relevant EU institutions, Latvia will host the 4th Eastern Partnership summit in Riga on 21&ndash;22 May 2015.  We maintain the summit will provide an excellent opportunity to review the progress that has been achieved since the Vilnius Eastern Partnership summit as well as set the way ahead.<\/p> <p>  Latvia will support the European External Action Service in further developing the relationship with the southern neighbourhood region, contributing to stability and security of the region based on the principles of democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law.  Latvia will also support the efforts of the High Representative to strengthen EU engagement with central Asian countries, as we see a need to intensify our relations with that part of the world.  To this end, Latvia is keen to promote EU-central Asia dialogue and co-operation in areas of importance for both sides, including energy security, transport, sustainable development, the rule of law and education.  In this regard, the review of the EU-central Asia strategy in March 2015 will be of the utmost importance.  The scaling-down of the international security presence in Afghanistan in 2015 as well as instability in Iraq and Syria require greater EU attention towards central Asia to meet such common challenges as terrorism, border security and drug trafficking.  The implementation of regional co-operation programmes, namely, the border management programme in central Asia and the central Asia drug action plan, will be crucial in this regard.<\/p> <p>  While noting the strategic importance of enlargement policy in promoting political stability and economic prosperity in Europe, the Presidency remains committed to moving forward with the ongoing accession negotiations with Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey with a view to achieving further sustained progress.  The Presidency will pursue an enlargement policy based on the principles of conditionality and each country's merits.  These principles will also guide the Presidency's work in advancing the European perspective for other western Balkan countries according to respective stages of their integration, while keeping EU membership as the ultimate goal of the process.<\/p> <p>  My country fully supports the efforts aimed at increasing the effectiveness and visibility of the common security and defence policy.  Latvia will contribute to the preparations for the European Council of June 2015 and will underline the importance of continued progress on the security and defence agenda.  In this regard, Latvia deems it important to advance the work towards better and more efficient civilian and military capabilities, including EU battle-groups and better civil-military co-operation to address maritime security risks and threats.  We will also support enhanced civil-military co-operation when it comes to improving cyber defence awareness and protection.  Of course, appropriate attention will be paid to the challenges faced by the European defence industry as well.<\/p> <p>  Latvia will highlight the crucial nature of co-operation with international organisations and individual partners as part of the CSDP, in particular, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United Nations and the United States.  Close co-operation with NATO in capability development, rapid response, training and exercise requires our attention.  Naturally, Latvia will promote co-operation between the EU and the US in the light of emerging security challenges in many parts of the world.  The Presidency is keen to pay particular attention to problems related to external aspects of counter-terrorism such as foreign fighters, financing of terrorism, radicalisation and recruitment.  We are keen to address these issues in the first instance through better implementation of the already-agreed EU instruments and policy measures in all member states.<\/p> <p>  Open and fair external trade is vital for all of Europe.  Greater market openness as well as more active trade and investment flows are essential for promoting growth and economic recovery throughout the union.  The Presidency will contribute, therefore, to achieving further progress on the World Trade Organization multilateral negotiations and the Doha development agenda.  The Presidency attaches great importance to the ongoing WTO accession negotiations, including, but not limited to, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan and Serbia.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">H.E. Dr. Gints Apals:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It will support the preparations for the upcoming WTO Ministerial Conference of 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Presidency will support also the ongoing work on bilateral trade agreements.  I assure the committee that Latvia considers the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement and Free Trade Agreement negotiations with Japan and Vietnam as top priorities for the coming five months.  The implementation of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements with Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine will be high on our agenda.  In addition, Latvia will promote the approval of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada and the bilateral trade agreement with Singapore. <br\/><br\/>The year will be of crucial importance for progress on a universal post-2015 agenda for sustainable development<b><\/b>and the eradication of poverty.  The Presidency will work energetically to advance consultations on comprehensive EU contribution to international negotiations leading to the UN Summit in September 2015, facilitating the adoption of a new framework, including a set of globally-applicable sustainable development goals, SDGs, which will succeed the millennium development goals, MDGs.  In that context the Presidency sees gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment, good governance, the rule of law, human rights, and inclusive, sustainable growth to be of particular importance, including in regard to the European Year for Development 2015. <br\/><br\/>The Presidency will also contribute to preparations that lead to agreed EU position for the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015.  The partnership agreement between the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries and the EU is due to expire in 2020.  Therefore, the Presidency will work with the European External Action Service, EEAS, and the European Commission to advance EU reflection on future relations with the ACP countries.  Together with the EEAS and the Commission, the Presidency will closely monitor the ongoing and emerging humanitarian crises, as well as disease outbreaks, of which addressing the Ebola epidemic will be of paramount importance.  The Presidency will help to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of EU humanitarian aid<b><\/b>and to advance EU humanitarian advocacy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>third countries and international organisations.  The Presidency will support the necessary follow-up for preparations for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit.<br\/><br\/>I have outlined probably the most important policy areas, which we regard as a priority and the committee will understand that the work programme of the Presidency and the EU as a whole is extremely broad.  I will gladly answer any questions members may have on any of the subjects I mentioned and I will also gladly go beyond the area of external relations should that be necessary.  I thank the members for their kind attention and we can now move on to the members' questions and comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I compliment him on his presentation and wish his country well in its Presidency.  I welcome that Latvia has decided to prioritise economic growth and job creation as key goals.  He outlined the overarching priorities of a competitive Europe, a digital Europe and an engaged Europe.  There are challenges arising from the technological expansion across the EU.  It is important for all members states of the EU and its citizens that we boost smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  I welcome that Latvia hopes to advance the formulation of a proper framework for data protection, which is important in this era in which we are living.  Reducing telecommunications costs is an issue particularly for people who travel a good deal and for somebody like myself who lives in a Border constituency.  Unfortunately, we have a land Border in our own country and we have to put up with those costs.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the European External Action Service and the Lisbon treaty of 2009, both of those in their own way have made Europe a more visible actor in international affairs and in trade and diplomacy also.  The ambassador outlined that Latvia wants to facilitate a continued and an increased presence of the EU and better engagement and relations with its immediate neighbours.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the Eastern Partnership, does the ambassador believe that a more prudent approach is needed by the European Union in its dealings with neighbouring countries?  He stated in his presentation that Latvia intends to contribute to the strengthening of the Eastern Partnership as an inclusive platform and to promoting a more individual approach to each partner country, respecting their own ambitions.  That is a mutual requirement for both the EU and its neighbouring countries.<\/p> <p>  Last summer Latvia increased its defence budget on its eastern border with Russia and it requested additional security help from NATO.  I note in a comment Latvia's ambassador to the United States made last Thursday that he stated that citizens of Latvia remain nervous and concerned about the rising tensions between Russia and the West.  He also stated that the situation is getting worse.  Has Latvia felt supported sufficiently by the European Union and the European External Action Service when dealing with Russian aggression on its borders?  As we review the work of the Presidency of the EU, the heightened tension and conflict in the Ukraine today and the major loss of life is a very worrying development.  We sincerely hope that a ceasefire will be achieved and that progress will be made in bringing about real and meaningful dialogue to bring that dispute to a proper conclusion.

The ambassador is doing a great job on behalf of his country.  I have met him at many events.  He has been very active and I congratulate him on that.  I hope the Ministry for foreign affairs in Latvia recognise his hard work.<\/p> <p>  To follow on from what Deputy Smith said, Latvia plays a very important role in a very sensitive political period.  Ukraine and the Eastern Partnership were mentioned.  A summit will be held in Riga on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy.  Can I be in a little provocative and ask the ambassador a number of questions?  We are collectively aware of the difficulties of those emerging democracies from under the yoke of communism but we are also very conscious of mistakes Europe might have made in the past in its relationship with the Eastern Partnership and in the relationship with Ukraine.  I have just come back from there and this committee has addressed the issue off the largest successful political party in the recent Moldovan elections being a pro-Putin, a pro-Soviet party.  In that region there are great sensibilities which require the utmost diplomatic skills.  Those are the skills of Europe's relationship with the Russia Federation.<\/p> <p>  Latvia has a substantial Russian speaking population.  By way of background and to counterpose what I am going to ask the ambassador, I am sure he will be aware that this country in the past four years has granted citizenship to 70,000 new Irish citizens form 126 countries in the world.  He may know that we advocate new communities and immigrants to participate in local elections.  If they have been living here for six months or longer, they are eligible to vote.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eric Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=142\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Eric Byrne\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FOJ&amp;amp;memberid=142&amp;amp;pid=EricJByrne&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Eric Byrne\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I might counterpose our position with Latvia's position regarding its Russian-speaking community, which is quite substantial, maybe in the region of 26% of the population, who do not have these basic democratic rights.  How does the ambassador view the role of Europe under the presidency of Latvia <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the relationship of Putin and the Russian Federation to Europe, given what they allege has happened in eastern Ukraine, namely, discrimination against Russian speakers, and the possibility that the same argument would be used against the Latvian authorities?<br\/><br\/>What are the key areas of the Eastern Partnership summit in Riga and the European neighbourhood policy?  What will be different after those debates in Riga?  Where will they lead?<br\/><br\/>On a domestic, but also international, front, I am conscious of being lobbied when in Latvia by politicians who argue that we are facilitating sham marriages of Latvian women, predominantly to non-Europeans.  We have the statistics here.  They are mainly Pakistani, Nigerian, Brazilian and Bangladeshi men.  Is the ambassador happy that we are taking the necessary steps to prevent these sham marriages?  It is alleged that these women are being trafficked from Latvia to Ireland.

There are major trade agreements coming up, economic issues that affect all of us, very particular economic issues that affect Greece and the problems in Ukraine.  Everybody has mentioned the problems in Ukraine.  I would also like to refer to that and how it impacts on Latvia.  When the problems started in Ukraine, there was a general increase in Russian military and intelligence activity in Latvia, and Lithuania and Estonia as well, and this was noticed very much.  There is a large ethnic Russian population in Latvia.  About a quarter of the population is of Russian origin.  The Russians justified their activities in Ukraine on the basis of the abuse of the rights of the Russian-speaking population.  Is Latvia open to similar accusations?  Does Latvia, which in the EU, unlike Ukraine, feel safe from any desire of Russia to exploit what it sees as abuses of the rights of their ethnic population in other countries, whether within the EU or in Ukraine?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#D00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador and wish Latvia well in its EU presidency.  The ambassador said in his speech earlier that the Latvian Presidency will be focused on jobs and growth.  Ireland's EU Presidency was also focused on jobs and growth, but unfortunately unemployment, specifically youth unemployment, is a significant problem not only in Ireland but right across Europe.  A &euro;300 billion investment package has been announced by the European Commission, but many see that as one leg of the stool.  Does Latvia see the area of youth employment as a priority for the Presidency?<\/p> <p>  The question of Greece was touched on earlier.  There are a few debates in Europe on how we move forward.  Some are pro-austerity and others are pro-stimulus.  The Greek Government has called for a debt conference.  Would Latvia see that as part of its EU Presidency or would it have a view on that idea of a debt conference and bringing together people, not only the public representatives, but civic society groups and so on that are impacted by debt and poverty and deprivation?  Greece is looking for a write-down again.  It is outside the EU Presidency, but I am interested in Latvia and where it positions itself in that debate within Europe.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador said TTIP is one of the priorities.  There are huge concerns about this, which we have discussed at this committee and at the European Affairs committee.  There are aspects of TTIP with which people are very uncomfortable.  Ireland has concerns about the impact on our agricultural and food sectors, whether it is about regulation and deregulation and so on.  The big area people are concerned about is investor-state dispute settlement.  There is significant concern about it right across Europe.  The Commission stated recently that it had received 150,000 replies to its consultation and 145,000 related to opposition to this matter.  The ambassador says he wants to push ahead with the negotiations, but the concern from civil society and across Europe relates to the secrecy surrounding the negotiations themselves.  Are there similar concerns in Latvia on aspects of that agreement - the change in work portfolios, people moving from jobs, trade within countries, within Europe and so on?  Are those concerns shared?  Some are calling for the suspension rather than the prioritisation of the talks.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador says Latvia strongly supports the European common security and defence policy and he would like to see enhanced co-operation with NATO and the increased use of training and battle groups.  I do not share his enthusiasm.  I accept that Latvia has historical reasons for this, and it is a member of NATO, but many of us see NATO as a relic from a previous time.  Would the ambassador see the interaction there as complementary rather than competitive?  Ireland is not a member of NATO.  How do countries like Ireland figure in this closer alignment?  Does the ambassador not believe issues like the common security and defence policy, CSDP, are driving some of the scepticism in Europe?  Some would say it is an attack on sovereignty.  Is CSDP entirely framed in the interests of larger EU countries?  I am more concerned about the debate on where we fit into this moving together with NATO, as a neutral country?  There are concerns.  Latvia is very concerned about the issues in Ukraine, as are others, and the Eastern Partnership.  Is there a role for those countries that have decided to stay outside the partnership?  The ambassador mentioned people having an independent role and so on.  How does he see outreach to those countries, like Armenia and Azerbaijan, that have decided to stay outside the partnership developing?<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1774\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FOJ&amp;amp;memberid=1774&amp;amp;pid=SeanCroweSF&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Is the Presidency thinking in terms of conferences or how is it going to pull that together?  Does it favour an increase in military involvement in the Ukraine?  Some people say there is still potential even at this late stage with the initiative from France and Germany.  <\/p><p> On the European Year for Development 2015 can the ambassador detail any specific plans in this regard?  How will the Latvian Presidency advance many of those issues?  The ambassador mentioned the implementation of regional co-operation programmes in central Asia and the whole area of drug trafficking.  After we returned from Iran some were keen that it should have a relationship with the European Union.  Previously the European Union had a relationship with Iran and countries in that region to try to stop the flow of drugs from Afghanistan.  Figures were given for the growth of the poppy and it will all end up on our shore.  Does the ambassador see the Iranians or other countries in that region as having a role and what can Latvia, during its presidency, do in this area?  The Iranians complain that they are not getting support.  One of the reasons given for this was the death penalty.  We co-operate with other countries around the world, despite the death penalty, as it is flowing straight to Europe.<\/p><p> On the issue of minority languages, I understand there are many minority languages and community groups throughout Europe which the European Union supports.

Can the ambassador see any approaches that would improve relationships with Russia, outside of the issues in relation to concerns in Ukraine, as the dialogue between Russia, which is Latvia's nearest neighbour, and the European Union has almost dried up?  Surely, that is not conducive to developing relationships, understanding and influencing events which are important to both Russia and to the European Union.  One of the key issues in the European Union at the moment is the situation regarding Greece and potentially leaving the Union but hopefully not.  As the Presidency, can Latvia see itself taking initiatives rather than the various ministerial meetings to try to overcome the difficulties that have arisen and find solutions as it is a highly complex issue?  While some commentators say the EU is in a better position now to lose Greece than it was previously, we have to be careful about believing much of that because it certainly would reduce international confidence in the euro if Greece left the European Union, apart from other issues surrounding it.

I apologise for my late arrival but I have read his presentation which is interesting.  I was particularly struck by his comments with regard to strengthening the Eastern Partnership.  He also included the engagement with central Asian countries, some of us hope to be there later this month.  There is much tension in that area.  The relationship that Latvia builds with those countries will, to a large extent, assist the direction that the EU and those countries will go in the future.  I welcome the Latvian Presidency committing to doing  that.<\/p> <p>  Ukraine has been mentioned.  I welcome the dialogue which is taking place.  I would raise a question in that regard, it is very much a German-Franco driven initiative.  It struck me that perhaps there should have been some EU-wide involvement and Latvia, given that it holds the presidency, might be involved.  Perhaps the representatives will comment.  I am friendly with some of the Latvian parliamentarians and I know that they would be hostile to Russia because of their experience; in the same way as we were oppressed by the British for many centuries, Latvia has also suffered oppression under the Russians in its history.  Some of them have chastised me for some of my encouragement with the Russian authorities.  As Deputy Neville said, that is the way forward.  Russia and Europe have many inter-connected objectives and interests that need to be founded on a better relationship than we had.  Perhaps the representatives would comment on the Europe-wide aspect of that.  <\/p> <p>  The ultimate question would be with regard to Greece.  There is much talk about the economic crisis in Greece which obviously is hurting the people badly.  We have experienced it here as have other European countries to a greater or lesser degree.  It has to be said that the European project has been damaged by this crisis.  There has been a dearth of quality political leadership across Europe all during this crisis.  The manner in which they tried to deal with it has not taken into account the effects on citizens and, perhaps, dealing with it in a way which has ameliorated some of the difficulties which people have encountered in their daily lives as a consequence of this.  All governments carry some responsibility.  Govem the geographic location of Greece, and given what is happening in the Middle East - it is nearly an entry point for any escalation of the crisis there - but also given the political make-up in Greece, real leadership will be required to deal with that issue.  Nobody is talking any more about a two tier euro which would reflect the disparity between the economies.  That was largely debated at the outset of the crisis but seems to have gone off the radar altogether.  How Greece is handled is not just a Greek issue, there will be knock-on effects in Spain, probably in the not too distant future, and perhaps in Italy as well.  It needs to be handled in a way that takes into account the medium and longer-term vision if there is a vision for Europe any more.  I say that as somebody who is fully committed to the European project but who will think long and hard the next time we are voting for a treaty as to whether I will vote \"Yes\" or \"No\".<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jim Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1982\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Senator Jim Walsh\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FOJ&amp;amp;memberid=1982&amp;amp;pid=JimWalsh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Senator Jim Walsh\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That would never have been my position in the past, but the manner in which this crisis has been dealt with by the European Union is nothing short of scandalous, although others may disagree with that point of view.<\/p><p> I refer to the ambassador's comments on counter-terrorism and the high profile incidents in Paris and other issues come to mind.  Approximately 30 people have left Ireland to travel to the Middle East as combatants.  They have joined the terrorist group that is in charge of parts of Iraq and Syria and are being trained to engage in terrorist activities.  I  listened to a radio programme yesterday on which it was reported that foreign combatants were being placed at the forefront in killing people, including by beheading.  It is obvious that this is being done to break any taboo they might have in order that when they move to other countries, they may well pose a significant threat to the civilian populations.  In the opinion of the ambassador, how should citizens who return to European countries and who have participated in violence be dealt with?  How should we deal with the issue of immigration?  It is not inconceivable that many who are not citizens of European countries may find themselves drifting into Europe in the next two decades.  They may well come with a particular intent which will not be benevolent towards the freedom we enjoy in this part of the world.  How will the programme anticipate and deal with this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#E00500","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":790,"content":"<p>The ambassador has a wide area to cover in his response.

I assure members that I will try to do my best to answer the questions one by one in order that every member will receive a proper response from our representation.  Not all of the questions are pertinent to the role of Latvia as Presidency of the European Council.  Nevertheless, I regard this as a unique opportunity to speak to a large number of elected representatives of the Irish people; therefore, I will gladly dwell on each and every question raised.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with the question from Deputy Brendan Smith concerning the role of the European Unin, the External Action Service and support for those countries that might be nervous, as the Deputy described it, about the situation to the east of their borders.  One must always keep in mind the wider context.  There are several international organisations active on a global or regional basis; this is not only about the European Union and the External Action Service.  I also deliberately referred to NATO as the defence alliance in that it deals directly with military threats to its members.  The European Union is not a military alliance and this distinction should be kept in mind.  Therefore, the instruments of the European Union are mostly political and economic.  <\/p> <p>  From my perspective, the European Union and the External Action Service are doing their best, employing the means in their possession - diplomatic means, statements, public messages and economic sanctions against individuals or states.  This is the role of the European Union and the External Action service.  <\/p> <p>  I referred to NATO and the NATO alliance.  The individual member states and their governments are responsible for the defence of the territories.  There are many other international forums which are also very useful in addressing these security concerns.  I refer, for example, to the OSCE and, in partial form, the Council of Europe.  I could list many more, if necessary.  In brief, the role of the European Union has been appropriate, while the External Action Service has also been active, given its mandate.  The latest initiative is a initiative of France and Germany, coming on top of the activities of or those agreed and pursued by the European Union.  I can only hope for complementary work between the European Union, the External Action Service and individual member states, including my own.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked many questions.  I do not necessarily agree with all of his qualifications when speaking about the situation in my country or Ukraine.  He asked about the European neighbourhood policy and the positions of Ukraine and Moldova.  We recognise that there might be differences between national positions.  The European neighbourhood policy concerns six very different countries.  Three countries have signed association agreements that are being ratified by EU member states, while three other countries are still interested in participation in the European neighbourhood policy, but they have their own approach.  For example, Armenia has chosen to join the Eurasian economic union and customs union, but it is still eager to have political dialogue and a political association with the European Union.  In the future member states might look for flexible arrangements to accommodate every single member of that group according to their ambitions and objectives.  At least from the perspective of my government, the Eastern Partnership is a useful platform for dialogue with these countries.  It is also a useful platform for dialogue between the countries of the partnership.  It is a multilateral platform that facilitates exchange and co-operation between the six countries mentioned.  Therefore, in holding the Presidency and as a member state, Latvia is very much interested in keeping this platform active for the future because it opens a range of avenues in relations between Europe and these countries and between themselves.  The ultimate purpose is to promote our values in the wider region, not only economic interests but also the values of the European Union, including human rights and the rule of law, for example.  This also applies to Ukraine and Moldova, even in spite of the fact that not all political parties in these countries fully embrace European values.  One should always keep in mind that this is an open and ongoing process.  The spread of European values and the extension of our principles form part of an open-ended process.  The Deputy referred to the success of specific parties in the Moldovan elections, but one should always continue dialogue and convince people that the European approach has its merits.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the Deputy's second question on the Russian-speaking population.  I do not really recognise the link between ethnic origin or the native tongue and citizenship.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">H.E. Dr. Gints Apals:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have citizens of many backgrounds and citizenship is not awarded to anybody on the basis of their ethnic origins or linguistic identity.  Therefore, there are many Russian-speaking citizens of Latvia, some of whom are ethnic Russians while others are not.  The Russian language is widely spoken and Russian is probably my second language and my first foreign language.  Therefore, the committee might also consider me to be a Russian speaker or a member of the group.  <\/p><p> Latvian policy in matters of citizenship is very simple.  Latvia will grant citizenship to any permanent resident on the basis of individual application.  What we cannot accept for legal and political considerations is that the State could or should impose citizenship on a group of persons without individual applications.  This would be wrong.  Citizenship cannot be imposed on anyone.  This applies not only to Latvia but also to many other countries in the world.  Therefore, when it comes to citizenship, let me assure the committee that this is a purely legal question in my country which has been resolved using all democratic mechanisms and there is no discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or language origins.  <\/p><p> In respect of local elections, if I understand correctly, Deputy Byrne suggested that any permanent resident should be entitled to participate in local elections regardless of his or her citizenship, place or origin, etc.  The international practice contains several approaches.  My country still belongs to a large group of countries that see full participation in political processes, including the right to vote and be elected at all levels, as the prerogative of the citizen.  Anybody who would like to take part in those elections is cordially invited to apply for a Latvian passport.  This will be a speedy process that will facilitate social integration between different groups.  <\/p><p> In respect of discrimination against Russian speakers in Ukraine, I can only say that I do not necessarily agree because I am not in possession of any facts concerning discrimination against the Russian-speaking population Ukraine in the past or currently.  I do not even recall many signals about discrimination against the Russian-speaking population before the outbreak of the recent crisis in eastern Ukraine.  For more than 20 years, Ukraine was a stable country and the international media did not report much about any sort of discrimination.  I can only voice my surprise that very recently and suddenly, many mass media outlets were reporting and talking about the notion of discrimination against ethnic Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.  This was not the case in the past.  This would lead me to say that the EU collectively and EU member states should do something to promote our own values and views through the mass media in the eastern neighbourhood and the Russian Federation because sometimes we might have different views on certain subjects but we then need to have a dialogue which would be a two-way street - not only us accepting certain notions but also us having the liberty to make our voice heard.  This would certainly promote peace and stability throughout the region.  <\/p><p> In respect of the agenda of the Eastern Partnership summit in Riga, I should say that the international situation remains very dynamic.  Certainly the agenda of the summit will be defined in a collective manner which means that all the EU institutions concerned will have the right along with the host nation to define the agenda and the programme of the summit.  We would like to see this as a venue for free and broad debate among all participants - European and those coming from partner countries.  That will allow us not only to take stock of the implementation of association agreements and not only to talk of mobility but also to reflect on the way ahead.  Given the dynamic and changing nature of and situation in the region, some questions are still open.  I am quite sure that by April, we will have much more clarity.  We should also remember that the summit will happen on 21 and 22 May.  That is to say, there is still some time.  While we can collectively define the agenda items, proposals are more than welcome.  <\/p><p> The last question concerned bilateral relations and the problem of sham marriages.  This is a complex issue because in the past, several hundred Latvian women came to Ireland and married third country nationals from several countries.  This was a difficult situation.  The trend has changed and the number of Latvian women coming to Ireland to marry third country nationals has decreased significantly.  We also appreciate all the steps taken by Irish authorities to prevent sham marriages and the human trafficking element of that problem.  This work should continue and is continuing.  There are several international co-operation projects involving institutions and NGOs from Latvia, Ireland and other countries.  Probably the best way to prevent sham marriages involves raising awareness of the risks of such marriages.  At the same time, I must voice my respect for the position of the Irish Government because it is fully entitled to adopt whatever immigration procedures and policies it wishes.  This is a matter for the Irish nation, Parliament and Government.  We cannot interfere with the Government's decisions regarding whether or not the Irish authorities would recognise certain types of marriages.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Dr. Gints Apals stated it is not only the Latvians who come to Ireland.  We can deal with the issue only on a national level as we did by amending the Latvian criminal law in 2013.  The law came into force in 2013 to tackle sham marriages by making it a crime to facilitate the application for residency rights.  In January we also started the HESTIA project in co-operation with the European Commission and the six countries involved are Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Slovakia and Ireland.

I would find it difficult to conceive that the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland or the United Kingdom would claim the right to defend the interests of English speaking people around the world only on the basis of their linguistic identify.  Normally in international law, states have the right to protect the interests of their citizens, but the idea that any country could claim the right to protect the interests of the citizens of another country is a very difficult question and I cannot see how such an argument could be used against my country or neighbouring countries while remaining within the bounds of international law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We appreciate the fact the Greek Government would like to negotiate a solution to the existing economic crisis and debt problem.  This is certainly a positive message.  We also recognise the fact the Greek Government has a democratic mandate.  As far as the European Council is concerned, I must emphasise that the Council can and will even tomorrow discuss the situation in Greece but decisions concerning the problems arising from assistance and possible modification of those provisions are for the eurozone finance ministers.  This probably will be the correct way to negotiate any alteration of existing provisions.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, I recognise what Deputy Crowe said that the issue is complex but the Council has given a clear mandate to the Commission to pursue negotiations.  Democratic scrutiny is important.  I have had assurances from the members of the Commission that of course the Commission is looking for a balanced deal with the United States, which respects the interests of both sides, both the European countries and the United States.  The negations will continue for some time because the Commission would like to assure a fair and balanced deal for both sides.  In that process there are elements of democratic control, not only NGOs, the world conference but also elections to the European Parliament and contacts with elected members of the European Parliament, not least of course, members of the government.  There are many mechanisms to acquire more information and probably these means should be employed by citizens.  The Latvian Presidency will not be of any particular assistance in the process.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on the CSDP and the role of NATO.  NATO is a defence alliance and at the same time it is an important organisational structure providing security and addressing humanitarian crisis and peace operation throughout the world.  The EU through the CSDP mechanisms co-operate with NATO for the purpose of peace operations.  Ireland, as far as I know, is also co-operating with NATO, being a member of the partnership for peace arrangement, with the purpose of conducting joint peace operations.  This is how I see the relationship between Ireland and NATO.  What I said about co-operation with NATO does not necessarily extend to territorial defence.  The EU unfortunately is not a defence alliance, even though the treaty contains the Sovereignty Clause.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the Eastern Partnership of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the ambitions and interests of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus should be taken into account when thinking of the future of the Eastern Partnership.  One can negotiate with those countries.  It is important that they remain as participants of the process.  With time their positions on certain issues may change.  Certainly during this process, we can only keep the existing context and welcome those countries as participants of the Riga Eastern Partnership summit. <\/p> <p>  I did not fully grasp the points made on the increased military involvement in Ukraine.  I would say that I oppose any military involvement or intervention in eastern Ukraine but at this moment there is only one party which is engaged in military intervention in eastern Ukraine.  Certainly this is not the EU and these are not EU member states.<\/p> <p>  In Central Asia, the very important issues are the fight against drugs and the position of Iran in that respect.  The EU is doing a great deal and we need to raise awareness of what it is doing.  For more than a decade the EU has funded two significant programmes in that part of the world, the Board of Management Programme for Central Asia, helping those countries to establish civilised borders and to control migration, trade and everything else across borders; second, the Central Asia drug action plan initiative is also funded by the European Commission.  These are two major instruments.  In addition, one can involve many international structures.  In Malta there are bilateral projects, involving not only EU member states and countries such as Iran but the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna.  That structure is very active in Central Asia doing research and controlling the drugs traffic across central Asian countries to Europe.  This is a matter for international co-operation and the EU can certainly play a positive role and is already doing so.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">H.E. Dr. Gints Apals:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The next question is how to improve relations with the Russian Federation.  I already mentioned that there is certainly one possibility which is to send our message concerning our values and views to the Russian public as actively and widely as possible.  There is a deficit of information inside the Russian Federation on developments elsewhere and how people in Europe perceive developments in Eastern Ukraine and other places.  Much more active exchange of information using European funds for information in the Russian language intended for the Russian population would be a means to improve our relations with the Russian Federation in general.  It is not only about dialogue between governments.  This is also about public diplomacy and everything else.<\/p><p> I already tried to answer the question on Greece by saying that the Presidency of the European Council can probably not take any significant initiatives to address and modify the existing assistance programme to Greece.  Simultaneously, the European Council is having a debate on the social and economic situation in Greece, but the meeting of the eurozone ministers for finance would probably the correct institution through which to formally address those concerns.<\/p><p> I was asked about the European perspective of Eastern Partnership countries.  Certainly, a European perspective exists, but it might be rather remote.  When we speak on Eastern Partnership countries, we must recognise that while they have signed the association agreements, these have not yet even been ratified by all European member states.  This is only the beginning of a very long process which might in time lead to membership as a subject for negotiations and probably as an ultimately reality.  That is not going to be within a few years but rather we should speak in this context of a decade or two.<\/p><p> I have already said concerning the initiative of Germany and France that all complementary initiatives are welcome from the point of view of the Presidency.  I have heard also of similar views of the High Representative who spoke in Dublin two weeks ago.  Therefore, one can only appreciate the new initiative should it be productive.  Concerning Greece, we addressed the issue of negotiations.<\/p><p> The last question I was asked was on counter-terrorism.  The Presidency would like to do whatever is possible to improve counter-terrorism measures in Europe but we must also recognise three important factors.  First, counter-terrorism measures are mostly national competencies of EU member states.  Second, they normally involve sharing information and co-operation between security and intelligence services.  Third, there are already a number of European documents and initiatives on this subject.  Therefore, we believe that the European Council should certainly continue the debate the matter while paying particular attention to better implementation of existing measures.  Before producing new declarations or adopting new documents, one could simultaneously consider full or better implementation of the agreed measures.

The ISI has already announced that from the first quarter of this year, 2015, it will publish on a quarterly basis details of debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements that have been voted down by creditors.  That information is now going to be available on a quarterly basis and that will make it available much more quickly, instead of waiting for an annual publication.  I believe this is the right direction to take so that it can be seen clearly what is happening when people are trying to deal with these debt issues.<\/p><p> Debt relief notices would not be included in the proposed amendment, since the Personal Insolvency Act does not provide for a creditor vote for this type of arrangement.  If it is a limited write-down of unsecured debt for persons with very little income or assets which is approved directly by the court, a creditor can object to the court but no creditor vote is required because of the specific and limited nature of the debt solution.  Perhaps the Deputy would take the points I am making in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#A00400","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Collins's amendment.

It concerns the bank veto.  Anecdotally, we hear stories that banks are working reasonably but then within Oireachtas committees we detect, reading between the lines that the banks are making it clear it is one veto after another.  We considered this to be a weakness with the Act.  Given a bank the ability to prevent a deal stacks the dice against the person who is trying to get their life moving again.  For example, looking at the evidence the banks gave to the finance committee, they were quite strong in suggesting they would not be engaging in write-downs and so on.  This is the key problem with the original Bill that we would want to see revisited.  We are using this opportunity today to flag the issue with the Minister and I hope she can revisit the whole issue.  The veto is the one area that is a fundamental flaw in the original Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#B01300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":834,"content":"<p>The effect of the Deputy's amendment is to reduce the proportion of debt required to approve a personal insolvency arrangement, from 65% to just 30%.  That proposal, as the Deputy says, was made on Report Stage of the Bill in 2012 and it was opposed at that point on the basis that it seems unlikely that creditors would accept or agree to be bound by a solution which was only approved by a minority - the Deputy is saying 30% - of value of the overall debt.  There would be a situation where, out of all of those creditors, it would only require 30% of them to agree that the arrangement was acceptable.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the issue the Deputy is trying to deal with and I believe there are other avenues open to us which we will be considering as a result of the review.  The courts might be able to play a further role, for example, and be in a position to make further interventions.  There are obviously different definitions of \"unreasonable\" for different people.  A court might make a call where there had been a particular situation in which a solution was being refused by a creditor.  We are concerned here with striking a delicate balance between the rights of creditors and debtors.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we have to be clear that the banks must and should engage constructively on these issues and help people come to resolutions.  That is a key issue.  Although the solution suggested here is not the right solution and I am not in a position to accept the amendment, I intend to bring forward changes and proposals for the Personal Insolvency Act and will be considering very carefully the range of possible approaches, also in the context of any legal advice.  There will be some constitutional property rights, for example, that would impact on this type of decision.  I would point out that in the UK, the percentage is 75%.   We have 65% here and the Deputy is suggesting going down to 30%.  I understand the problem he is trying to deal with but it is a very dramatic reduction in the percentage where agreement is needed in order for it to be accepted.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to accept the amendment that but there may be other ways of dealing with this issue.<\/p><p>As I said on Second Stage, the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, predicted that 15,000 people would avail of this when the Bill was enacted but the actual figure was, I understand, around 10% of that figure.  The difficulty is that the perception and the message that came from the banks in the finance committee was that they are not in the mind-set in terms of dealing with  write-downs and that they want to send out a robust message in this respect.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2321\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=JUS&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> We must do something radical, although I do not know if that is the right word, to remove the veto.

There is a flaw in the legislation and my party feel strongly about it.  When this was going through originally, the entire Opposition took this position.

I gave the committee a brief paper in advance, to which I will speak.  I will begin with the executive summary.  Citizens are being deprived of a significant benefit they earned and paid for.  This measure is not designed to help older workers to stay in employment.  Employers and unions were given no opportunity to consider the complex labour market issues involved.  In terms of the raising of the pension age - it is not the retirement age but the pension age because they are two different things - we are going further and faster than any other country in Europe.  We will have the highest pension age in Europe at the end of this relatively short process.<\/p> <p>  There has been no public debate on this matter.  No one has explained to the public why we must have the highest public pension age in the EU.  This measure makes nonsense of the advice the Pensions Board gave for years about the importance of long-term planning for one's retirement.  This measure flies in the face of the principles of pension reform.  The troika did not impose this measure.  It was contrived by politicians and public officials who will continue to enjoy good pensions from age 65 and earlier.  We are a long time into this process and we have no faith that the cosseted pension elite who contrived this matter have any intention of mitigating the injustice they have caused.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it.  We were told that this hasty arbitrary diktat was agreed with the troika.  There was no political debate, no public consultation and no cost-benefit analysis of the measure.  No consideration was given to the significant labour market issues involved nor was thought given to issues of fair play, equity or minimising hardship on those worst affected.  Social policy issues, labour market issues, industrial relations issues, pension policy issues, planning issues and social insurance issues are involved.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Fergus Whelan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Nobody should be fooled by the notion that this has anything to do with austerity.  Long before austerity, spurious demographic arguments were being used by the Department of Social Protection and, hopefully to its now shame, the Society of Actuaries in Ireland to tell us that 50 years from now, there would be so many pensioners and so few people at work that we had to do something drastic about PRSI pension entitlements.  They even on occasions dressed these assumptions up as inescapable facts.  There are no inescapable facts about 50 years from now.  Making assumptions about population growth five years ahead is a very good idea if one wants to plan for a school building programme.  In terms of pension policy, doing demographic projections 50 years ahead is complete nonsense.  <\/p><p> In the run up to 2014, workers were given no advance notice when depending on their age, they stood to lose &euro;12,000, &euro;24,000 or &euro;36,000 per year.  The newspapers hardly covered it and the Department of Social Protection did not write to these people to tell them that although they had been paying PRSI for the past 40 years and were expecting a pension at 65, they would not get it.  Between themselves and their employers, the people affected by it paid almost 15% of their salary since the PRSI system was invented to pay for this benefit so this is not a handout.  No politician or civil servant looked into their heart and said it would be nice to give these workers a pension.  This is something these workers paid for and nobody had the right to confiscate these payments because it is confiscation of money earned and paid for by workers paying PRSI.  These workers are now victims of decision makers who are not affected at all.  The people who happily made this decision will suffer no ill effects as a result of it.<\/p><p> Apologists for this measure suggest that as people are living longer, they should work longer.  ICTU holds that people should be free to work longer if they wish but they should not be obliged to do so in order to avoid poverty.  No provision has been made to facilitate workers remaining in employment after age 65.  When the lower grades in Government Departments, who are on the higher levels of PRSI, reach the age of 65, they are out the door, regardless of whether they have any pension entitlement or not.  The Government can hardly expect the private sector employers to keep their people on if it is not prepared to keep its own employees on in this situation.  On a number occasions, we asked the Department of Social Protection what it proposed to do with its lower grade staff on the higher rate of PRSI when they hit 65 if they had no pension entitlements.  Even when it was put in writing, that answer was not forthcoming.  The reason it was not forthcoming was because it knew exactly what it was going to do.  It was going to push them out the door, which is exactly what it did.  This has nothing to do with keeping people in the workforce for longer.  <\/p><p> Employers and unions were given no opportunity to consider the other complex labour market issues involved.  IBEC was concerned about whether the lack of clarity concerning the legality or otherwise of an affiliate sacking workers at age 65 would lead to litigation.  We were concerned that if a person with 40 years service was going out the gate with no pension, he or she might picket it.  In a way, I am sorry some of them did not do this.  It might have brought the matter to a head but as a trade union official whose job it is to fix industrial disputes, I can say it would be a very difficult dispute to fix because this person has been pushed out the door and he or she has nothing to lose by keeping the picket going for the rest of their life.  <\/p><p> Other labour market issues that were ignored were the effects on the morale and productivity of workers either being retained in or forced out of employment against their will.  This is a big issue for both us and employers.  Even if one lets somebody who has been planning to go at 65 stay on to avoid poverty, there are implications for productivity.  There are also implications for productivity and morale among other people who are being held back from promotion because people who were expected to leave at a particular age are being kept on.  If the Government had decided that people were not getting a pension at 65 but their employers had to keep them on, the troika would have regarded it as a labour market rigidity.  I use the term \"if\" because nobody involved in making this decision with whom I spoke had any intention of doing anything to protect a worker who was being driven out of employment with no pension entitlement.  <\/p><p> Another issue that is very dear to my heart, probably because of where my working life began, is the fact that it is all very well for to ask somebody working in this building or organisation, in the various organisations associated with it or in education to work to 68.  Where is the justice in asking a scaffolder to work to 68 if one could find an employer who would be irresponsible enough to let a 68 year old man climb a scaffold on a January or December morning?  There was no discussion of this matter.  If arrangements are made to keep people on - not that anybody has done this - is there a knock-on effect down the line in terms of youth unemployment and positions not being available for younger people coming into the labour market?  <\/p><p> Pension reform and pension planning are long-term issues.  When we go to negotiate a pension scheme, we engage actuaries and the workers pay them big money to find out how much they have to put away and for how long if they want a certain pension.  This must be done over a 40-year period, which is the proper way to plan a pension.  To come along 35 years into that and say, \"by the way, some of the figures are wrong because we changed the rules.  It's OK.  You've paid for three years PRSI pension but we have decided you're not getting it\", makes a nonsense of pension planning.  <\/p><p> The current Administration is saying that it wants to move towards a mandatory pension scheme or a pension scheme that involves everybody.  This decision has done a lot of damage to that prospect.  People have been paying PRSI for years and now they see it confiscated.  What worker will agree to pay into a pension for their entire career if some Administration in the future can just decide \"we didn't really mean it, we wanted you to pay for it alright but we never had any intention of giving it to you\".  Huge damage has been done to confidence in pensions as a result not just of this measure, but of others we will not go into.  Perhaps we will come back another day and talk about them.  To put it simply, if somebody was told five years ago that he or she was going into an occupational pension scheme, they would nearly have celebrated.  If it was said to a young worker today, he or she would nearly cry because very few people have any faith that they will get what they are paying for.  This decision has been a big contributor to that.  <\/p><p> I will not read out the rest of my paper.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Fergus Whelan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In the paper I drew up last year I refer to a person aged 59 years but I will correct that to 60 years of age.  A private sector worker who is 60 years of age this year will not get their pension until he or she is 67 years of age.  I know this because I am that person.  I started to work at 16 years of age in a construction site and I have worked ever since.  I will not get a penny out of my PRSI pension until I am 51 years in the workforce, that is assuming my employer allows me to stay on after 64 years of age, which is the age at which I finish work.  That is a big assumption.  The people who made this decision can get very generous pensions.  Most of the people involved  have very generous pensions at 60 years of age and never paid the rates of PRSI that I paid.  <\/p><p> In my entire life as a trade union official I have tried to avoid the public sector-private sector divide and that is still very important to me but it is very hard when well-pensioned elites can make decision at the flick of a pen which deny people, much poorer than them, an entitlement without a by or leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Whelan.

I hope I do not repeat the questions I asked previously when the witness appeared before one of the committees, I think was the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  This issue comes before us because somebody has appealed to us, as a petitions committee, that the public service and public policy is doing them a disservice.  That is the reason the petition is before us and the reason Mr. Whelan was invited to appear before the committee.<\/p> <p>  I have wholehearted sympathy for the position the witness and the petitioner have taken.  I agree in particular with the point he made around the lack of debate and the lack of foresight for those who are affected in any way.  Normally if an entitlement is to be taken away there is negotiation or compensation.  In this case neither has happened.  What is even worse is that this was one of the Bills that was guillotined where we never reached the debate which had been scheduled so that we could tease out all the implications of a move such as this.  Has any analysis been carried out around the number of jobs that will be affected?  There is a whole range of contracts, including Mr. Whelan's own case, where it is hoped employers will extend the contract or else one will be retired.  One is not pensioned any more because the pension age is 65, 66 or 67 as the case may be and one will be put on the dole, the jobseeker's allowance.  If all those people have to extend their contracts that means there are many young people whose job opportunities have been delayed to them by one, two or three years.  Has a job of work been done to see what will be the effect on the jobs market?<\/p> <p>  The other question is around alternatives.  I agree with Mr. Whelan's scepticism around the actuarial approach being given to this pension time bomb as it is presented.  Have any alternatives been offered, for example, to look again at the PRSI contributions, the reinstatement of the National Pensions Reserve Fund or such like to ensure that the Social Insurance Fund is adequate to address what is a perceived shortfall?  That is not correctly linked to the petitioner.  The petitioner basically said that it is unfair to lose an entitlement which they were led to believe their PRSI contribution was going to bring them at retirement age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#D00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423663200,"counter":873,"content":"<p>When a person reaches the age of 65 and has no pension and their employer asks him to leave the premises, the correct word for that is dismissal.  What happens when a person reaches the age of 65 is that he or she has to go out the door.  Retirement is a nice thing, it sounds as if one is going to get a watch and pension.  The correct word is dismissal.  No analysis was carried out on the effects on the job market.  When IBEC and ourselves were in with the Department of Social Protection we were asking the same questions but we did not agree on everything; basically, we were asking for clarity as to whether people would have to stay on.  The attitude of the officials at that stage was that it was being implemented, if people want to stay on they can take their legal cases and see how they get on.  This was done on the basis that we will just do it and let the fall-out be what it is.  No analysis was done of the likely effect and we still do not know the likely effect.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, it is very hard to get a handle on what is being done.  For instance, one of the aspects is that one is entitled to unemployment benefit for nine months, but is that the case?  It is if one has not been unemployed in the recent years but quite a number of people when planning for retirement would have taken their redundancy package and signed on for unemployment and so on and would have been depending on it but not everybody gets it.  Something bizarre has happened in respect of unemployment benefit and while I welcome some of the change it but it is not a long-term but a short-term fix.  As I understand it, a person who is entitled to unemployment benefit will not just get it for the nine months but will be given it for 12 months.  That is certainly better than nothing and helps in a little way but it does not help for the second and third year.  To some extent, the effect of that was to prevent a bigger backlash against this in the short term.  The alternative is that if the pension age has to go up.  By all means let it go up but let it go up for everybody and much more slowly  than the present rate and let it go up to 68 when it has gone up to 68 for everybody else.  Why should Irish workers be the only workers in Europe who do not get their pension until they are 68 years of age?  By all means push it out but an injustice has been which can be mitigated if it is pushed out a little and only to 67 years of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I call Deputy McEntee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#D00500","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Whelan for appearing before the committee and for his presentation.

I do not have the figure to hand, but it was a rather small figure.  Has ICTU done a cost-benefit analysis on the matter?  Let us compare that with the net cost to the State.  There would be a loss of tax revenue because those people would not be working and we would be paying them unemployment benefit for that period.  On the face of it, only a saving of &euro;500,000 annually to the State is at issue in respect of introducing something that has major implications.  Has ICTU had a chance to examine the net cost and the implications?<\/p><p> Another point mentioned by Mr. Gaynor is the ring-fencing principle in industrial relations.  We have seen it with newly qualified teachers and nurses.  People who were already in the system were ring-fenced and any changes brought in to working conditions were only for new entrants to the system.  Mr. Gaynor has suggested that if something like this were to be introduced, then it is only right and proper from an industrial relations perspective that we should only introduce it for people who start to pay PRSI from when the agreement is made, and anyone who is already in the system should be ring-fenced.  Mr. Whelan is an industrial relations negotiator.  This seems to be a generally accepted principle across unions and employers.  Does this fly in the face of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#D00800","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423663200,"counter":880,"content":"<p>I will answer the second question first.  It is even bigger than that.  The industrial relations aspect comes from a far more fundamental thing in law, that is, legitimate expectation.  There is a thinking in law whereby if an employee pays for something on the basis that he has been told this is what he will get, then he has a legitimate expectation.  This proposition tears up legitimate expectation in a most unfair way.  If anyone had the wherewithal to bring a Supreme Court challenge or a challenge to the institutions in Europe, I believe this could not but fly in the face of legitimate expectation.<\/p> <p>  The other question was whether we had done a cost-benefit analysis.  We have not.  I believe that initially only a rather small number of people would be affected by it.  However, the fewer the number of people affected by this, the greater the injustice.  If I and five others are the only people to have lost &euro;24,000 as a result, it is a greater injustice than if 50,000 people were affected.  In other words, it is worse if a small number of people have been targeted.  It would have the effect that a small number of people have lost out but no one else would lose out.

They are not receiving an adequate service because the broadband system is not up to speed.  What recourse can be provided by the Department?  The communications regulator has issued very unsatisfactory communications in this regard.  The main issue on the communications side is the broadband spend.

The mapping exercise was critical; in fact, it was required in the context of the state aid application, to which the Deputy referred.  We will have to make a state aid application under the general principle, of which colleagues will be aware.  State aid rules &ndash; EU-wide rules &ndash; prohibit the State from intervening in the provision of services where the private or commercial sector is delivering or intends to deliver a service.  We have not yet made our state aid application, but I expect it to be made sometime mid-year.  We are not yet ready to make the application.  We are doing an enormous amount of work on a daily basis in the Department and with our external advisers in looking at financial, governance, legal and contract issues.  Will there be one or several contracts in terms of the State's intervention?  Who will own the network which will be the equivalent of 100,000 km of road, if one was to think of it as a roads system?  An enormous amount of work needs to be done this year on the state aid application to take us to the stage to which we need to get by the end of the year to go to tender to find a contractor or contractors to build the network.

That is not the position we are in, but the mapping exercise shows what the commercial sector will do between now and the end of 2016.  I know that is not a full answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, but he can say to a constituent or anyone else in the country who is wondering how he or she will fare and how he or she is fixed in terms of broadband that if he or she is to be supplied by the private sector, it will happen before the end of 2016, at a minimum 30 Mbps.  That is important also because many people have access to broadband but not at adequate speeds.  In fact, practically everybody has access to some broadband service, but it is not adequate.  The private sector is to deliver a minimum figure of 30 Mbps by the end of 2016.  The map is prospective to the end of 2016.

Tourism is an obvious sector.  There are many other people in new innovative areas of business who depend on broadband, not just to download from the system but also to upload.  We understand what the need is, but we want to do it properly.  The private sector has given an undertaking to deliver between now and the end of 2016.

I am not taking a political shot, but it was a huge mistake, from which we must learn, no matter which policy area we are examining.  It is urgent that we move forward.  I know that we want to get it right, but we have learned that if one tries to rush things, they will not work out.  It is vital that we get it right and have it done as soon as possible.

In 1988 or 1989, the Deputy's colleagues introduced a new legislative basis for independent broadcasting which gave rise to a degree of controversy at the time but which has since bedded down quite well.  We now have a lively public sector alongside an equally lively private sector in broadcasting.  We need to maintain both sectors.<\/p> <p>  RTE has had a dual funding model since the early 1960s.  The decision to establish a sound and vision fund was one change in that regard.  A percentage of proceeds from the licence fee is made available under the fund for programming that is not directly produced by RTE.  I support the sound and vision fund and we have recently announced a new phase of it.  The question of redistributing revenue from the licence fee away from the public sector to include the private sector is more difficult to justify.  If we are to have a robust public broadcasting sector, it needs stable funding.

That one-off stimulus of &euro;30 million is gone, and even though we got an additional &euro;10 million, if I am not mistaken, the provision shows a net drop of &euro;20 million on last year's figures.  If the Deputy is asking me whether I think the better energy programmes and all the SEAI project work is important, I can tell him, yes, it is critically important that people's homes, businesses and public building are energy efficient.  As public representatives we need to ensure that we render public and private buildings energy efficient so that the cost of energy will decrease in the future.  We should not, as the adage goes, be putting the coal up the chimney.  We need to ensure we reduce dependence not only on imported fossil fuels but on all energy sources.  We should think about reducing energy consumption.  The energy companies might not necessarily like to hear us say that.  We want a growing economy, but we want to try to ensure we decrease our use of energy where we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#G00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>I presume the Minister works in liaison with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  When will the new planning guidelines for wind turbines come into force?  Families have been very distressed by the granting of planning permission for these turbines.  It is causing major problems.<\/p> <p>  There are people who propose to generate energy - who have made their application to join the national grid and are in line to do so - who are not progressing their projects, yet they are holding their positions in the queue.  Is there a case for setting conditions for applications to join the national grid such that the applicant must show that he or she has the money to complete the project within an agreed timeframe?  The present arrangement is akin to bed blocking in hospitals, as it blocks new entrants.<\/p> <p>  I have talked to people in Bord na M&oacute;na about growing willow and other crops for biomass.  The reality is that our timber industry cannot produce enough trees to supply the sawmills, not to mind using them for something else.<\/p> <p>  The price of electricity is very important.  Other countries can produce electricity more cheaply than Ireland, but they have moved away from wind energy, while we are subsidising it.  Has the Minister a roadmap for bringing down the price of electricity to ensure our economy is more competitive, which will help businesses to create more jobs?  Let me be clear: I do not buy into paying levies to subsidise energy production that is costing us jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#G00800","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>My first point will not endear me to the Deputy, but to achieve the targets that we regard as important, in order to decarbonise our economy, irrespective of which energy sources we use to replace it, there will be a cost.  It will not be possible to do it for nothing.  The approach we have taken is to do it through refit incentives and support schemes.  The Deputy is correct if he is saying that we should be vigilant and careful to ensure that the policy mix is right and that if we get to a stage at which the supports for one particular energy source are no longer justified, we should switch from that.  Of course that is right.  Let me sound a note of caution: in order to achieve our objectives, there will be a cost.  The question is who will bear it.  Will it be the Exchequer, the consumer or the business?  It may not be a long-term cost and it may taper off at a certain stage when we have reduced our dependence on fossil fuels permanently, but there will continue to be a cost.<\/p> <p>  To address the Deputy's question on comparators for Ireland, let me draw his attention to a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in January 2015, which noted that for 2012 Ireland had an average electricity support, per unit of gross electricity produced, of &euro;2.03 per megawatt, versus an average across the 22 countries assessed of &euro;13.68 per megawatt.  Only two countries, Finland and Norway, had lower supports than Ireland.  It is important to put the issues in context.  People say that other countries are turning away from generating wind energy, but no two countries in Europe are exactly the same.  Some have done more and others have done a lot less in terms of wind energy.  What is required is a mix.  If we move away from one source, we must think of what we are replacing it with.  Each and every source of energy has an issue.  The Deputy mentioned biomass, and if I am interpreting him correctly, he said the sheer quantity of timber required was enormous.  That is an obstacle to the bigger picture for biomass.  Some of the other inputs are easier to advance through Government policy.  We have to be conscious that the Drax power station type model requires enormous inputs of wood, and that is an issue with biomass.  We have already touched on the issues that arise from wind energy.  I would like to see solar energy advancing, but there are obstacles and issues with each and every replacement source of energy. <\/p> <p>   Deputy Fitzmaurice asked two questions about the national grid.  First, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to issue guidelines, but obviously my officials and I have been in contact with the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and his officials, as well as the SEAI, and we are looking at the review of wind energy guidelines in respect of noise, proximity and shadow flicker.  It is proposed to update the relevant sections of the existing guidelines on each of these specific issues.  A number of technical appendices will be developed to assist planning authorities on noise assessment, monitoring and the setting of planning conditions.  Draft guidelines, as the Deputies will be aware, were published in December 2013 for public consultation.  After deep consideration of the various submissions and the modelling that arises from that, the revisions to the guidelines that the Deputy asked me about will be finalised and will be issued to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act.  I believe that will be done in the early part of 2015, although I cannot give the Deputy a precise date.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>I think it would be worthwhile to set aside money to address the greatest waste of solid fuel, the open fireplace in domestic dwellings.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Griffin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2333\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Brendan Griffin\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=TR6&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Brendan Griffin\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Something simple could be done, for example, grant-aiding the replacement of open fireplaces with solid fuel stoves, although not necessarily wood-burning stoves.

It is in the process of being carried out and due for publication, possibly in mid-2016.  On the question of how much it will cost, we have in mind a figure in the order of &euro;1 million.  Importantly, the consultation process did not just consider the potential environmental health impact but also the human health impact.  Many of the submissions received, including from Deputy Michael Colreavy's part of the world in counties Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan, asked for there to be someone on the group with a health competency.  I am delighted that there is someone on it with that expertise, as the survey's two major pillars will be to consider the environmental and health impacts.<\/p> <p>  Stemming from a number of public meetings that we held in Sligo last summer, I also asked for some feedback during the process, instead of having to wait two years for the results.  I am delighted that there is a dedicated information-sharing website.  We will be able to furnish the Deputy with the details.  I am also hoping for a mid-term review to be carried out in whatever form in a couple of weeks time.<\/p> <p>  Regarding petroleum, a number of initiatives are ongoing.  The Department's expenditure is on promotion because we need to get companies interested.  Thankfully, there is momentum within the industry, given the new Atlantic licensing round that will close in 2015.  We will not be in a position to say how real the momentum is until the close of the round on the Atlantic margins, but the feedback from companies has been steady.  After decades, there have only been four finds, but we must consider the geography of what is available to us.  In a European perspective, Ireland is the fourth largest country if the undersea landmass off the south and south-west coasts is included.  Ireland is larger than Germany, although not as large as Portugal, France and Spain.  The Department is focusing a great deal of its energy on this front, particularly via the Geological Survey of Ireland and the INFOMAR project.  The large amount of research involved is being undertaken at considerable expense.  There is a partnership between the Government and industry, with the main tenets being transparency, openness and accountability, but the undersea landmass available to us has resource potential.<\/p> <p>  Reverting to the contribution of unconventional systems of extraction and exploration on land and without undermining the independence of the EPA-sponsored analysis, we have a great deal of territory under the sea that can be explored.  Obviously, it will depend on companies' exploratory finds.  The Minister has specific responsibility for the Corrib field.  I hope the first gas supply will start towards the end of the second quarter of this year.  In terms of our reliance on fossil fuels, we import 100% of our oil and 95% of our gas.  With the new Corrib gas supply coming on stream in mid-2015, we could meet as much as 42% of our own gas needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#H00800","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I was not going to mention hydraulic fracturing-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#H00900","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>But seeing as how I brought it up-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#H01000","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>Yes.

They did a pile of cleaning up of rivers and enhancing inland fisheries.  The Department should take a more proactive role.  Inland fisheries appears to be the last thing to be looked at.

Obviously, there are stocking challenges with brown trout and wild salmon and there are discussions and consultations taking place about management.  We could have a very wide debate about the constraints and the challenges, be it pollution, cormorants or seals, but we have a difficulty in terms of stocks.  At the same time there are very positive partnerships at community level.  I will cite one, which the Deputy alluded to, on the River Lacken.  There has been a great partnership project there between the local development company and the people.  In fact, workers in the T&uacute;s programme came to work on the rehabilitation of spawning beds, looking at walkways and so forth.  This work must come from the community.  When I meet with members of the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland they talk about the pressures they are under in terms of fewer personnel, enforcement and being vigilant in monitoring, so the community, local angling clubs and the local groups in charge of the various rivers have a massive role in this regard.<\/p> <p>  On the question of money going back to Europe, many of these funding applications are demand led at community level.

I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion regarding information sharing for creating awareness.  Getting away from inland fisheries for a moment, even within the GSI section, where work is ongoing on the Tellus project, which is a mapping exercise looking at water tables and other information that will be shared with different local authorities, the EPA and so forth and on which an extra &euro;3 million will be spent this year, there is a job to be done in terms of creating awareness.  Although it is in the very early stages, in case the Secretary General and the Assistant Secretary General fall off their seats, we have just had a discussion on the possibility of bringing the work of the Department, be it on inland fisheries, GSI or in the petroleum division, to secondary schools to bring it to the attention of students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22015021100002#K00400","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>We will proceed to subhead F, appropriations-in-aid.

I assure the committee that the Latvian Presidency intends to work in full conformity with the provisions of the Lisbon treaty, respecting the competences and prerogatives of all the parties involved in the EU decision-making process, which is collective by default.  The priorities of the Latvian Presidency have been developed in close co-operation with the other members of the trio, namely, Italy and Luxembourg, as well as all the European institutions and member states, duly respecting their interests and positions.<\/p> <p>  The general priorities of the Latvian Presidency have been presented in Dublin on several occasions.  Committee members will recall that the Latvian Presidency has two broad objectives.  First, to steer the work of all relevant council formations to fully overcome the economic and financial crisis.  Second, to promote stability, security and development in the neighbourhood and the world in close co-operation with the European Commission, the European External Action Service and all the member states.  To reach these two objectives we intend to promote three main themes, namely, competitive Europe, digital Europe and engaged Europe.  Naturally, while speaking before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade I will focus on the external dimension and the major issues pertinent to the common foreign and security policy, the common security and defence policy, external trade, economic relations and the enlargement process.<\/p> <p>  The Presidency will extend all possible support to the President of the European Council and the High Representative in her role as the President of the Foreign Affairs Council, to help her to conduct the common foreign and security policy and co-ordinate all external action of the Union.  This will be done through chairing appropriate meetings upon invitation from the High Representative, organising numerous events in Latvia and lending our knowledge and expertise in specific fields of external relations.<\/p> <p>  During the coming five months the Latvian Presidency will put particular emphasis on EU relations with the Eastern Partnership countries and central Asian countries.  As committee members are aware, the European neighbourhood policy will remain the key EU instrument when it comes to framing relationships with neighbouring countries.  Ongoing conflicts and instability in the broader neighbourhood are a cause of great concern for all member states and institutions.  More than ever, the neighbourhood countries need EU attention and support.  Hence, Latvia is keen to enhance the effectiveness of the EU policy in addressing political and security challenges in the eastern and southern neighbourhoods.  To achieve this, we will support a comprehensive review of the European neighbourhood policy aimed at better effectiveness through increased differentiation.<\/p> <p>  Latvia intends to contribute to the strengthening of the Eastern Partnership as an inclusive platform and the promotion of a more individual approach to each partner country, respecting their ambitions and objectives.  We are keen to strengthen political association, economic integration, enhanced trade, improved mobility, people-to-people contacts, education co-operation, and engagement with civil societies, as appropriate.  In co-operation with the President of the European Council and relevant EU institutions, Latvia will host the 4th Eastern Partnership summit in Riga on 21&ndash;22 May 2015.  We maintain the summit will provide an excellent opportunity to review the progress that has been achieved since the Vilnius Eastern Partnership summit as well as set the way ahead.<\/p> <p>  Latvia will support the European External Action Service in further developing the relationship with the southern neighbourhood region, contributing to stability and security of the region based on the principles of democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law.  Latvia will also support the efforts of the High Representative to strengthen EU engagement with central Asian countries, as we see a need to intensify our relations with that part of the world.  To this end, Latvia is keen to promote EU-central Asia dialogue and co-operation in areas of importance for both sides, including energy security, transport, sustainable development, the rule of law and education.  In this regard, the review of the EU-central Asia strategy in March 2015 will be of the utmost importance.  The scaling-down of the international security presence in Afghanistan in 2015 as well as instability in Iraq and Syria require greater EU attention towards central Asia to meet such common challenges as terrorism, border security and drug trafficking.  The implementation of regional co-operation programmes, namely, the border management programme in central Asia and the central Asia drug action plan, will be crucial in this regard.<\/p> <p>  While noting the strategic importance of enlargement policy in promoting political stability and economic prosperity in Europe, the Presidency remains committed to moving forward with the ongoing accession negotiations with Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey with a view to achieving further sustained progress.  The Presidency will pursue an enlargement policy based on the principles of conditionality and each country's merits.  These principles will also guide the Presidency's work in advancing the European perspective for other western Balkan countries according to respective stages of their integration, while keeping EU membership as the ultimate goal of the process.<\/p> <p>  My country fully supports the efforts aimed at increasing the effectiveness and visibility of the common security and defence policy.  Latvia will contribute to the preparations for the European Council of June 2015 and will underline the importance of continued progress on the security and defence agenda.  In this regard, Latvia deems it important to advance the work towards better and more efficient civilian and military capabilities, including EU battle-groups and better civil-military co-operation to address maritime security risks and threats.  We will also support enhanced civil-military co-operation when it comes to improving cyber defence awareness and protection.  Of course, appropriate attention will be paid to the challenges faced by the European defence industry as well.<\/p> <p>  Latvia will highlight the crucial nature of co-operation with international organisations and individual partners as part of the CSDP, in particular, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United Nations and the United States.  Close co-operation with NATO in capability development, rapid response, training and exercise requires our attention.  Naturally, Latvia will promote co-operation between the EU and the US in the light of emerging security challenges in many parts of the world.  The Presidency is keen to pay particular attention to problems related to external aspects of counter-terrorism such as foreign fighters, financing of terrorism, radicalisation and recruitment.  We are keen to address these issues in the first instance through better implementation of the already-agreed EU instruments and policy measures in all member states.<\/p> <p>  Open and fair external trade is vital for all of Europe.  Greater market openness as well as more active trade and investment flows are essential for promoting growth and economic recovery throughout the union.  The Presidency will contribute, therefore, to achieving further progress on the World Trade Organization multilateral negotiations and the Doha development agenda.  The Presidency attaches great importance to the ongoing WTO accession negotiations, including, but not limited to, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan and Serbia.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">H.E. Dr. Gints Apals:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It will support the preparations for the upcoming WTO Ministerial Conference of 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Presidency will support also the ongoing work on bilateral trade agreements.  I assure the committee that Latvia considers the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement and Free Trade Agreement negotiations with Japan and Vietnam as top priorities for the coming five months.  The implementation of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements with Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine will be high on our agenda.  In addition, Latvia will promote the approval of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada and the bilateral trade agreement with Singapore. <br\/><br\/>The year will be of crucial importance for progress on a universal post-2015 agenda for sustainable development<b><\/b>and the eradication of poverty.  The Presidency will work energetically to advance consultations on comprehensive EU contribution to international negotiations leading to the UN Summit in September 2015, facilitating the adoption of a new framework, including a set of globally-applicable sustainable development goals, SDGs, which will succeed the millennium development goals, MDGs.  In that context the Presidency sees gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment, good governance, the rule of law, human rights, and inclusive, sustainable growth to be of particular importance, including in regard to the European Year for Development 2015. <br\/><br\/>The Presidency will also contribute to preparations that lead to agreed EU position for the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015.  The partnership agreement between the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries and the EU is due to expire in 2020.  Therefore, the Presidency will work with the European External Action Service, EEAS, and the European Commission to advance EU reflection on future relations with the ACP countries.  Together with the EEAS and the Commission, the Presidency will closely monitor the ongoing and emerging humanitarian crises, as well as disease outbreaks, of which addressing the Ebola epidemic will be of paramount importance.  The Presidency will help to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of EU humanitarian aid<b><\/b>and to advance EU humanitarian advocacy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>third countries and international organisations.  The Presidency will support the necessary follow-up for preparations for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit.<br\/><br\/>I have outlined probably the most important policy areas, which we regard as a priority and the committee will understand that the work programme of the Presidency and the EU as a whole is extremely broad.  I will gladly answer any questions members may have on any of the subjects I mentioned and I will also gladly go beyond the area of external relations should that be necessary.  I thank the members for their kind attention and we can now move on to the members' questions and comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It is important for all members states of the EU and its citizens that we boost smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  I welcome that Latvia hopes to advance the formulation of a proper framework for data protection, which is important in this era in which we are living.  Reducing telecommunications costs is an issue particularly for people who travel a good deal and for somebody like myself who lives in a Border constituency.  Unfortunately, we have a land Border in our own country and we have to put up with those costs.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the European External Action Service and the Lisbon treaty of 2009, both of those in their own way have made Europe a more visible actor in international affairs and in trade and diplomacy also.  The ambassador outlined that Latvia wants to facilitate a continued and an increased presence of the EU and better engagement and relations with its immediate neighbours.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the Eastern Partnership, does the ambassador believe that a more prudent approach is needed by the European Union in its dealings with neighbouring countries?  He stated in his presentation that Latvia intends to contribute to the strengthening of the Eastern Partnership as an inclusive platform and to promoting a more individual approach to each partner country, respecting their own ambitions.  That is a mutual requirement for both the EU and its neighbouring countries.<\/p> <p>  Last summer Latvia increased its defence budget on its eastern border with Russia and it requested additional security help from NATO.  I note in a comment Latvia's ambassador to the United States made last Thursday that he stated that citizens of Latvia remain nervous and concerned about the rising tensions between Russia and the West.  He also stated that the situation is getting worse.  Has Latvia felt supported sufficiently by the European Union and the European External Action Service when dealing with Russian aggression on its borders?  As we review the work of the Presidency of the EU, the heightened tension and conflict in the Ukraine today and the major loss of life is a very worrying development.  We sincerely hope that a ceasefire will be achieved and that progress will be made in bringing about real and meaningful dialogue to bring that dispute to a proper conclusion.

I hope the Ministry for foreign affairs in Latvia recognise his hard work.<\/p> <p>  To follow on from what Deputy Smith said, Latvia plays a very important role in a very sensitive political period.  Ukraine and the Eastern Partnership were mentioned.  A summit will be held in Riga on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy.  Can I be in a little provocative and ask the ambassador a number of questions?  We are collectively aware of the difficulties of those emerging democracies from under the yoke of communism but we are also very conscious of mistakes Europe might have made in the past in its relationship with the Eastern Partnership and in the relationship with Ukraine.  I have just come back from there and this committee has addressed the issue off the largest successful political party in the recent Moldovan elections being a pro-Putin, a pro-Soviet party.  In that region there are great sensibilities which require the utmost diplomatic skills.  Those are the skills of Europe's relationship with the Russia Federation.<\/p> <p>  Latvia has a substantial Russian speaking population.  By way of background and to counterpose what I am going to ask the ambassador, I am sure he will be aware that this country in the past four years has granted citizenship to 70,000 new Irish citizens form 126 countries in the world.  He may know that we advocate new communities and immigrants to participate in local elections.

Everybody has mentioned the problems in Ukraine.  I would also like to refer to that and how it impacts on Latvia.  When the problems started in Ukraine, there was a general increase in Russian military and intelligence activity in Latvia, and Lithuania and Estonia as well, and this was noticed very much.  There is a large ethnic Russian population in Latvia.  About a quarter of the population is of Russian origin.  The Russians justified their activities in Ukraine on the basis of the abuse of the rights of the Russian-speaking population.  Is Latvia open to similar accusations?

The ambassador said in his speech earlier that the Latvian Presidency will be focused on jobs and growth.  Ireland's EU Presidency was also focused on jobs and growth, but unfortunately unemployment, specifically youth unemployment, is a significant problem not only in Ireland but right across Europe.  A &euro;300 billion investment package has been announced by the European Commission, but many see that as one leg of the stool.  Does Latvia see the area of youth employment as a priority for the Presidency?<\/p> <p>  The question of Greece was touched on earlier.  There are a few debates in Europe on how we move forward.  Some are pro-austerity and others are pro-stimulus.  The Greek Government has called for a debt conference.  Would Latvia see that as part of its EU Presidency or would it have a view on that idea of a debt conference and bringing together people, not only the public representatives, but civic society groups and so on that are impacted by debt and poverty and deprivation?  Greece is looking for a write-down again.  It is outside the EU Presidency, but I am interested in Latvia and where it positions itself in that debate within Europe.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador said TTIP is one of the priorities.  There are huge concerns about this, which we have discussed at this committee and at the European Affairs committee.  There are aspects of TTIP with which people are very uncomfortable.  Ireland has concerns about the impact on our agricultural and food sectors, whether it is about regulation and deregulation and so on.  The big area people are concerned about is investor-state dispute settlement.  There is significant concern about it right across Europe.  The Commission stated recently that it had received 150,000 replies to its consultation and 145,000 related to opposition to this matter.  The ambassador says he wants to push ahead with the negotiations, but the concern from civil society and across Europe relates to the secrecy surrounding the negotiations themselves.  Are there similar concerns in Latvia on aspects of that agreement - the change in work portfolios, people moving from jobs, trade within countries, within Europe and so on?  Are those concerns shared?  Some are calling for the suspension rather than the prioritisation of the talks.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador says Latvia strongly supports the European common security and defence policy and he would like to see enhanced co-operation with NATO and the increased use of training and battle groups.  I do not share his enthusiasm.  I accept that Latvia has historical reasons for this, and it is a member of NATO, but many of us see NATO as a relic from a previous time.  Would the ambassador see the interaction there as complementary rather than competitive?  Ireland is not a member of NATO.  How do countries like Ireland figure in this closer alignment?  Does the ambassador not believe issues like the common security and defence policy, CSDP, are driving some of the scepticism in Europe?  Some would say it is an attack on sovereignty.  Is CSDP entirely framed in the interests of larger EU countries?  I am more concerned about the debate on where we fit into this moving together with NATO, as a neutral country?  There are concerns.  Latvia is very concerned about the issues in Ukraine, as are others, and the Eastern Partnership.  Is there a role for those countries that have decided to stay outside the partnership?  The ambassador mentioned people having an independent role and so on.  How does he see outreach to those countries, like Armenia and Azerbaijan, that have decided to stay outside the partnership developing?<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1774\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FOJ&amp;amp;memberid=1774&amp;amp;pid=SeanCroweSF&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Is the Presidency thinking in terms of conferences or how is it going to pull that together?

Some people say there is still potential even at this late stage with the initiative from France and Germany.  <\/p><p> On the European Year for Development 2015 can the ambassador detail any specific plans in this regard?  How will the Latvian Presidency advance many of those issues?  The ambassador mentioned the implementation of regional co-operation programmes in central Asia and the whole area of drug trafficking.  After we returned from Iran some were keen that it should have a relationship with the European Union.  Previously the European Union had a relationship with Iran and countries in that region to try to stop the flow of drugs from Afghanistan.  Figures were given for the growth of the poppy and it will all end up on our shore.  Does the ambassador see the Iranians or other countries in that region as having a role and what can Latvia, during its presidency, do in this area?  The Iranians complain that they are not getting support.  One of the reasons given for this was the death penalty.  We co-operate with other countries around the world, despite the death penalty, as it is flowing straight to Europe.<\/p><p> On the issue of minority languages, I understand there are many minority languages and community groups throughout Europe which the European Union supports.

We know how time consuming and difficult the presidency is for all sections of government.  Russia has been mentioned.  Can the ambassador see any approaches that would improve relationships with Russia, outside of the issues in relation to concerns in Ukraine, as the dialogue between Russia, which is Latvia's nearest neighbour, and the European Union has almost dried up?  Surely, that is not conducive to developing relationships, understanding and influencing events which are important to both Russia and to the European Union.  One of the key issues in the European Union at the moment is the situation regarding Greece and potentially leaving the Union but hopefully not.  As the Presidency, can Latvia see itself taking initiatives rather than the various ministerial meetings to try to overcome the difficulties that have arisen and find solutions as it is a highly complex issue?  While some commentators say the EU is in a better position now to lose Greece than it was previously, we have to be careful about believing much of that because it certainly would reduce international confidence in the euro if Greece left the European Union, apart from other issues surrounding it.

I apologise for my late arrival but I have read his presentation which is interesting.  I was particularly struck by his comments with regard to strengthening the Eastern Partnership.  He also included the engagement with central Asian countries, some of us hope to be there later this month.  There is much tension in that area.  The relationship that Latvia builds with those countries will, to a large extent, assist the direction that the EU and those countries will go in the future.  I welcome the Latvian Presidency committing to doing  that.<\/p> <p>  Ukraine has been mentioned.  I welcome the dialogue which is taking place.  I would raise a question in that regard, it is very much a German-Franco driven initiative.  It struck me that perhaps there should have been some EU-wide involvement and Latvia, given that it holds the presidency, might be involved.  Perhaps the representatives will comment.  I am friendly with some of the Latvian parliamentarians and I know that they would be hostile to Russia because of their experience; in the same way as we were oppressed by the British for many centuries, Latvia has also suffered oppression under the Russians in its history.  Some of them have chastised me for some of my encouragement with the Russian authorities.  As Deputy Neville said, that is the way forward.  Russia and Europe have many inter-connected objectives and interests that need to be founded on a better relationship than we had.  Perhaps the representatives would comment on the Europe-wide aspect of that.  <\/p> <p>  The ultimate question would be with regard to Greece.  There is much talk about the economic crisis in Greece which obviously is hurting the people badly.  We have experienced it here as have other European countries to a greater or lesser degree.  It has to be said that the European project has been damaged by this crisis.  There has been a dearth of quality political leadership across Europe all during this crisis.  The manner in which they tried to deal with it has not taken into account the effects on citizens and, perhaps, dealing with it in a way which has ameliorated some of the difficulties which people have encountered in their daily lives as a consequence of this.  All governments carry some responsibility.  Govem the geographic location of Greece, and given what is happening in the Middle East - it is nearly an entry point for any escalation of the crisis there - but also given the political make-up in Greece, real leadership will be required to deal with that issue.  Nobody is talking any more about a two tier euro which would reflect the disparity between the economies.  That was largely debated at the outset of the crisis but seems to have gone off the radar altogether.  How Greece is handled is not just a Greek issue, there will be knock-on effects in Spain, probably in the not too distant future, and perhaps in Italy as well.  It needs to be handled in a way that takes into account the medium and longer-term vision if there is a vision for Europe any more.  I say that as somebody who is fully committed to the European project but who will think long and hard the next time we are voting for a treaty as to whether I will vote \"Yes\" or \"No\".<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jim Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1982\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Senator Jim Walsh\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=FOJ&amp;amp;memberid=1982&amp;amp;pid=JimWalsh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Senator Jim Walsh\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That would never have been my position in the past, but the manner in which this crisis has been dealt with by the European Union is nothing short of scandalous, although others may disagree with that point of view.<\/p><p> I refer to the ambassador's comments on counter-terrorism and the high profile incidents in Paris and other issues come to mind.  Approximately 30 people have left Ireland to travel to the Middle East as combatants.  They have joined the terrorist group that is in charge of parts of Iraq and Syria and are being trained to engage in terrorist activities.  I  listened to a radio programme yesterday on which it was reported that foreign combatants were being placed at the forefront in killing people, including by beheading.  It is obvious that this is being done to break any taboo they might have in order that when they move to other countries, they may well pose a significant threat to the civilian populations.  In the opinion of the ambassador, how should citizens who return to European countries and who have participated in violence be dealt with?  How should we deal with the issue of immigration?  It is not inconceivable that many who are not citizens of European countries may find themselves drifting into Europe in the next two decades.  They may well come with a particular intent which will not be benevolent towards the freedom we enjoy in this part of the world.

I assure members that I will try to do my best to answer the questions one by one in order that every member will receive a proper response from our representation.  Not all of the questions are pertinent to the role of Latvia as Presidency of the European Council.  Nevertheless, I regard this as a unique opportunity to speak to a large number of elected representatives of the Irish people; therefore, I will gladly dwell on each and every question raised.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with the question from Deputy Brendan Smith concerning the role of the European Unin, the External Action Service and support for those countries that might be nervous, as the Deputy described it, about the situation to the east of their borders.  One must always keep in mind the wider context.  There are several international organisations active on a global or regional basis; this is not only about the European Union and the External Action Service.  I also deliberately referred to NATO as the defence alliance in that it deals directly with military threats to its members.  The European Union is not a military alliance and this distinction should be kept in mind.  Therefore, the instruments of the European Union are mostly political and economic.  <\/p> <p>  From my perspective, the European Union and the External Action Service are doing their best, employing the means in their possession - diplomatic means, statements, public messages and economic sanctions against individuals or states.  This is the role of the European Union and the External Action service.  <\/p> <p>  I referred to NATO and the NATO alliance.  The individual member states and their governments are responsible for the defence of the territories.  There are many other international forums which are also very useful in addressing these security concerns.  I refer, for example, to the OSCE and, in partial form, the Council of Europe.  I could list many more, if necessary.  In brief, the role of the European Union has been appropriate, while the External Action Service has also been active, given its mandate.  The latest initiative is a initiative of France and Germany, coming on top of the activities of or those agreed and pursued by the European Union.  I can only hope for complementary work between the European Union, the External Action Service and individual member states, including my own.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked many questions.  I do not necessarily agree with all of his qualifications when speaking about the situation in my country or Ukraine.  He asked about the European neighbourhood policy and the positions of Ukraine and Moldova.  We recognise that there might be differences between national positions.  The European neighbourhood policy concerns six very different countries.  Three countries have signed association agreements that are being ratified by EU member states, while three other countries are still interested in participation in the European neighbourhood policy, but they have their own approach.  For example, Armenia has chosen to join the Eurasian economic union and customs union, but it is still eager to have political dialogue and a political association with the European Union.  In the future member states might look for flexible arrangements to accommodate every single member of that group according to their ambitions and objectives.  At least from the perspective of my government, the Eastern Partnership is a useful platform for dialogue with these countries.  It is also a useful platform for dialogue between the countries of the partnership.  It is a multilateral platform that facilitates exchange and co-operation between the six countries mentioned.  Therefore, in holding the Presidency and as a member state, Latvia is very much interested in keeping this platform active for the future because it opens a range of avenues in relations between Europe and these countries and between themselves.  The ultimate purpose is to promote our values in the wider region, not only economic interests but also the values of the European Union, including human rights and the rule of law, for example.  This also applies to Ukraine and Moldova, even in spite of the fact that not all political parties in these countries fully embrace European values.  One should always keep in mind that this is an open and ongoing process.  The spread of European values and the extension of our principles form part of an open-ended process.  The Deputy referred to the success of specific parties in the Moldovan elections, but one should always continue dialogue and convince people that the European approach has its merits.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the Deputy's second question on the Russian-speaking population.  I do not really recognise the link between ethnic origin or the native tongue and citizenship.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">H.E. Dr. Gints Apals:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have citizens of many backgrounds and citizenship is not awarded to anybody on the basis of their ethnic origins or linguistic identity.  Therefore, there are many Russian-speaking citizens of Latvia, some of whom are ethnic Russians while others are not.  The Russian language is widely spoken and Russian is probably my second language and my first foreign language.  Therefore, the committee might also consider me to be a Russian speaker or a member of the group.  <\/p><p> Latvian policy in matters of citizenship is very simple.  Latvia will grant citizenship to any permanent resident on the basis of individual application.  What we cannot accept for legal and political considerations is that the State could or should impose citizenship on a group of persons without individual applications.  This would be wrong.  Citizenship cannot be imposed on anyone.  This applies not only to Latvia but also to many other countries in the world.  Therefore, when it comes to citizenship, let me assure the committee that this is a purely legal question in my country which has been resolved using all democratic mechanisms and there is no discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or language origins.  <\/p><p> In respect of local elections, if I understand correctly, Deputy Byrne suggested that any permanent resident should be entitled to participate in local elections regardless of his or her citizenship, place or origin, etc.  The international practice contains several approaches.  My country still belongs to a large group of countries that see full participation in political processes, including the right to vote and be elected at all levels, as the prerogative of the citizen.  Anybody who would like to take part in those elections is cordially invited to apply for a Latvian passport.  This will be a speedy process that will facilitate social integration between different groups.  <\/p><p> In respect of discrimination against Russian speakers in Ukraine, I can only say that I do not necessarily agree because I am not in possession of any facts concerning discrimination against the Russian-speaking population Ukraine in the past or currently.  I do not even recall many signals about discrimination against the Russian-speaking population before the outbreak of the recent crisis in eastern Ukraine.  For more than 20 years, Ukraine was a stable country and the international media did not report much about any sort of discrimination.  I can only voice my surprise that very recently and suddenly, many mass media outlets were reporting and talking about the notion of discrimination against ethnic Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.  This was not the case in the past.  This would lead me to say that the EU collectively and EU member states should do something to promote our own values and views through the mass media in the eastern neighbourhood and the Russian Federation because sometimes we might have different views on certain subjects but we then need to have a dialogue which would be a two-way street - not only us accepting certain notions but also us having the liberty to make our voice heard.  This would certainly promote peace and stability throughout the region.  <\/p><p> In respect of the agenda of the Eastern Partnership summit in Riga, I should say that the international situation remains very dynamic.  Certainly the agenda of the summit will be defined in a collective manner which means that all the EU institutions concerned will have the right along with the host nation to define the agenda and the programme of the summit.  We would like to see this as a venue for free and broad debate among all participants - European and those coming from partner countries.  That will allow us not only to take stock of the implementation of association agreements and not only to talk of mobility but also to reflect on the way ahead.  Given the dynamic and changing nature of and situation in the region, some questions are still open.  I am quite sure that by April, we will have much more clarity.  We should also remember that the summit will happen on 21 and 22 May.  That is to say, there is still some time.  While we can collectively define the agenda items, proposals are more than welcome.  <\/p><p> The last question concerned bilateral relations and the problem of sham marriages.  This is a complex issue because in the past, several hundred Latvian women came to Ireland and married third country nationals from several countries.  This was a difficult situation.  The trend has changed and the number of Latvian women coming to Ireland to marry third country nationals has decreased significantly.  We also appreciate all the steps taken by Irish authorities to prevent sham marriages and the human trafficking element of that problem.  This work should continue and is continuing.  There are several international co-operation projects involving institutions and NGOs from Latvia, Ireland and other countries.  Probably the best way to prevent sham marriages involves raising awareness of the risks of such marriages.  At the same time, I must voice my respect for the position of the Irish Government because it is fully entitled to adopt whatever immigration procedures and policies it wishes.  This is a matter for the Irish nation, Parliament and Government.  We cannot interfere with the Government's decisions regarding whether or not the Irish authorities would recognise certain types of marriages.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Dr. Gints Apals stated it is not only the Latvians who come to Ireland.  We can deal with the issue only on a national level as we did by amending the Latvian criminal law in 2013.

In January we also started the HESTIA project in co-operation with the European Commission and the six countries involved are Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Slovakia and Ireland.  We greatly appreciate the Irish Immigrant Council, which joined this project, as well as the support of the Department of Justice and Equality.  <\/p><p> This is a complex issues and will take a great deal to stop.

We appreciate the fact the Greek Government would like to negotiate a solution to the existing economic crisis and debt problem.  This is certainly a positive message.  We also recognise the fact the Greek Government has a democratic mandate.  As far as the European Council is concerned, I must emphasise that the Council can and will even tomorrow discuss the situation in Greece but decisions concerning the problems arising from assistance and possible modification of those provisions are for the eurozone finance ministers.  This probably will be the correct way to negotiate any alteration of existing provisions.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, I recognise what Deputy Crowe said that the issue is complex but the Council has given a clear mandate to the Commission to pursue negotiations.  Democratic scrutiny is important.  I have had assurances from the members of the Commission that of course the Commission is looking for a balanced deal with the United States, which respects the interests of both sides, both the European countries and the United States.  The negations will continue for some time because the Commission would like to assure a fair and balanced deal for both sides.  In that process there are elements of democratic control, not only NGOs, the world conference but also elections to the European Parliament and contacts with elected members of the European Parliament, not least of course, members of the government.  There are many mechanisms to acquire more information and probably these means should be employed by citizens.  The Latvian Presidency will not be of any particular assistance in the process.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on the CSDP and the role of NATO.  NATO is a defence alliance and at the same time it is an important organisational structure providing security and addressing humanitarian crisis and peace operation throughout the world.  The EU through the CSDP mechanisms co-operate with NATO for the purpose of peace operations.  Ireland, as far as I know, is also co-operating with NATO, being a member of the partnership for peace arrangement, with the purpose of conducting joint peace operations.  This is how I see the relationship between Ireland and NATO.  What I said about co-operation with NATO does not necessarily extend to territorial defence.  The EU unfortunately is not a defence alliance, even though the treaty contains the Sovereignty Clause.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the Eastern Partnership of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the ambitions and interests of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus should be taken into account when thinking of the future of the Eastern Partnership.  One can negotiate with those countries.  It is important that they remain as participants of the process.  With time their positions on certain issues may change.  Certainly during this process, we can only keep the existing context and welcome those countries as participants of the Riga Eastern Partnership summit. <\/p> <p>  I did not fully grasp the points made on the increased military involvement in Ukraine.  I would say that I oppose any military involvement or intervention in eastern Ukraine but at this moment there is only one party which is engaged in military intervention in eastern Ukraine.  Certainly this is not the EU and these are not EU member states.<\/p> <p>  In Central Asia, the very important issues are the fight against drugs and the position of Iran in that respect.  The EU is doing a great deal and we need to raise awareness of what it is doing.  For more than a decade the EU has funded two significant programmes in that part of the world, the Board of Management Programme for Central Asia, helping those countries to establish civilised borders and to control migration, trade and everything else across borders; second, the Central Asia drug action plan initiative is also funded by the European Commission.  These are two major instruments.  In addition, one can involve many international structures.  In Malta there are bilateral projects, involving not only EU member states and countries such as Iran but the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna.  That structure is very active in Central Asia doing research and controlling the drugs traffic across central Asian countries to Europe.  This is a matter for international co-operation and the EU can certainly play a positive role and is already doing so.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">H.E. Dr. Gints Apals:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The next question is how to improve relations with the Russian Federation.  I already mentioned that there is certainly one possibility which is to send our message concerning our values and views to the Russian public as actively and widely as possible.  There is a deficit of information inside the Russian Federation on developments elsewhere and how people in Europe perceive developments in Eastern Ukraine and other places.  Much more active exchange of information using European funds for information in the Russian language intended for the Russian population would be a means to improve our relations with the Russian Federation in general.  It is not only about dialogue between governments.  This is also about public diplomacy and everything else.<\/p><p> I already tried to answer the question on Greece by saying that the Presidency of the European Council can probably not take any significant initiatives to address and modify the existing assistance programme to Greece.  Simultaneously, the European Council is having a debate on the social and economic situation in Greece, but the meeting of the eurozone ministers for finance would probably the correct institution through which to formally address those concerns.<\/p><p> I was asked about the European perspective of Eastern Partnership countries.  Certainly, a European perspective exists, but it might be rather remote.  When we speak on Eastern Partnership countries, we must recognise that while they have signed the association agreements, these have not yet even been ratified by all European member states.  This is only the beginning of a very long process which might in time lead to membership as a subject for negotiations and probably as an ultimately reality.  That is not going to be within a few years but rather we should speak in this context of a decade or two.<\/p><p> I have already said concerning the initiative of Germany and France that all complementary initiatives are welcome from the point of view of the Presidency.  I have heard also of similar views of the High Representative who spoke in Dublin two weeks ago.  Therefore, one can only appreciate the new initiative should it be productive.  Concerning Greece, we addressed the issue of negotiations.<\/p><p> The last question I was asked was on counter-terrorism.  The Presidency would like to do whatever is possible to improve counter-terrorism measures in Europe but we must also recognise three important factors.  First, counter-terrorism measures are mostly national competencies of EU member states.  Second, they normally involve sharing information and co-operation between security and intelligence services.  Third, there are already a number of European documents and initiatives on this subject.  Therefore, we believe that the European Council should certainly continue the debate the matter while paying particular attention to better implementation of existing measures.  Before producing new declarations or adopting new documents, one could simultaneously consider full or better implementation of the agreed measures.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021100002#H00900","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I am not sure it is necessary and there are some workability issues associated with it as well.  The ISI has already announced that from the first quarter of this year, 2015, it will publish on a quarterly basis details of debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements that have been voted down by creditors.  That information is now going to be available on a quarterly basis and that will make it available much more quickly, instead of waiting for an annual publication.  I believe this is the right direction to take so that it can be seen clearly what is happening when people are trying to deal with these debt issues.<\/p><p> Debt relief notices would not be included in the proposed amendment, since the Personal Insolvency Act does not provide for a creditor vote for this type of arrangement.  If it is a limited write-down of unsecured debt for persons with very little income or assets which is approved directly by the court, a creditor can object to the court but no creditor vote is required because of the specific and limited nature of the debt solution.  Perhaps the Deputy would take the points I am making in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#A00400","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Collins's amendment.

It concerns the bank veto.  Anecdotally, we hear stories that banks are working reasonably but then within Oireachtas committees we detect, reading between the lines that the banks are making it clear it is one veto after another.  We considered this to be a weakness with the Act.  Given a bank the ability to prevent a deal stacks the dice against the person who is trying to get their life moving again.  For example, looking at the evidence the banks gave to the finance committee, they were quite strong in suggesting they would not be engaging in write-downs and so on.  This is the key problem with the original Bill that we would want to see revisited.  We are using this opportunity today to flag the issue with the Minister and I hope she can revisit the whole issue.  The veto is the one area that is a fundamental flaw in the original Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#B01300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>The effect of the Deputy's amendment is to reduce the proportion of debt required to approve a personal insolvency arrangement, from 65% to just 30%.  That proposal, as the Deputy says, was made on Report Stage of the Bill in 2012 and it was opposed at that point on the basis that it seems unlikely that creditors would accept or agree to be bound by a solution which was only approved by a minority - the Deputy is saying 30% - of value of the overall debt.  There would be a situation where, out of all of those creditors, it would only require 30% of them to agree that the arrangement was acceptable.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the issue the Deputy is trying to deal with and I believe there are other avenues open to us which we will be considering as a result of the review.  The courts might be able to play a further role, for example, and be in a position to make further interventions.  There are obviously different definitions of \"unreasonable\" for different people.  A court might make a call where there had been a particular situation in which a solution was being refused by a creditor.  We are concerned here with striking a delicate balance between the rights of creditors and debtors.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we have to be clear that the banks must and should engage constructively on these issues and help people come to resolutions.  That is a key issue.  Although the solution suggested here is not the right solution and I am not in a position to accept the amendment, I intend to bring forward changes and proposals for the Personal Insolvency Act and will be considering very carefully the range of possible approaches, also in the context of any legal advice.  There will be some constitutional property rights, for example, that would impact on this type of decision.  I would point out that in the UK, the percentage is 75%.   We have 65% here and the Deputy is suggesting going down to 30%.  I understand the problem he is trying to deal with but it is a very dramatic reduction in the percentage where agreement is needed in order for it to be accepted.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to accept the amendment that but there may be other ways of dealing with this issue.<\/p><p>As I said on Second Stage, the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, predicted that 15,000 people would avail of this when the Bill was enacted but the actual figure was, I understand, around 10% of that figure.

I gave the committee a brief paper in advance, to which I will speak.  I will begin with the executive summary.  Citizens are being deprived of a significant benefit they earned and paid for.  This measure is not designed to help older workers to stay in employment.  Employers and unions were given no opportunity to consider the complex labour market issues involved.  In terms of the raising of the pension age - it is not the retirement age but the pension age because they are two different things - we are going further and faster than any other country in Europe.  We will have the highest pension age in Europe at the end of this relatively short process.<\/p> <p>  There has been no public debate on this matter.  No one has explained to the public why we must have the highest public pension age in the EU.  This measure makes nonsense of the advice the Pensions Board gave for years about the importance of long-term planning for one's retirement.  This measure flies in the face of the principles of pension reform.  The troika did not impose this measure.  It was contrived by politicians and public officials who will continue to enjoy good pensions from age 65 and earlier.  We are a long time into this process and we have no faith that the cosseted pension elite who contrived this matter have any intention of mitigating the injustice they have caused.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it.  We were told that this hasty arbitrary diktat was agreed with the troika.  There was no political debate, no public consultation and no cost-benefit analysis of the measure.  No consideration was given to the significant labour market issues involved nor was thought given to issues of fair play, equity or minimising hardship on those worst affected.  Social policy issues, labour market issues, industrial relations issues, pension policy issues, planning issues and social insurance issues are involved.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Fergus Whelan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Nobody should be fooled by the notion that this has anything to do with austerity.  Long before austerity, spurious demographic arguments were being used by the Department of Social Protection and, hopefully to its now shame, the Society of Actuaries in Ireland to tell us that 50 years from now, there would be so many pensioners and so few people at work that we had to do something drastic about PRSI pension entitlements.  They even on occasions dressed these assumptions up as inescapable facts.  There are no inescapable facts about 50 years from now.  Making assumptions about population growth five years ahead is a very good idea if one wants to plan for a school building programme.  In terms of pension policy, doing demographic projections 50 years ahead is complete nonsense.  <\/p><p> In the run up to 2014, workers were given no advance notice when depending on their age, they stood to lose &euro;12,000, &euro;24,000 or &euro;36,000 per year.  The newspapers hardly covered it and the Department of Social Protection did not write to these people to tell them that although they had been paying PRSI for the past 40 years and were expecting a pension at 65, they would not get it.  Between themselves and their employers, the people affected by it paid almost 15% of their salary since the PRSI system was invented to pay for this benefit so this is not a handout.  No politician or civil servant looked into their heart and said it would be nice to give these workers a pension.  This is something these workers paid for and nobody had the right to confiscate these payments because it is confiscation of money earned and paid for by workers paying PRSI.  These workers are now victims of decision makers who are not affected at all.  The people who happily made this decision will suffer no ill effects as a result of it.<\/p><p> Apologists for this measure suggest that as people are living longer, they should work longer.  ICTU holds that people should be free to work longer if they wish but they should not be obliged to do so in order to avoid poverty.  No provision has been made to facilitate workers remaining in employment after age 65.  When the lower grades in Government Departments, who are on the higher levels of PRSI, reach the age of 65, they are out the door, regardless of whether they have any pension entitlement or not.  The Government can hardly expect the private sector employers to keep their people on if it is not prepared to keep its own employees on in this situation.  On a number occasions, we asked the Department of Social Protection what it proposed to do with its lower grade staff on the higher rate of PRSI when they hit 65 if they had no pension entitlements.  Even when it was put in writing, that answer was not forthcoming.  The reason it was not forthcoming was because it knew exactly what it was going to do.  It was going to push them out the door, which is exactly what it did.  This has nothing to do with keeping people in the workforce for longer.  <\/p><p> Employers and unions were given no opportunity to consider the other complex labour market issues involved.  IBEC was concerned about whether the lack of clarity concerning the legality or otherwise of an affiliate sacking workers at age 65 would lead to litigation.  We were concerned that if a person with 40 years service was going out the gate with no pension, he or she might picket it.  In a way, I am sorry some of them did not do this.  It might have brought the matter to a head but as a trade union official whose job it is to fix industrial disputes, I can say it would be a very difficult dispute to fix because this person has been pushed out the door and he or she has nothing to lose by keeping the picket going for the rest of their life.  <\/p><p> Other labour market issues that were ignored were the effects on the morale and productivity of workers either being retained in or forced out of employment against their will.  This is a big issue for both us and employers.  Even if one lets somebody who has been planning to go at 65 stay on to avoid poverty, there are implications for productivity.  There are also implications for productivity and morale among other people who are being held back from promotion because people who were expected to leave at a particular age are being kept on.  If the Government had decided that people were not getting a pension at 65 but their employers had to keep them on, the troika would have regarded it as a labour market rigidity.  I use the term \"if\" because nobody involved in making this decision with whom I spoke had any intention of doing anything to protect a worker who was being driven out of employment with no pension entitlement.  <\/p><p> Another issue that is very dear to my heart, probably because of where my working life began, is the fact that it is all very well for to ask somebody working in this building or organisation, in the various organisations associated with it or in education to work to 68.  Where is the justice in asking a scaffolder to work to 68 if one could find an employer who would be irresponsible enough to let a 68 year old man climb a scaffold on a January or December morning?  There was no discussion of this matter.  If arrangements are made to keep people on - not that anybody has done this - is there a knock-on effect down the line in terms of youth unemployment and positions not being available for younger people coming into the labour market?  <\/p><p> Pension reform and pension planning are long-term issues.  When we go to negotiate a pension scheme, we engage actuaries and the workers pay them big money to find out how much they have to put away and for how long if they want a certain pension.  This must be done over a 40-year period, which is the proper way to plan a pension.  To come along 35 years into that and say, \"by the way, some of the figures are wrong because we changed the rules.  It's OK.  You've paid for three years PRSI pension but we have decided you're not getting it\", makes a nonsense of pension planning.  <\/p><p> The current Administration is saying that it wants to move towards a mandatory pension scheme or a pension scheme that involves everybody.  This decision has done a lot of damage to that prospect.  People have been paying PRSI for years and now they see it confiscated.  What worker will agree to pay into a pension for their entire career if some Administration in the future can just decide \"we didn't really mean it, we wanted you to pay for it alright but we never had any intention of giving it to you\".  Huge damage has been done to confidence in pensions as a result not just of this measure, but of others we will not go into.  Perhaps we will come back another day and talk about them.  To put it simply, if somebody was told five years ago that he or she was going into an occupational pension scheme, they would nearly have celebrated.  If it was said to a young worker today, he or she would nearly cry because very few people have any faith that they will get what they are paying for.  This decision has been a big contributor to that.  <\/p><p> I will not read out the rest of my paper.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Fergus Whelan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In the paper I drew up last year I refer to a person aged 59 years but I will correct that to 60 years of age.  A private sector worker who is 60 years of age this year will not get their pension until he or she is 67 years of age.  I know this because I am that person.  I started to work at 16 years of age in a construction site and I have worked ever since.  I will not get a penny out of my PRSI pension until I am 51 years in the workforce, that is assuming my employer allows me to stay on after 64 years of age, which is the age at which I finish work.  That is a big assumption.  The people who made this decision can get very generous pensions.  Most of the people involved  have very generous pensions at 60 years of age and never paid the rates of PRSI that I paid.  <\/p><p> In my entire life as a trade union official I have tried to avoid the public sector-private sector divide and that is still very important to me but it is very hard when well-pensioned elites can make decision at the flick of a pen which deny people, much poorer than them, an entitlement without a by or leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Whelan.

I hope I do not repeat the questions I asked previously when the witness appeared before one of the committees, I think was the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  This issue comes before us because somebody has appealed to us, as a petitions committee, that the public service and public policy is doing them a disservice.  That is the reason the petition is before us and the reason Mr. Whelan was invited to appear before the committee.<\/p> <p>  I have wholehearted sympathy for the position the witness and the petitioner have taken.  I agree in particular with the point he made around the lack of debate and the lack of foresight for those who are affected in any way.  Normally if an entitlement is to be taken away there is negotiation or compensation.  In this case neither has happened.  What is even worse is that this was one of the Bills that was guillotined where we never reached the debate which had been scheduled so that we could tease out all the implications of a move such as this.  Has any analysis been carried out around the number of jobs that will be affected?  There is a whole range of contracts, including Mr. Whelan's own case, where it is hoped employers will extend the contract or else one will be retired.  One is not pensioned any more because the pension age is 65, 66 or 67 as the case may be and one will be put on the dole, the jobseeker's allowance.  If all those people have to extend their contracts that means there are many young people whose job opportunities have been delayed to them by one, two or three years.  Has a job of work been done to see what will be the effect on the jobs market?<\/p> <p>  The other question is around alternatives.  I agree with Mr. Whelan's scepticism around the actuarial approach being given to this pension time bomb as it is presented.  Have any alternatives been offered, for example, to look again at the PRSI contributions, the reinstatement of the National Pensions Reserve Fund or such like to ensure that the Social Insurance Fund is adequate to address what is a perceived shortfall?  That is not correctly linked to the petitioner.  The petitioner basically said that it is unfair to lose an entitlement which they were led to believe their PRSI contribution was going to bring them at retirement age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#D00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423663200,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>When a person reaches the age of 65 and has no pension and their employer asks him to leave the premises, the correct word for that is dismissal.

The correct word is dismissal.  No analysis was carried out on the effects on the job market.  When IBEC and ourselves were in with the Department of Social Protection we were asking the same questions but we did not agree on everything; basically, we were asking for clarity as to whether people would have to stay on.  The attitude of the officials at that stage was that it was being implemented, if people want to stay on they can take their legal cases and see how they get on.  This was done on the basis that we will just do it and let the fall-out be what it is.  No analysis was done of the likely effect and we still do not know the likely effect.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, it is very hard to get a handle on what is being done.  For instance, one of the aspects is that one is entitled to unemployment benefit for nine months, but is that the case?  It is if one has not been unemployed in the recent years but quite a number of people when planning for retirement would have taken their redundancy package and signed on for unemployment and so on and would have been depending on it but not everybody gets it.  Something bizarre has happened in respect of unemployment benefit and while I welcome some of the change it but it is not a long-term but a short-term fix.  As I understand it, a person who is entitled to unemployment benefit will not just get it for the nine months but will be given it for 12 months.  That is certainly better than nothing and helps in a little way but it does not help for the second and third year.  To some extent, the effect of that was to prevent a bigger backlash against this in the short term.  The alternative is that if the pension age has to go up.  By all means let it go up but let it go up for everybody and much more slowly  than the present rate and let it go up to 68 when it has gone up to 68 for everybody else.  Why should Irish workers be the only workers in Europe who do not get their pension until they are 68 years of age?  By all means push it out but an injustice has been which can be mitigated if it is pushed out a little and only to 67 years of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I call Deputy McEntee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#D00500","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Whelan for appearing before the committee and for his presentation.

I do not have the figure to hand, but it was a rather small figure.  Has ICTU done a cost-benefit analysis on the matter?  Let us compare that with the net cost to the State.  There would be a loss of tax revenue because those people would not be working and we would be paying them unemployment benefit for that period.  On the face of it, only a saving of &euro;500,000 annually to the State is at issue in respect of introducing something that has major implications.  Has ICTU had a chance to examine the net cost and the implications?<\/p><p> Another point mentioned by Mr. Gaynor is the ring-fencing principle in industrial relations.  We have seen it with newly qualified teachers and nurses.  People who were already in the system were ring-fenced and any changes brought in to working conditions were only for new entrants to the system.  Mr. Gaynor has suggested that if something like this were to be introduced, then it is only right and proper from an industrial relations perspective that we should only introduce it for people who start to pay PRSI from when the agreement is made, and anyone who is already in the system should be ring-fenced.  Mr. Whelan is an industrial relations negotiator.  This seems to be a generally accepted principle across unions and employers.  Does this fly in the face of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#D00800","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423663200,"counter":1156,"content":"<p>I will answer the second question first.  It is even bigger than that.  The industrial relations aspect comes from a far more fundamental thing in law, that is, legitimate expectation.  There is a thinking in law whereby if an employee pays for something on the basis that he has been told this is what he will get, then he has a legitimate expectation.  This proposition tears up legitimate expectation in a most unfair way.  If anyone had the wherewithal to bring a Supreme Court challenge or a challenge to the institutions in Europe, I believe this could not but fly in the face of legitimate expectation.<\/p> <p>  The other question was whether we had done a cost-benefit analysis.  We have not.  I believe that initially only a rather small number of people would be affected by it.  However, the fewer the number of people affected by this, the greater the injustice.  If I and five others are the only people to have lost &euro;24,000 as a result, it is a greater injustice than if 50,000 people were affected.  In other words, it is worse if a small number of people have been targeted.  It would have the effect that a small number of people have lost out but no one else would lose out.

This is the Minister's first time taking the Estimates and I wish him the best of luck.  The Department is almost all-encompassing at this stage.  Broadband coverage is the main communications issue.  People right across the country are very exasperated with broadband services and the almost never-never promise or commitment on the provision of broadband.  Approximately 40% of the State has no adequate broadband service.  I understand that the Department is moving closer to the view that the only reasonable or credible way of providing broadband right across the country is through a fibre system.  Has the Department costed the possibility of bringing fibre to every community?  What kind of investment is needed?<\/p> <p>  I refer to an application to the European Union Commission's state aid programme.  Has that application been submitted to the EU Commission?  What is the likely timeframe?  Even though it is nearly 12 months since the next stage of the broadband plan was issued, it has not been submitted to the European Commission.  People who have bought telephone and broadband bundling packages from some of the companies providing telecommunications services such as Eircom, are very frustrated.  They are not receiving an adequate service because the broadband system is not up to speed.  What recourse can be provided by the Department?  The communications regulator has issued very unsatisfactory communications in this regard.  The main issue on the communications side is the broadband spend.  What kind of money is being allocated by the Department for 2015?  What is the Department's best estimate of the funding required for the provision of fibre to every community?  How will it deal with complaints against telecommunications companies who are not honouring their side of the bargain?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#A00800","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1206,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Moynihan for his insights and his questions.

The mapping exercise was critical; in fact, it was required in the context of the state aid application, to which the Deputy referred.  We will have to make a state aid application under the general principle, of which colleagues will be aware.  State aid rules &ndash; EU-wide rules &ndash; prohibit the State from intervening in the provision of services where the private or commercial sector is delivering or intends to deliver a service.  We have not yet made our state aid application, but I expect it to be made sometime mid-year.  We are not yet ready to make the application.  We are doing an enormous amount of work on a daily basis in the Department and with our external advisers in looking at financial, governance, legal and contract issues.  Will there be one or several contracts in terms of the State's intervention?  Who will own the network which will be the equivalent of 100,000 km of road, if one was to think of it as a roads system?  An enormous amount of work needs to be done this year on the state aid application to take us to the stage to which we need to get by the end of the year to go to tender to find a contractor or contractors to build the network.  That is the way we need to do it to do it properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#A00900","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1208,"content":"<p>I take it the preferred choice is fibre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#B00200","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1209,"content":"<p>Under state aid rules, we must maintain neutrality.

I use the line that we are only as strong as the slowest connection and, unfortunately, there are a lot of slow connections around the country.<\/p> <p>  One of the Minister&rsquo;s first engagements was in Cahersiveen to officially launch the fibre broadband service in the town.  It is of enormous help in that part of County Kerry, but like in so many other parts of the country when one travels a couple of miles outside the town, there is literally no reception.  In the Black Valley near Killarney, the last part of the country to receive an electricity supply, people are still writing to me to say their telephone connections are not up to standard.  We have lagged very far behind.  It dates back to the 28th D&aacute;il and the privatisation of the telecommunications infrastructure.  It is a legacy issue.  I am not taking a political shot, but it was a huge mistake, from which we must learn, no matter which policy area we are examining.  It is urgent that we move forward.  I know that we want to get it right, but we have learned that if one tries to rush things, they will not work out.  It is vital that we get it right and have it done as soon as possible.  I get a sense of helplessness from people whose service from their providers is not of a good enough standard in terms of their contact with the regulator.  They do not believe the regulator is responding adequately to their concerns and complaints.  This is something I have heard on many fronts.  There is a substandard service and when people go to the regulator, they do not make much progress or get any joy from it.  This matter must be addressed.  It is one thing not to have a good enough service, but when one cannot progress a complaint, one is really in trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#C00900","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>I can only agree with what the Deputy has said and the examples given.

However, from time to time we meet them and communicate concerns in a general sense.  The regulator has a critically important role to play in that regard.  If there is anything I can usefully do as Minister in the interim, leaving aside the big picture about which we have been talking, I will try to do it, but my main concentration is on fixing the problem once and for all in order that whoever will be sitting in my position or that of any of the Deputies across from me in three years time or at the end of the next Oireachtas in five years time will not be saying we did a half-baked job, that we did not do it properly or that we did not take steps to ensure coverage was provided for everyone in rural areas, in particular.<\/p><p>The launch of Eircode is due to take place in quarter two of 2015.

A percentage of proceeds from the licence fee is made available under the fund for programming that is not directly produced by RTE.  I support the sound and vision fund and we have recently announced a new phase of it.  The question of redistributing revenue from the licence fee away from the public sector to include the private sector is more difficult to justify.

I attended the conference in Lima in November and a speaker there made a stark point, that every economy in the world will have to adjust, whether rich, poor or in between.  Every economy must adjust its economic model to decarbonise its economy.  It is no exaggeration to say that, otherwise, within a generation, we face a catastrophe.  We must do this, but we must do it in a planned and fair way.  The targets we in this country are asked to shoulder should be fair <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other countries.  The Taoiseach and others have been in discussion with our European partners to ensure they are fair, but we must move forward on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#F00600","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1270,"content":"<p>I wish to make a number of points.  The oil market is very volatile currently, but the renewable energy market is also very volatile.  It can be very difficult to predict what will happen next year, let alone in ten or 20 years time.  Is the Minister satisfied his Department and the CER have enough energy economists looking into the crystal ball and predicting what will happen down the line?  I know how difficult that is.<\/p> <p>  Page 29 of the documentation refers to the increased levels of CO2 avoided due to the use of renewable energy.  However, the financial value of that avoidance reduced from &euro;47 million in 2011 to &euro;16 million in 2013.  I do not understand how that can be the case.  It does not make sense.<\/p> <p>  The number of low-income homes implementing energy-efficient measures has reduced from 12,000 in 2014 to 7,475 in 2015.  This is disappointing.  Is there any double counting in those figures?  Was the 12,000 figure for 2014 the actual output or the then planned output?  What is the actual output?<\/p> <p>  My final question concerns an issue I have raised previously, micro energy generating projects and the cost of linking to the grid.  I believe the cost of linking is an impediment to these projects.  I spoke last night to a chap who was talking about setting up what would be a nice industry in Sligo which he wants to be totally self-sufficient in terms of renewable energy generation and use.  I am aware from previous discussions with a person in Monaghan that he not only had a self-sufficient solution to renewable energy but also to waste management but could not proceed with his project because of the cost of linking to the grid.

We have ended up in a situation where too many people feel victims of energy policy rather than participants in it with an opportunity to have an input into the policy and, perhaps, to produce energy-efficient themselves, whether on farms or in local communities.  We will get far more engagement from local communities in the big challenge of energy if we provide for such projects as the Deputy has mentioned.  I have discussed this in the Department and have pressed officials on the issue.

That one-off stimulus of &euro;30 million is gone, and even though we got an additional &euro;10 million, if I am not mistaken, the provision shows a net drop of &euro;20 million on last year's figures.  If the Deputy is asking me whether I think the better energy programmes and all the SEAI project work is important, I can tell him, yes, it is critically important that people's homes, businesses and public building are energy efficient.  As public representatives we need to ensure that we render public and private buildings energy efficient so that the cost of energy will decrease in the future.  We should not, as the adage goes, be putting the coal up the chimney.  We need to ensure we reduce dependence not only on imported fossil fuels but on all energy sources.  We should think about reducing energy consumption.  The energy companies might not necessarily like to hear us say that.

Other countries can produce electricity more cheaply than Ireland, but they have moved away from wind energy, while we are subsidising it.  Has the Minister a roadmap for bringing down the price of electricity to ensure our economy is more competitive, which will help businesses to create more jobs?

It will not be possible to do it for nothing.  The approach we have taken is to do it through refit incentives and support schemes.  The Deputy is correct if he is saying that we should be vigilant and careful to ensure that the policy mix is right and that if we get to a stage at which the supports for one particular energy source are no longer justified, we should switch from that.  Of course that is right.  Let me sound a note of caution: in order to achieve our objectives, there will be a cost.  The question is who will bear it.  Will it be the Exchequer, the consumer or the business?  It may not be a long-term cost and it may taper off at a certain stage when we have reduced our dependence on fossil fuels permanently, but there will continue to be a cost.<\/p> <p>  To address the Deputy's question on comparators for Ireland, let me draw his attention to a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in January 2015, which noted that for 2012 Ireland had an average electricity support, per unit of gross electricity produced, of &euro;2.03 per megawatt, versus an average across the 22 countries assessed of &euro;13.68 per megawatt.  Only two countries, Finland and Norway, had lower supports than Ireland.  It is important to put the issues in context.  People say that other countries are turning away from generating wind energy, but no two countries in Europe are exactly the same.  Some have done more and others have done a lot less in terms of wind energy.  What is required is a mix.  If we move away from one source, we must think of what we are replacing it with.  Each and every source of energy has an issue.  The Deputy mentioned biomass, and if I am interpreting him correctly, he said the sheer quantity of timber required was enormous.  That is an obstacle to the bigger picture for biomass.  Some of the other inputs are easier to advance through Government policy.  We have to be conscious that the Drax power station type model requires enormous inputs of wood, and that is an issue with biomass.  We have already touched on the issues that arise from wind energy.  I would like to see solar energy advancing, but there are obstacles and issues with each and every replacement source of energy. <\/p> <p>   Deputy Fitzmaurice asked two questions about the national grid.  First, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to issue guidelines, but obviously my officials and I have been in contact with the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and his officials, as well as the SEAI, and we are looking at the review of wind energy guidelines in respect of noise, proximity and shadow flicker.  It is proposed to update the relevant sections of the existing guidelines on each of these specific issues.  A number of technical appendices will be developed to assist planning authorities on noise assessment, monitoring and the setting of planning conditions.  Draft guidelines, as the Deputies will be aware, were published in December 2013 for public consultation.  After deep consideration of the various submissions and the modelling that arises from that, the revisions to the guidelines that the Deputy asked me about will be finalised and will be issued to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act.  I believe that will be done in the early part of 2015, although I cannot give the Deputy a precise date.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>I think it would be worthwhile to set aside money to address the greatest waste of solid fuel, the open fireplace in domestic dwellings.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Griffin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2333\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Brendan Griffin\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=TR6&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Brendan Griffin\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Something simple could be done, for example, grant-aiding the replacement of open fireplaces with solid fuel stoves, although not necessarily wood-burning stoves.

Importantly, the consultation process did not just consider the potential environmental health impact but also the human health impact.  Many of the submissions received, including from Deputy Michael Colreavy's part of the world in counties Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan, asked for there to be someone on the group with a health competency.  I am delighted that there is someone on it with that expertise, as the survey's two major pillars will be to consider the environmental and health impacts.<\/p> <p>  Stemming from a number of public meetings that we held in Sligo last summer, I also asked for some feedback during the process, instead of having to wait two years for the results.  I am delighted that there is a dedicated information-sharing website.  We will be able to furnish the Deputy with the details.  I am also hoping for a mid-term review to be carried out in whatever form in a couple of weeks time.<\/p> <p>  Regarding petroleum, a number of initiatives are ongoing.  The Department's expenditure is on promotion because we need to get companies interested.  Thankfully, there is momentum within the industry, given the new Atlantic licensing round that will close in 2015.  We will not be in a position to say how real the momentum is until the close of the round on the Atlantic margins, but the feedback from companies has been steady.  After decades, there have only been four finds, but we must consider the geography of what is available to us.  In a European perspective, Ireland is the fourth largest country if the undersea landmass off the south and south-west coasts is included.  Ireland is larger than Germany, although not as large as Portugal, France and Spain.  The Department is focusing a great deal of its energy on this front, particularly via the Geological Survey of Ireland and the INFOMAR project.  The large amount of research involved is being undertaken at considerable expense.  There is a partnership between the Government and industry, with the main tenets being transparency, openness and accountability, but the undersea landmass available to us has resource potential.<\/p> <p>  Reverting to the contribution of unconventional systems of extraction and exploration on land and without undermining the independence of the EPA-sponsored analysis, we have a great deal of territory under the sea that can be explored.  Obviously, it will depend on companies' exploratory finds.  The Minister has specific responsibility for the Corrib field.  I hope the first gas supply will start towards the end of the second quarter of this year.  In terms of our reliance on fossil fuels, we import 100% of our oil and 95% of our gas.

However, with that in mind, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of my officials because they have responded to my request to show leadership and to take responsibility in terms of leading on this, which has happened.<\/p> <p>  There was an agreement prior to Christmas.  There have been EPA issues and there has been a lot of contact with Inland Waterways and the local authorities.  There has been a whole mix of collaboration to try to get a pilot dredge and there was pressure on to do this before Christmas.  We got agreement in principle before Christmas to do the dredge.  The only thing holding this up at the moment is water levels.  The advice is that to do it right the job should be done at lower water levels and we are following this advice.  The pilot dredge has been agreed, but we are waiting on the water levels to move to a more satisfactory position in the interests of doing the job right rather than making a half-job of it.<\/p> <p>  To reiterate, my officials in Inland Fisheries have been very proactive on this.  It is an example of community engagement.  There is a sense of frustration at a local level.  There are fears at a local level also, which were taken into account.  Can these invasive clams be eradicated fully?  The advice I have been given is that they cannot, but we need to focus on containment and ensure that we dispose of them in a proper way.  We need to ensure that we do not have fishermen using boats and gear that might transfer the clams to other areas.  These are good-practice issues.  We are working with Inland Waterways on these and the use of smaller boats and containment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#J00600","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>My other question relates to the eel fishing ban.

I gave the committee a brief paper in advance, to which I will speak.  I will begin with the executive summary.  Citizens are being deprived of a significant benefit they earned and paid for.  This measure is not designed to help older workers to stay in employment.  Employers and unions were given no opportunity to consider the complex labour market issues involved.  In terms of the raising of the pension age - it is not the retirement age but the pension age because they are two different things - we are going further and faster than any other country in Europe.  We will have the highest pension age in Europe at the end of this relatively short process.<\/p> <p>  There has been no public debate on this matter.  No one has explained to the public why we must have the highest public pension age in the EU.  This measure makes nonsense of the advice the Pensions Board gave for years about the importance of long-term planning for one's retirement.  This measure flies in the face of the principles of pension reform.  The troika did not impose this measure.  It was contrived by politicians and public officials who will continue to enjoy good pensions from age 65 and earlier.  We are a long time into this process and we have no faith that the cosseted pension elite who contrived this matter have any intention of mitigating the injustice they have caused.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it.  We were told that this hasty arbitrary diktat was agreed with the troika.  There was no political debate, no public consultation and no cost-benefit analysis of the measure.  No consideration was given to the significant labour market issues involved nor was thought given to issues of fair play, equity or minimising hardship on those worst affected.  Social policy issues, labour market issues, industrial relations issues, pension policy issues, planning issues and social insurance issues are involved.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Fergus Whelan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Nobody should be fooled by the notion that this has anything to do with austerity.  Long before austerity, spurious demographic arguments were being used by the Department of Social Protection and, hopefully to its now shame, the Society of Actuaries in Ireland to tell us that 50 years from now, there would be so many pensioners and so few people at work that we had to do something drastic about PRSI pension entitlements.  They even on occasions dressed these assumptions up as inescapable facts.  There are no inescapable facts about 50 years from now.  Making assumptions about population growth five years ahead is a very good idea if one wants to plan for a school building programme.  In terms of pension policy, doing demographic projections 50 years ahead is complete nonsense.  <\/p><p> In the run up to 2014, workers were given no advance notice when depending on their age, they stood to lose &euro;12,000, &euro;24,000 or &euro;36,000 per year.  The newspapers hardly covered it and the Department of Social Protection did not write to these people to tell them that although they had been paying PRSI for the past 40 years and were expecting a pension at 65, they would not get it.  Between themselves and their employers, the people affected by it paid almost 15% of their salary since the PRSI system was invented to pay for this benefit so this is not a handout.  No politician or civil servant looked into their heart and said it would be nice to give these workers a pension.  This is something these workers paid for and nobody had the right to confiscate these payments because it is confiscation of money earned and paid for by workers paying PRSI.  These workers are now victims of decision makers who are not affected at all.  The people who happily made this decision will suffer no ill effects as a result of it.<\/p><p> Apologists for this measure suggest that as people are living longer, they should work longer.  ICTU holds that people should be free to work longer if they wish but they should not be obliged to do so in order to avoid poverty.  No provision has been made to facilitate workers remaining in employment after age 65.  When the lower grades in Government Departments, who are on the higher levels of PRSI, reach the age of 65, they are out the door, regardless of whether they have any pension entitlement or not.  The Government can hardly expect the private sector employers to keep their people on if it is not prepared to keep its own employees on in this situation.  On a number occasions, we asked the Department of Social Protection what it proposed to do with its lower grade staff on the higher rate of PRSI when they hit 65 if they had no pension entitlements.  Even when it was put in writing, that answer was not forthcoming.  The reason it was not forthcoming was because it knew exactly what it was going to do.  It was going to push them out the door, which is exactly what it did.  This has nothing to do with keeping people in the workforce for longer.  <\/p><p> Employers and unions were given no opportunity to consider the other complex labour market issues involved.  IBEC was concerned about whether the lack of clarity concerning the legality or otherwise of an affiliate sacking workers at age 65 would lead to litigation.  We were concerned that if a person with 40 years service was going out the gate with no pension, he or she might picket it.  In a way, I am sorry some of them did not do this.  It might have brought the matter to a head but as a trade union official whose job it is to fix industrial disputes, I can say it would be a very difficult dispute to fix because this person has been pushed out the door and he or she has nothing to lose by keeping the picket going for the rest of their life.  <\/p><p> Other labour market issues that were ignored were the effects on the morale and productivity of workers either being retained in or forced out of employment against their will.  This is a big issue for both us and employers.  Even if one lets somebody who has been planning to go at 65 stay on to avoid poverty, there are implications for productivity.  There are also implications for productivity and morale among other people who are being held back from promotion because people who were expected to leave at a particular age are being kept on.  If the Government had decided that people were not getting a pension at 65 but their employers had to keep them on, the troika would have regarded it as a labour market rigidity.  I use the term \"if\" because nobody involved in making this decision with whom I spoke had any intention of doing anything to protect a worker who was being driven out of employment with no pension entitlement.  <\/p><p> Another issue that is very dear to my heart, probably because of where my working life began, is the fact that it is all very well for to ask somebody working in this building or organisation, in the various organisations associated with it or in education to work to 68.  Where is the justice in asking a scaffolder to work to 68 if one could find an employer who would be irresponsible enough to let a 68 year old man climb a scaffold on a January or December morning?  There was no discussion of this matter.  If arrangements are made to keep people on - not that anybody has done this - is there a knock-on effect down the line in terms of youth unemployment and positions not being available for younger people coming into the labour market?  <\/p><p> Pension reform and pension planning are long-term issues.  When we go to negotiate a pension scheme, we engage actuaries and the workers pay them big money to find out how much they have to put away and for how long if they want a certain pension.  This must be done over a 40-year period, which is the proper way to plan a pension.  To come along 35 years into that and say, \"by the way, some of the figures are wrong because we changed the rules.  It's OK.  You've paid for three years PRSI pension but we have decided you're not getting it\", makes a nonsense of pension planning.  <\/p><p> The current Administration is saying that it wants to move towards a mandatory pension scheme or a pension scheme that involves everybody.  This decision has done a lot of damage to that prospect.  People have been paying PRSI for years and now they see it confiscated.  What worker will agree to pay into a pension for their entire career if some Administration in the future can just decide \"we didn't really mean it, we wanted you to pay for it alright but we never had any intention of giving it to you\".  Huge damage has been done to confidence in pensions as a result not just of this measure, but of others we will not go into.  Perhaps we will come back another day and talk about them.  To put it simply, if somebody was told five years ago that he or she was going into an occupational pension scheme, they would nearly have celebrated.  If it was said to a young worker today, he or she would nearly cry because very few people have any faith that they will get what they are paying for.  This decision has been a big contributor to that.  <\/p><p> I will not read out the rest of my paper.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Fergus Whelan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In the paper I drew up last year I refer to a person aged 59 years but I will correct that to 60 years of age.  A private sector worker who is 60 years of age this year will not get their pension until he or she is 67 years of age.  I know this because I am that person.  I started to work at 16 years of age in a construction site and I have worked ever since.  I will not get a penny out of my PRSI pension until I am 51 years in the workforce, that is assuming my employer allows me to stay on after 64 years of age, which is the age at which I finish work.  That is a big assumption.  The people who made this decision can get very generous pensions.  Most of the people involved  have very generous pensions at 60 years of age and never paid the rates of PRSI that I paid.  <\/p><p> In my entire life as a trade union official I have tried to avoid the public sector-private sector divide and that is still very important to me but it is very hard when well-pensioned elites can make decision at the flick of a pen which deny people, much poorer than them, an entitlement without a by or leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1329,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Whelan.

What is even worse is that this was one of the Bills that was guillotined where we never reached the debate which had been scheduled so that we could tease out all the implications of a move such as this.  Has any analysis been carried out around the number of jobs that will be affected?  There is a whole range of contracts, including Mr. Whelan's own case, where it is hoped employers will extend the contract or else one will be retired.  One is not pensioned any more because the pension age is 65, 66 or 67 as the case may be and one will be put on the dole, the jobseeker's allowance.  If all those people have to extend their contracts that means there are many young people whose job opportunities have been delayed to them by one, two or three years.  Has a job of work been done to see what will be the effect on the jobs market?<\/p> <p>  The other question is around alternatives.  I agree with Mr. Whelan's scepticism around the actuarial approach being given to this pension time bomb as it is presented.  Have any alternatives been offered, for example, to look again at the PRSI contributions, the reinstatement of the National Pensions Reserve Fund or such like to ensure that the Social Insurance Fund is adequate to address what is a perceived shortfall?  That is not correctly linked to the petitioner.  The petitioner basically said that it is unfair to lose an entitlement which they were led to believe their PRSI contribution was going to bring them at retirement age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#D00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423670400,"counter":1331,"content":"<p>When a person reaches the age of 65 and has no pension and their employer asks him to leave the premises, the correct word for that is dismissal.  What happens when a person reaches the age of 65 is that he or she has to go out the door.  Retirement is a nice thing, it sounds as if one is going to get a watch and pension.  The correct word is dismissal.  No analysis was carried out on the effects on the job market.  When IBEC and ourselves were in with the Department of Social Protection we were asking the same questions but we did not agree on everything; basically, we were asking for clarity as to whether people would have to stay on.  The attitude of the officials at that stage was that it was being implemented, if people want to stay on they can take their legal cases and see how they get on.  This was done on the basis that we will just do it and let the fall-out be what it is.  No analysis was done of the likely effect and we still do not know the likely effect.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, it is very hard to get a handle on what is being done.  For instance, one of the aspects is that one is entitled to unemployment benefit for nine months, but is that the case?  It is if one has not been unemployed in the recent years but quite a number of people when planning for retirement would have taken their redundancy package and signed on for unemployment and so on and would have been depending on it but not everybody gets it.  Something bizarre has happened in respect of unemployment benefit and while I welcome some of the change it but it is not a long-term but a short-term fix.  As I understand it, a person who is entitled to unemployment benefit will not just get it for the nine months but will be given it for 12 months.  That is certainly better than nothing and helps in a little way but it does not help for the second and third year.  To some extent, the effect of that was to prevent a bigger backlash against this in the short term.  The alternative is that if the pension age has to go up.  By all means let it go up but let it go up for everybody and much more slowly  than the present rate and let it go up to 68 when it has gone up to 68 for everybody else.  Why should Irish workers be the only workers in Europe who do not get their pension until they are 68 years of age?  By all means push it out but an injustice has been which can be mitigated if it is pushed out a little and only to 67 years of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1332,"content":"<p>I call Deputy McEntee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#D00500","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1333,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Whelan for appearing before the committee and for his presentation.

I do not have the figure to hand, but it was a rather small figure.  Has ICTU done a cost-benefit analysis on the matter?  Let us compare that with the net cost to the State.  There would be a loss of tax revenue because those people would not be working and we would be paying them unemployment benefit for that period.  On the face of it, only a saving of &euro;500,000 annually to the State is at issue in respect of introducing something that has major implications.  Has ICTU had a chance to examine the net cost and the implications?<\/p><p> Another point mentioned by Mr. Gaynor is the ring-fencing principle in industrial relations.  We have seen it with newly qualified teachers and nurses.  People who were already in the system were ring-fenced and any changes brought in to working conditions were only for new entrants to the system.  Mr. Gaynor has suggested that if something like this were to be introduced, then it is only right and proper from an industrial relations perspective that we should only introduce it for people who start to pay PRSI from when the agreement is made, and anyone who is already in the system should be ring-fenced.  Mr. Whelan is an industrial relations negotiator.  This seems to be a generally accepted principle across unions and employers.  Does this fly in the face of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#D00800","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423670400,"counter":1338,"content":"<p>I will answer the second question first.  It is even bigger than that.  The industrial relations aspect comes from a far more fundamental thing in law, that is, legitimate expectation.  There is a thinking in law whereby if an employee pays for something on the basis that he has been told this is what he will get, then he has a legitimate expectation.  This proposition tears up legitimate expectation in a most unfair way.  If anyone had the wherewithal to bring a Supreme Court challenge or a challenge to the institutions in Europe, I believe this could not but fly in the face of legitimate expectation.<\/p> <p>  The other question was whether we had done a cost-benefit analysis.  We have not.  I believe that initially only a rather small number of people would be affected by it.  However, the fewer the number of people affected by this, the greater the injustice.  If I and five others are the only people to have lost &euro;24,000 as a result, it is a greater injustice than if 50,000 people were affected.  In other words, it is worse if a small number of people have been targeted.  It would have the effect that a small number of people have lost out but no one else would lose out.

This is the Minister's first time taking the Estimates and I wish him the best of luck.  The Department is almost all-encompassing at this stage.  Broadband coverage is the main communications issue.  People right across the country are very exasperated with broadband services and the almost never-never promise or commitment on the provision of broadband.  Approximately 40% of the State has no adequate broadband service.  I understand that the Department is moving closer to the view that the only reasonable or credible way of providing broadband right across the country is through a fibre system.  Has the Department costed the possibility of bringing fibre to every community?  What kind of investment is needed?<\/p> <p>  I refer to an application to the European Union Commission's state aid programme.  Has that application been submitted to the EU Commission?  What is the likely timeframe?  Even though it is nearly 12 months since the next stage of the broadband plan was issued, it has not been submitted to the European Commission.  People who have bought telephone and broadband bundling packages from some of the companies providing telecommunications services such as Eircom, are very frustrated.  They are not receiving an adequate service because the broadband system is not up to speed.  What recourse can be provided by the Department?  The communications regulator has issued very unsatisfactory communications in this regard.  The main issue on the communications side is the broadband spend.  What kind of money is being allocated by the Department for 2015?  What is the Department's best estimate of the funding required for the provision of fibre to every community?  How will it deal with complaints against telecommunications companies who are not honouring their side of the bargain?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#A00800","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1388,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Moynihan for his insights and his questions.  To reference the Estimates I remind colleagues that the 2014 allocation had allowed for an end of contract provision of &euro;9.058 million for the NBS service-provider and an allocation of &euro;6.2 million for schools broadband, as well as additional moneys for the separate issue of postcodes.<\/p> <p>  To deal with the national broadband plan provisions for 2015, the provision has increased from &euro;1.3 million in 2014 to &euro;4.1 million for 2015.

The mapping exercise was critical; in fact, it was required in the context of the state aid application, to which the Deputy referred.  We will have to make a state aid application under the general principle, of which colleagues will be aware.  State aid rules &ndash; EU-wide rules &ndash; prohibit the State from intervening in the provision of services where the private or commercial sector is delivering or intends to deliver a service.  We have not yet made our state aid application, but I expect it to be made sometime mid-year.  We are not yet ready to make the application.  We are doing an enormous amount of work on a daily basis in the Department and with our external advisers in looking at financial, governance, legal and contract issues.  Will there be one or several contracts in terms of the State's intervention?  Who will own the network which will be the equivalent of 100,000 km of road, if one was to think of it as a roads system?  An enormous amount of work needs to be done this year on the state aid application to take us to the stage to which we need to get by the end of the year to go to tender to find a contractor or contractors to build the network.  That is the way we need to do it to do it properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#A00900","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1390,"content":"<p>I take it the preferred choice is fibre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#B00200","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1391,"content":"<p>Under state aid rules, we must maintain neutrality.

That is not the position we are in, but the mapping exercise shows what the commercial sector will do between now and the end of 2016.  I know that is not a full answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, but he can say to a constituent or anyone else in the country who is wondering how he or she will fare and how he or she is fixed in terms of broadband that if he or she is to be supplied by the private sector, it will happen before the end of 2016, at a minimum 30 Mbps.  That is important also because many people have access to broadband but not at adequate speeds.  In fact, practically everybody has access to some broadband service, but it is not adequate.  The private sector is to deliver a minimum figure of 30 Mbps by the end of 2016.  The map is prospective to the end of 2016.  If one is in the blue area, the private sector will deliver a service; it is up to the State to deliver the rest.<\/p> <p>  To return to Deputy Michael Moynihan&rsquo;s point, it is about the State doing it properly once and for all.  The Deputy gave me examples of school, educational, social and cultural use, to say nothing about the business opportunities in rural areas to create and maintain businesses.  Tourism is an obvious sector.  There are many other people in new innovative areas of business who depend on broadband, not just to download from the system but also to upload.  We understand what the need is, but we want to do it properly.  The private sector has given an undertaking to deliver between now and the end of 2016.  Individual operational problems are a matter for the private operators to deal with, subject to the regulator in certain instances where undertakings have been given or contractual arrangements are not being followed.  It is up to the private sector to do what it is supposed to do for its customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#C00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1413,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#C00800","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1414,"content":"<p>I am sorry that I missed the start of the meeting.  I echo the concerns being expressed in predominantly rural constituencies.  The difficulties faced by businesses and householders alike are enormous because of the lack of proper broadband provision.  I use the line that we are only as strong as the slowest connection and, unfortunately, there are a lot of slow connections around the country.<\/p> <p>  One of the Minister&rsquo;s first engagements was in Cahersiveen to officially launch the fibre broadband service in the town.  It is of enormous help in that part of County Kerry, but like in so many other parts of the country when one travels a couple of miles outside the town, there is literally no reception.  In the Black Valley near Killarney, the last part of the country to receive an electricity supply, people are still writing to me to say their telephone connections are not up to standard.  We have lagged very far behind.  It dates back to the 28th D&aacute;il and the privatisation of the telecommunications infrastructure.  It is a legacy issue.  I am not taking a political shot, but it was a huge mistake, from which we must learn, no matter which policy area we are examining.  It is urgent that we move forward.  I know that we want to get it right, but we have learned that if one tries to rush things, they will not work out.  It is vital that we get it right and have it done as soon as possible.  I get a sense of helplessness from people whose service from their providers is not of a good enough standard in terms of their contact with the regulator.  They do not believe the regulator is responding adequately to their concerns and complaints.  This is something I have heard on many fronts.  There is a substandard service and when people go to the regulator, they do not make much progress or get any joy from it.  This matter must be addressed.  It is one thing not to have a good enough service, but when one cannot progress a complaint, one is really in trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#C00900","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>I can only agree with what the Deputy has said and the examples given.

However, from time to time we meet them and communicate concerns in a general sense.  The regulator has a critically important role to play in that regard.  If there is anything I can usefully do as Minister in the interim, leaving aside the big picture about which we have been talking, I will try to do it, but my main concentration is on fixing the problem once and for all in order that whoever will be sitting in my position or that of any of the Deputies across from me in three years time or at the end of the next Oireachtas in five years time will not be saying we did a half-baked job, that we did not do it properly or that we did not take steps to ensure coverage was provided for everyone in rural areas, in particular.<\/p><p>The launch of Eircode is due to take place in quarter two of 2015.

In 1988 or 1989, the Deputy's colleagues introduced a new legislative basis for independent broadcasting which gave rise to a degree of controversy at the time but which has since bedded down quite well.

The decision to establish a sound and vision fund was one change in that regard.  A percentage of proceeds from the licence fee is made available under the fund for programming that is not directly produced by RTE.  I support the sound and vision fund and we have recently announced a new phase of it.  The question of redistributing revenue from the licence fee away from the public sector to include the private sector is more difficult to justify.

We are doing that and the reason we brought forward the bioenergy plan was to ensure that we do not just discuss developing wind but also discuss other sources and elements.

I know how difficult that is.<\/p> <p>  Page 29 of the documentation refers to the increased levels of CO2 avoided due to the use of renewable energy.

We have ended up in a situation where too many people feel victims of energy policy rather than participants in it with an opportunity to have an input into the policy and, perhaps, to produce energy-efficient themselves, whether on farms or in local communities.  We will get far more engagement from local communities in the big challenge of energy if we provide for such projects as the Deputy has mentioned.  I have discussed this in the Department and have pressed officials on the issue.

If the Deputy is asking me whether I think the better energy programmes and all the SEAI project work is important, I can tell him, yes, it is critically important that people's homes, businesses and public building are energy efficient.  As public representatives we need to ensure that we render public and private buildings energy efficient so that the cost of energy will decrease in the future.  We should not, as the adage goes, be putting the coal up the chimney.  We need to ensure we reduce dependence not only on imported fossil fuels but on all energy sources.

It will not be possible to do it for nothing.  The approach we have taken is to do it through refit incentives and support schemes.  The Deputy is correct if he is saying that we should be vigilant and careful to ensure that the policy mix is right and that if we get to a stage at which the supports for one particular energy source are no longer justified, we should switch from that.  Of course that is right.  Let me sound a note of caution: in order to achieve our objectives, there will be a cost.  The question is who will bear it.  Will it be the Exchequer, the consumer or the business?  It may not be a long-term cost and it may taper off at a certain stage when we have reduced our dependence on fossil fuels permanently, but there will continue to be a cost.<\/p> <p>  To address the Deputy's question on comparators for Ireland, let me draw his attention to a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in January 2015, which noted that for 2012 Ireland had an average electricity support, per unit of gross electricity produced, of &euro;2.03 per megawatt, versus an average across the 22 countries assessed of &euro;13.68 per megawatt.  Only two countries, Finland and Norway, had lower supports than Ireland.  It is important to put the issues in context.  People say that other countries are turning away from generating wind energy, but no two countries in Europe are exactly the same.  Some have done more and others have done a lot less in terms of wind energy.  What is required is a mix.  If we move away from one source, we must think of what we are replacing it with.  Each and every source of energy has an issue.  The Deputy mentioned biomass, and if I am interpreting him correctly, he said the sheer quantity of timber required was enormous.  That is an obstacle to the bigger picture for biomass.  Some of the other inputs are easier to advance through Government policy.  We have to be conscious that the Drax power station type model requires enormous inputs of wood, and that is an issue with biomass.  We have already touched on the issues that arise from wind energy.  I would like to see solar energy advancing, but there are obstacles and issues with each and every replacement source of energy. <\/p> <p>   Deputy Fitzmaurice asked two questions about the national grid.  First, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to issue guidelines, but obviously my officials and I have been in contact with the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and his officials, as well as the SEAI, and we are looking at the review of wind energy guidelines in respect of noise, proximity and shadow flicker.  It is proposed to update the relevant sections of the existing guidelines on each of these specific issues.  A number of technical appendices will be developed to assist planning authorities on noise assessment, monitoring and the setting of planning conditions.  Draft guidelines, as the Deputies will be aware, were published in December 2013 for public consultation.  After deep consideration of the various submissions and the modelling that arises from that, the revisions to the guidelines that the Deputy asked me about will be finalised and will be issued to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act.  I believe that will be done in the early part of 2015, although I cannot give the Deputy a precise date.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>I think it would be worthwhile to set aside money to address the greatest waste of solid fuel, the open fireplace in domestic dwellings.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Griffin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2333\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Brendan Griffin\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=TR6&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Brendan Griffin\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Something simple could be done, for example, grant-aiding the replacement of open fireplaces with solid fuel stoves, although not necessarily wood-burning stoves.

Importantly, the consultation process did not just consider the potential environmental health impact but also the human health impact.  Many of the submissions received, including from Deputy Michael Colreavy's part of the world in counties Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan, asked for there to be someone on the group with a health competency.  I am delighted that there is someone on it with that expertise, as the survey's two major pillars will be to consider the environmental and health impacts.<\/p> <p>  Stemming from a number of public meetings that we held in Sligo last summer, I also asked for some feedback during the process, instead of having to wait two years for the results.

I am also hoping for a mid-term review to be carried out in whatever form in a couple of weeks time.<\/p> <p>  Regarding petroleum, a number of initiatives are ongoing.  The Department's expenditure is on promotion because we need to get companies interested.  Thankfully, there is momentum within the industry, given the new Atlantic licensing round that will close in 2015.  We will not be in a position to say how real the momentum is until the close of the round on the Atlantic margins, but the feedback from companies has been steady.  After decades, there have only been four finds, but we must consider the geography of what is available to us.  In a European perspective, Ireland is the fourth largest country if the undersea landmass off the south and south-west coasts is included.  Ireland is larger than Germany, although not as large as Portugal, France and Spain.  The Department is focusing a great deal of its energy on this front, particularly via the Geological Survey of Ireland and the INFOMAR project.  The large amount of research involved is being undertaken at considerable expense.  There is a partnership between the Government and industry, with the main tenets being transparency, openness and accountability, but the undersea landmass available to us has resource potential.<\/p> <p>  Reverting to the contribution of unconventional systems of extraction and exploration on land and without undermining the independence of the EPA-sponsored analysis, we have a great deal of territory under the sea that can be explored.  Obviously, it will depend on companies' exploratory finds.  The Minister has specific responsibility for the Corrib field.  I hope the first gas supply will start towards the end of the second quarter of this year.  In terms of our reliance on fossil fuels, we import 100% of our oil and 95% of our gas.

At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the role of the officials within my Department.  They have been extremely proactive and this has been in response to the genuine proactivity at a local level.  Local councillors, Deputies and the local community's swift response on the clams issue in Lanesborough has been positive and has helped the process.  Do my section and Department have statutory functions with regard to moving forward the whole issue of the invasive species?  No, they do not.  However, with that in mind, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of my officials because they have responded to my request to show leadership and to take responsibility in terms of leading on this, which has happened.<\/p> <p>  There was an agreement prior to Christmas.  There have been EPA issues and there has been a lot of contact with Inland Waterways and the local authorities.  There has been a whole mix of collaboration to try to get a pilot dredge and there was pressure on to do this before Christmas.  We got agreement in principle before Christmas to do the dredge.  The only thing holding this up at the moment is water levels.  The advice is that to do it right the job should be done at lower water levels and we are following this advice.  The pilot dredge has been agreed, but we are waiting on the water levels to move to a more satisfactory position in the interests of doing the job right rather than making a half-job of it.<\/p> <p>  To reiterate, my officials in Inland Fisheries have been very proactive on this.  It is an example of community engagement.  There is a sense of frustration at a local level.  There are fears at a local level also, which were taken into account.  Can these invasive clams be eradicated fully?  The advice I have been given is that they cannot, but we need to focus on containment and ensure that we dispose of them in a proper way.  We need to ensure that we do not have fishermen using boats and gear that might transfer the clams to other areas.  These are good-practice issues.  We are working with Inland Waterways on these and the use of smaller boats and containment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021100002#J00600","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1423670400,"counter":1484,"content":"<p>My other question relates to the eel fishing ban.

People who have bought telephone and broadband bundling packages from some of the companies providing telecommunications services such as Eircom, are very frustrated.  They are not receiving an adequate service because the broadband system is not up to speed.  What recourse can be provided by the Department?  The communications regulator has issued very unsatisfactory communications in this regard.  The main issue on the communications side is the broadband spend.  What kind of money is being allocated by the Department for 2015?  What is the Department's best estimate of the funding required for the provision of fibre to every community?

I am certainly very conscious of this and the thinking generally on what is best technically to deliver high speed quality broadband across the country.

I expect, once the successful contractor or contractors are in place, the roll-out of the plan to start in 2016.  That is the timetable.<\/p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s points about existing problems with the timetables of commercial operators, unfortunately, I cannot direct them.  That is not the position we are in, but the mapping exercise shows what the commercial sector will do between now and the end of 2016.  I know that is not a full answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, but he can say to a constituent or anyone else in the country who is wondering how he or she will fare and how he or she is fixed in terms of broadband that if he or she is to be supplied by the private sector, it will happen before the end of 2016, at a minimum 30 Mbps.  That is important also because many people have access to broadband but not at adequate speeds.  In fact, practically everybody has access to some broadband service, but it is not adequate.  The private sector is to deliver a minimum figure of 30 Mbps by the end of 2016.  The map is prospective to the end of 2016.  If one is in the blue area, the private sector will deliver a service; it is up to the State to deliver the rest.<\/p> <p>  To return to Deputy Michael Moynihan&rsquo;s point, it is about the State doing it properly once and for all.  The Deputy gave me examples of school, educational, social and cultural use, to say nothing about the business opportunities in rural areas to create and maintain businesses.  Tourism is an obvious sector.  There are many other people in new innovative areas of business who depend on broadband, not just to download from the system but also to upload.  We understand what the need is, but we want to do it properly.  The private sector has given an undertaking to deliver between now and the end of 2016.  Individual operational problems are a matter for the private operators to deal with, subject to the regulator in certain instances where undertakings have been given or contractual arrangements are not being followed.  It is up to the private sector to do what it is supposed to do for its customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015021100002#C00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654200,"counter":1538,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015021100002#C00800","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654200,"counter":1539,"content":"<p>I am sorry that I missed the start of the meeting.

It is of enormous help in that part of County Kerry, but like in so many other parts of the country when one travels a couple of miles outside the town, there is literally no reception.  In the Black Valley near Killarney, the last part of the country to receive an electricity supply, people are still writing to me to say their telephone connections are not up to standard.  We have lagged very far behind.  It dates back to the 28th D&aacute;il and the privatisation of the telecommunications infrastructure.  It is a legacy issue.  I am not taking a political shot, but it was a huge mistake, from which we must learn, no matter which policy area we are examining.  It is urgent that we move forward.  I know that we want to get it right, but we have learned that if one tries to rush things, they will not work out.  It is vital that we get it right and have it done as soon as possible.  I get a sense of helplessness from people whose service from their providers is not of a good enough standard in terms of their contact with the regulator.  They do not believe the regulator is responding adequately to their concerns and complaints.  This is something I have heard on many fronts.  There is a substandard service and when people go to the regulator, they do not make much progress or get any joy from it.  This matter must be addressed.

We now have a lively public sector alongside an equally lively private sector in broadcasting.  We need to maintain both sectors.<\/p> <p>  RTE has had a dual funding model since the early 1960s.  The decision to establish a sound and vision fund was one change in that regard.  A percentage of proceeds from the licence fee is made available under the fund for programming that is not directly produced by RTE.  I support the sound and vision fund and we have recently announced a new phase of it.  The question of redistributing revenue from the licence fee away from the public sector to include the private sector is more difficult to justify.  If we are to have a robust public broadcasting sector, it needs stable funding.  However, I am open to discussing the issue with the IBI.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Alex White:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2219\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Alex White\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=TR6&amp;amp;memberid=2219&amp;amp;pid=AlexWhite&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Alex White\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am uncomfortable with the idea of the zero sum, that we have to take from one to give to the other.

However, because we are in a relatively small country of 4.5 million people, it will never be realistic for RTE to be like the BBC, solely funded from the licence fee.

Of course that is right.  Let me sound a note of caution: in order to achieve our objectives, there will be a cost.  The question is who will bear it.  Will it be the Exchequer, the consumer or the business?  It may not be a long-term cost and it may taper off at a certain stage when we have reduced our dependence on fossil fuels permanently, but there will continue to be a cost.<\/p> <p>  To address the Deputy's question on comparators for Ireland, let me draw his attention to a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in January 2015, which noted that for 2012 Ireland had an average electricity support, per unit of gross electricity produced, of &euro;2.03 per megawatt, versus an average across the 22 countries assessed of &euro;13.68 per megawatt.  Only two countries, Finland and Norway, had lower supports than Ireland.  It is important to put the issues in context.  People say that other countries are turning away from generating wind energy, but no two countries in Europe are exactly the same.  Some have done more and others have done a lot less in terms of wind energy.  What is required is a mix.  If we move away from one source, we must think of what we are replacing it with.  Each and every source of energy has an issue.  The Deputy mentioned biomass, and if I am interpreting him correctly, he said the sheer quantity of timber required was enormous.  That is an obstacle to the bigger picture for biomass.  Some of the other inputs are easier to advance through Government policy.  We have to be conscious that the Drax power station type model requires enormous inputs of wood, and that is an issue with biomass.  We have already touched on the issues that arise from wind energy.  I would like to see solar energy advancing, but there are obstacles and issues with each and every replacement source of energy. <\/p> <p>   Deputy Fitzmaurice asked two questions about the national grid.  First, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to issue guidelines, but obviously my officials and I have been in contact with the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and his officials, as well as the SEAI, and we are looking at the review of wind energy guidelines in respect of noise, proximity and shadow flicker.  It is proposed to update the relevant sections of the existing guidelines on each of these specific issues.  A number of technical appendices will be developed to assist planning authorities on noise assessment, monitoring and the setting of planning conditions.  Draft guidelines, as the Deputies will be aware, were published in December 2013 for public consultation.  After deep consideration of the various submissions and the modelling that arises from that, the revisions to the guidelines that the Deputy asked me about will be finalised and will be issued to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act.  I believe that will be done in the early part of 2015, although I cannot give the Deputy a precise date.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>I think it would be worthwhile to set aside money to address the greatest waste of solid fuel, the open fireplace in domestic dwellings.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Griffin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2333\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Brendan Griffin\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=TR6&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Brendan Griffin\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Something simple could be done, for example, grant-aiding the replacement of open fireplaces with solid fuel stoves, although not necessarily wood-burning stoves.

It is in the process of being carried out and due for publication, possibly in mid-2016.  On the question of how much it will cost, we have in mind a figure in the order of &euro;1 million.  Importantly, the consultation process did not just consider the potential environmental health impact but also the human health impact.  Many of the submissions received, including from Deputy Michael Colreavy's part of the world in counties Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan, asked for there to be someone on the group with a health competency.  I am delighted that there is someone on it with that expertise, as the survey's two major pillars will be to consider the environmental and health impacts.<\/p> <p>  Stemming from a number of public meetings that we held in Sligo last summer, I also asked for some feedback during the process, instead of having to wait two years for the results.  I am delighted that there is a dedicated information-sharing website.  We will be able to furnish the Deputy with the details.  I am also hoping for a mid-term review to be carried out in whatever form in a couple of weeks time.<\/p> <p>  Regarding petroleum, a number of initiatives are ongoing.  The Department's expenditure is on promotion because we need to get companies interested.  Thankfully, there is momentum within the industry, given the new Atlantic licensing round that will close in 2015.  We will not be in a position to say how real the momentum is until the close of the round on the Atlantic margins, but the feedback from companies has been steady.  After decades, there have only been four finds, but we must consider the geography of what is available to us.  In a European perspective, Ireland is the fourth largest country if the undersea landmass off the south and south-west coasts is included.  Ireland is larger than Germany, although not as large as Portugal, France and Spain.  The Department is focusing a great deal of its energy on this front, particularly via the Geological Survey of Ireland and the INFOMAR project.  The large amount of research involved is being undertaken at considerable expense.  There is a partnership between the Government and industry, with the main tenets being transparency, openness and accountability, but the undersea landmass available to us has resource potential.<\/p> <p>  Reverting to the contribution of unconventional systems of extraction and exploration on land and without undermining the independence of the EPA-sponsored analysis, we have a great deal of territory under the sea that can be explored.  Obviously, it will depend on companies' exploratory finds.  The Minister has specific responsibility for the Corrib field.  I hope the first gas supply will start towards the end of the second quarter of this year.  In terms of our reliance on fossil fuels, we import 100% of our oil and 95% of our gas.  With the new Corrib gas supply coming on stream in mid-2015, we could meet as much as 42% of our own gas needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015021100002#H00800","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654200,"counter":1599,"content":"<p>I was not going to mention hydraulic fracturing-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015021100002#H00900","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654200,"counter":1600,"content":"<p>But seeing as how I brought it up-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015021100002#H01000","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654200,"counter":1601,"content":"<p>Yes.

The Deputy is correct to raise it.  I am very keen on ensuring it happens, and we have clearance to do it.  For example, there is a need for petroleum exploration specialists and for senior telecommunications analysts and engineers in respect of the broadband roll-out we discussed.  We need a head of cyber security to lead in the protection of critical national infrastructure, and energy market analysts, a subject we also discussed earlier, to focus on both market and technology developments nationally and internationally.  To answer the Deputy's question, the first element relates to the recruitment of specialist staff.  The second element is that the increased allocation also includes moneys that must be made available owing to the fact that there are 27 fortnightly pay days in 2015, as opposed to the usual 26.  It is a quirk of the Roman calendar that we have 27 pay days in 2015.  Nobody gets any extra pay, unfortunately, but they get paid on an extra occasion this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015021100002#K00900","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654200,"counter":1625,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy White, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and the officials for assisting the committee in its consideration of the Revised Estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015021100002#K01000","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1423654200,"counter":1626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015021100002#K01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1423654200,"counter":1627,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 87, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<blockquote>The Select Sub-committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for public services for the year ending 31 December 2015: Vote 29 &mdash; Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62015021100002#K01200","speaker":"1089"}]
