I will attempt to respond to the questions, which I was asked, on a range of economic issues. <br\/><br\/>Over the period 2001-07, in a wide range of publications, together with my colleagues, we repeatedly warned about the dangers posed for the Irish economy by the growth of a property market bubble and of the need to use fiscal policy to defuse the situation.  If the advice on fiscal policy had been followed, Ireland would probably have escaped much of the damage that was suffered over the recent crisis.  However, we did not draw the connection between the growth of a property market bubble and the risks to the financial system.  In 2008 in our medium-term review<i>, \\ <\/i>failed to foresee the impending financial collapse.  The review had a short shelf life because six weeks later we published the quarterly economic commentary which carried headlines that Ireland was in recession.  I am afraid its shelf life was short.<br\/><br\/>I was asked questions about the economic recovery of the 1990s.  Having spent the 1980s dealing with a major budgetary crisis, the economy entered a period of rapid growth in the 1990s.  The ground had been prepared by a very substantial improvement in competitiveness and the restoration of order to the public finances in the 1980s.<br\/><br\/>There were a number of underlying strategic factors in the Irish recovery.  These included the completion of the EU Single Market which was particularly important for us at the end of 1992.  In addition, there was the effects of investment in education because Ireland had lagged behind the rest of northern European for a long period.  Finally, the rising participation of women in the economy was important.  These factors helped to produce a sustained rapid period of growth in the 1990s.  <br\/><br\/>Due to the fact that growth was fuelled from outside of Ireland, it resulted in a substantial movement into a current account surplus of the balance of payments.  That meant that savings were enough to fund investment.  We did not need a capital inflow to the banking system to fund the very rapid growth because we were living within our means.  <br\/><br\/>A significant part of the growth of the 1990s represented a catch up on the rest of the EU 15.  There is an interesting article by Cormac &Oacute; Gr&aacute;da which was published in the ESRI's quarterly economic commentary which brings this matter out.  The interesting thing about Ireland was that bad policy, over a very long period, managed to keep us down.  Then we had a recovery in the 1990s which acted as a catch up to probably where we should have been otherwise.<br\/><br\/>By the end of the 1990s, and into the first few years of the 2000s, the catch up phase was completed and the rate of productivity growth slowed rapidly.  While exports continued to grow, domestic demand began to rise quite fast.  People reacted to their higher living standards by spending more on consumption and, in particular, investment in housing.  This rise in domestic demand was further fuelled by stimulatory fiscal policy which going back to the medium-term review of 1999-2001, and so on, we felt was unwise and a fueling of an already very rapidly growing economy.  Rising expectations saw a gradual disimprovement in competitiveness due to wage inflation which adversely affected exports.  The current account of the balance turned negative.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor John FitzGerald:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I expressed serious concerns about the nature of fiscal policy, in particular in 2001, but it was probably only in 2003 that growth really began to outstrip the potential of the economy, giving cause for real concern.  The bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2002 took the steam out of the economy, which we were worried about in 2001, and that postponed the turning point.<\/p><p> I was asked to say something on the external policy environment.  With the advent of monetary union in 1999, the ECB took over control of monetary policy so that interest rates were not set to meet the needs of individual economies.  They were set as they are today to meet the needs not of Germany but of the EU economy as a whole.  Monetary union also facilitated the free movement of capital, as anticipated.  It reduced the risk premium, which is the cost of capital.  In the 20 years between 1979 and 1999, Ireland paid 2% more on average than Germany, controlling for everything else.  There was a risk premium which meant investment was more expensive.  We were less competitive than Germany.  That risk premium disappeared with monetary union.  Prior to monetary union, Ireland and Spain had probably under-invested in housing as we had a higher cost of capital than in countries like Germany or France.  Given the demographic profile, we needed to invest in housing.  In permitting a more rapid adjustment to the housing stock, the lower cost of capital was beneficial.  However, it was the failure to appropriately control this surge in investment which eventually proved fatal.<\/p><p> Monetary union had its benefits, but it required governments to act differently.  In our case and in the case of Spain, governments did not act differently.  When the property boom got out of control in the period 2003 to 2007, the intensity of the investment went well beyond domestic savings and the counterpart to the deficit was the inflow of funds through the banking system.  The demand for credit to fund investment ran well ahead of the ability of the banks to meet from their own domestic funds.  However, it proved easy and cheap to borrow additional funds abroad.  In the period before monetary union, a constraint on such expansion might have been the exchange risk involved in such borrowing but the experience of EU countries outside monetary union shows that a change in the world economy had taken place.  This was partly due to US policy and meant that cheap money was available not just because of monetary union.  Estonia and Latvia were not members of the eurozone, but they suffered exactly the same experience of a massive property bubble fuelled by very large investment through the banking system of very cheap money.  One should not blame monetary union as it was a worldwide phenomenon of cheap money which governments and central banks failed to manage appropriately.<\/p><p> The turning point was 2003, but one can argue about it.  The current account of the balance of payments was in deficit that year, though the size was small, but wages had been rising rapidly for a number of years and the loss of competitiveness was beginning to take a toll, notwithstanding that it was not yet that serious.  House prices in 2003 returned to growth at more than 10% a year and the demand for credit was outstripping the ability of the banks to fund it.  One began to see the banks borrowing abroad in the inter-bank market to fund the expansion of credit.  The demand for housing, however, had a real basis in terms of the rising population.  House completions at nearly 70,000 were running ahead of the actual increase in population and there was no sign of the rate of increase in house prices slowing.  An important factor driving that was what I call the \"user cost\".  People expected house prices to rise in future which made buying a house much better than renting because rents would go up.  That proved self-fulfilling and produced a bubble effect.  Over the period to 2007, the current account deficit ballooned reflecting the fact that domestic savings were not enough to fund the investment boom.  We had to borrow from abroad, which resulted in increasing vulnerability for the banking system and a rapid rise in household indebtedness.<\/p><p> It is impossible to identify when the bubble became irreversible.  The last chance to stop it without disaster was probably in 2006.  By the end of that year and moving into 2007, house prices were far above their equilibrium level and collapse became inevitable.  I have provided the committee with a detailed appendix which I will not go through here.  It shows that the dangers were apparent, even if disaster was not certain.  One further factor which aggravated the cost of the collapse was the fact that the building and construction sector was like a tumour which grew and grew, squeezing the rest of the economy.  Fortunately, it turns out not to have been cancerous and we are getting over it.  However, real jobs were squeezed out in the rest of the economy.  This contrasts with the situation in the UK, which also had a property bubble.  However, they did not allow any building so that when prices collapsed, there was not a collapse in a large part of the economy.  The expansion of the building sector in Ireland meant that it had to bid resources away from the rest of the economy.  This was done through inflation which made the rest of the economy uncompetitive.  This killed off a significant number of firms and jobs in the exporting sector.  These jobs did not seem important at the time and nobody noticed they were going in the absence of news headlines, but they have proved crucial.  We really need those jobs today.<\/p><p> I turn finally to the policy response.  The dangers the economy faced as a result of the over-inflation of house prices, the build-up of debt and the loss of competitiveness in the economy were foreseeable and foreseen.  The build-up of the bubble could have been prevented by appropriate fiscal policy or by appropriate prudential action by the Central Bank and the regulator, or both.  Either one of these policy instruments, if appropriately deployed, could probably on its own have prevented disaster.  Both together would have prevented disaster.  On fiscal policy, I note that from 2001 onwards in many publications, I and my colleagues pointed to the need to tighten fiscal policy.  Instead, in an economy that was growing strongly and well above potential, fiscal policy pumped money into the economy in six out of eight budgets.  There is a graph which shows this.  When the economy was growing rapidly, successive Governments pumped money into it, which greatly aggravated the situation.  If instead the Government had run a deflationary fiscal policy, as we recommended repeatedly, and built up a substantial surplus, it would have taken the steam out of the housing market and reduced pressure on the labour market.  The case of Finland is instructive.  Having experienced the same disaster we did only 20 years earlier, it ran up a current government surplus of 5% to prevent a repetition.<\/p><p> In addition, to operating a much tighter fiscal policy in the 2001-07 period, I recommended using specific fiscal instruments to take the heat out of the building and construction sector.  We recommended getting rid of all building incentives and, possibly, taxing mortgage interest payments.  The UK Treasury visited us and published a paper in 2003 which said that if the UK joined monetary union it would need to use fiscal instruments to manage the housing market.  The Treasury recommended using stamp duty, but the problem with that is it would lead to higher household debt.  My feeling was that taxing mortgage interest payments would discourage people from taking on debt.  As people would end up with lower debt, it would be a better instrument.  Either way, one could have used fiscal instruments to take the heat out of building construction.  A further result would have been a smaller balance sheet in the banking sector.  If the building sector had not been allowed to grow and fewer houses had been bought at lower prices, the banking sector would not have been vulnerable.<\/p><p> I will not go into banking regulation and macro-prudential policy in detail.  It was the other instrument which could have been used.  There were a range of ways the Central Bank and the regulator could have stopped the growth in credit, as demonstrated by research from within the Central Bank itself by Kieran McQuinn and Gerard O'Reilly.  They wrote a number of papers on how credit growth is important in fuelling house prices.  If the credit channel had been choked off in 2003 to 2007 by the regulator, it would have halted the rise in house prices or, at least, achieved an appropriate moderation.  Policy instruments were available.<\/p><p> By 2007, it was probably too late to prevent a major crisis from occurring in 2008.  However, if urgent action had been taken in the form of a tightening of fiscal policy or regulatory action, it would have reduced the subsequent damage.  It would have reduced the indebtedness of the household sector by stopping the boom earlier.  If people who bought in 2007 had not bought, they would not be in difficulties today.  The bloated balance sheets of the banks would have been smaller.  However, if policy makers ever considered such action, which I do not think they did, they might have decided that bursting the bubble deliberately in 2007 or early 2008, with serious consequences, was much less attractive than hoping for redemption by delaying action.  It became politically difficult even at the best of times to take action once things had gone that far.  If any action had been taken in 2007, it would probably have left a smaller problem to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423612800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Before I turn to our lead questioners, Deputy Pearse Doherty and Senator Michael D'Arcy, I will do some scene setting with Professor FitzGerald to provide some clarity on the role of the ESRI and its relationship with the Department of Finance.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor John FitzGerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2165\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Ciar&aacute;n Lynch\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BIJ&amp;amp;memberid=2165&amp;amp;pid=CiaranLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Ciar&aacute;n Lynch\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The ESRI is often described as the Government think tank.

Professor Joe Lee in his <i>Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society<\/i>, commented on the fact that universities were not producing useful research at the time.  It was an initiative led by Dr. Ken Whitaker, the then Secretary of the Department of Finance.  To guarantee its independence, he sought funding for it from the Ford Foundation.  He told me that he discovered that the person responsible for funding in the Ford Foundation served mass in a church in New York.  He went to mass and nobbled him after it to get the money for the ESRI.  For the first four years, it was totally independent of the Government.  That was the intention of both the Government and the Secretary of the Department of Finance.<br\/><br\/>The ESRI is legally a charity.  The Department of Finance took over giving it 100% funding when the Ford Foundation money ran out in the middle 1960s.  The ESRI was about 80% funded by a direct grant from the Department of Finance until the late 1980s.  Then there were pretty dramatic cutbacks, as we know, and the ESRI chose to survive by looking for research contracts from the EU, other Departments and so on.  Today, approximately 30% of its funding comes from grant-in-aid from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the other 70% coming from a range of sources such as public research funding from the EU, SFI, Science Foundation Ireland, Departments and public bodies, with a limited amount from the private sector.  The ESRI insists on publishing everything it does without censorship.  The private sector is not generally prepared to fund public good research.<br\/><br\/>The ESRI is governed by a director who is responsible to a council.  The council is not appointed by the Government but co-opts its membership.  Until the late years of the last decade, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance was always a member of the council.  It is now an assistant secretary from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Central Bank Governor has generally been a member.  There is a range of people broadly representative from civil society.  The council is not appointed by the Government, a provision which is there to ensure its independence.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Finance has been party to these ground rules.  Generally, it has been good to deal with.  It understands we kick them and they grin and bear it.

If one looks at the 2007 April spring quarterly commentary, we did mention the financial risks.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor John FitzGerald:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In addition, we mentioned this in papers back to 2004 in the Dublin Economics Workshop.  While we were conscious they were there, because we had not done research, we did not go into detail on that.  Looking back on it, had I even looked at the data on the balance sheet of the banking system, I would have known there was a major problem.  I would not have needed a lot of research to conclude it was not just fiscal policy.  I feel that I made a serious mistake in not looking at the data on that.  I suppose a lot of people relied on the fact that the Central Bank had the biggest number of economists doing research.  As they were doing research on that area, were we to go out seeking funding for such research, the response would have been the Central Bank was doing it.  The lesson for the future is that there is a need for two people or bodies to undertake research on any given area.  However, what happened is a cause of regret.  It is not because we were told not to, rather it is why I did not look at the data, as it would have stood out.  Even though we had not done research, I think I would have said something on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423612800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>In respect of research carried out and published by others in newspaper articles - Morgan Kelly is one who springs to mind for example - was such research simply ignored by the ESRI in its forecasts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#D00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423612800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>No.  I think the first discussion of what Morgan Kelly was producing was in September 2007.

In particular, it stated that lasting damage would be done to the tradeable sector, that is, the export sector.  Were one to plug in the right numbers in terms of the financial sector, the model we had of the economy actually explained what happened to the real economy and we can see the real economy is recovering now.  However, what it did not see was the catastrophic damage done by the financial collapse, in which one had a dramatic fall in output.  I believed then that the economy would recover from whatever happened and I think that actually is what is happening.  Nevertheless, that does not excuse the fact that we did not see the financial collapse.  We published an article in 2011 in which we considered how the economy's behaviour was in line with previous behaviour, if one put in the right external numbers into our way of understanding the economy.  In an updated medium-term review in 2010, we published a high and low scenario for Ireland out to 2020 on the basis that the real economy was not broken and that the business sector would respond in a recovery.

Immediately after the publication, I became aware that the rest of the world was contemplating matters being much worse and then, six weeks later, in a quarterly economic commentary, we stated we thought there was going to be a recession and that it was clear we were wrong.

I discussed it with the director and it seemed to me that the Department's comments were political and should be ignored.  I checked this and note that the first set of chapters of the medium-term review were finalised, on my machine in any event, on 1 October 1999.  Some time between then and 15 October, we published the medium-term review.  Unfortunately, I was not able to check that date with the ESRI.  The author changed the text to meet the Department of Finance's suggestions, or made some changes, and when I came back I discovered this had happened.  We had put the thing to bed.  However, what John McManus in his story did not realise was the role <i>The Irish Times<\/i>played in this.  A few days after we published on 15 October, all of the things that had been taken out were published in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.

I was not in a position to talk to him when I came back from Warsaw and I had other things on my mind.  That would be most unusual.  On that medium-term review, we received a letter after publication from a senior official in a different public institution saying the ESRI had committed treason in it.  I think the word used was &quot;treason&quot;.  That was because we had suggested that corporation tax should be raised from 12.5% to 15% or 17.5% between 2011 and 2015.  The official asked that we withdraw the medium-term review.  That is my memory.  There was a much more normal Department of Finance reaction.

In a paper on budget perspectives 2012 or 2013 - I have updated it since - I looked at the approach taken in Ireland and the approach taken in Spain.  I think we got it broadly right.  Basically, we under promised and over delivered whereas in the Spanish case it over promised and under delivered.  We have done roughly the same and got to roughly the same position.  What makes Ireland different is that the outgoing Government decided to take a pessimistic view of the public finances, three months before the election in its paper of October-November 2010, and set targets which have been difficult to reach but were politically possible so that the incoming Government was handed a plan that was deliverable within target every period.  By contrast, in the Spanish case what happened was that the outgoing government continually raised the bar and promised it would get the deficit down to 3% even faster, something the incoming government finds it is impossible to achieve.  People say Ireland meet its targets and Spain does not.  It mirrors what happened in 1986, 1987 and 1988 where the political system across party boundaries delivered a resolution which produced a better adjustment for Ireland.  The bailout in terms of the plan was an Irish plan developed by an Irish Government.  The troika bought into it and said it was okay.  The incoming Government said it did not like features of it and the troika agreed that so long it stuck to the broad parameters it could change it.

However, over the summer and into the autumn it became clear that the hole in the banks was going to be much bigger and we ended up putting &euro;64 billion into the banks.

How did such a tumour go undetected by the ESRI on the basis that it produced reports for the Department of Finance in 2003 on the national development plan, where it was very critical of the growth in the property sector, and a follow-up report in 2006, where it said exactly the same thing?  Professor FitzGerald took part in the Kenmare conference in October 2004 and subsequently followed it up with \"Future Shock\" on RTE in April 2007.  He used the same term on both occasions.  He said that the economy was out on a limb due to the property market.  With the benefit of hindsight, why did the tumour of the property bubble and the banking stream of funding go undetected by the ESRI?  Why was it not highlighted in the 2008 medium-term review report considering that up to April 2008, taxes were behind by &euro;700 million and &euro;1.2 billion by May 2008, we were running a deficit of &euro;3.6 billion and taxes in all areas were behind?

I ask the Professor FitzGerald to comment on Professor Kelly's article dated 28 December 2006 in which he said:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>If, however, we look at what has happened to other small economies where sudden prosperity and easy credit drove house prices to absurd levels, we should be very worried indeed.<\/blockquote>Then he mentioned the potential for house prices to fall by between 40% and 50% and a collapse of the housing building industry.  He referenced Finland and continued:<blockquote>With low interest rates, and loans available for the asking, house prices soared.  Then, as the Soviet Union collapsed, unemployment rose and house prices started to fall, creating problems first for builders, then for homeowners, and finally for banks.  But why can't we just have our soft landing, where prices stay fixed or rise slowly for a while?  Definitely not: a soft landing is not so much unlikely as contradictory.<\/blockquote>On construction, he continued:<blockquote>In Ireland, if and when the fall occurs, it will be from about 18 per cent of all national income.  We could see a collapse of Government revenue and unemployment back above 15 per cent. <\/blockquote>He concluded:<blockquote>Pilots define a soft landing as one that you can walk away from.  Looking at the collapses in Finland and The Netherlands and the building bust in Arizona, Ireland could be heading for what they call CDIT: controlled descent into terrain.  You are happily descending through cloud, thinking yourself at a safe altitude, until suddenly you smack into a hillside.<\/blockquote>The article was published on 28 December 2006.

Direct funding is low in the ESRI - if you look at the best in Europe, the Central Planning Bureau is wholly funded - and there are advantages and disadvantages to the funding model.  The advantage is that the policy output and policy relevance of what we have done has been doubled or trebled since we were totally funded.  The productivity increase in the institute over the last 20 years is dramatic.  We are funded to do research on energy and it is policy-relevant, whereas if you are an ivory tower with money to spend and you decide what you are going to do, some of the time you will indulge yourself and do things which might not be of great use to policy.  So the funding model has an advantage, but the disadvantage is there are areas that fall through the cracks that are not funded.  The funding of macroeconomics would have been very limited and the funding of the financial research undertaken in the 1990s came from banks.  They stopped funding it, however, and it would probably have been a major problem if the funding was still coming from banks in the last decade.  They would not have continued to fund because you would have been saying there is a real problem and the banks would have been upset.<\/p> <p>  I think the model is too much in contract and in block grant whereas the untied funding should be substantially larger.  Looking at other institutes across Europe, a 50:50 model would be a better model.  It would combine incentives to be policy-relevant with the independence to pick areas that nobody else is interested in.  For example, the ESRI was a leading area of research on poverty over the last 20 years but there has been very limited research funding for poverty, so staff have got to move on to other areas, and there are areas like demography that nobody wants to fund but which I think are important.

Most methodologies for estimating potential GDP do not incorporate information about unsustainable credit developments, housing bubbles, interest-rate movements, and other financial developments that can result in longer-term deviations of GDP from its potential trend.

It is just taking the current EU methodology for establishing structural deficit and potential output, which is wrong and inappropriate for Ireland and gives the wrong answer.  Adding in the financial variables, you may get a better fit but it is not going to come up with the right answer so I think there is a problem with this simplistic approach to estimating potential output.  I can go down this route.  I published an article in April of last year on this with my colleague, Edel Bergin, but it is taking us rather far from what Senator Barrett is talking about here.

I mentioned earlier the papers by Kieran McQuinn and Gerard O'Reilly in the Central Bank, a number of which showed that credit was very important in terms of explaining what happened to the housing market.  One of the problems, of course, is that that was a single equation, or small model, and credit is itself endogenous.  You need to embed it in a larger model in order to understand the full role.  That is one of the things the ESRI is working on in collaboration with the Central Bank in developing the CoSMo model to include the financial sector.  However, just because a particular model does not have the financial sector does not, as I said earlier, excuse you from looking at that.  It is a very important part of the economy.  The HERMES model does not have the financial sector in it but we have used it to very good effect since the crisis to look at what is happening in the Irish economy because we bring our own human capital, our own understanding of the role of the financial sector, and add it on to the model.

What should have happened was that, yes, we had to raise taxes and cut expenditure dramatically, as did Spain, but the rest of Europe - France, probably Italy, Germany, Netherlands - should have stimulated the economy.  That is what should have happened.  The problem is that all the fiscal rules that have been put in place are about making sure that debt is repaid.  None of them is about co-ordinating fiscal policy.  Also on rules, one of the reasons we got into a mess was that we had the Stability and Growth Pact.  In dealing with the EU Commission and the IMF in the run-up to the crisis, in 2004-06, they would come and visit us and I would tell them they needed to give the Government a speeding ticket.

How many research institutes of that kind one can support in a society is a problem.<\/p> <p>  Looking at, say, the Netherlands, the central planning bureau, which I think is the best in Europe, is in a dominant position, a monopoly, and they do a great job, but they are very conscious of the fact that they are in a responsible position.  In the ESRI in the 1980s, one would publish something and nobody might notice.  It has become much more of a responsibility when the media are going to take everything very seriously.

Therefore, taxing the profits was not going to prevent a bubble.

I am not hung up on a particular mechanism, but we need some fiscal mechanism to take money out of the property market.  Taxing the profits will not do that.

One of my concerns about the banking crisis was the extent to which competition coming from foreign banks outside of Ireland drove Irish banks to do stupid things to hold their market share.  One of the things I was not sure about was whether the Central Bank - I now know what powers it has and it has powers in this area - had power to regulate the banks.  It could say it had powers to regulate AIB, because it licensed AIB, but did it have powers in regard to Ulster Bank or Bank of Scotland (Ireland)?<\/p> <p>  I asked Axel Weber, then governor of the Bundesbank, when he was in Dublin whether Europe needed more co-ordination.

It was a failure of regulation.  It is unclear how it would have operated in a world with banks from different countries with different regulators.  That is why the achievement of European banking regulation is a great leap forward.  I know that we failed, and that had we taken action we could have stopped it, but I am not sure of the details of how, precisely, it would have worked out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#W02100","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423612800,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I would like to clarify three points Professor FitzGerald made this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#X00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1423612800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>You have only a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#X00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1423612800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>In his opening statement, Professor FitzGerald said, \"The dangers the economy faced as a result of the over-inflation of house prices, the build-up of debt and the loss of competitiveness in the economy were foreseeable and [as set out in the appendix] foreseen.\"  The appendix contains the implications for fiscal policy of the analysis in the ESRI quarterly economic commentary and the medium-term review in the period 2001 to 2008.

The Government should encourage diversity of opinions.  Undertaking research across a wide range of areas of the economy is important.  Models need to develop continuously.  Although we will soon have a model of the financial sector, the next problem to hit Ireland will be something different.  How do we know what it will be?  We should not be too reliant on the past and should think outside the box, and this is one area in which we have failed.  I do not know what will be the next major policy challenge.<\/p> <p>  In fiscal policy, I am concerned that we lack the infrastructure to sensibly operate the rules we have put in place regarding the management of fiscal policy and structural deficit, and which are embedded in the Constitution.  As long ago as the early years of the last decade, the Department of Finance said the current EU methodology for calculating the structural deficit and potential output was an unwise method.  Although the methodology was telling the Government it was doing a great job and should continue to stimulate the economy, the Department of Finance still said it was a bad method.  Whereas the European Commission is now saying Ireland has a substantial structural deficit and needs more cuts, my assessment, using my methodology published last April, is that we are in structural surplus and do not need further cuts.  However, in the medium term, using an appropriate methodology, we may find ourselves in the next five years having to run an increasing surplus because there is a chance we might get rapid growth, moving beyond potential output.  There is a need to improve our methodology and we have put forward a methodology for assessing fiscal policy which is better than what is there.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission officials accept that the methodology does not work.  In 2010 and 2012, I was at conferences in Amsterdam and Brussels, and at the Amsterdam conference my colleague spoke about this problem, that the methodology is inappropriate.  The European Commission official became furious, not because my colleague had said the methodology was wrong but because she had said it was a Commission methodology.  The official's view was that it was an EU methodology and that, although the Commission implemented it, he agreed with us.  In monitoring fiscal policy, we must develop more appropriate methodology that will give the right answer.  There is a danger that in the short run it may tell us we need &euro;2 billion more in cuts when we do not, and that in the long run it may tell us to stimulate the economy when we should take money out of it.  I have suggested a methodology.  I do not have a monopoly on wisdom and it is open to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the Department of Finance and the ESRI to develop an alternative.  We need better guidance for the future in light of the mistakes of the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021100002#X01700","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1423612800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank Professor FitzGerald for his participation in today's meeting.

The ISI has already announced that from the first quarter of this year, 2015, it will publish on a quarterly basis details of debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements that have been voted down by creditors.  That information is now going to be available on a quarterly basis and that will make it available much more quickly, instead of waiting for an annual publication.  I believe this is the right direction to take so that it can be seen clearly what is happening when people are trying to deal with these debt issues.<\/p><p> Debt relief notices would not be included in the proposed amendment, since the Personal Insolvency Act does not provide for a creditor vote for this type of arrangement.  If it is a limited write-down of unsecured debt for persons with very little income or assets which is approved directly by the court, a creditor can object to the court but no creditor vote is required because of the specific and limited nature of the debt solution.

For example, looking at the evidence the banks gave to the finance committee, they were quite strong in suggesting they would not be engaging in write-downs and so on.  This is the key problem with the original Bill that we would want to see revisited.  We are using this opportunity today to flag the issue with the Minister and I hope she can revisit the whole issue.  The veto is the one area that is a fundamental flaw in the original Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#B01300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The effect of the Deputy's amendment is to reduce the proportion of debt required to approve a personal insolvency arrangement, from 65% to just 30%.  That proposal, as the Deputy says, was made on Report Stage of the Bill in 2012 and it was opposed at that point on the basis that it seems unlikely that creditors would accept or agree to be bound by a solution which was only approved by a minority - the Deputy is saying 30% - of value of the overall debt.  There would be a situation where, out of all of those creditors, it would only require 30% of them to agree that the arrangement was acceptable.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the issue the Deputy is trying to deal with and I believe there are other avenues open to us which we will be considering as a result of the review.  The courts might be able to play a further role, for example, and be in a position to make further interventions.  There are obviously different definitions of \"unreasonable\" for different people.  A court might make a call where there had been a particular situation in which a solution was being refused by a creditor.  We are concerned here with striking a delicate balance between the rights of creditors and debtors.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we have to be clear that the banks must and should engage constructively on these issues and help people come to resolutions.  That is a key issue.  Although the solution suggested here is not the right solution and I am not in a position to accept the amendment, I intend to bring forward changes and proposals for the Personal Insolvency Act and will be considering very carefully the range of possible approaches, also in the context of any legal advice.  There will be some constitutional property rights, for example, that would impact on this type of decision.  I would point out that in the UK, the percentage is 75%.   We have 65% here and the Deputy is suggesting going down to 30%.  I understand the problem he is trying to deal with but it is a very dramatic reduction in the percentage where agreement is needed in order for it to be accepted.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to accept the amendment that but there may be other ways of dealing with this issue.<\/p><p>As I said on Second Stage, the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, predicted that 15,000 people would avail of this when the Bill was enacted but the actual figure was, I understand, around 10% of that figure.  The difficulty is that the perception and the message that came from the banks in the finance committee was that they are not in the mind-set in terms of dealing with  write-downs and that they want to send out a robust message in this respect.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2321\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=JUS&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=11\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> We must do something radical, although I do not know if that is the right word, to remove the veto.  It is ensuring that the banks do not have the percentage on their side to stall a settlement.  There is also a balance of responsibility and, at present, they have all the chips on their side.  There is a flaw in the legislation and my party feel strongly about it.  When this was going through originally, the entire Opposition took this position.  Those who take up the option vindicate our view.  We may not convince the Minister today but I ask her to deliberate further on the matter to see if we can make changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015021100002#B01400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423663200,"counter":463,"content":"<p>When the committee reported on this, we spoke about an appeal mechanism.
