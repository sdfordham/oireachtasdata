The themes include confirmation of the central role of public capital investment and addressing overheating risks, as well as supporting social progress, the need to align public capital investment with a changing demographic profile, the critical importance of public capital infrastructure in meeting the essential requirement for balanced regional growth and promoting the societal transformation required to achieve climate action objectives, responding to Brexit, driving value for money and having in place strong business cases to underpin important projects.<\/p><p>Based on this analysis, the review of the capital plan identified a number of key sectors as priorities for investment including transport, education, housing and health.  <\/p> <p> Consequently, between 2014 and 2021, public capital investment in Ireland will have more than doubled and as set out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment in Ireland moving to among the highest in the EU.

In response to the Deputy's questions on sectors, I intend that the capital plan will be multisectoral but there will be a balance.

To do so would adversely affect the important independent role of the commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  However, as Deputies may be aware, an extensive review of the operation of the freedom of information, FOI, framework fed into the development of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 which introduced a modernised, consolidated, restructured and more accessible system.

Among the key reforms of the Act was the removal of the requirement to pay upfront fees for making requests to public bodies and the significant reduction in the cost of applying for internal reviews and appeals to the Information Commissioner.  In addition, in relation to non-personal requests, a minimum threshold of &euro;101 was introduced below which no search, retrieval and copying fees can be charged.  This means that if a request is focused and takes no longer than five hours to search for, the requests will be processed free of charge.  However, I, as Minister, have no role in monitoring or policing of individual decisions, including in relation to fees.<\/p>  <p>  For the information of the Deputy, some 30,417 FOI requests were processed by public bodies in 2016.

It needs to be looked at.  Currently, it is only an offence under the FOI Act to destroy a record after a request has been received in relation to that record.  We have a situation, for example, where NAMA can destroy all the emails of staff 12 months after they have left and it is not illegal.  Is that right?  Should it be that way?

The pensions of post-1995 public servants are integrated with the contributory State pension.  This results in a situation where the pensioner generally applies to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for social welfare benefit, which is usually jobseeker's benefit, for the intervening year.  Many pensioners are not comfortable with that arrangement because they are required to register for social welfare benefits despite the fact that they have retired.  Pensioners feel that they have earned their pensions and should not have to sign on as jobseekers for that period.  Many would prefer to continue to work until normal State pension age rather than engage in such a process.  This process is likely to become more protracted as the age of eligibility for the State pension increases in 2021 and 2028.<\/p> <p> Many public servants want to continue to work beyond the age of 65 because they are fit and healthy and have the ability to contribute further.

Let us bear in mind the number of people involved.  As non-public servants, the staff of such organisations could exceed 100,000.  There could be more than 100,000 individuals working in these sectors.  Some 300,000 people are working directly for the State.  As many as one third more could be working for these organisations.  These individuals did not fall within the application of the FEMPI legislation, which involved reductions in pay and increases in pension contributions for public servants.  It is correspondingly the case that current public service pay policy does not extend to such organisations.  This is a matter for those organisations, which are self-governed and accountable to their management for their own financial resources.

It is not a uniform case that all of these organisations cut wages.  Some organisations did cut wages, which I acknowledge, but others did not.  Other organisations may have changed the number of people working for them or made changes to find cost savings elsewhere.

The complexity of this matter arises from the fact that there is not.

As he and the rest of the House know, public procurement is governed by well-established European Union, EU, and national rules and guidelines.  The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for public procurement, I launched new public procurement guidelines for goods and services in July this year.  These guidelines replace previous guidelines published by the Department of Finance and take account of 2014 EU directives on public procurement, as implemented in Ireland.  The purpose of these guidelines is to promote best practice and consistency of application of the public procurement rules relating to the purchase of goods and services.  The guidelines form part of the national procurement policy framework, which consists of five strands.  These are legislation, policy, capital works management framework for public works, general procurement guidelines for goods and services and more detailed technical guidelines, template documents and notes issued periodically by the policy unit of the Office of Government Procurement.<\/p>  <p>  These new guidelines are aimed at demystifying some of the more complex rules and procedures around public procurement and making them more accessible to both contracting authorities and suppliers.  They are intended to serve as a tool kit for practitioners and a general reference document for suppliers.  They have been written in plain language with a view to providing a clear appreciation of the rules and best practice attached to the various stages of the procurement process from specification through to selection and award stages, and through to the contract management stage.  They promote and reinforce improved best practice, standardisation and consistency of approach among public procurement practitioners.  The guidelines facilitate public bodies in meeting their corporate governance requirements relating to procurement.  However, it is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure they comply with EU and national rules relating to public procurement.<\/p>  <p>  Public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 and the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and Accounting Officers are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred.  Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have the details of the last point mentioned by the Deputy.

I will then conclude with an observation on the interesting point that the Deputy made about diversity and inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  First, we will soon set up a public service management leadership board, an entity that will have all of the senior leaders, not only in our Civil Service, but across the public service, coming together on a regular basis to review progress in delivering this plan.  That is not something that we have done previously.  It is separate to the Civil Service Management Board, which considers how to implement Government decisions, policy and so on.  This will all be about how we bring that document to life.<\/p>  <p>  Second, we now have a chief HR officer, who is looking to roll out consistent HR practice across all Departments.  In the next three years, HR sections in Departments will be strengthened and supported more from the centre, which is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to make that strategy happen.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that the Deputy made a point about inclusion.  I have noticed, as recruitment into the Civil Service has returned to reasonable levels in recent years, the significant quality and diversity of young civil servants who have joined.  This is encouraging for the future of the Civil Service but we cannot take it for granted.  We are examining ways of better recruiting on university campuses, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400010#H01600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1513251600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's establishment of a public service development board, if that was the name mentioned, but a basic point must be acknowledged.

Although we hardly need it, we had another reminder last night of how divisive this issue is in the UK with an embarrassing parliamentary defeat for its Government.  One consequence of this vote is that the timeframe for agreeing a deal is potentially compressed even further, even though it was already tight.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il broadly welcomes last week's deal as it pertains to the island of Ireland.  However, given the vastly different interpretations being put on that deal, we must accept that the most difficult Brexit negotiations are still ahead of us.  The putting into effect of the commitments secured last week as part of a final, legally binding written agreement will be a major challenge.  The clock is ticking and with the UK set to leave the EU in just over 15 months time, the imperative in the coming months will be to achieve as much certainty as possible for Irish businesses trading with the UK.  It is generally accepted that there is less than a year to agree a transition agreement and the framework of a future relationship.<\/p>  <p>  In her speech in Florence last August, the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, called for a transition period of two years.  Given the level of complexity involved across different sectors and the amount of detail that must be worked out as part of that process, two years is nowhere near adequate or realistic.  If one takes the aviation sector, for example, where forward planning has to be done many years in advance, it is clear that the business community must be afforded a long lead-in period to whatever the new trade arrangements will be.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm what length of transition period the Government will seek as part of the phase 2 negotiations?  Will he give an assurance that throughout the transition phase, however long it is, the UK will remain part of the Single Market and the customs union and that the terms of trade, on both a North-South basis and an east-west basis, will remain unchanged and unimpeded?<\/p>  <p>  On the question of what can be achieved in phase 2, the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, has said that while an agreement on a future relationship can only be finalised and concluded once the UK has become a third country, the EU will be ready to engage in preliminary and preparatory discussions with the aim of identifying an overall understanding of the framework for that relationship.  People will want to know what this means in practice.  Is it the T&aacute;naiste's understanding that there will be no talks at all on the details of a future trade deal until the UK leaves the Union in March 2019?  It is undoubtedly the case that the EU stood by Ireland in phase 1.  What reassurances has the Government received that the same solidarity will apply in phase 2 on the critical question of trade, given the enormous economic exposure of the State to changes in that area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400012#K01100","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1513252800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>First, when people see the text of the guidelines agreed by leaders, which are to be published tomorrow morning, they will clearly see the determination on the EU side to ensure there is no slide-back from the commitments that were made in phase 1.  This applies to issues of particular Irish concern, as well as other issues.  It is very clear in the wording that the negotiations in the second phase will not proceed or continue unless there is clear evidence that the commitments which were made in phase 1 will be followed though and given legal effect.  I expect to see the EU develop, early next year, a draft withdrawal agreement which offers reassurance that the commitments made under phase 1 will be implemented.<\/p><p>I agree with the Deputy that we need to give businesses certainty as soon as we can.  While I have very strong views on what I would like to see as the outcome of the phase 2 process, regardless of that outcome, businesses need time to adapt to any new realities.  I have said a number of times that if there is a significant difference between the trading environment today and the trading environment post Brexit, then we will need a number of years to allow businesses to adapt to that change.  We need time, too, to negotiate the detail of a new trade deal.  Any expectation that the full detail of a new trade partnership or arrangement will be concluded in full and be in place by next October or November, as some parties are suggesting, is simply not realistic.  What is possible by next October is to have a framework agreement within which we can set the parameters for a new trading environment between the United Kingdom and the EU.  The Government's position is that we want this framework to deliver an environment as close as possible to the <i>status quo<\/i>, with no barriers to trade between the EU and the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>In the absence of agreement, and if the British Government decides to pursue the course of action it has outlined many times, namely, to leave the Single Market and customs union as well as the EU, there will, of course, be problems to address.  Such an approach would mean that some of the commitments made in phase 1 in the context of those decisions will be triggered and will have to be part of any withdrawal agreement.<\/p><p>I expect the transition period will take longer than two years.  There is nothing in the guidelines that commits the EU to a specific time period, although there is a recognition that the UK has requested approximately two years.  An agreement on that matter will be part of the discussions early next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400012#K01200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1513252800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>The Government is right to guard against any potential backsliding away from the deal that was announced last week.

I am seeking to clarify the Government's position on the question of the transition period.  Ireland is now, hopefully, about to commence the phase two negotiations.  The T&aacute;naiste has said that he favours a transition period of up to five years.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will clarify this and confirm it as the formal position of the Government as we enter into the phase two negotiations.  However long the transition period will be, is it the EU and the Government's position that the UK would remain within the Single Market and the customs union during that period so there is a defined transition window?  We know what we are working towards but while that window is open, firms and businesses could have that certainty.

If the UK wants to negotiate a Canada style free trade agreement, it will take a number of years.  If the UK wants or chooses an option that keeps the United Kingdom much closer to the Single Market and the customs union in the future, it may not involve as much change, and therefore may not involve as long a transition period.<\/p><p>Let me be very clear that the transition period, however long it is, or the adaptation period as some people call it, will involve Britain remaining as part of the Single Market and customs union as it is today.

The Government has decided to endorse the joint report from the EU Commission and the British Government and last Friday morning the Taoiseach described that report as &ldquo;rock solid and cast iron&rdquo;.  While acknowledging the positive language in the joint report, Sinn F&eacute;in warned that it fell far short of what is needed to truly protect the national interest, North and South.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in also cautioned that the commitments made were not legally binding and that the Government needed to be very careful in its dealings with the Tory Government.  Over the days that followed, our caution was proven to be well founded.  The British Government spokesperson on Brexit, David Davis, went on television last Sunday and stated that the joint report was merely a &ldquo;statement of intent&rdquo;.  Senior officials from the Department for Exiting the European Union at Westminster have already rowed back on the British commitments.  They have claimed that full alignment will only apply to six areas of North-South co-operation as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  The looseness of the joint report was further highlighted when, on Monday the EU Commission confirmed that the joint report is not legally binding.  They described it as &ldquo;a deal between gentlemen&rdquo;.  This is hardly the language of rock solid and cast iron agreements.  The backsliding the T&aacute;naiste referred to earlier has already started.<\/p>  <p>  We are left with a set of contradictions.  The first is the claim that there will be no hard border in Ireland, but Britain is leaving customs union and the Single Market and wishes to drag the North of Ireland with them.  The second contradiction is the claim that there will be no denudation of rights for citizens, but Britain is leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  The third contradiction is the claim that there is no threat to the Good Friday Agreement, but we are facing the biggest social and political rupture to impact on our island in generations.  There is a huge square to be circled here and relatively little time in which to do it.<\/p>  <p>  I met with cross-community sectoral groups in Belfast last Monday.

Those commitments are cast iron in my view and in the view of the EU negotiators and the EU institutions within the EU Union at Council and Commission level.  The Deputies have seen very strong commentary in response to the ambiguous comments that were made last weekend, which created concern in Ireland and elsewhere.  David Davis has subsequently clarified those comments and unfortunately Deputy McDonald has chosen to not quote him in that regard.  Rather than trying to raise unfounded fears, we need to reassure communities living in the Border regions.  This is what the Government is trying to do.  We received very clear assurances in writing last week.  As of tomorrow morning we will also have clear reassurance in the EU guidelines around how the EU is going to approach phase two to make sure the commitments will be honoured in full.  The wording on that in the first paragraph of the guidelines will be very clear to ensure no back sliding from the commitments made last week.  If that was to happen, it would prevent phase two from going ahead.

It is the Government's job to make sure we can reassure people on the basis of what has been agreed, in black and white and in writing.

Some of those who have come forward recently with their stories and allegations tell us that those incidents occurred before they were 18 years.  Many allegations involve high profile figures from the political world, film, theatre and music and we have seen similar revelations in Ireland.  The victims who have made allegations recently are in a place in their personal lives where they can confront what happened to them because they know that today they will be believed and they have a good chance of getting justice.  That is such an important part of the recovery process but I want to remember those who were not believed and those who did not get justice or support for one reason or another.  Because they did not get justice, they continue to suffer every time an allegation of abuse is made, when they relive that abuse.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2015, I raised the issue of those who made accusations against their swimming coach with then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  I raised it because they never had justice.  There were 27 allegations of indecent carnal knowledge of minors, which took place some years ago, against this individual who was their coach.  I can imagine the bravery of those who came forward over 20 years ago when it was a very different atmosphere.  In spite of the great efforts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that came to nothing, there was no justice.  Some weeks ago I watched the RT&Eacute; documentary made in 2006 in which some of the victims told their stories.  The journalist in the documentary followed the individual accused of the abuse to America where he has been living.  Recently, through the work of an investigative journalist, Irvin Muchnik, through freedom of information requests, through a court hearing and through a settlement, it has become obvious that mistakes were made both in the US and Ireland.  Irvin Muchnik sought to find out why American authorities allowed George Gibney into the United States and why Irish authorities and Irish individuals facilitated that.<\/p>  <p>  An interesting thing to emerge from the settlement was that, through a freedom of information request, the US authority on citizenship and immigration services, a subdivision of the Department of Homeland Security, released four pages relating to George Gibney and withheld 98 pages.

As a result of judicial review proceedings in 1994, the State was unable to extradite the person due to the time lapse between the occurrence of the alleged offences and the making of the complaints by the injured parties.  More recent investigations were conducted in 2003 by members of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

There is no point drifting towards an entirely rental-oriented approach to housing when, at present, fixity of tenure is completely inadequate and when a lack of inspection or an enforceable standards regime results in the horrific living conditions we saw on \"Prime Time\" last month.  The fact that one in three tenancies in the State is financially rent assisted is just adding pressure to further rent increases for all, making Dublin simply an unattainable place to buy or rent.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the inept governmental policy response to date.  The incoherence of all this policy implies that what may have happened is that Rebuilding Ireland, launched last year, was rapidly abandoned as a plan by departmental officials without them telling the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The T&aacute;naiste is now defending a plan which is not there or, if it is, is certainly not working.  Where is the &euro;1 billion going?  Given the new numbers, why can the T&aacute;naiste not accept that Rebuilding Ireland is not succeeding and will not succeed in effectively tackling the housing crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400015#N00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1513254600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>This is territory in which I am personally very interested.  It is going to be some time before people see the full benefits of Rebuilding Ireland but we have dramatically increased funding for social housing and there is a multi-annual commitment of almost &euro;6 billion to add 50,000 new social housing units to the national stock, which would be a 30% increase over four or five years.  That takes time and it is not just measured in new builds.  Next year, we will see 3,800 new build houses and 600 private sector-built social house units purchased under Part V, 600 voids returned into use, 900 acquisitions of existing homes and 2,000 long-term leases.  It is a combination of a series of different approaches that are realisable.  Going from building 200 or 300 social houses to building 7,000 or 8,000 in the space of one year is not doable.<\/p>  <p>  While we build up capacity to dramatically increase the number of social housing units that are being delivered through local authorities, approved housing bodies, AHBs, and the private sector under Part V, there is a significant reliance on supporting people in the rental market.  This year we will see about 21,000 social housing solutions put in place, many under the housing assistance payment, HAP, which is an improvement on previous support programmes for the rental sector.  We know this puts pressure on the rental sector, which is why there is a need for rent caps at present, which we introduced last year.  Some 65% of rental properties are in rent pressure zones and the tenants in those properties cannot be asked for an increase of more than 4%, despite the pressures of the market.<\/p>  <p>  We have very significant pressures in the housing market, both in rental properties and those for purchase, because of a dramatic lack of supply, supply which has not been delivered for nearly a decade.  Over time, we will solve that by increasing supply in the private sector, the affordable sector and social housing and by ensuring we bring a lot of vacant properties and sites back into use by using methods with which I am sure the Deputy is familiar.  People cannot expect this problem to be solved overnight and we have to ensure that while the new strategy and the significant funding behind it builds a capacity in the construction sector to significantly increase delivery of housing, we try, in the meantime, to manage a rental sector that is under significant pressure .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400015#N00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1513254600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>It is hard to believe the figures the T&aacute;naiste is giving for next year when the figures the Government has given for this year show that, of a target of 2,284 houses, only 809 were delivered.  There is a huge disconnect between the narrative and reality.  The harsh reality is that 8,000 people are homeless.  The tragic reality is that 3,000 of them are children and the stark objective reality is that Rebuilding Ireland simply is not working.  There were only 809 builds in 2017, of which 303 were direct local authority builds in 18 different authorities, meaning 13 local authorities did not complete a single house in 2017.  Of the 98 completions in Dublin, 76 were rapid builds for families on the increasing homeless list, which leaves a grand total of 22 units in the greater Dublin area for a waiting list of 40,000 people.  How is the capital housing budget being adequately spent if the greater Dublin area only saw 22 units built in the first nine months of this year?  It is time to think outside the box and for the Government to accept that Rebuilding Ireland is not working.  This is an emergency and a crisis.  Surely an objective analysis of the Government's response should be results-driven.  The results speak for themselves and they are appalling.

The Bill I am introducing is about making the transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy.  It will allow small-scale household production of electricity through solar or wind energy production.  It will allow any excess electricity produced by small-scale micro-generators, whether households or farms, to be fed into the grid and for householders to be paid for it, which is currently not provided for.  We are lagging way behind on this issue.  Why are we not harnessing and utilising solar power from people's rooftops and small-scale wind and other sources?  This Bill aims to grow the renewable energy sector and to add more renewable energy sources to allow citizens to play their part in expanding the sector.  <\/p><p>Climate change is affecting us seriously.  A report published last week shows that sea levels around Ireland are rising.  Since 1990, they have risen at the rate of 3.5 cm per decade.  That is not disputed.  The report is supported by a number of sources.  That is 10 cm since 1990.  Seasons are warmer and average rainfall has increased by 5% across the State.  Deputies from western counties will know it has been higher in the west.  Recent weather patterns have been erratic.  We have had Storm Ophelia and flash floods in Donegal and parts of the west of Ireland.  In recent weeks, we have had serious flooding in Mountmellick and Portarlington in County Laois.  A huge amount of rain has been falling in short periods.  Our greenhouse gas emissions are rising.  There has been a rise of 7% over two years according to the Environmental Protection Agency.<\/p><p>We are supposed to be reducing our emissions by 20% by 2020.  I remind Deputies it is two years away.  What is happening?  We have increased them by 7% over the past two years.  In terms of our 2020 targets, we are not even at the races.  We are falling way short.  Not alone are we destroying the environment and adding to global warming, but we will face substantial fines in two short years.  We are one of the most dependent countries in the European Union on fossil fuel imports.  That is not only relevant in terms of our environment, but also in terms of security of supply.  It will become very relevant post-Brexit.  We wish everybody well in the negotiations and hope we get a good outcome.<\/p><p>There will be an issue of energy security.  Small-scale renewable energy is used right across Europe and the world and we have to start doing it here.  There has been virtually no attempt by successive Governments to expand our portfolio of renewable energy.  We have completely lacked vision not only in Government but right across society.  Up until now, we have relied almost completely on large-scale wind farms to do it.  It is an intermittent and unreliable source.  We are not saying it should not happen or that we should not use wind but it is an intermittent source.  To take climate change seriously and to end the use of fossil fuels, we need to use all of the renewable energy sources available.  Small-scale home-generated electricity alone will not solve the issue but it will form part of the solution.  Why not allow households to produce their own energy and earn from the excess power fed into the grid?  Germany and other countries are doing it.  There is immense potential in varied small-scale renewable energy sources.  We are one of the most expensive states for electricity.  That is a fact.  Having households and even small businesses produce their own electricity would allow us to reduce bills and it would also allow some payback in certain cases.  Going forward, we also need to change our transport use.  We have fewer than 2,000 electric cars on the road in the State.  In Sinn F&eacute;in, we see a future in which people will be able to charge their cars at home from their own renewable sources.  There are economic and environmental benefits to that.  <\/p><p>If we are to take climate change and job creation seriously, increase our security of supply and allow ordinary householders to play their part, we need to urgently use all the resources available.  It is essential that the potential of home generated electricity provided for in the Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill is brought forward.  I appeal to the Government and the House to support it.  We have often been accused of not bringing forward solutions.  It has not happened so much in the past two years, but members of a previous Government used to stand up and shout it across at us.  Here we are trying to provide an environmental and economic solution and a solution to global warming.  I urge everyone to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400019#R01400","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1513257000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400019#R01500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1513257000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400019#R01600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513257000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513257000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400019#R01800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1513257000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400019#R01900","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513257000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Bail (Amendment) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1513257000,"counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400019#R02100"},{"type":"speech","time":1513257000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Bail Act 1997, and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>The Bill seeks to amend the laws that operate with respect to bail and the granting of bail.  At present, bail can be refused if it is the case there is a threat or it is believed an individual may commit a crime in the future.  That change happened as a result of an amendment to the Constitution made at the end of the last century which was given legislative effect by the Bail Act 1997.  Part of the reason I am introducing the Bill is the very real fear and concern in many parts of the country of the threat posed from burglary and aggravated burglary.<\/p><p>Recently I was at a public meeting in Cavan at which many harrowing accounts were given by individuals of acts of burglary and aggravated burglary that were committed against them and their families.  It is not just an issue that affects rural communities.  We read in the paper and online today that an individual in Terenure, which is in my constituency, was taken from his home and brought to an ATM.  Money was forced from him in that way.  There is a very real and legitimate fear and concern in our society about burglary and aggravated burglary.  I am conscious there is not one solution to the issues.  Very many of the solutions rest on resources but we cannot ignore the fact that many of the crimes committed are committed by people who are on bail or who previously committed offences.<\/p><p>We note from statistics available to us that in 2016, 13% for all crimes were committed by people out on bail, an increase on the previous year which was 11%.  Data from the Irish Prison Service recidivism study show that a recidivism rate of 79.5% exists among persons in prison for burglary and related offences.  That is the highest rate for any offence and is considerably above the overall recidivism rate of 62%.<\/p> <p> I note that the Government recently strengthened the bail laws.  That was introduced through the House.  We need to revisit it and need to tighten them even further.<\/p> <p> This legislation proposes amending section 2 of the Bail Acts as they exist.  Under the law at present where an application for bail is made by a person charged with a serious offence, a court may refuse the application if the court is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  The Oireachtas is entitled to strengthen that test.  This legislation proposes that instead of it being discretionary, it would be mandatory on a court to refuse bail if the court is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  It is not removing consideration of the issue from a court, but it is stating that the Oireachtas believes it is appropriate and necessary for bail to be refused in circumstances where the court believes it is reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of a further offence.<\/p> <p> The Bill also seeks to further amend section 2B of the legislation which will have the effect that the consideration of factors to be considered by a court in refusing bail should be limited.  If an individual has already been convicted of a serious offence and is applying for bail in respect of another offence, the presumption should be against the grant of bail.  If bail is to be granted, we state in a further section that it should only be granted in those circumstances if the candidate for bail is subjected to electronic monitoring.<\/p> <p> We need to recognise that electronic monitoring exists in our criminal justice system.  However, I am sure the Government will agree it is not used as effectively as it could be.  It is used to a much more widespread degree in Northern Ireland where it is very effective.  If the option for an individual is that he or she remains incarcerated or is subject to electronic monitoring, most individuals would favour the electronic monitoring because they retain their liberty, but are subject to scrutiny and monitoring by the State at that stage.<\/p> <p> That is the legislation we seek to introduce and we hope to bring it forward for Second Stage in due course.

The first purpose is to provide authorisation in law for all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2017 on the basis of the Estimates, which were voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.<\/p><p>Section 1 and Schedule 1 set out the amounts to be appropriated for supply services.  These relate to the amounts included in the Revised Estimates for 2017 voted by the D&aacute;il on 30 May this year and the further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates voted by the D&aacute;il last Thursday, 7 December.  In aggregate, these Estimates amount to &euro;46.8 billion.  The comparable amount in the Appropriation Act 2016 was &euro;44.6 billion.  The amount to be appropriated this year, therefore, represents an increase of &euro;2.2 billion or 4.9% on last year&rsquo;s net voted expenditure.  Over 80% of this increase is in the areas of housing, health and education.<\/p><p>Housing is a key priority for Government.  Including appropriations-in-aid, the sum appropriated for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will have increased year-on-year by just over 50%, with gross expenditure on the housing programme increasing by an estimated &euro;0.5 billion to &euro;1.3 billion this year.<\/p><p>Compared to the amount provided for health in 2016, the Appropriation Bill amount for 2017 represents an increase of approximately 5%.  In line with the commitment to delivering improvements in the health service, spending on our health services is already at record levels.  In 2016, Ireland ranked sixth in terms of health care spend <i>per capita<\/i>out of all OECD countries.  Given the scale of gross voted expenditure of an estimated &euro;14.8 billion in 2017, a key challenge is to ensure value for money to maximise the impact of the increased expenditure.<\/p><p>An effective education system delivers significant benefits for the individual and for society.  It is also vital to keeping our economy competitive and attracting investment.  The sums appropriated for education in the 2017 Bill represent an increase of almost 5% on the comparable amounts for 2016.<\/p><p>Including expenditure on the national training fund, this brings gross spend on education to over &euro;9.5 billion in 2017.  In aggregate, taking into account expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund and the national training fund, total gross voted expenditure is forecast to total over &euro;58.5 billion in 2017.  This represents a significant investment to support the delivery of essential public services and to provide for the necessary infrastructure to support social and economic progress.  A key challenge as we continue with a policy of providing sustainable and prudent increases in public expenditure will be to ensure value for money from this expenditure in order to maximise the benefits for society. <\/p> <p> The second key purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into 2018 in the period before the D&aacute;il votes on the 2018 Estimates.  If the Bill were not enacted before the end of December there would be no authority to spend any voted moneys in 2018 from the start of January until approval of the 2018 Estimates, since this authority for 2018, as contained in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965, is based on the amounts provided for in the Appropriation Act 2017 itself.  Under the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004 Departments may carry over, from the current year to the following year, unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital.  This reflects the difficulty in planning for major capital projects and provides some flexibility for Departments.<\/p> <p> The Appropriation Act determines definitively the capital amounts which may be carried over to the following year.  The aggregate amount of proposed capital carryover from 2017 into 2018 is &euro;70.3 million, which represents just under 2% of the total Exchequer capital programme of &euro;4.6 billion for 2017.  The amount carried over from 2016 into 2017 was &euro;76.5 million.  The proposed amounts in unspent capital to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2 of the Bill.<\/p> <p> The 2018 Revised Estimates Volume, to be presented to the House today, will set out detailed financial and key performance information for Departments and offices.  In Part Il of the Estimates, for each Vote availing of the capital carryover facility a table is included listing the amounts to be deferred by sub-head.  In line with last year&rsquo;s Appropriation Act, section 3 of the Bill includes a specific provision to allow for an advance, not exceeding &euro;200 million, from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General&rsquo;s supply account, with this advance then being repaid to the Central Fund in January 2018.  The need for this provision arises as certain Exchequer liabilities and social welfare payments, in particular child benefit, which will form part of the supply services for 2018, are due for payment by electronic funds transfer on 1 or 2 January 2018.  With the banking system closed on 1 January 2018, funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year to meet those liabilities on a timely basis.  In addition, An Post needs to be pre-funded before the end of 2017 in respect of certain payments due between the first and the fifth day of January 2018, in order to transfer payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to their network of Post Offices throughout the country. <\/p> <p> I remarked at the outset that the Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping which those of us in the D&aacute;il are required to undertake.  The passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2017 on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.  The passage of the Bill will also ensure that payments funded from voted expenditure in 2017 such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, non-contributory State pension, nurses&rsquo; pay, teachers&rsquo; pay and all other pay and pensions funded from voted money can continue to be funded in 2018 in the period before the D&aacute;il approves the 2018 Estimates.  While this is a somewhat technical Bill, it is vitally important.  I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400021#W00700","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513258500,"counter":375,"content":"<p>We will be supporting the Bill.  As the Minister of State said it is a very technical Bill, but it is important.  The recent discussions around a potential election highlighted the importance of this Bill.  They also perhaps highlighted an issue as to whether or not this is the most effective way to be doing business in this day and age.  We bring this Bill in on the very last day of the session and if it does not pass many things will fall.  From the point of view of prudence and keeping our legislation up to date it might be worth looking at.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned some of his priorities, including health, education and housing, and used the usual phrase of \"record spending\".  There are record problems, in housing in particular.  If we are to do anything in 2018, we should build houses.  Spending money on HAP is not adding anything extra to the stock.  We can talk about extra money and record amounts of money, but at the end of the day we still have thousands of children in emergency accommodation and people dying on our streets.  If we are here again this time next year talking about record allocations for housing when it is not making a blind bit of difference on the ground then there is no real point in being here.<\/p>  <p>  There was a story this morning about the Central Bank spending &euro;135,000 on a lighting fixture for its new headquarters in the docklands.  It shows that a sense of extravagance is creeping in around the use of taxpayers' money again.  It needs to be cut out now and a clear signal should go to all Government Departments and agencies.  That kind of extravagance has no place.  We have problems in health, housing and education.  That kind of extravagance is completely ridiculous and is an insult to people on housing lists, health waiting lists and people who are waiting on payments the length and breadth of the country.  The Minister needs to send a very strong signal from the Department of Finance that this cannot happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400022#X00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1513258500,"counter":376,"content":"<p>We also will be supporting the Bill.  Deputy Calleary outlined the importance of it.  It gives authorisation in law for all of the expenditure covered by the Estimates which were dealt with in May of this year and also the Supplementary Estimates which were dealt with on 7 December.  The Bill is coming before the House now because it could not be brought before the Supplementary Estimates are in.  Deputy Calleary's point about looking at how we approach this is valid, because if a general election had been called the week before last this is one of the Bills that would not have been able to proceed, along with the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about record spending and mentioned health and housing as areas of priority.  Unfortunately the issue of housing has dominated the political agenda again this year, in particular homelessness.  We have had a number of deaths this year.  It is really not a matter of spending, but a matter of policy.  The quicker Government realises that the policies which are articulated and put forward are not working the better everyone will be.  We cannot have a situation where, despite all of the policy proposals put forward to deal with housing, the number of people who are entering homelessness is on the increase.  The number of young people under 25 entering homelessness has gone up again this year and very sadly and tragically the number of people who have died on our streets this year is greater than it was last year.  That is a very damning indictment of Government policy.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also allows for certain expenditure in 2018 to be able to happen because of the way the new year and bank holidays are falling.  Certain social welfare payments must be made, as the Minister of State outlined.  For that reason this Bill is important.  If this Bill was not passed child benefit and social welfare payments would not be paid at the start of the year because they would not have been authorised in law.  While it is a very technical Bill it is very important legislation and we will be supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400022#X00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1513258500,"counter":377,"content":"<p>While the Minister of State reeled off a list of impressive statistics and amounts, the Government is somewhat in denial about the scale of some of the problems associated with some of these headings, which are deeply worrying to concerned members of Irish society.<\/p><p>I will start by referring to housing.  I listened to one of the two Ministers for housing we have had in less than two years.  This is a structural problem with this Government, and with Fine Gael in office.  It is now so focused on spin that people are not being left in jobs long enough to see matters to completion.  They do not have time to build up authority with civil servants so that they can be in leadership positions and inspire people in order to actually get the job done.<\/p> <p> I was on the first trip on the new Luas line a few days ago.  When in Cabinet, I argued very strongly for spending on public transport.  Without that kind of spending, we will not be able to give people the quality of life they need.  I was astonished when I passed Dominick Street and heard both of the Fine Gael Ministers who have been responsible for housing, Deputy Coveney and his successor, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, refer to that huge vacant site within a stone's throw of Stephen's Green.  I thought building was under way.  I had not been in Dominick Street on foot for a few months.  I was astonished to discover that nothing has happened.<\/p> <p> Having seen the Dominick Street site lying empty, I raised the issue of another site with both Deputies.  It is called O'Devaney Gardens.  By the way, there are beautiful flats further up the way at the corner of Dorset Street.  The city council has now boarded up all of the lower levels, which used to be for the use of older people.  It is now starting to board up the upper levels and is doing so in the midst of a housing crisis of the scale the city and the country are facing.  I want to pause.  The Minister is saying that more money has been allocated.  I accept that.  That is good, but where is the management leadership to get the job done in respect of housing?  We have had two different Ministers responsible for housing in less than two years.  That is a shocking commentary on the Government.  I went up to O'Devaney Gardens to check progress, because that is the area I am from.  It is a beautiful site beside the Phoenix Park.  It has a public road running through it which would allow building in any corner.  It is beside St. Bricin's, very close to Arbour Hill, so it is in a beautiful, highly desirable part of Dublin.  There are many transport options there.  Even Heuston Station is only a stone's throw away.  Weeds are growing everywhere.  There is absolutely no sign of a brick being placed on a brick.<\/p> <p> Increasing numbers of people are becoming homeless because more of the banks are repossessing houses.  When I was Minister for Social Protection, I spent time with the Simon Community and the housing authorities in Cork on several occasions.  I agree with Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  It is shocking to see that homelessness is now spreading in a way not seen heretofore.  Cork has been very good at looking after its own people.  The Simon Community, other organisations, those involved with Penny Dinners and so on have been very good at looking after rough sleepers or people with other issues.  Will the Government have a meeting in the new year to show some leadership in the management of expenditure so that we can start getting results?<\/p> <p> I spoke to the Minister earlier about the dreadful situation in respect of the publicly-paid employees of section 39 organisations and he was quite honest.  He very kindly went through an explanation.  However, the explanation provided by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was all about process rather than people.  There is now a problem.  If a nurse, a doctor or another member of staff transfers from one of the hospitals in Cork to work in the hospice, from the beginning of next year his or her pay will be sharply lower than the pay he or she got when working in the hospital.  The Minister said that we cannot identify whether some people took a cut.  This is a nightmare for the people trying to run these organisations, which include Rehab, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Western Care Association, and the hospices in Cork, Dublin and Limerick.  Rehab employs approximately 10,000 people.  It is the job of the Minister to find solutions.  We have now analysed the problem over a long period.<\/p> <p> All of those organisations, particularly the hospices, have asked for meetings with the Minister and the Minister for Health.  There has been no reply.  They do not seem able to meet anybody.  I believe that all three speakers present here, on behalf of our respective parties, would ask the Minister if he could not sit down with these organisations.  He gave us many technical reasons for not acting and I appreciate that he did so, but can he not sit down and work out who is and who is not entitled to pay restoration?  The Minister said that some people did not take the cuts.  That is possibly true, but he can still make a declaration.<\/p> <p> Finally, on education and housing, we have nowhere near enough apprentices in training.  As we get the money together, we will have nobody to build the houses or the apartments.  Will the Minister please address that from a leadership management point of view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400022#X00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513259100,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I too am delighted to be able to contribute.  Like other speakers, I wonder what would have happened if we had the election nobody wanted but which almost arrived.  Where would it have left us in respect of this Bill?  It is being debated at half past the 11th hour - on the second-last day of this current session - as we head towards a new year.  I think it is imprudent and improper that it is being stuck in here at the end of session given the huge and important amount of money being made available for appropriations across all Departments.  This is not the right way to do business.<\/p>  <p>  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, made a promise during the talks.  The Minister was there and was listening to him.  He said that we would have to change because of the new situation arrived at after the election and the new scenario that had presented itself.  He said that the whole public service would have to change to match that.  I believe he was genuine, but we have not seen this change.  The wheels of State are still turning as if there had been no change and no election.  I am not attacking the officials but this whole system must change.<\/p>  <p>  We have the Business Committee, which the Ceann Comhairle does a fine job of chairing.  We worked very hard to set it up as a result of the work of the Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform.  On that committee, we do our best to deal with any legislation that comes forward.  I received an earful from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, a few minutes ago.  One would think I was in control of the Business Committee.  I am only one member representing our group.  I am not preventing his legislation passing Second Stage.   The Minister's comments were very unfair but I can deal with that when I am speaking on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017.  This kind of legislation comes through the committee and did so this morning.  We agreed on it but anything could happen.  The sky could fall in or the election could have happened.  Where would we have been then?  Would there be any money in any accounts to pay anybody in different Departments?  To use other parlance, we are sailing close to the wind.<\/p><p>The amounts involved here are staggering.  As the Minister of State said, in 2016 Ireland ranked sixth out of all OECD countries for <i>per capita<\/i>health care spend.  Given the scale of gross voted expenditure of an estimated &euro;14.8 billion in 2017, a key challenge is to ensure value for money to maximise the impact of the increased expenditure.  The health budget has increased every year since I was elected, apart from the years when there were very serious cutbacks, but the outcomes have got worse.  There are some very good outcomes when people get into the system, which all Members acknowledge, but there is chaos in terms of accident and emergency departments and waiting lists for simple operations on knees or hips or ophthalmic and cataract treatment.  My colleagues, Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Michael Collins, have organised for a busload of people to travel to Belfast this Saturday to get their cataracts treated on foot of an EU directive.  Some of those people have been waiting four or five years for treatment.  It took expos&eacute;s by RT&Eacute; and TV3 to get people to understand the sheer scale of the waiting lists.  The EU directive exists but we are told it could disappear if Brexit goes ahead in all its incarnations and the UK ceases to be part of the EU, which would be a tragedy for Ireland.  People have to organise the treatment themselves and most funding is organised through credit unions, which I thank.  The treatment must be paid for upfront but people will get the money back from a health budget.  I am told it will not come from the current budget and I would love to know from which one it comes.  There seems to be endless money available.  There was a response within five weeks.  Many people cannot afford the treatment.  I salute those Deputies for organising that endeavour.  Buses will also travel up to Belfast in January and February.  This is a great initiative and is made easier by the good motorway.  Those people are delighted that they will be able to read the newspaper and see their crops, their loved ones and so on.  They are nearly blind.  We are happy to appropriate money into health to allow for such ventures.<br\/><br\/>Members are aware of the expos&eacute; in regard to consultants who work very limited hours.  Many eminent consultants with whom I deal are very good but there are many, as was revealed, who conduct private business in public hospitals.  Barry Desmond of the Labour Party - I am not sure whether he is still alive but I hope he is - was a Minister when I was only a buachaill &oacute;g and fought against the practice of consultants in the 1960s and 1970s working in public hospitals and using State-provided equipment.  That should not have been allowed.  A vet, dentist or any other practitioner has to have his or her own equipment, surgery, X-ray machine and equipment.  Why should the State provide money for some consultants who earn enormous sums?  While such consultants generally treat people well from a professional and medical perspective, some of them believe they are mighty people and treat others with utter disdain.  At times, patients are barely permitted to talk to them.  Why should the State provide them with assistance?<br\/><br\/>The outcomes in health have become worse.  A line has been crossed.  As regards orthodontic treatment, there are teenage girls in Tipperary who want to go to secondary school and are embarrassed to be out in public but have to wait four or five years for treatment.  There are not enough psychologists available in the HSE.  There is no mental health service in Tipperary, which is one of the finest and biggest counties in Ireland and which has a significant population.  It has had no mental health services since A Vision for Change was implemented.  It should have been called A Vision for Horror.  People from south Tipperary and as far north as Thurles are expected to go to Kilkenny for treatment while people from north Tipperary are expected to go not to Limerick but, rather, to Ennis, where the mental health facilities are completely full and patients from Tipperary are not wanted.  There are no facilities for transport for business, which is very important, as Members know, in the context of a person suffering from depression or mental illness.  If a person has a psychotic episode, he or she ends up in the already vastly overcrowded accident and emergency department system.<br\/><br\/>We are coming up to the capital review of expenditure for the next period and more money will be thrown at hospitals without getting any meaningful outcomes.  The Minister yesterday announced that HIQA will now have powers to close hospitals.  Where will people go after hospitals are closed?  Where will people go for treatment if we shut any more hospitals that are overcrowded and bursting at the seams?  We can appropriate all that money and it is lovely to talk about the vast amount of money available and many good things are happening but there are also many bad things and much dysfunctionality and no accountability within the HSE.<br\/><br\/>Money is being thrown at the housing problem.  All Members know how many housing Ministers there have been in recent years.  Although it is Christmas and I do not want to be too hard on her, Deputy Burton will remember that when her colleague, Deputy Kelly, was housing Minister he promised to build skyscrapers to the moon that were going to be completed in weeks, not months.  We saw very little action in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400023#Y00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513259700,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Some 4,000 houses were opened up while Deputy Kelly was Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400024#Z00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1513259700,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I am surprised Deputy Burton did not mention that when she was speaking on the issue.  Deputy Kelly could not build a hen house in Toomevara or a dog house in Carrick-on-Suir and did not do so.  It was all spin and talk.  Members know of the Taoiseach's new spin unit.  Deputy Kelly did not need his own spin team but he still has it and the ego to go with it.  However, houses were not built while he was Minister.  There have been too many Ministers for housing, with five or six in recent years, and there has been no continuity while people are dying on streets all over our country.  Cork is affected, as is Clonmel, my home town in Tipperary.  I am contacted by homeless families every couple of days.  No progress is being made on housing although money is being thrown at it.  It is pointless to do so when the outcomes are no better.  We have lost the will, vision and capability to build social houses.  It was left to private developers for decades and all Members know where that got us.  It is now not profitable to build them.  It must be profitable.  I am neither in the pockets of nor a supporter of developers, but they need to be able to make some modicum of profit.<\/p>  <p>  Before and since the publication of the programme for Government, Members have called on the Government to address the issue of vacant shops and premises in the middle of towns which have become desolate and to recognise that they could be turned into living accommodation without development charges or fees for planning or change of use.  Some action in that regard was today announced by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  That would create a living town again and go some way towards solving the housing crisis.  I do not know when the Government will do simple things such as that.  It could instruct county managers to waive fees.  If it is worried about giving breaks to builders, the VAT incurred during construction could be returned to the people who want to buy or lease such premises and do them up and buy all the materials.  Such people would spend that money in towns and villages and improve the local economy in that way.  A vision of what needs to be done seems to have been totally lost, which is very sad.<\/p>  <p>  I will not address the issue of the Central Bank and the new chandeliers that have been installed there.  I thought that kind of morass was gone with the recession but it has crept back in because no action has been taken.  There has been no legislation to deal with bankers or to stop the Central Bank spending a scandalous amount of money on lighting.  It is time the lights were turned off on those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400024#Z00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1513259700,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the contributions of Deputies Calleary and Jonathan O'Brien and some of that of Deputy Burton but I have been updated on what was said.  Deputies Calleary and Jonathan O'Brien queried whether this is the correct way to handle such legislation.  This is how such legislation is always handled and it is done at this time of the year.  That is because it is only at this point in the year that the issue of any Supplementary Estimates is settled.  All Estimates for all Departments, including Supplementary Estimates, have been scrutinised by the relevant committees.  They have gone through committees and we are now seeking to give legal effect to the spending of that money this year and the passage of the Bill then allows the spending of money for next year, which is crucial.  It takes place now because it is only at this point in the parliamentary cycle that we are clear on the nature and magnitude of the Supplementary Estimates.  For example, any funding that may be required in the areas of housing and health can only be dealt with at this time.  It happens at this point every year.  Everything has already gone through the relevant committees.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge it is a very high level of spending.  In many areas, we are returning to the level of spending we had at other points in our history.  It would be great if Members, in particular Deputy Mattie McGrath, could give recognition to the very fine things that are happening in our country and which are enabled by the spending of this money.<\/p><p>In recent weeks, for example, we have seen the great success of young Irish students in numeracy and literacy.  We have also seen that life expectancy in Ireland has increased because of breakthroughs in how we handle ageing, heart disease and lifestyle changes.  These are just some examples of all the very positive things that have been enabled by successive Governments - obviously, I point to this one and that which preceded it - in spending money to try to make progress on the path taken by our State.<\/p> <p> This is not to say that we do not have difficulties; of course we do.  However, the acknowledgement that we have significant and severe difficulties should not come at the expense of failing to say that we are making progress in some areas, because we are doing so.  Yes, we have difficulties in respect of housing and our health service, but there is also the fact that housing output will increase next year.  The Government of which Deputy Mattie McGrath was a member allowed social housing to be delivered by the private sector.  When the private sector then completely collapsed, we did not have the capacity to deliver that housing.  We are now rebuilding that supply.  I see this, for example, on the northside of Dublin.  Last week, for example, I witnessed the launch of Broome Lodge, 80 new units of sheltered accommodation available in the heart of Dublin 7.  Similarly, we will start making progress tomorrow on St. Mary's Mansions on Railway Street and Foley Street, a housing project that has been crying out for support for a decade.  We all wish this could have happened sooner, but the work is under way and we are now putting a huge amount of resources into housing and into efforts to ensure we make progress on the commitment that everyone in this House has - and which the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, certainly has - to tackling this issue.<\/p> <p> Regarding health, it is a fact that amid many of the difficulties to which Deputies have referred, waiting lists in a number of key areas are beginning to decline.  It is also a fact that while the recent patient survey published by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, this week pointed to things we want to change, it also pointed to things that are happening in our hospitals and primary care centres that are good for patients and that deliver the kind of support and health care they need at vulnerable points in their lives.  We are seeking authorisation for a very large amount of money; the amount that would be authorised by the Bill is &euro;46.8 billion, which is an increase of almost 5% on the sum authorised in respect of the Appropriation Act 2016.  In recent years, we have increased expenditure by 15% to respond to the issues we have.  We have accompanied this through reform of our public services.

The amendment specifically provides for the inclusion in the Long Title of the Bill of a reference providing for the investigation into the performance of functions regarding institutes of technology, including the Dublin Institute of Technology.<\/p><p>This provision is comprehended in the function and governance of technological universities, TUs, as referenced in the Long Title of the Bill.  Amendment No. 2 is another technical amendment, providing for the inclusion in the Long Title of a reference providing for the investigation into the performance of its functions in respect of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and its three constituent schools of Celtic studies, cosmic physics and theoretical physics, and the National College of Art and Design.  Amendment No. 3 is a further technical amendment providing for the inclusion of references to the Acts governing the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and its three constituent schools and the National College of Art of Design.  The Institute for Advanced Studies Act 1940 and the National College of Art of Design Act 1971 are being amended to provide for the power of the Minister to appoint an investigator into any matter specified concerning the performance of the functions of those institutions.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 33 arises as a consequences of issues highlighted at the Committee of Public Accounts, which required reports and subsequent reviews, concerning the operation of several higher education institutions.  The committee's deliberations highlighted the necessity for more flexible investigative powers to be provided to the Minister for Education and Skills to deal with such matters.  This provision will enable any matter or concern relating to a technological university to be investigated and a draft report to be prepared by the investigator.  The report will be provided to the Minister, the Higher Education Authority and the governing body of the TU, as well as any person the investigator deems it necessary should receive the report or part of the report.  Having considered any representations made within a 28-day period, the investigator will finalise his or her report and furnish it to the Minister and the Higher Education Authority as soon as practicable thereafter.  The provision requires the co-operation of both leadership and staff, as well as contractors, consultants and advisers, with the investigator.  Specifically, the investigator shall be entitled at all reasonable times to enter a TU, institute of technology or other referenced publicly funded higher education institution on any matters regarding the performance of its functions and shall be afforded every facility by that body, including access to all records concerning the performance of its function.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 34 provides that the governing body of a technological university shall furnish to the Minister any information requested by the latter concerning the performance by the institution of its functions.  The Minister may provide any such information furnished to him or her to an investigator.  However, the Minister shall not be permitted to request information from a TU in regard to the specific matter being investigated during the period of the investigation, up to and including the furnishing of the final report by the investigator to the Minister.<\/p> <p> In order to provide consistency in respect of the various referenced institutions, a number of amendments which mirror amendment No. 34 are required.  Amendment No. 48 proposes to replace section 15 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992 to provide the same power to the Minister to appoint an investigator to examine the performance of its functions by the DIT.  Amendment No. 51, in the same vein, amends the Regional Technological Colleges Act 1992 to facilitate the same investigatory function in respect of the institutes of technology.  Again, provision is made, in amendments Nos. 49 and 52, such that the Minister shall not request information during the period beginning on the appointment of the investigator and ending with the furnishing of the final report.<\/p> <p> The power to appoint an investigator is likewise extended to include the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and its constituent schools of Celtic studies, cosmic physics and theoretical physics.  This is done by way of amendment No. 54, which inserts a new section 29A into the Institute for Advanced Studies Act 1940.  Amendment No. 55 specifies that the Minister may provide information furnished to him or her by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and its constituent schools to an investigator.  However, the amendment stipulates that the Minister shall not request information during the period beginning on the appointment of the investigator and ending with the final report.<\/p> <p> Finally, amendment No. 56 extends the power to appoint an investigator to the National College of Art and Design by way of the insertion of a new section 15A into the National College of Art and Design Act 1971.  Amendment No. 57 extends the power to the Minister to provide information furnished to him or her by the National College of Art and Design to an investigator.  Again, the amendment stipulates that the Minister shall not request information during the period beginning on the appointment of the investigator and ending with the delivery of the final report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400025#AA01500","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513260900,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I welcome these provisions.

In some cases, there was a great deal of defensiveness on the part of sector representatives when confronted with the concerns being expressed.

The best that the Higher Education Authority, HEA, can offer at the moment is to say that it does not envisage job losses.  This seems to be a rather slippery form of words.  It does not take a genius to work out that rationalisations in administration and academic staff could follow this proposed merger.  I ask the Minister a direct question.  The HEA has said that it does not envisage job losses but is the Minister prepared to be more precise and give a guarantee that there will not be job losses?  Is she prepared to deny to the union concerned that there will be job losses and will the Minister give a guarantee to the House and the workers in this regard?<\/p>  <p>  On the superannuation issue, the employee self-service, ESS, pension scheme is the lower tier pension scheme for education workers who were recruited after 2015.

I note that this is the scheme for new recruits under the arrangements as planned in the Bill.  It amounts to an endorsement of a two-tier system and discrimination.

For consistency right across the higher education sector, it is intended to provide for the power in relation to universities at a later stage.  The enactment of the Technological Universities Bill 2015 is a priority for the Government and I do not want to delay the passage of the Bill in any way.  I have, therefore, decided to proceed with the introduction of the investigative power into performance of functions across the institutes of technology and the technological university sector, and in respect of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and the National College of Art and Design.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry asked about jobs losses.  The whole concept behind us forming technological universities, TUs, is to improve the sector right across the State.  There have been problems with specific institutes of technology and by doing this, not only are we offering more to the student who is the most important person in these institutions, but I believe that jobs will be safer in strong, technological universities to which students will apply and in which they will want to finish their studies.  Currently we find that students are dropping out and there is no continuum of education across the sector.  In the technological universities, students will be able to do levels six through to ten.  We envisage that this will strengthen the technological universities and that by doing this, jobs will be preserved and saved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400027#CC00200","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1513261500,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I strongly criticise Deputy Barry for coming into the Chamber and throwing this red herring into the debate at the last minute.

One thing in the institutes of technology which has been partially resolved, particularly by the work of the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, in a constructive and lengthy contact and debate with the Department of Education and Skills.  Some people may have concerns about section 50(1)(b) and section 50(2) because they want reassurance and clarity about status.  This is because, in recent decades, there has been a shift in how staff are appointed to various positions within the third level sector.  This is not only in institutes of technology but also the universities.  Recently, there was a suggestion that in future, university presidents may have much higher salaries.  At the same time as the Government indicated it is favourably disposed to the new Garda Commissioner receiving an annual salary package of around &euro;250,000 annually, which is a lot of money to most people, there were indications that the heads of colleges and universities might similarly be in line for such salaries.  The Minister of State should clarify this.  I do not know what stage this proposal has reached.<\/p>  <p>  Many young people are at various stages of undertaking PhDs while others have recently been awarded PhDs.  Many find that they are being effectively being appointed at assistant lecturer level.  The salary that goes with being at assistant lecturer level is modest.  People would earn far more working in the information technology sector, in the commercial business sector, as accountants, lawyers or finance experts.  Many people want to pursue an academic career.  There is concern that in the transfer from one type of institution to another, there might be people whose terms and conditions are at risk.  There has been a creeping development, I suspect influenced by the UK, where some of the leadership in third level institutions have people on contract terms that do not equate to tenure for long periods and perhaps even over a lifetime, whereas tenure used to be the common experience in Irish third level institutions.  This could work out fine for people in some cases but it does not for others and it does not work fine for those who are among the 30-somethings who also need to buy a house and need status and confirmation of salary terms and conditions to be able to get a mortgage.  There is a question of status within the institution for those without tenure.  There has been a vast change internationally on the matter of status.  It also applies to ancillary staff.  I have often met people from the institutes of technology and the universities who might work in the library, for example, which is critically important especially in institutions where research is dominant.  Their terms and conditions are being changed as institutions evolve.  It is important to send a clear message.  The technological university development will be really good for institutes of technology.  It will allow them to grow and prosper and become more of a magnet for foreign direct investment into their local area.  They are very attractive to people who have qualified in trades who can then progress to become engineers, professional accountants or other professionals and go up the ladder of achievement, but it needs to be directed.<\/p>  <p>  Another thing which must be addressed are the complaints, which have come from as high a level as head of department, is that there has not been enough consultation with and information given to the senior staff in the institutions who are the leadership therein.  These are the people on whom the Minister of State will rely to develop and lead this vision.  I have seen people, whose achievements for their institutions and their students I really respect, query why they are not being included in a process.  The process seems to being run out of the offices of the presidents.  <\/p>  <p>  Many years ago, I was on the original steering committee for the Grangegorman project.  It was very difficult to explain the vision of the Dublin Institute of Technology being an institution with 20,000 students, for this city and country, that would open up career or academic progression, regardless of a person's background.  It would offer the kind of progression that exists in countries such as Germany and Austria, where someone can begin as an electrician and go right up the ladder to become head of engineering in the institution, whether it is a university or an institute of technology.  These heads of department, many of whom have made a similar progression and for whom I have the utmost respect, are saying that they are not sufficiently involved or consulted.<\/p>  <p>  On the other end, I could take the Minister of State to my constituency, or indeed her own, and introduce her to people who, having committed to a PhD and an academic career, find it extremely difficult to get an established post.  The Minister of State must speak on this to those two different sets of people who have only the best of ambition and intention to progress.  The Minister of State said that this was all about students.  People who have given their lives and are now heads of department, as well as those who are starting on a career to which they are totally committed, all need more information and contact from the Department and a greater indication of what is going to happen.  <\/p><p>I fought in Cabinet for the new Luas to stop at Grangegorman, which it now does, and this will transform not just the DIT, but the whole area.  Leadership is required from the Minister in the really important job she has to do.

We have a national framework for doctoral education which was launched in 2015.  The framework articulates nine principles for doctoral education in Ireland and has been endorsed by the Irish higher education institutions, as well as the main research funders.  Its aims are to facilitate consistent excellence in the quality of postgraduate education, to enable and encourage higher education institutions to work more closely in the delivery of an improved learner experience and outcome, and to maximise the employability of doctoral graduates across a broad range of employment sectors by ensuring that the acquisition of discipline-specific knowledge is complemented by the development of transferable skills to underpin the international standing of the Irish doctoral award.  In 2016, QQI commissioned an expert panel to report on quality assurance for research programmes.  We want the best for our doctoral programmes and we have set up two national negotiation forums with unions where issues can be raised.  We have strengthened postgraduate study for our doctoral students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400029#EE00900","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1513262700,"counter":428,"content":"<p>The issue is whether there will be job losses in the institutes of technology, specifically Cork and Tralee, but also more generally, on foot of this Bill and the merger into the Munster technical university.  Job losses could happen in different ways.  They could happen on day one as a result of the merger or they could happen down the road, such as later in year one or in year two.  The Minister was asked a straight question and, in the answer she gave, she quoted section 50 of the Bill, which seems to give a clear indication that there will not be job losses on day one.  We can put that in the bank, but then we must ask whether the way this could work out will lead to job losses down the road, and the Minister is far less clear in that regard.  On top of saying she hates to give guarantees, she said that, sometimes, courses change.  In that context, she is not able to give a guarantee about job losses.<\/p>  <p>  It does not take a rocket scientist to work out that courses will change on foot of this merger.  If there are two almost identical courses in college A and college B and all the students are grouped together from different locations with teleconferencing, it would lend itself to changes in the courses which take place.  Resources from one course could be freed up and both lecturing and administrative staff could be affected.  Incidentally, such a development, far from improving standards for students, would lower standards but that is not the main issue.  Notwithstanding the fact that the TUI has signed up to this, there are more than one or two TUI members who have questions and concerns about this and these concerns are genuine.  I do not think they will have been lessened in any way by the comments of the Minister because she seems to be saying that there is a guarantee for day one while, a little bit down the road, the picture is not so clear and no guarantees can be given.  For Solidarity, that is not good enough, even if it is good enough for the Government.  The issue in this debate is whether it is good enough for Fianna F&aacute;il.  Is Fianna F&aacute;il going to vote for the Bill on the basis of a somewhat half-hearted guarantee or is it not?

My question is on something that does not feature in the Bill and maybe we will come back to it in the new year so I will flag it for the Minister.<\/p><p>Does the Minister of State have concerns about what is happening to very talented people who are either completing their PhDs or in the middle of same and their capacity to get stable, recognised employment?  Section 50(1)(<i>b<\/i>) refers to a fixed term employee.  Does the Minister of State have data on the institutes of technology and other institutions as to how many staff working there over long periods lack full staff positions?  While they rightly have to run their own institutions, it has suited some college presidents to vary their budgets to have some people on full staff terms and conditions which others do not enjoy.  The Minister of State may well tell the House that this is not a feature of the Bill, but it is one of the issues she has to address as an office holder.  If she does not, many of these people, who are among the brightest and best, will end up leaving the country or going into other fields where their skills are recognised and remunerated.<br\/><br\/>The document from which the Minister of State read is a general one on how postgraduates are to be treated.  I do not even think that is being done, by the way, in some of our universities.  It does not apply either to how some women are being treated in our universities where their rate of promotion is significantly lower than that of men.  That has been addressed in part by the courts and in part by a number of other bodies.  These issues are really important for the quality of our third level institutions.  What is the Minister of State saying to staff who are in those positions and where tenure is weak or non-existent?  What about promotion by gender, where women are not numerically represented as well as men?  We have a lot of women staff in colleges and universities at the lower levels but they are not necessarily going up the promotion ranks.  Again, it means losing out on a lot of talent.  What are the Minister of State's thoughts on this important issue for the country as we progress?  Our third level sector is a major draw for foreign direct investment because of the calibre of those who have been educated and trained here.  Institutes of technology are vital to attracting more foreign direct investment to Tralee, Sligo and Mayo and as such we need clarity that the people employed in these institutions will get contracts.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State did not address the point I made about ancillary staff in libraries, laboratories, research centres, services and administration in colleges.  Is the Minister of State saying that what was traditionally understood as a transfer of undertakings operates at a 100% level for all of these people and not just for the academic staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400029#EE01400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513263300,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I accept what the Minister of State has said on section 50 and the guarantee she has given.

A very worrying example of where this can lead can be found in Institute of Technology, Tallaght, ITT, where the student union has been very effective.  For example, it recently led a successful campaign to defend a students' cr&egrave;che that was faced with closure as a result of cutbacks.  In recent weeks, ITT has made moves to cut the full-time student union secretary position, a position that plays an important role in terms of dealing with administrative, secretarial issues for the student union.  The institute of technology has just unilaterally cut that, which is a massive cut to the resources available to the student union and means that instead of being able to deal with the issues they are meant to be dealing with, the student union sabbatical officers are drowning in paperwork, which is quite a conscious decision by the institute of technology.  The cutting of the position undermines the ability of the student union to offer essential services to the student body and the result is unacceptable backlogs in services and essential facilities effectively being closed.  That student union is campaigning to maintain its independence and resources so that the institute of technology does not have the capacity to just cut and damage the ability of the student union to operate.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that situation if possible, to support the student union campaign to have that position restored and to endorse these amendments, which are vital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400032#HH00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1513264500,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I have met the student unions and I have to say that I am shocked by some of the stories I have heard about student unions not being recognised and colleges putting obstacles in their way.  I have heard that anecdotally about a number of colleges and I think that is very wrong.  However, I have explained to the student unions that I am not sure this legislation is the right place to place a definition of a student union.  I, along with Fianna F&aacute;il, am open to considering separate legislation on the recognition of student unions.  Obviously, a bit of work will have to go into that.  Perhaps somebody on the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills could look at it because a fair issue has been raised.  I worry that we are setting up recognition of a student union or legal rights in the definition of it here and I am not sure that would do it or would be good enough.  I see the point colleagues are making and I respect them but I think I will sit this one out today.  My commitment is definitely there and I have told the student unions that I will work with them to make sure that type of practice is changed.  The types of practice outlined by Deputy Paul Murphy today or the types of practice that other student unions have outlined would not be affected by this definition.  I am not denigrating anyone.  Deputies Paul Murphy and Funchion raised fair points.  If what Deputy Paul Murphy is saying is correct, that would be very wrong but this would not change it.  If that is happening, it must be changed and we should be working on that.  I will suggest to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills that we work on the fair points that have been raised but I would have thought that if this is accepted today, it will just delay the Bill.

We are going down a very dangerous path.  I accept that it does not solve all problems but student unions do have some recognition and this merely involves adding three or four more sentences to what is in the Bill.  I do not see how it would delay the Bill any further.  It is an amendment that is quite progressive and makes a lot of sense.  If we are looking at our education system and trying to make it somewhat progressive, we should be looking at representing students.  There was a lot of talk about the TUI and staff, and that is very important but we need to take the student voices into account.

The successful interaction of the student representative body with the technological university will be based on mutual co-operation to achieve the resolution of any particular issues.<\/p>  <p>  In seeking to amend the definition of student union to include reference to an independent body, the definition in Deputy Catherine Martin's amendment does not reference accountability for funding channelled to that body.

Work carried out in Scotland has been highlighted as a possible model.  I cannot accept Deputy Martin's definition of a student union because the current definition also includes the reference to other student representative bodies, which ensures the possibility of there being more than one student representative body being provided for.

I am also delighted that consensus was achieved on it in the Seanad, leaving very little work to be done in the D&aacute;il before it can be referred to the President for signature.  I commend Senator Mark Daly, Fianna F&aacute;il and members of the deaf community on the work that was put into achieving that consensus.  I particularly want to mention Grace Coyle, Senator Mark Daly's parliamentary assistant, for her dedication, perseverance and endless patience in seeing the Bill through to this point.  I also commend Deagl&aacute;n &Oacute; Briain, Jennifer O'Connell and my adviser, Gerry Maguire, for their amazing and professional work on the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned in the Seanad, the Government's approach to amending the Bill is to keep and strengthen the three key features that need to be in legislation.  Those are: to ensure the retention of the important recognition by the State of Irish Sign Language and that users have the right to use it; to place a duty on public bodies to provide Irish Sign Language interpretation at no cost to the user when access to statutory entitlements is sought by a person; and to provide a clear statutory right to use Irish Sign Language in court proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate for the House that, in response to concerns raised by the deaf community - all of whom present in the Gallery I welcome to the House for this very important debate - the commitments relating to Irish Sign Language in the national disability inclusion strategy I launched last July were strengthened.  In addition to providing for the extension of the Irish Sign Language remote interpretation service to evenings and weekends and supporting this legislation to ensure that all public bodies provide Irish Sign Language users with free interpretation when accessing or availing of their statutory services, we will ensure that the Sign Language Interpretation Service, SLIS, will be resourced to increase the number of trained sign language and deaf interpreters.  A quality assurance and registration scheme for interpreters, for whom ongoing professional training and development will be provided, will be established.  I am delighted to confirm that an allocation of &euro;327,000 in 2018 has been made available to SLIS via the Citizens Information Board for that work.<\/p>  <p>  Much work was put into improving the Bill in the Seanad and, as I said, there are very few amendments for the D&aacute;il to consider.  One substantive amendment to the Bill has been proposed following discussions between myself and Senator Mark Daly.  In regard to specific detail on the number of hours per annum, the Bill, as published, proposed that users of Irish Sign Language be provided with an annual allocation of interpretation for non-public sector purposes, to include GP visits and social and cultural activities.  That level of detail and prescription is not appropriate to primary legislation, which point was accepted by the Senator in negotiations.  I again thank him for his co-operation.  Although he agreed in the Seanad to the deletion of the provision, which is contained in section 7, that was on the basis that the issue would be further considered in the D&aacute;il.  I accept that sign language users suffer extreme social isolation.  That argument was put forward by the deaf community and the Senator and I accept it.  Provision of support so that sign language users can visit the GP and engage in social, cultural and other activities would be a humane and worthwhile initiative to combat that isolation and improve well-being and mental health.  However, that cannot be regulated through detailed prescription of annual numbers of hours in primary legislation as was originally proposed.  I am delighted to confirm that I have secured the agreement of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, for the provision, in principle, of funding to Irish Sign Language services in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The intention for 2018 is to develop guidelines as envisaged in amendment No. 15.  SLIS, working with its funder, the Citizens Information Board, will be tasked with scoping out how a model for such a scheme would operate and preparing draft guidelines for consideration and approval by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The intention, subject to the progress of that work, is to aim to trial an approach towards the end of 2018.  In that context, a sum of up to &euro;50,000 may be made available from within existing resources to meet any pilot project costs incurred towards the end of next year.  Following the pilot project, more detailed proposals and revised guidelines will be developed and they will inform future annual funding requirements, subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, in the normal way.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has examined the text of the amendment originally suggested by Senator Mark Daly and advised that it should be recast as per amendment No. 15.  The Senator and I engaged in further discussions and it is now an agreed amendment.  As agreement has been reached on an approach to funding, which is the remaining outstanding issue, and as it is a very real issue for the deaf community, I am happy to present the amendment by agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that a number of technical amendments should be made to the Bill, as passed by the Seanad.  They include: moving a regulation-making power adding new public bodies from definitions in section 2 to a substantive section of the Bill; a technical recasting of the regulations in respect of notice to be given by a user of Irish Sign Language seeking to avail of free interpretation services and ancillary matters in section 5; an internal reorganisation of the review of the Act in section 9; and changing the Title of the Bill to the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, which is crisper and more user-friendly.  Those amendments have been discussed and I hope we will be able to agree them on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  It is appropriate to reflect at this time of year on the significant progress that has been made on disability issues over the past 12 months.<\/p><p>The task force on personalised budgets, which I launched in 2016, will report to me shortly on a personalised budgets model, which will give people with disabilities more control in accessing health-funded personal social services, thereby giving them greater independence and choice in accessing services which best meet their individual needs.  The task force is an important part of the process of progressing the Government's objective to provide services and supports to people with disabilities that will enable them to have greater independence in accessing the services they choose and improve their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This is an important issue in the context of choice and equality for all citizens.<\/p> <p> In April of this year the Make Work Pay report was launched, and many its 24 recommendations already are being actively advanced by all Departments.  In some cases the Government has gone beyond the recommendations of the report in support of people with disabilities.  For example, the report identified transport as being critically important for people with disabilities who are considering returning to work.  On foot of this recommendation, it was decided that a person in receipt of a long-term disability payment may retain his or her free travel pass for five years.<\/p> <p> In budget 2018, I secured an increase in the allocation for disability services to &euro;1.763 billion, which is an increase from the allocation of &euro;1.688 billion in 2017.  As a result of my securing additional funding of &euro;92 million for disability services in 2017, this year saw the allocation of an additional &euro;10 million for the provision of services for 1,500 young people leaving school and rehabilitative training this year; the development of alternative respite models with &euro;1 million in targeted funding; the reconfiguration of residential services supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding and to be further supported by the service reform fund; and quality improvements to increase compliance with the national standards for residential services for children and adults with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400038#OO00400","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513268400,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I will share my time with Deputies O'Loughlin and Browne.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is delighted to support, and to have initiated, the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016.  This is a hugely significant day for the deaf community as this legislation will empower them by placing Irish Sign Language on a statutory footing.  It is a massive advance for their civil and human rights.  On enactment of the Bill, the State will recognise the right of Irish Sign Language users to use Irish Sign Language as their native language.  Designating Irish Sign Language as a native language will empower the deaf community by permitting the language to be used in legal proceedings.  It will also require the State to provide interpreting services for students who use Irish Sign Language.  Importantly, it will also require public bodies to provide Irish Sign Language users with free interpretation when availing of or seeking access to statutory entitlements and services.  This will make it easier for members of the deaf community to communicate with State institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was originally put together by Senator Mark Daly, working with the Irish Deaf Society, including members of the deaf community, some of whom were from my native county of Cork.  The Bill covers a wide range of topics, including recognition of Irish Sign Language and the rights of members of the deaf community.  Three times my party colleague, Senator Mark Daly, introduced Irish Sign Language legislation in the Seanad and now, on the third attempt, he has succeeded.  I commend his persistence.  I also acknowledge the work of Ms Grace Coyle, who works with Senator Daly.  She worked very hard on the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, the Bill was drawn up in collaboration with the Irish Deaf Society, which has campaigned for more than 30 years for recognition of Irish Sign Language as a major aspect of equality for deaf people in Irish society.  Irish Sign Language is the primary language of the deaf community in Ireland, and approximately 50,000 people communicate in the language.  It is the native language of the deaf community, a visual language with its own unique grammar, and it is a language not only of the hands but also of the face and the body.  Until now it has had no official status in Irish legislation, and it has been a crucial objective of the Irish Deaf Society to secure such recognition.  This week this goal will be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this legislation is just the start and not the end of this journey.  I particularly hope that official recognition of the language will transform the lives of deaf people, especially deaf children.  Before I was elected to this House, I worked as a special needs assistant, so I particularly welcome section 5 of the Bill, which provides for educational supports for deaf children.  In this, as in so much else, early intervention is critical.  There is no reason deaf children should not have the same educational outcomes as those of the rest of society, yet the proportion of deaf children who progress to higher education, for example, is half the proportion of the wider community.  I hope this Bill will be able to address such issues.  In the years ahead we must closely monitor and evaluate the progress of young deaf people and be prepared, if necessary, to come back here and improve this legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to work on core funding for the Irish Deaf Society, which does Trojan work.  I, too, am happy to commend the Bill to the House.  I compliment the Minister of State on his work and I reiterate my congratulations to the Irish Deaf Society, many members of which are in the Gallery, and to Senator Mark Daly for making this happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400039#PP00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1513268400,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I extend a warm welcome to all the members of the Irish Deaf Society who are in the Gallery with their families.  It is a very proud and significant day for all of them.  I also welcome the fact that we have an interpreter in the press gallery.  I was very frustrated one day when I had hoped to hold a meeting with Eddie Redmond of the Irish Deaf Society and the Houses of the Oireachtas Service could not and would not provide an interpreter.  I hope that will all change with this Bill.  Today is a very significant day after a very long campaign lasting more than 30 years, and I commend again the Irish Deaf Society and Eddie Redmond, Senator Mark Daly and the Minister of State on bringing the Bill to where it is today.  It has been the culmination of a very long struggle.<\/p>  <p>  The right to use one's own language is an important human right that each person in the Gallery should have and will have when this Bill is passed.  Purely because of a lack of communication over the years, the deaf community has suffered.  Deaf people have through the years become one of the most marginalised groups in society, facing barrier after barrier at every stage of their lives, preventing their full participation as equal citizens.  When we look back over the research, we see and must acknowledge that deaf people have faced higher unemployment rates, lower educational attainment, poorer health rates, higher risk of mental health issues and significantly decreased economic mobility.  Please God, this will end.  There will still be barriers and battles, but when the Bill is passed I hope life will be an awful lot easier for all of those in this community.<\/p>  <p>  What will legal status in respect of Irish Sign Language, ISL, achieve?  There are a number of reasons it is important for us to accord such status.  From what we can see, ISL users will have more legal rights, better access to public services through ISL, which is hugely important, better education for deaf children, better third level education and training for deaf adults and better interpreting quality and monitoring.  These are just five reasons the Bill is so incredibly important to all of those in the Gallery and those whom they represent.  There is no doubt but that the Bill, when passed, will make a positive and meaningful difference to the quality of life for Irish Sign Language users, both the 5,000 who use it constantly and the other 40,000 who use it as a means of communication.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill to the House and am proud to stand with colleagues in supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400039#PP00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513269000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of the deaf community who are in the Visitors Gallery for this historic occasion.

The Bill provides civil rights for the 50,000 members of the deaf community in Ireland and, crucially, places responsibility on the State to deliver those rights.<\/p>  <p>  From my experience as party spokesman on mental health, I welcome these provisions, which include an onus on the State to provide interpreters in all public services, including hospitals, as a means to enable members of the deaf community to gain the help they may need when suffering from poor mental health.  The provision to provide funds to support users of Irish Sign Language, ISL, in accessing social and cultural events is likewise particularly welcome.

There are approximately 5,000 deaf people in Ireland who use ISL daily.  In addition, approximately 40,000 hearing people use the language regularly or on occasion.  The right to use one's language is a human right.  Unfortunately, we in Ireland are accustomed to the mistreatment and lamentable decline of Gaeilge.  The failure to give official recognition to ISL before now is another example of the disgraceful treatment of our indigenous languages.  Irish Sign Language was formally recognised in the North of Ireland in 2004.  The Good Friday Agreement requires equal respect in both jurisdictions for all rights bestowed in either jurisdiction.  That equality will finally be in place for the Irish deaf community in this State with the passage of this legislation.  While we are on the topic of equality and language rights, I take the opportunity to record our support for those campaigning in the North for an Irish language Act, Acht na Gaeilge.<\/p>  <p>  In October last year, in my capacity as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I was honoured to launch a report fully endorsing the formal recognition of ISL.  During the course of our hearings on this issue, the committee heard of the extent to which the deaf community experiences exclusion and isolation through the lack of sign language provision.  One witness described that experience as one of \"extreme marginalisation\", extending from the personal level right through to interactions with key organs of State such as the education system, Courts Service, health service and the Oireachtas.  Those of us blessed with hearing take for granted the most simple of things like listening to music, hearing our telephones ring, watching television, accessing State services and communicating with our health providers.  We all recall the infamous Storm Ophelia, which hit our shores some weeks ago.  Those of us with the gift of hearing were provided with 24-hour news coverage of the storm's progress.  Every effort was made to keep us informed and safe, but the same consideration was not given to those in the deaf community.  It was only when contact was made with the national broadcaster to point out that the service did not cater for the needs of deaf people that an interpreter was finally provided.  This is just one recent example of how the deaf community is continually let down.  The introduction of statutory targets regarding the accessibility of TV programming, as provided for in the Bill, is very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  In my contribution at the launch of the justice committee's report, I made reference to a very sad chapter in the recent story of the deaf community in Ireland and those most seriously impacted among its number.  I dedicated the event, which took place in the Leinster House audiovisual room on 13 October 2016, to the memory of brothers Daniel and William McCarthy whose remains were discovered at their Millrose Estate home in Bluebell in west Dublin just weeks before the report's launch.  Their tragic passing exemplified the need for a formal recognition of Irish Sign Language.  The message from this Chamber today is that Daniel and William are still in our thoughts.<\/p>  <p>  The passing of this Bill will mean that deaf people in Ireland are finally able to access State services in their own language.  It will mean every public body having to devise and implement an action plan to promote the use of sign language within the organisation.  It will also permit the use of sign language within the courts.  In addition, the Bill advocates for the establishment of an Irish Sign Language council, which would regulate sign language interpreters and teachers.  All of these provisions will make a huge difference in the lives of many.  The legislation represents a massive step forward and I am delighted to have played my part, however small, in its coming into being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400040#QQ00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1513269000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire agus le gach a bh&iacute; p&aacute;irteach sa Bhille seo thabhairt chun cinn.

As on the previous occasion, I started my contribution in Irish to illustrate a specific point.  Irish is my native language.  It is a language of which I am very proud and which I have spoken since I was a child.  Despite the complaints I might have regarding the status, promotion and funding of the Irish language, it is officially recognised in the Constitution.  I have the right to use my native language in our courts and when engaging with public services.  While the manner in which that is done is not perfect and there are many flaws, I am aware that these are privileges that the deaf community in Ireland does not currently enjoy.  Users of Irish Sign Language do not enjoy those privileges in respect of what is their native language.  This Bill changes that and, as a result, it is welcome.<\/p> <p> I commend the Minister of State and Senator Mark Daly on their work in respect of the Bill.  I also commend Grace Coyle, the Senator's parliamentary assistant.  I worked with Grace in a newsagents many years ago.  It is a small world.  I also commend Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who made this Bill a priority at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, which brought forward the report.<\/p> <p> It is extraordinary that the campaign for the recognition of Irish Sign Language has taken so long.  It has been 30 years since the matter was first raised in the European Parliament by Eileen Lemass, a former MEP.  It is extraordinary that it has taken so long to reach this point.  The greatest congratulations of all are owed to those who were involved in campaigning, the many people who are in the Public Gallery tonight, the Irish Deaf Society and, specifically, the Cork Deaf Club, which was very active in canvassing me and all Deputies and Senators in Cork city and county.  There are many people in this institution who deserve to be commended on the passing of this vitally important legislation, but the greatest congratulations are due to the aforementioned groups for their perseverance.<\/p> <p> The legislation is important in terms of its symbolism and its recognition of the language.  It is also important in the context of its practical effect.  Deaf people have been marginalised in the areas of employment, education and opportunity.  It is essential that the legislation will now give equal opportunities to members of the deaf community in all those areas and that it will give practical effect to the recognition of the language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400040#QQ00400","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513269600,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I welcome those in the Public Gallery.  They are more than welcome.  I am sure this Bill is very important to them.  It is the result of years of campaign work and pressure from the deaf community.  They are the people who fight for resources for their community and for the recognition of the language and the culture.  The deaf community has experienced many years of discrimination and isolation.  The State's education system marginalises their language and this has resulted in social isolation of the community.  Members of the deaf community should be very proud of their campaign work and in their achievement of having Irish Sign Language recognised as a language.<\/p>  <p>  Solidarity-People Before Profit will support this Bill, but we also believe that there must be far stronger provision for Irish Sign Language as a full, official language of the State with legal obligations on those outside of the public sector also.  The deaf community will have to fight - as do other communities - for the resources to make this recognition a reality.  I am particularly happy to contribute to this debate because of Deaf Village Ireland on the Navan Road and the important role it plays in the life of the constituency I represent in Dublin West.  Deaf Village Ireland forms the boundary of the constituency and many people who are deaf live in the area and have links with the local community on the Navan Road.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Sign Language is indigenous to Ireland.  The language should be valued as part of the deaf community's culture and as Irish culture.  Irish Sign Language is used by 5,000 people in the State.  The actual figure is thought to be much higher as a result of the fact that family members and work colleagues also use it at some level.  Some estimates indicate that 20,000 to 50,000 people us the language.  In the 19th century it was the dominant view that sign language should be discouraged because it was believed to be a barrier to integration.  This was a mistaken belief.  People were forced to fit in to the education system rather than the education system fitting their needs.  It was an utterly backward idea.<\/p>  <p>  Knowledge of sign language in general, and of Irish Sign Language, is essential for interaction with wider society.  This interaction with education means that members of the deaf community often have lower literacy levels than the rest of society.  In that context, 80% of adults in the community have same literacy level as eight or nine year olds.  For the rest of society, the figure is 25%.  The resources are not available to the community to fund Irish Sign Language education for their families.  This means that members of the deaf community can often find it difficult to communicate with their own families and those closest to them.  One survey indicates that 71% of deaf people are unemployed.  They are fully capable of working productively but cannot hear, or have difficulty hearing, and use a different language.  It is also difficult to get interpreters.  There are approximately 60 to 70 interpreters in the State.  Their number must be greatly increased.  In Finland, there are 500 registered interpreters.  The deaf community now needs to fight for massive investment to bring about the appointment of teachers and interpreters.  Grown adults should not have to rely on family members to interpret for them.<\/p>  <p>  While Solidarity-People Before Profit welcomes the Bill as an achievement for the deaf community, we need to keep active to fight for resources.  The State has failed the Irish language and there are no legal obligations on private companies to use Irish, despite it being an official language of the State.  The same could happen with Irish Sign Language.  The deaf community has won this recognition but it will need to remain vigilant.  Solidarity-People Before Profit believes that Irish Sign Language should be more than recognised, it should be an official language of the State.  This would place the onus on the State to provide it and ensure that measures are carried through.  There should be education for Irish Sign Language in all primary schools, even if it is at a very basic level.  If there was a widespread knowledge of their language, it would open up the world of deaf people.  There should also be targets for the public service providers - especially those in the areas of health and education and the Garda - to have a certain number of people with the knowledge of Irish Sign Language.  A legal obligation should be placed on large private sector companies such as banks, supermarkets and utility companies to have a knowledge of Irish Sign Language among their staff.  If courses and training were available I believe this would be taken up enthusiastically by many workers.  It would break down many of the barriers faced by people who are deaf.<\/p>  <p>  With this Bill, there are important gains for the deaf community.  It comes in the context of many minorities, such as Travellers and the LGBT community, demanding their rights.  However, we need to go much further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400041#RR00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1513269600,"counter":525,"content":"<p>The word \"equality\" has been used a lot in political and public discourse lately.  This is a very positive development.  Obviously, the marriage equality referendum was an enormous step forward for the LGBTQ community.  Equality was the watchword.  We need to fight for equality because there has been so much inequality.  A host of groups in Irish society have been denied real equality as citizens of the Republic.  This has been true for women, for the LGBTQ community and, critically, for people with disabilities.  It is a matter of continued frustration for many Deputies that 11 years after agreeing to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Ireland has still not done so.  Members of the deaf community have fought for the recognition of sign language and for full equality as citizens for decades.<\/p><p>It is a shame on our society that, to date, we have failed to achieve that genuine equality.  It is a particular shame that during the period of austerity that deaf services and advocacy groups were victims of cuts, as were many other services for people with disabilities.  The struggle of the deaf community has finally paid off and today we are taking a significant step forward with this Bill.  Senator Mark Daly deserves commendation on that, but the greatest credit should go to the sign language and deaf community which has fought so long and hard for this recognition.  In a Chamber where we must often be critical and where we are often frustrated, it is good that we can celebrate a positive development and a step in the direction of equality. <\/p> <p> The measures in the Bill address critical areas where there has not been equality for the deaf community: recognition of Irish Sign Language as a distinct language and culture, the lack of full and equal access to education, the lack of resources to learn through sign language, lack of access to media communications because there is not enough sign language interpreting in the Irish media, more generally the access to public services, and the need to regulate sign language interpreters and make sure that we have sufficient interpreters in all areas of the public service, politics, media and critically in education.  These are all matters addressed in this Bill, and all are needed if we are to move towards equality.  These must all be backed up with resources, but having these things enshrined in law places a legal obligation on the Government, politicians and the State to ensure that recognition of equality.<\/p> <p> Deputy Coppinger's observation on the private sector is important.  This is a first step for the State and for public services to ensure access and equality, but it is something that needs to be extended across society so that the equality exists in all areas of employment and all engagements with employers and private sector actors along with the resources and services.<\/p> <p> I commend the sign language and deaf community.

I found the Irish Deaf Society's list of the ten main reasons that Irish Sign Language must be recognised by the State as a language of this country, which are as follows: there are 5,000 deaf people using ISL daily, and an additional 35,000 hearing people; for regular ISL users, it is an innate and integral part of their personality; ISL is the only natural and fully accessible language for deaf children - it does not hinder any ability to learn how to speak or listen; there is no national register of ISL interpreters and ISL teachers and furthermore there are no accreditation or monitoring systems; ISL has been in use for centuries despite repressive attempts to destroy the language; service providers such as Government bodies are not legally obliged to respect Irish Sign Language - they will translate information into English and Irish but rarely into ISL; the motion calling on the Government to recognise ISL has been passed by more than 40 local authorities; there is no automatic right for deaf people to have an ISL interpreter in the justice system; no deaf child can fully learn ISL, as not all teachers are fluent or even qualified in ISL; and there is no access for deaf people to emergency or helpline services in ISL.<\/p>  <p>  Tonight is a brilliant night for the deaf community to see this situation changed in legislation.  I commend Senator Mark Daly on this, but more importantly I ask the Ceann Comhairle to indulge us somewhat this evening.  Every now and then we can hear applause from the Gallery and it would be appropriate if we took a moment for the deaf community to applaud themselves because it was its campaigning work over the past 30 years that has brought this about.  Well done to all.<\/p>  <p>  We know what this Bill will initiate.  It will allow more access to public services and education.  The State will be obliged to provide interpreters in schools and in broadcasting and it will allow the deaf community to have interpreters in courts and the health services.  This is just a start and I hope that from now on we will have more resources for the deaf community to advance their rights, equality in the public and private sector and its absolute human right to have its own language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400042#SS00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1513270200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>It is nice to finish the year, almost, on a positive note.  Like everyone else, I am delighted to see this Bill before the House tonight.  There is no doubt that a huge number of people have campaigned on this issue for so long.  It was a great shame that it was voted down by the previous Administration.  There are over 70 million users of sign language worldwide and after this legislation is passed, Ireland will be among a small group of countries which have given legislative recognition to native sign language.  It makes an incredibly nice change for us to be at the forefront of something rather than dragging up the rear as we are so often.<\/p>  <p>  I also very much welcome the Minister of State's announcement about the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I urge that this happen as soon as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  There can be no doubt that this is an historic day.  I salute the work of Senator Mark Daly and members of the deaf community, although the issue is also bigger than the deaf community.  It is not only about the rights of the deaf community to access public services, which of course should be the case, but also the right of the hearing community to be able to interact with our brothers and sisters in the deaf community.  From that point of view, while we can bank this legislation here today, I make no apologies for exercising my prerogative as a legislator to put forward amendments to push this forward further.  I know it will not be dealt with today and that is absolutely fine, but on behalf of my friends who are deaf and others in the hearing community, the fact that the State is recognising Irish Sign Language today is great.  We will bank that and we will build on it because it is only the start of recognition for people from the deaf community.  <\/p>  <p>  I have some concerns because Irish Sign Language is a first language and we should be pronouncing that proudly.  It is not just a tool to access public services.  It is a first language and it is important that more emphasis be placed on that fact.  Deafness is not a disability, it is also a culture and ISL is a language and a vital part of that culture.  Most, but not all, deaf people use ISL as their first language.  That was not always the case as it was repressed in our school system a long time ago, which inflicted a great deal of damage and it was a wrong inflicted on deaf people.  The lack of recognition also had a negative effect in ingraining discrimination against deaf people.  We should proudly proclaim today that ISL is an indigenous language.  It is unique; it is not a second language to its users and it is not imposed on them by outside forces.  It was not invented by an authority or a Department or in a school curriculum, rather it was developed in a holistic fashion and it has evolved through use over generations, just like spoken languages.<\/p><p>It has a grammar, syntax, colloquialisms, dialects and, like all language, it is regulated by the unique culture and heritage of the geographic area from where it comes.  Sign languages cannot ever have an international set of visible signals that can be read universally.<\/p> <p> I was surprised by the title of the Bill, which is the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill, and I am glad the Minister is changing it as it is too narrow.  The whole country needs to recognise sign language and everybody, deaf and hearing, should recognise that Irish Sign Language, ISL, is a language.  As others have said, 5,000 deaf people in Ireland use it as well as hearing people, with a total of over 40,000 users.  We should encourage this and I have tabled amendments, though they have been disallowed, to require all the children in our education system to be exposed to ISL.  In this way, we can all communicate with each other as brothers and sisters, hearing and deaf.<\/p> <p> I have tabled another amendment which I will deal with later on.  I am a bit concerned about a narrow approach to ISL as a tool for social services and I made this point when we discussed the report of the justice committee last year.  Section 3(1) refers to the right to use Irish Sign Language as a person's native language and to the corresponding duty on all public bodies to provide ISL.  While the bodies have such a duty, the language exists regardless of this duty and we should recognise that, rather than confining the provisions to the question of access to services, though that is critically important.  It is necessary to ensure that adequate steps are taken to end the marginalisation experienced by members of the deaf community.  We, as hearing people, must step up and recognise that the language belongs to all of us and we should encourage other hearing people to learn and access it.  Having reached the historic stage of recognising ISL as a language, we need to build on that and ensure it is incorporated in our education system, our health system and all the services we provide.  The report published by the justice committee last year stressed the importance of a system of registration and regulation of ISL interpreters, deaf interpreters and ISL teachers and I am glad to see that this is in the Bill.  Hopefully, the Department of Education and Skills will also aim for this because it is key in moving this forward.<\/p> <p> I welcome the move and congratulate all those involved in this historic day when, at last, we give recognition to ISL.  Hopefully this is just the beginning of a process where the deaf community march forward and its members claim their right to equality as equal citizens of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400042#SS00300","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513270800,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I am delighted chun seas suas agus c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar son an Bhille sin.

I thank an tAire St&aacute;it, Deputy Finian McGrath, for coming here and taking part in such a good-spirited debate with the emphasis on granting a right to all people with this disability.  I hope it is passed unanimously, though I can see there are some amendments.  If it passes tonight it will not be before time.  P&aacute;draig Pearse once said that a nation was not a nation without its language and I agree with that.  There has been a shameful denial for a long time and it is shameful that we have not recognised ISL or provided the facilities for people who have issues with hearing or cannot hear.  I am sure some people in this House, including the Ceann Comhairle, have at times wished they could not hear me but sin sc&eacute;al eile.  It is nearly Christmas and I wish all Members, including the Ceann Comhairle, and all the staff a happy Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, Deputy Michael Collins and I support this Bill.  Everybody has spoken highly of the Bill and it is nice to hear unison, at least on one issue.  The right to use one's own language is a basic human right.  We give lip service to it at times and we are criticised for reports that are published in our national tongue but I make no apology for doing that.  I compliment the Irish Deaf Society and its members for lobbying and fighting the good fight to get to this stage.  They should not have had to fight for these things but sadly, there is not equality in every area.  The deaf community feels a great sense of isolation and neglect.  Some of us occasionally get problems with our hearing but we have no idea what it is like to hear and exchange words.  I thank the interpreters who work with the society for their engagement.  This is about a right and they have been discriminated against.  I hope that once the legislation is passed there will be no further delays or prevarication but that it is expeditiously put through.  The resources also have to be put with it so that the necessary supports can be given to the people who need them.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Clare Daly said, all children, at least those in national schools, should be encouraged and able to understand ISL.  The Irish language was beaten into us in my time at school, meaning we rejected it, but it is important that all children, from na&iacute;onra&iacute; and play-schools to first, second and third level, should be better able to understand our friends and colleagues, as well as acknowledge their rights.  It is also important that all public bodies implement the legislation and assist with ISL.  They should have a cohort among their staff who can deal with deaf people efficiently because the latter deserve that.  We should not just talk about this and pass the Bill - we must ensure the money is put behind it so that it is embraced by everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400043#TT00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1513270800,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill this evening.  I commend Senator Mark Daly and his colleagues in the Seanad on bringing this Bill forward.  I welcome the Irish Deaf Society, whose members have come in large numbers.  It is a great day for them and they deserve this moment.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to support this Bill, which gives legal recognition for its use in legal proceedings and requires the provision of interpretation into Irish Sign Language by public bodies, as well as providing for related matters.  As it stands, Irish Sign Language has no official status in Irish legislation and a vital aim of the Irish Deaf Society is to get recognition and to uphold the status of ISL in Ireland, particularly in education where its acquisition as a first language by deaf children is vital.  This Bill aims to grant that official recognition, which will benefit 5,000 deaf people in Ireland who use Irish Sign Language as their first language.<\/p><p>In general, approximately 40,000 people will communicate in ISL with their deaf family members and friends.  It is important that our society does its best to integrate all people and communities, be they deaf, blind or other.  The Bill is a vital way to do that.  It is unfortunate it has taken as long as it has to get to where it is today.  I see exactly what pain and suffering these people have experienced, which is very similar to what people who have cataracts suffer.  Approximately 8,000 people, most of them elderly, have been left without a simple cataract procedure that can be carried out in this country.  As I said on Leaders' Questions the other day, the State would rather see them go blind than resolve this issue.  That is why there are buses leaving west Cork on Friday for Belfast to seek a solution.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, myself and our colleagues in the Rural Independent Group have done a great deal of work in that regard.<\/p> <p> Irish Sign Language is the indigenous language of the deaf community in Ireland and it is different from the British and American sign languages.  Ireland has it own unique language, culture and traditions which are recognised all over the world.  As such, I cannot see how we could fail to give our own sign language the same recognition.  Public bodies such as the HSE, educational institutions and the State broadcasters have a responsibility to provide for their deaf customers.  To date, these customers have felt neglected where services have failed to meet their needs by providing a competent person to communicate through the medium of Irish Sign Language.  Irish Sign Language should be taught in national schools to allow those with Down's syndrome, autism and other non-verbal children to communicate and feel accepted in our society as opposed to lost in their own worlds.  In the USA, staff of McDonald's have learned sign language so that the deaf community would feel welcome and normal, as they are.  How many stroke victims lose the ability to speak?  If sign language were more widely taught in the community, locked-in syndrome for the victims of stroke would not be an issue.  If sign language were taught, it would help doctors, hospitals and the wider community.  If we can teach foreign languages to communicate with those of other nationalities, why can we not teach sign language to help our own?  I ask Members to imagine being unable to hear or communicate for a day.  It is a lot easier to learn when a child is young and learning feels natural.<\/p> <p> Many children are deprived of access to sign language and risk never reaching their full potential.  I know of a child in Cork who was discovered, soon after being born, not to have the vital auditory nerves which transmit sound information from the middle ear to the brain.  It made him one of a handful of deaf children who cannot benefit from any kind of hearing aid technology.  His family was met with a multitude of barriers but his father knew he was a bright boy and that as a family they needed to knock down the barriers to achieving his potential.  The family switched their focus squarely to learning Irish Sign Language and their son was sent to a school 80 km away, which distance demonstrates, again, the other barriers that confront deaf people.  The family did not give up on their son's right to achieve his potential.  I hope the Government is in a position to accept this necessary legislation to progress the integration of the Irish deaf community in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400043#TT00300","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513271400,"counter":533,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an Comhaontas Glas f&iacute;or sh&aacute;sta tac&iacute;ocht a thabhairt leis an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Ar dt&uacute;s, I acknowledge and welcome the members of the Irish deaf community to the Gallery, including their interpreters and supporters who have campaigned so long for the recognition of Irish Sign Language.  I commend Senator Mark Daly, who is with us this evening, on introducing the Bill in the Seanad.  He took the initiative, ran with it and secured the support necessary to bring it before the D&aacute;il.  This is an important Bill and today is an important day on which we take a crucial step to recognise the basic right to communicate of more than 5,000 members of the Irish deaf community.  As a councillor in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown in 2015, I received a letter from a constituent called Wendy Murray who was then the chairperson of the Irish Deaf Society.  She asked me to table a motion before the council and I was delighted to do so.  It received unanimous support.  As has happened here today, each councillor spoke loudly and clearly in turn in support of the motion.  It is a privilege to stand in the House and speak to the Bill which seeks to make that recognition a reality.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Deaf Society has stated that the failure to recognise the Irish Sign Language by the State puts the health and well-being of deaf people at risk as they often struggle to avail of vital health and educational services.  Many of the private and public services so many of us take for granted are inaccessible to deaf people.  It is essential that public bodies be required to provide the necessary interpretive services for deaf people.  I cannot even begin to contemplate how frustrating it must be for a person who is deaf to engage with a public body.  I refer to simple, daily acts I take for granted like contacting a local authority or departmental office which becomes increasingly frustrating for those who are deaf because there is no one on the other side of the counter who can interpret or communicate with them.  Irish Sign Language gives thousands of Irish people the invaluable gift of communication.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Deaf Society has campaigned for more than 30 years to have Irish Sign Language officially recognised to ensure equality for deaf people.  All those people want is to secure the right to full participation as citizens.  The availability of services and information, as guaranteed by law, is the only means to ensure that deaf people have the opportunity to access and participate fully in society.  I welcome the Bill, which seeks to ensure that members of the deaf community can participate fully as citizens by legally guaranteeing the right to access information in what is their first, and for so many, only language.  The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, is happy to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400044#UU00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1513271400,"counter":534,"content":"<p>At the outset, I would like to communicate something in Irish Sign Language; congratulations to the Irish Deaf Society.  This is a wonderful day for everyone in the Public Gallery and it has not come a moment too soon.  The Irish Deaf Society's members and their families have been campaigning for this day for 30 years.  I welcome the fact that we are now at the point of ensuring that ISL finally takes its place as a fully recognised language in Ireland.  I commend Senator Mark Daly and the Minister of State for ensuring that we have got to this point.  Senator Daly has been working with the deaf community over several years and to finally get to this day is a wonderful achievement.  Irish Sign Language is the native language of the Irish deaf community and it is used by the majority of members of that community and their families and friends.  Articles 21 and 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities note the importance of recognition and the need for states to facilitate the learning of sign language and the promotion of the linguistic identity of the deaf community.  Recognition is an important step towards the realisation by wider society that ISL is not a tool used to overcome a disability but is rather an integral part of the unique linguistic and cultural identity shared by the deaf community.<\/p>  <p>  I am probably the only member of the Oireachtas who holds a diploma for teachers of the deaf.  I am fully recognised officially as qualified to teach the deaf but that is not really the case.  I qualified many years ago and long before I came into the House, having done the official diploma for teachers of the deaf in UCD.  Incredibly, there was no element whatsoever of sign language in the training course. <\/p><p>When I started teaching in the school for the deaf, St. Joseph's in Cabra, corporal punishment had been recently outlawed.  Up to then, however, children in such schools were slapped if they were caught signing.  During my time at the school, which is not 100 years ago, there were notices all over the school telling the students they would be fined if they were caught signing.  That was an incredibly backward attitude to what is a native language for our deaf community.  I call it \"backward\" at this point with the benefit of hindsight.  The thinking in those days was very different.  There was a sense that if we concentrated on oralism deaf people would learn to speak and communicate orally and that if people started using signs they would never become oral.  Of course, that was to misunderstand the situation entirely.  The more enlightened thinking that it was about multiple communication arrived more recently, in the 1980s and 1990s.<\/p> <p> It also took a long time for people to recognise Irish Sign Language officially, as opposed to Signed English.  When progress started to be made in the late 1980s and 1990s on signing and as signing became more accepted in society generally, people tended to speak about Signed English.  Of course, that is not what deaf people use.  Deaf people use their native language of Irish Sign Language.  It is an important distinction. <\/p> <p> I am not satisfied that there is sufficient emphasis in this legislation on ensuring that teachers are adequately trained.  Currently, there is no existing training course for teachers of the deaf.  Most training is done in Manchester and Birmingham.  There is no reason we could not have a training course in this country again.  There is also no reason for not insisting on upskilling inservice courses in Irish Sign Language for teachers who currently working with the deaf.  That is important.<\/p> <p> The Bill proposes to establish training opportunities organised by the Department of Education and Skills for parents, people working with deaf people, guardians and siblings.  That is most important.  The lack of provision of signing is an invisible but significant barrier to accessing basic State services.  The national disability inclusion strategy for 2017 to 2021 includes commitments to extend the remote interpretation service and the establishment of quality assurance and registration.  However, we must go further than what is provided for in the Bill.  Take the example of access to medical care.  The stresses of accessing care in a medical situation are significant so it is important that interpreting services are available for that in the same way as they are available for court appearances.  We are very under-resourced at present with regard to the provision of signing and ISL interpreters.  We must take a significant step forward by significantly increasing those numbers.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I warmly welcome the Bill.  It is a testament to the tireless campaigning by the deaf community over many years.  It is a positive step forward but it is only the first step.  I hope it represents a move towards continued engagement with the deaf community as equal citizens and ongoing development of ISL throughout the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400044#UU00300","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513272000,"counter":536,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy, for that valuable insight.

I thank the Irish deaf community for its outstanding work and effort in pursuit of this agenda over many years.  In particular, I thank Senator Mark Daly, who has been tenacious and meticulous in advancing this legislation.  Indeed, last year I met Senator Mark Daly, the representatives of the deaf community and those who were advising on the Bill to try and chart a pathway forward and to make it clear that we resolutely supported this.<\/p>  <p>  The cultural impact of the passing of this legislation on public bodies and institutions will be profound.  The important point of this legislation is not just the legal provision but the cultural change it will usher forward.  I recall visiting a primary school in Cork, St. Columba's in Douglas, where many children with hearing impairment were educated.  They were amalgamated with a mainstream school.  It was wonderful that every child in the school had sign language.  That is the type of template one should aspire to have.  It was done with great ease and dignity.  That cultural impact is very important.<\/p>  <p>  The interpretation dimension of the legislation is critical.  It highlights the importance of training for those who can become good quality interpreters.  That is an essential component of the Bill and I welcome it.  I also welcome the review section.  When we pass the legislation it is important that we can reflect in a timely manner on how it is being implemented to ensure it is having practical benefits and that it witnesses improvements and advancements in sign language and in terms of training, interpretation and utilisation both in our courts and by public bodies, so it becomes a habitual occurrence and not something that must be continually sought.  I introduced the Education Act 1998 and Irish Sign Language is referenced in that Act, so I am conscious of the need for full implementation.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate everybody involved.

I value their suggestions and ideas.  I also value the debate about equality and on citizens of the State demanding and getting equality.<\/p>  <p>  Two matters struck me.  First, Deputy Clare Daly used the words \"bank\" and \"build\".  We must bank on this legislation but there is much building to be done in the future as well with regard to putting in place services for the deaf community.  I accept that argument.  What Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said was also important.  He congratulated and commended, saying \"well done\" to everybody.  Everybody refers to all of my colleagues across the House and the members of the deaf community, who worked together, and particularly Senator Mark Daly.  It was difficult.  There were difficult negotiations and a couple of rows, but we got over them in the interests of the deaf community.  However, to return to the issue at hand, we must bank and build.<\/p>  <p>  Another matter arose during the debate.  I am delighted the Government has decided to proceed with the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This Bill is part of that process.  We are putting in place legislation.  The precise timetable and sequence of events for the ratification will become clearer.  We will bring the detailed process back to the Government and the formal process will begin early in the new year.  A motion must be passed by the D&aacute;il under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, which states, \"The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann\".  I appreciate the support today and I would also appreciate the support of the House when that motion comes before the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Members for their suggestions.  This is an important civil rights issue involving the right to have the Irish Sign Language recognised officially.  The rights of citizens are very important but there must be services to support those rights.  The debate today is part of that process.<\/p><p>The &euro;10 million in extra money allocated in recent days for respite care was another part of the process.

I do not know if somebody has been engaged in mischief over the past number of days or what has been going on in terms of the reaction to me tabling amendments to the Bill.  I am not sure who started it or where it started.  However, there was a suggestion that some civil servants had a problem with us tabling amendments.  I am fully aware of the detailed work that went on behind the scenes through the offices of Senator Mark Daly, representatives of the deaf community and civil servants in preparing the Bill.  That is their democratic right.  They had a very keen and diligent input into the process.  It is our democratic right and responsibility, as Deputies in the House, to use the democratic methods we have to table amendments to improve legislation if we think we can do that.  There was never any chance that the tabling of these amendments would scupper or undermine anything or take from the glory of Senator Mark Daly or anybody else.  Their purpose was simply to highlight a number of issues we felt needed to be highlighted.  I make absolutely no apologies for that.  <\/p><p>While recognising the rights of everybody in this process, I acknowledge the rights of everybody outside this process, including the deaf community, who were not at those talks, and the hearing community.  This is an issue for everybody.  If we are serious about it, we will all take responsibility for it.  This amendment is a very simple one dealing with section 3(1) of the Bill which states, &quot;The State recognises the right of Irish Sign Language users to use Irish Sign Language as their native language and the corresponding duty on all public bodies to provide Irish Sign Language...&quot;.  It is very important that is accommodated but my amendment seeks to recognise that ISL is more than that.  It is not just a vehicle for accessing information; it is a vehicle in its own right and cultural recognition needs to be established.  Instead of stating &quot;corresponding duty&quot; just for the sake of it, I am suggesting the words &quot;which is an indigenous language in its own right used by a sizeable minority in the State&quot; and the duty would be on all public bodies to provide ISL.  It puts it in its important cultural context.  That is why we have moved the amendment.  This issue is bigger than just access to services.  <\/p><p>As my other amendments have been ruled out of order and I will not take time later on, I will mention the suggestion that was made to me by one of the ushers on the way in to the Chamber.  There is a very good sign language programme running in Trinity College at the moment and some of my staff have signed up to do the course in the new year.  It is very good.  One of the ushers suggested that the ushers in the House and Members should be encouraged and funded to take up that course in order to provide the types of services the deaf community deserves.

At the same time, we are legislators and when it comes to finalising legislation it is important that everybody is given a hearing on it.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Daly would strengthen the Bill.  I do not see any reason the Minister of State would not accept the wording.  It makes a statement of fact about ISL being an indigenous language in its own right which is used by a sizeable minority in the State.  It is important to state that fact.  It strengthens it and recognises it further, not just as a native language but as an indigenous language used by a great number of people.  It is not just a small minority thing.  It is a welcome proposal.  I am concerned that there has been a lot of tick-tacking between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il on this to the point where they seem to be excluding other people from having an input into this important Bill.

Three of Deputy Daly's amendments were ruled out of order on the advice of the people who normally process these things.  They were ruled out of order because they were considered to be a potential charge on the Exchequer.  There is a constitutional prohibition on legislators other than members of the Government proposing anything that imposes a charge on the Exchequer.  I am not aware of anything untoward, exceptional, different or extraordinary in how these matters were dealt with.

The recognition of Irish Sign Language as a unique language in its own accord is a very important advance.  I would intrinsically support the amendment in that regard.  In my constituency office in Wexford I share premises with the People's College, which runs a number of courses.  One of the best-attended courses is in Irish Sign Language, both beginners and more advanced.  All of us need to pay more attention to it to ensure that people who are deaf can participate fully in all State services, including in communicating with Members of the Oireachtas in our constituency settings.<\/p> <p> I will not be discordant in my contribution.  I hope that what is intended in this amendment can be accepted.

My points were in no way a reflection of any decision by the Ceann Comhairle's office or the ruling out of order; I understand fully how that process works and I fully accept it.  It was more to do with the fact that because there has been so much dedicated and hands-on work behind the scenes in preparation for bringing the Bill here, between representatives of the deaf community and the Civil Service, there may have been a feeling that anybody else who made suggestions outside that was not to be welcomed.  I reiterate the points Deputy Shortall made: our job, as legislators, is to try to improve legislation where we see fit.  We, the members of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, have been trying to push this and are keen to see it through.<\/p>  <p>  I will not repeat the points.  It is self-evident to me.  I raised this point when we discussed a report from the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality last year.  Public bodies have a duty to provide Irish Sign Language, but the language exists regardless of that duty.  That should be recognised as such without being directly linked to a service approach.  They are two separate things and they should be two separate sentences; that is all I am seeking to do.  They are statements of fact and not superfluous at all.  We do not treat other languages in such narrow terms.  We do not connect the use of Irish or English with accessing public services.  We automatically understand that people have a right to use those languages in their own right.  That is all the amendment seeks to do.<\/p>  <p>  As discussed in the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, the point is to ensure that adequate steps are taken to end the extreme marginalisation of people in the deaf community.  That is a responsibility for us in the hearing community who were not necessarily involved in the backroom talks on this.  I echo the points made by my colleagues.  I think it is a point of fact and can be contained.  I do not see what the problem is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400048#YY00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1513273800,"counter":585,"content":"<p>Before the Minister of State comes in, I remind the House that by order of the House in seven minutes I may be putting one question, which would be my first time to do so.

I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  I spoke about this Bill for approximately 15 minutes last night.  It will have a big effect on rural Ireland.  I do not think the Minister realises what rural Ireland is about and what it means.  This drink-driving Bill will have an unnecessary effect on the everyday lives of people in small rural areas.  There is no need for this.  The existing legislation is strong enough.  The Minister does not seem to take that on board.  He lives in a big urban area in Dublin.  He does not realise how people in rural Ireland live, the problems they face every day or what their situations are.<\/p>  <p>  My party introduced mandatory testing and supported the legislation that decreased the alcohol limits.  Our limits are some of the lowest in Europe, so why are we trying to do more?  They are some of the lowest in Europe so we have already led the way.  Why is the Minister trying to go further and make ordinary people suffer more?  The latest proposal from the Minister is to introduce automatic disqualification for three months for those driving with a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml.  This offence is currently punishable with three penalty points, provided the driver is not a learner or professional driver and has not previously been found guilty of the same offence.  As I said last night, the legislation is already in place to control this but it needs to be implemented.  That is the point I am trying to get across to the Minister.  These draconian measures he is introducing will make the situation worse and make the penalties more severe.  He is forgetting about ordinary people who are trying to live ordinary lives in rural communities.  He is upsetting the whole social fabric of those communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is portraying this as a catch-all Bill that will prevent more people from drinking and driving.  Our party does not condone drink-driving.  I said that last night.  Nor are we prisoners of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, as the Minister has incorrectly alleged.  I also said that last night.  I am a rural Deputy and standing up for my people in Carlow-Kilkenny does not mean that I am representing the vintners.  I am not; I am representing the people who voted for and elected me.  It is important to think about that aspect.<\/p>  <p>  There needs to be stronger enforcement of existing laws, as well as an examination of ways to address the full range of causes of road deaths.  This was highlighted by a recent \"Prime Time\" programme, which found that the current legislation governing drink driving is not enforced consistently.  That was proven on a programme on RT&Eacute; on Monday night last.  I hope the Minister saw it.  I saw the programme and I took a lot of comfort from it.  There is a huge body of road legislation dating back to 1961 that contains a number of anomalies and inconsistencies.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, both committed to consolidating this legislation during their respective terms as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This was never achieved, however.  In the interim, there continue to be huge disparities in the penalties that apply to drink-driving offences in court.  It says everything about the Minister's real approach to road safety that he has taken more than half a year to commence provisions relating to learner drivers following their successful passage by the D&aacute;il last year.  If the Minister was serious about protecting road users, this would simply not have been the case.<\/p>  <p>  Research confirms that drivers with a blood alcohol limit of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml make up a very small portion of the number of fatal collisions.  This is specified in the Fatal Collisions 2008-2012 report of the Road Safety Authority.  Just 4.6% of cases involved this level of alcohol.  In half of the cases in which alcohol was cited as a contributory factor, the drivers had blood alcohol levels of more than 200 mg per 100 ml, four times the legal limit.<\/p>  <p>  I can read all I like and I can refer to all the statistics all I like.  All I am telling the Minister is that rural Ireland is exceptional.  I come from rural Ireland and I represent rural people.  The Minister does not see the difference.  He lives in Dublin and does not see the problems in rural Ireland.  I ask him to reconsider this Bill and to consider from where we come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400051#BBB00200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1513275300,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Ireland is an unusual country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400051#BBB00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1513275300,"counter":635,"content":"<p>On a point of order, we need a quorum.

To do so is indefensible.  No Member would try to defend such behaviour because that would be unfair to those who may suffer because of it.  It is positive that a practice that was commonplace is no longer so.<\/p> <p> There are very many issues regarding what is at stake, how society is organised in Ireland and how we legislate.  As regards housing, Ireland differs from most countries in Europe in terms of one-off housing.  It was a bad idea to allow one-off housing all over the country.  Many Members may disagree with me in that regard.  The argument is often made that if one is born on a farm, one should be allowed to build on that land.  I have no problem with that, provided that the new build is constructed near the existing house.  Allowing sites in the middle of nowhere to be sold on the open market to whoever could afford to buy them was poor planning and had huge environmental implications.<\/p> <p> I remember asking the former Minister for the Environment, Phil Hogan, how many of the septic tanks in Ireland the Department was going to check for compliance.  There was a big furore over septic tanks at the time and much concern about the impact faulty tanks were having on the water table.  It took me about ten minutes to get an answer out of him.  He eventually told me that it was going to check approximately 8% of the septic tanks in the country.  I asked him how many septic tanks in Wexford he thought were operating properly and within the rules.   He said that the soil is good in Wexford and septic tanks work well there.  I told him he was wrong and that although the land in Wexford is good for many purposes, it is not good for percolation.  Half the septic tanks in Wexford are contaminating the water table and a link between contaminated water and cancer is not unproven.  It is a huge problem in Ireland but the Government is not dealing with it.  I have checked the rate at which inspections are being carried out in Wexford.  At the current rate, it will take almost 200 years to inspect all septic tanks.  Faulty tanks will keep poisoning the water table.  It is strange with what issues we become obsessed.<\/p> <p> Another outcome of one-off housing is that it would be almost impossible to provide a good level of public transport to all houses in Ireland.  That could not be done because houses are all over the place.  We do not have a good public transport system anyway.  Although small improvements are being made, huge problems remain.  I live in a village of several houses in the countryside.  I could not leave and return to that village on a Friday or Saturday night using public transport.  I accept that it would be difficult to provide that but, given that I live in a village rather than an isolated house, it should be done.  In most countries in Europe, if one's home is in a cluster of houses or a village, one can travel to and from it using public transport.  However, that cannot be done in Ireland.  That will not change in the short term.  I am not saying that the Minister should aim to ensure every small village in rural Ireland be serviced by public transport, even on a 20 hour basis, because that is not feasible.  However, we must change our attitude to rural Ireland.<\/p> <p> There has never been much State investment in indigenous industry.  We have taken the lazy approach and been happy for foreign direct investment to provide most manufacturing jobs.  Agriculture is a very good indigenous industry but we do not compare well with any European country in terms of manufacturing, although we would in terms of foreign direct investment.  There was a time when the Government was able to ask a company coming to Ireland if it would be interested in setting up in a particular area and could suggest a suitable place.  However, for a long time nobody has been able to tell foreign companies where they should set up.  If the proposed location is not within an hour of Dublin Airport, companies are not very interested.  The country is becoming more centralised in Dublin and the surrounding areas while the countryside is more and more neglected.  There are fewer jobs available in the countryside and young people who grow up there move to a city as soon as possible in order to find employment.  That means that it is harder for banks and post offices to remain open in small towns and small shops are struggling.  The State has immense potential to make a difference in those areas.<\/p> <p> A targeted and proactive approach by the Government would make a big difference.  It should tackle the fact that rural Ireland is dying and try to change it.  It should help every village in Ireland to flourish, not just cities and big towns.  It should create a situation whereby young people would be able to remain in the area in which they grow up, which is not currently the case.  Ireland is not the only country to have these problems but there has been a rapid erosion of rural Ireland over the past 20 years.  I am very familiar with some small villages in northern Italy that have taken a different approach.<\/p><p>In one small village with which I am very familiar there is a real local authority.  It is called a <i>comune<\/i>.  It has some real power to run the local area.  It runs the schools, a health service, the libraries, the refuse services and the water services.  It organises community festivals.  Of the income tax paid in the region, it is allowed to take a certain percentage in order to pay for the work it does.  This is regional power.  We do not have it.  There is a local authority in Wexford but it is powerless and totally dependent on central government to do everything.  It waits for handouts from central government.  It used to receive motor tax revenue; I do not think it does any more.  All it gets now is the commercial rates revenue, to the best of my knowledge.  The local authority works out at the start of the year how much money it needs to keep running for the year and it works backwards to calculate the level at which it will set the rates for the year, despite the fact that about a third of those who have to pay commercial rates are either struggling or failing to pay them.  It does not make sense.  Rates in Ireland are ridiculously high.  It is difficult to run a small business in this country.  I know several people running small businesses, and it is not easy to make ends meet doing so.  We have even built the buildings for some of the people who run huge businesses, foreign direct investment companies coming here, we have put in the infrastructure and we have given them grants to come here.  More often than not, we charge them very little tax.  However, for an individual trying to start a small business in rural Ireland there is very little State help.  Someone I know very well was trying to start a small industry in Wexford in the past year and a half.  I inquired here with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation whether grants were available to help someone start up and was told there were.  The person trying to start the industry looked into them and found them so prohibitive and restrictive that it did not make any sense even to sign up-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400051#BBB00600","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513276500,"counter":640,"content":"<p>What does this have to do with the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400053#DDD00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1513276500,"counter":641,"content":"<p>-----to seek Government help because it did not materialise into anything worthwhile and actually placed restrictions on the individual as to how he would start his company and run it for the first few years.  There is not enough help for indigenous industry in Ireland.  If there were, it would be good for small communities.  It would be good for small communities if we changed our mind about local government.  We all know that local government has been problematic, but we told them they were not working very well and that there was a lot of poor practice going on and we took even more of their powers away from them.  We took more and more.  We took more of their revenue-raising independence.  We have watered down the local authority to such a degree that we do not actually have local authorities any more; we have local administration that is dependent on central government for a handout in order to make ends meet.  It would make a huge difference if we had real local government.  It could be a huge benefit.  Since local authorities did not perform well and were disappointing much of the time, instead of minimising them and stripping them of authority and finance, we should have fixed them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400053#DDD00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1513276500,"counter":642,"content":"<p>This is a road traffic Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400053#DDD00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1513276500,"counter":643,"content":"<p>It is all related.<\/p>  <p>  I live in rural Ireland.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle refers to traffic.  If a village is on the wane, it is not attractive for any transport company to service it.  If there is no transport in or out of it, no one can go anywhere.  Are we just going to carry on as if this will work itself out or is it possible we might get a Government that will some day say that things could be different and better organised and that there is a better way of approaching the way in which the State treats rural Ireland.  There is a better way but it will require different thinking.<\/p>  <p>  If I were back building, I would build in Dublin, which is where I was building before, because that is where the work is.  I do not blame people for coming to Dublin to make a living because this is where a living is made.  The N11 is getting busy every morning again because there is no work in Wexford and we still have over 15% unemployment.  I listen to Ministers here tell me weekly that the national figure has fallen under 6%.  I am sorry, but it is still over 15% in Wexford.  The N11 is getting busy again with people having to drive up and down every day for work in Dublin.  The idea that they might find accommodation in Dublin while working up here during the week was a runner in the past but is a non-runner now.  It is out of the question because we have a housing crisis and rental costs have gone off the Richter scale because they are unregulated.  We do not regulate the rental market or the way in which we supply housing, and there is a price to be paid for this.  We talk about addressing climate issues, yet we are clogging up the roads because we will not create work in places such as Wexford and we are forcing the people in Wexford to travel to Dublin, 160 km from where I live, to find work.  They cannot afford accommodation in Dublin so they drive up and down every day.  This is not great for the environment.  In 2007, at the height of the boom, there were 50% more Wexford people working outside of the county than in it, and we are going back there.  More and more people are leaving the county again and having to go to Dublin.  There is a serious lack of joined-up thinking in the Government's approach to rural Ireland, and that is a fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400053#DDD00500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1513276500,"counter":644,"content":"<p>Bogaimid ar aghaidh anois go dt&iacute; Fianna F&aacute;il.

The record of the Minister's predecessors in office, going back to the late Seamus Brennan and, subsequently, Noel Dempsey, shows what was achieved in this area by my party in government.  In 2001, we introduced the penalty points system and, in 2005, mandatory alcohol road tests.  The Road Safety Authority was established by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2006 and, three years later, it rolled out the installation of safety cameras.  In 2010, we introduced the graduated driver licensing system.  Our record in this area is strong and I acknowledge the Minister's effort, in bringing forward these proposals, to build on it.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is specific in its purpose, namely, to introduce a regime of automatic disqualification of three months for drivers found to have a blood alcohol level of 50 mg to 80 mg per 100 ml.  It is worth emphasising the point, because there seems to be some misunderstanding in this regard, that it is already illegal to drive with a blood alcohol level of 50 mg or more.  What is at issue here is the penalty which applies to that offence.  When the Minister introduced the Bill in the House, he said it was about saving lives.  In fact, as well as seeking to prevent road fatalities, we need to reduce the incidence of serious, life-changing injuries.  It behoves us all to be as honest as we can be in this debate and to address the proposals in view of the evidence available to us.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things that struck me when I was researching this issue is that there is no standard international practice in this area.  Different countries have a whole range of different policies on what is and is not appropriate.  It is difficult to find scientific evidence that indicates clearly the point at which driving is impaired.  A blood alcohol level of 0% is well defined and measurable, but beyond that point things are less clear.  Why, for example, have we chosen 50 mg as the threshold when some countries have lower levels?  I had expected more of that type of detail and background information from the Minister as he progressed these proposals.<\/p>  <p>  In his opening statement on Second Stage, the Minister outlined the dramatic improvements in road safety since the 1990s.  In 1997, for instance, there were 472 road fatalities in the State.  Twenty years later, that number looks to be more than halved for this year.  The figure is still too high, but the various policies that have been implemented have improved road safety significantly.  The Minister went on to say that between 2012 and 2016, 3,000 fixed-penalty notices were issued to drink-drivers in the 50 mg to 80 mg category.  In the five-year period from 2008 to 2012, he indicated, 35 people died in collisions who had an alcohol level between 21 mg and 80 mg, of whom 16 had a level of 50 mg or higher.  I do not understand why the Minister chose that period to illustrate the numbers.  It was right in the middle of this period that the law changed, which meant there were three years where the cut-off was 80 mg and two years where it was 50 mg.  That causes confusion rather than adding clarity.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated that moving from the current penalty regime to one of automatic disqualification will give clearer direction and a more severe disincentive, which will encourage more people not to drink and drive.  The reality, however, is that of the more than 8,000 people who were breathalysed and failed the test in 2016, 93% had a blood alcohol reading above 80 mg, which already incurs disqualification.  That is my real concern with this Bill.  I do not want to see a false hope put out there that these provisions will dramatically improve the situation.  In fact, we are way behind the curve in what we should be doing.<\/p>  <p>  I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister last March on the issue of road safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400054#EEE02500","speaker":"1298"}]
