It may be of assistance to the committee if I say at the outset that so far as the macro story is concerned, without agreeing with every  conclusion or every detail, in general I accept the broad thrust of the official reports prepared by Messrs Honohan, Regling and Watson and Nyberg, as well as the views ... most of the views anyway put forward by Dr. Donal Donovan and Professor Anton Murphy.<\/p>  <p>  Irish banks, by and large, avoided the mistakes that wrought havoc in the balance sheets of American, continental European and British banks where credit derivatives and CDOs did the damage.  Unfortunately, Irish banks made mistakes of their own, principally by excessive lending for residential and commercial development and these mistakes became exposed at the same time as international money markets shut up shop in September 2008.<\/p>  <p>  AIB lent too much to individual developers, put too much faith in cross-collateralisation, too much faith in the large net worth of individual developers.  We didn't do enough syndication or selling down of loans, and, in addition, we relied excessively on risk models that proved inadequate to the cataclysmic events of '09 ... '08 and '09.<\/p>  <p>  On 5 March last, the Minister for Finance and the current CEO of AIB, Mr. Duffy, made the very welcome announcement that AIB is on course to repay the total investment made by the State in the bank.<\/p>  <p>  The great recession of 2008, the worst the world had seen for 80 years, didn't start in Ireland or in the Irish banks, but there's no doubt that there were decisions made in AIB which made things worse than they need have been for citizens, for employees and for shareholders.  I wish to express my sincere regret for my part in those events, and to renew the apology which I made at the AIB AGM in 2009.<\/p>  <p>  In analysing what went wrong at AIB, I should point out that I resigned from the board in June 2009 and my perspective is, therefore, largely limited to information that became available before my departure - I haven't worked there for the last six years - and may to that extent, be incomplete. <\/p>  <p>  A country's banking system has been described as the nervous system of the economy, and in that sense the largest indigenous bank was never going to separate itself from the dominant economic activity of the society in which it functioned.  In the years leading up to 2008, a principal engine of economic growth in Ireland was property and construction.  It created a lot of jobs in connected trades and professions, paid lots of taxes, was encouraged by the State and the banks were fully involved in it.

Local authorities collected over &euro;3 billion through development contributions imposed as part of planning permissions between '99 and 2008.<\/p> <p>It's perfectly clear in retrospect that the appetite for risk was excessive and the lending strategy of AIB in respect of property was too expansive.  That's not actually how it appeared at the time.  In 2007, for instance, there was a strong national consensus widely confirmed by international commentators that Ireland was on a track of rapid sustainable expansion and development, and a good example is provided by the statements made at the launch of the national development plan in 2007.  Just one detail from it: it was planned to spend &euro;70 million a day every day for seven years on infrastructure with full employment, net inward migration, low debt-to-GDP ratio, budget surplus and buoyant tax revenue, and lots of civil servants were about to move out of Dublin.  Martin Wolf, who has been described as the most respected financial columnist, expressed the view in June 2007 that the possibility of huge calamities being generated by financial markets looked remote.  The IMF, in its financial stability report in 2006, expressed the view that risk dispersion as now organised in banks was less - made banking failures less likely.  And of course, the reverse turned out to be the case.<\/p> <p>  In viewings with the benefit of hindsight, looking back now, it seems to me that a great deal of the issue in Ireland comes back to the question of whether at a certain stage a correction that was coming was going to arrive in the form of a so-called soft or hard landing.  I think that's central to the errors.  The OECD, the EU, the IMF, the ECB, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the ESRI, the great majority of published economists in Ireland and abroad, although not all, the risk section of AIB and the board of AIB all favour the consensus of the soft landing and the consensus, of course, was entirely wrong.  <\/p> <p>  There's a striking example or expression, I suppose, of this consensus comes from the OECD report published on Irish banks in April 2008.  And I think the date is important because most of the loans ... nearly all the loans would have been made by then.  And the OECD said, having looked at the Irish banks, the Irish banks were profitable and well-capitalised and provide a buffer against a future downturn.  It's easy and certainly tempting to dismiss everything that went on in 2007 as irrational exuberance, but I actually think that there were - although this is not a popular thing to say - some policies, some justifications for the policy at the time, some rational justifications, and I want to briefly mention three of them.  The first was the calculated demand for housing in Ireland, the second was the reassuring effect of Basel II, as it's called, and the third was reliance on risk modelling in banks.<\/p> <p> There was hard statistical information which indicated that Ireland needed more housing.  One of the things AIB did was get independent economists to come and talk to the board every year or so, and a distinguished independent economist in the middle of 2007 brought a paper to the board, which pointed out that of a selected group of European countries, Poland was below us, but Ireland was next lowest on the list in terms of dwellings per 1,000 citizens.  Poland was 330 about, and we were about 370.  And then Estonia, Holland, UK, were all well above us, and Denmark, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain were all over 100 dwellings per 1,000 citizens ahead of us.  They were all over 470; we were at 370.  The second feature is Ireland has, as you're undoubtedly aware, a very unusual demographic history in the last century.  The peak birthrate in most western European countries was in the '60s; people stopped having large families.  The peak year in Ireland is 1980, so there were large groups of children born in the late 70s and early 80s and the 1980 crop will be 35 this year.  So there's the feeling that there was this group of citizens coming into the ... what I would call the house purchasing age, and we took that on board.  Those are the two things I want to say about housing demand, and I suppose the fact that there is now emerging something of a housing shortage in Dublin, certainly in some urban areas, suggests that this wasn't entirely irrational.<\/p> <p> I don't want to say much about Basel II; it was promoted with banks by the Bank for International Settlements in Zurich, reinforced by the CRD, the Capital Requirements Directive.  Its purpose was to ensure that banks had adequate capital.  We bought into it heavily and expensively, &euro;200 million between engaging experts and consultants and installing the systems in AIB.<\/p> <p>It went live at the start of 2008 and frankly it wasn't much good to us when the trouble came.  Part of Basel, a large part of Basel is to do with mathematical risk modelling, I remember we had to hire maths PhDs and so on to help us with this.  There was a fraud in the American operation of AIB in 2002, a man called Rusnak stole a lot of money, and immediately after that, every regulator from Washington to Warsaw crawled over AIB and, we got the services in conjunction with the Irish regulator, of a man called  Gene Ludwig, who had been a bank supervisor in the States and he investigated us up and down.  One of his recommendations was that we needed to set up a world-class risk management system and that we needed a world-class player to head it up and we duly engaged undoubtedly distinguished and experienced risk specialists from JP Morgan in New York at a very high salary.  I think ultimately 200 people came into the risk section.  At the same time, on foot of the same recommendations, we got a group internal auditor from outside Irish banking, the individual in question had been director of audit for risk and finance in Barclays Bank, then gone to work for the Italian regulator for a short while and then was engaged by AIB.  A third initiative at the time that I was involved in, was setting up a whistleblowing system.  There's a not-for-profit in the United Kingdom called Public Concern at Work, and it will act as a facilitator, and this was published to staff; they could ring up there and their messages would come only to my office and they could preserve their anonymity if they wanted to.<\/p> <p> Stress testing was done, installed, and in April '07 we had a stress test that looked at what would happen if things went wrong.  There were two stresses; a plausible stress and an extreme shock test.  The extreme shock test wrote down, for instance, unzoned land by about 60%, wrote down residential by 30% and I have the various figures if you need them ... but it went for a one in 25 year downturn and of course that wasn't enough.  The stress test just didn't avail when we got a one in 100 year event.  We didn't pay sufficient attention to the fact that the stress machinery didn't cater for that event and there was what I'd call an intellectual failure, for which I have to take my part of the blame, to envisage that if there was a serious property downturn in Ireland, a really serious one, and if at the same time there was a worldwide contraction of demand so that Irish businesses started doing badly, you started having unemployment and redundancy ... and at the same time as those two things, that the wholesale money markets closed up that we'd have a very serious crisis on our hands.  When Lehman's failed on 15 September 2008, that in effect is what happened. <\/p> <p> I want to say something briefly Chairman, if I can, about 2009 and what it was like.  Now it's painful, it's not long ago but it's possible, in the collapsing of the historical perspective, to forget just how bad things got say from the December of 2008.  In the autumn of 2008, the Department of Finance had estimated tax revenue for 2009 at &euro;43 billion and the outturn was &euro;33 billion.  They'd also estimated the contraction in GDP in Ireland at 1%, a 1% drop in GDP, and the outturn was 11.3% for 2009, ten times worse than the prediction.  In December 2008, a range of international banks were, this was unheard of before, downgraded.  That included Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley.  Anglo was nationalised in January 2009 and just as an indicator of how the general population felt, how public confidence had just gone at that stage, new car registrations in January '09 were 65% down on the previous year.  Irish banks were downgraded in February by Fitch and then in the spring, AIB and Bank of Ireland had to get help from the Government on capitalisation. <\/p> <p> Now you can ask the question why did everyone get it so wrong?  I think it's very hard to get it right, that economic forecasting is less reliable and more complicated than people think.  Credit has to be given to Professor Morgan Kelly, he detected the bubble but even he said he thought the downswing in prices in real terms would take eight or nine years.  He also expressed the view that the Irish banks were well capitalised.  I'd like to say something briefly about the accounting standards that applied at the time.  After the dotcom bubble, where accounting standards had given rise to alleged opacity in the accounts of public companies, IAS 39 was introduced.<\/p> <p>It prevented banks, in very simple terms, doing what was called cross-cyclical provisioning: putting something away in the good years to save you the trouble in the bad years.  It also had another effect.  It insisted that certain parts of a bank book had to be marked to market, and I don't think the people who designed it ever envisioned there'd be a day when there wouldn't be a market.  So you were now marking to market when there was no market and getting extraordinarily low values for assets.  And there's ... the best description of this - which I think is a key dynamic of the crisis - the best description of this that I've found is in the so-called EU high level group chaired by Jacques de Larosi&egrave;re ... Mr. Nyberg was a member, Sir Callum McCarthy and the great and good of European financial regulation.  It's a bit turgid but starting at paragraph 33, if I can read you into the record what they said.  It is about five or six sentences, Chairman, if you'll indulge me:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Financial institutions understandably tried to dispose of assets once they realised that they had overstretched their leverage, thus lowering market prices for these assets.  Regulatory requirements (accounting rules and capital requirements) helped trigger a negative feed-back loop amplified by major impacts in the credit markets ... Financial institutions, required to value their trading book according to mark-to-market principles, (which pushed up profits and reserves during the bull-run) were required to write down the assets in their balance sheet as markets deleveraged.  Already excessively leveraged, they were required to either sell further assets to maintain capital levels, or to reduce their loan volume.  &quot;Fire sales&quot; made by one financial institution in turn forced all ... financial institutions holding similar assets to mark the value of [those] assets down &quot;to market&quot; ... What was initially a liquidity problem rapidly, for a number of institutions, turned into a solvency problem.<\/blockquote>I would like, Chairman, to say something now about the milieu in which Irish banks functioned before the crisis.  Analysts and large shareholders, pension funds and stockbrokers were always interested in earnings per share and particularly where your earnings per share was going up as much as your peers.  If you were going up as much as your peers that was fine but if you weren't, then your share price would drop and that meant your capacity to raise money would drop, your capacity to expand would drop, vulnerability to takeover would increase.  Governor Honan in his report in 2011 adverted to that dynamic.  The other issue was Anglo being held up to us as an exemplar and you'll all be aware of that.  Commentators in Ireland and abroad repeatedly said: &quot;Anglo is the best bank.  Why can't you be more like Anglo?&quot;  It was determined by one international consultancy to be the best bank of its size in the world.  It was the darling not just of the Irish but of European stock exchanges generally.  And I had customers saying &quot;Why can't you be like Anglo?  Why are you always asking for more?  Yourself and Bank of Ireland give slow responses and you ask for paperwork&quot;, and things like that.  I think we tried in some way not to be drawn into the wake but inevitably we were, I think, in some respects.  Professor Honohan described the effect of this sort of competition in a memorable statement before he was the Governor.  He spoke to an economic conference in Dubrovnik in June 2009.  This is what he said: &quot;Competitive pressure on the leading banks to protect market share came especially from reckless expansion [from] one bank, Anglo-Irish (whose market share among Irish controlled retail banks jumped from 3 per cent to 18 per cent in a decade&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Can I say something briefly then about the regulator?  We had a perfectly professional relationship, mostly between executives and the Central Bank and the regulator.  I would meet the head once or twice a year maybe.  We invited the CEO and chairman of the regulator to come to an AIB board meeting and they accepted that invitation.  I know there has been a lot of criticism of the regulator and that is not my business.  I am wary of sporting analogies in a serious matter such as this but I did look at ... one of the witnesses that I did not to get a chance to look at was Professor Alan Ahern and he was in this room on 4 March.  And he was asked by one of the members here what was needed at that time and he said what was needed was a more intrusive regulator - someone who behaved like a referee in a football match.  And it strikes me, having reflected on it since, that that's apposite, that it's instructive ... that if you've a referee in a football match which is highly competitive - and Irish banking was enormously competitive at the time - and the referee does not blow the whistle much, then the more aggressive team tends to prosper and other people can get injured.<\/p> <p>Just to say one more thing about the bubble.  No bank could stop a bubble.  If, through some amazing piece of insight or wisdom which we certainly didn't have, AIB had decided on some day during this period to close up for loans and say, &quot;No more loans.  We're not lending anymore&quot;, it would have damaged the bank at the time but not as much as the crash did.  But, all of our customers who were claimants for loans would have been met within the following week by our competitors with glee, the competition was so fierce.  So, the point I make is that no bank could stop a bubble inflating; only authorities can do that.  <br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the night of the bank guarantee decision on 29 or 30 September 2008.  The committee are in possession of three separate near contemporary records which I made of the events of that night.  The main one is, of course, a seven page note, not perfect I'm afraid, but which I dictated a few days after the events of that night and which I've given to the committee.  There is also much shorter paragraphs in a memo that I sent to the CA two days later just as a couple of paragraphs that recites my recollection of what went on at the night and also a letter of complaint to another chairman of another bank which has a couple of paragraphs again about my recollection of the night.  <br\/><br\/>On Sunday, 28 September 2008 - this was a Sunday evening - AIB directors heard from the CEO at a board meeting at 6 o'clock that the word from the authorities was that two financial institutions in Ireland were likely to fail, the timescale was unknown and that a limited guarantee would be put in place for the remainder of the banks.  I furnished you in my supplemental statement a quote from the AIB minute: <blockquote>The purpose of the meeting of the 29th September which the representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland requested with the Government was to discuss the dramatically deteriorating international situation, the apparently dire staits in which Anglo found itself and the possible repercussions of Anglo's imminent collapse for Bank of Ireland and AIB.  We learned that Anglo could not open the next morning and had run out of liquidity.  The banks expressed the view that Anglo and Irish Nationwide needed to be decisively dealt with in some way by the State and then [and I emphasise the &quot;then&quot;] for a guarantee to be provided for the remaining banks to protect the surviving banks against the turmoil which would inevitably follow from an Irish bank being either liquidated or nationalised.  <\/blockquote>The Governor of the Central Bank stated during the meeting, in the presence of the Government representatives, that it would be disorderly, or ... and I remember this expression, &quot;or there could be a fumble if Anglo were dealt with mid-week&quot;, so what was needed, the Governor said, was for AIB and Bank of Ireland to try and provide &euro;5 billion each in liquidity to support Anglo until the coming weekend.  <br\/><br\/>Most of the evening was spent in efforts by Bank of Ireland and AIB to assemble enough liquidity to keep Anglo going until the weekend.  That effort was successful and, by morning, &euro;10 billion in liquidity, in excess of our own liquidity, half provided by Bank of Ireland and half by ourselves, had been assembled with its repayment within seven days guaranteed by the Government.  I want to emphasise that AIB's representatives were not involved in discussing or the making of the decision that was ultimately made.  The so-called &quot;blanket guarantee&quot; to include six banks, including Nationwide and Anglo, was not sought by or discussed with AIB.  I make no complaint about that.  I simply record the fact.  The representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland were not present in the room where the decision makers were for most of the evening, perfectly proper as well.  I first learned that Anglo and Irish Nationwide had been guaranteed along with the other four banks from the media early the next morning.  I acknowledge that the Government was faced with very difficult decisions on 29 September, which had to be made very urgently and I am not privy to the information or advice which was available to the Government on that evening.  Two days after the guarantee, I sent a note to the CEO of AIB which included the following, and this perhaps is the most encapsulated confirmation of what I think went on: <blockquote>Our name and reputation has been damaged by our perceived role in asking for the guarantee.  We have maintained silence on the fact that what we asked for was that Anglo and Nationwide, what brought us all down, be taken out of the market and then for a guarantee to be put in place.  What we did not ask for, and I underlined that in the original, was that Anglo and Nationwide should be boosted and baked into the system going forward.  <\/blockquote>The significance of the getting to the weekend, referred to by the Governor, is that at the weekend, the worldwide stock markets are closed for about two days, I think 51 hours, whereas during the week, worldwide stock markets are only closed at night for about three hours, between Japan ... between US closing and Japan opening.  Just ... finally, Chairman, to say about other options, very briefly, during that week other options, Fortis was rescued by the governments of Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands using ELA and I think that option was discussed briefly by Senator MacSharry with Professor Lane at this inquiry on 21 January.<\/p> <p>Later that week, or maybe at the start of the following week, the Bank of England made a secret loan of Stg&pound;63 billion to solve the allegedly critical liquidity issues at Halifax Bank of Scotland and RBS and that wasn't announced publicly until Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, said it to a Treasury select committee in November the following year.  Since then, like many other countries, Ireland has enacted special legislation to deal with bank resolution, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 and the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, and they obviously provide much more options for the sort of events that  occurred on the that night.   Those are my opening remarks, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300004#C01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429746600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Gleeson, and just to say your full statement will be published as part of the proceedings and that should be online some time this morning, and thank you very much for condensing that because that facilitates us in our proceedings this morning and I will be asking both members and yourself to be concise in the engagements today.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Gleeson, can you explain to the committee how AIB, which is a bank which has a history going back, I think to 1825, long before the foundation of the Irish State, a bank that was considered for ... over that period as a traditional conserving banking model, ended up during your period as chairperson being guaranteed by the Irish State and, ultimately, 99.8% owned by the Irish public?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300009#H00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429746600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Well, Chairman, I have tried to do something of that explanation in my opening remarks and I won't repeat what I said there but the bank was divided into five divisions.  We had an operation in the United States, in Poland and in the UK and then in Ireland it was divided into what is called capital markets and then Republic of Ireland, which is what people would know as the traditional bank that you've described.<\/p>  <p>  Four of those divisions, by and large, came through reasonably intact through the crisis.  Republic of Ireland, unfortunately, became embroiled in property lending which in retrospect ran out of control, was too expansive, was not controlled by the risk models.  I suppose it's fair to say that we had, and this is not an excuse, but it is an explanation ... some of the things that I am saying today may sound like excuses, I'm not making any excuses.  I am trying to assist the committee by explaining how it seemed at the time.  We had installed this enormously expensive ... the best personnel system of controlling risk and I think that directors thought that - and it was advertised -  as a means of measuring, monitoring and managing risk and we just had excessive faith in it.  Allied to that, we went too far with individual developers.  The AIB philosophy at the time, and for years before, was \"stick with your customer\".  Try and make sure they don't go anywhere else, because we had, as you said, plenty of customers and you have to remember that big developers were often customers that we'd had for maybe 25 or 30 years; people who had often started modestly as perhaps small builders and had been successful, accumulating large personnel wealth, always repaying their loans, always coming back for more and always repaying them again.  And I'm afraid we took too much comfort in that history and we weren't...our credit processes were not strict and savage enough.  We looked at affordability and I think we have to take the blame for having processes that just did not match the cataclysm that came.  As I say, the competition was fierce.  I refer again to Professor Honohan's analysis of the competition but that's another explanation, not an excuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1429746600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>And other members I'm sure will open up this debate as we proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300009#H00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429746600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Certainly, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300009#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1429746600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Can you just clarify as well because this will assist us as we go into other questioning.

Now, let me say this to you: we would have been very well off not to have exceeded that sectoral limit.  It's a great shame that we didn't.  But if I can describe to you what was going on at the time, it was Basel II, and we were written to by the regulator in February 2007, shortly after that, and I'm going to read the first sentence ... the first two sentences.  This is the regulator to our manager:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In the light of the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive, and in particular Pillar 2 requirements on concentration risk, the Financial Regulator is currently reviewing its sectoral concentration framework.  As part of this review I am contacting credit institutions that have experienced difficulties with the current sector limit.<\/blockquote>We replied; I won't read out the reply because it's long and you've asked me to be short, but the reply did say, &quot;We are now dealing with this under Basel.&quot;  That reply was from Mr. Bhattacharya, the chief group risk officer, on 2 May, and there's two other pieces of information that I need to give you.  In June of 2007 we put in our Basel II application to the Regulator, a document that I'd say ran to 1,000 pages, with all sorts of mathematical formulae.  The board, in June 2007, had to approve a sort of summary of it, and that summary included - and you have these papers - that summary included a section on credit concentration risk.  The document is called the Basel Programme Governance Workstream.  It had to be signed off and approved by the board, and that described the risk model that we were using for concentration risk, Moody's KMV portfolio manager, the one used by the Basel committee itself.  And the conclusion, having applied that model to our concentration issue, was that based on the analysis conducted - I'm skipping a lot here - &quot;AIB does not require additional capital requirement for credit concentration risk&quot;.  We sent that application in and it was approved by the Regulator.<br\/><br\/>Now, as I say, let me go back to basis.  We'd have been much better off at the old limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300013#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1429749000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, and you've made that point.

In that invitation I was asked to give evidence relating to a number of lines of inquiry.  In the context of three positions which I held in my employment with the AIB Group, specifically in the years from 1999 to 2009.  Those three roles were general manager of the strategic development unit in the bank, managing director of AIB Bank, Republic of Ireland, and as director of group strategy at AIB plc.  I just want to take the three of these in turn for a while if I might.<\/p>  <p>  I was general manager of the bank's strategic development unit from September 1999 to April 2002.  That was a strategic marketing role.  In that position I had no responsibility for credit management or credit strategy.  I was appointed as managing director of AIB Bank in April 2002, and I held that position until February 2009, you may have mentioned May 2009 earlier.  I believe it is principally in the context of this role that I can be of assistance to the inquiry.  AIB Bank was the domestic retail banking division of AIB Group.  As its managing director I was responsible for all aspects of the division's activity in accordance with AIB Group policies and governance.  Specifically in the context of credit strategies, credit approval or credit risk management, activities were all conducted within policies that were set out by the central group risk management function, endorsed by the group executive committee and approved by the board of directors.<\/p>  <p>  Thereafter, these activities were supervised by the group risk management function with support from the internal audit function.  As managing director of AIB Bank, I did not have any credit discretion.  My responsibility was to manage the business to the highest possible level of performance in all respects, and to do so within the credit risk policies and credit risk management frameworks that were set and ordained at group level.  Let me make it clear that, in outlining the corporate governance structure within which the AIB Bank division operated, I am doing that for the purpose of clarity.  I am not in any way suggesting that I am without a share of the responsibility for the failure of the bank.  I was part of the group executive management committee through this period and I became a member of the AIB Group board in 2007.  My voice would have been an influential one if I had questioned or challenged our credit strategy and credit positioning at these fora, but I did not do so.  While I had expected a faltering of economic activity and a pull back in the property market, I simply did not foresee the scale of the collapse that was to follow.  It is clear now that AIB credit policies were inappropriate at that advanced stage of the economic cycle.  At the time, I believe that the economy was on a more resilient and sustainable footing than subsequently proved to be the case.<\/p>  <p>  With the wisdom of hindsight, this was a serious misjudgment on my part and on the part of many others within the bank and outside.  My own failing in this respect is a matter of deep personal regret and I am very conscious of the implications of that misjudgment for very many people.  In late January and February of 2009, I was informed by the AIB Group chief executive that I was being moved from my post as managing director of AIB Bank to a newly created position as director of group strategy.  However, that position never materialised in the way that was indicated to me at the outset.  I found myself from that point completely removed from discussions at executive management and board level, and without objectives or direction in terms of a work agenda.  That situation persisted until I decided to leave the bank nine months later in November 2009.  Throughout my time in this role, I had no involvement in the management of the bank and very little knowledge of developments from a credit risk perspective.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the specific lines of inquiry that I was asked to address, I have addressed each of these in my written statement.  In the interest of time, I will not read through the detail of the views and perspectives that I have to offer, but I am happy to elaborate on my submission in any way that the committee considers helpful.  I have summarised that submission, Chairman, with my personal conclusion that the failure of the bank was primarily attributed to the failure of our credit risk management policy.  Our stress testing of customers' repayment capacity was not sufficiently challenging, and our loan to value constraint on security was inadequate.  The impact of these principle factors was exacerbated by an excessive weighting of property exposure in our portfolio, an undue level of exposure to individual counter parties, and there were external factors that contributed to the difficulty.  There were inappropriate accounting protocols in my view for loan loss provisioning, there was unanticipated and increased funding costs, there was an external requirement for increased capital and all of these added to the strain.<\/p>  <p>  I hope my statement is helpful to the committee.  I have relied primarily on my recollection of events in preparing material for the inquiry and this may mean that some points of detail have escaped me.  With that caveat, I am happy to address any more detailed questions that may arise.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300031#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1429759200,"counter":1284,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Forde.

I think ... I make the point I think, in my statement, that in my last act, if I can express it in those terms, of the MD of the division, was that the chief executive has asked me to do a very rigorous assessment of what the scale of loan losses could be.  This was in late January, early February of '09.  And I did that at the time and I did it ... that was ... that was done in close collaboration with the chief credit officer and the risk executives.  And the product of that was, at that time, to suggest that the loan losses could be of the order of &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion.  That was my last picture of the division before I, in a sense, stepped aside.  Now that would have not led to that order of capital requirement that subsequently came.  Now things deteriorated so quickly and so sharply after that, that from one month to another the situation changed, so I can understand how ... I mean, at that stage ... I recall when that was being done, the worry and the concern from a credit point of view was that houses weren't selling, sales of completed office developments had stopped.  The worry was not so much about the fall in value as it was about the suspension of economic activity.  At that stage values were back ... house values were back 25%.  Clearly from then, to a period 12 months later, things changed very dramatically.  So, if you'll forgive me, I think asking me whether something, an evaluation of the loan portfolio, was done in February or done in April is very material given what was happening.

You've to lend through a period in which land is purchased, in which houses are built and the costs are incurred before ... the revenue only comes at the end when houses begin to sell, or the office, the commercial development that has been developed begins to sell.  The loan and the cash flows are predicated on that sale happening at a particular time and, from early '08, it was obvious that activity in the market was beginning to slow; houses were not selling in the way that had been expected and what that begins to do then is it pushes out the revenues on which those loan cases are based, so, from early '08, it was obvious that there were some developers who were going ... would not meet the cash flow expectations that we had and I would describe the deterioration in the loan book through the course of '08 as that dynamic.

This relates to core document AIB PB2, page 6, item 4, or 4.2.  Very simply, Mr. Forde, the Central Bank have a licensing and supervision requirements and standards for credit institutions and the standards provided that the credit institutions should not have risk assets amounting to more than 200% of shareholder funds; that's the own funds inside in the bank.  And, in any one sector of business, or economic activity, or were considered to apply to two or more separate sectors, the limit was 250% of own funds.  Now, in July 2006, the banks' exposures to the broad property, building and construction sector, amounted to 2006% ... or, sorry, 2060% of own funds, which was already now going over the limit and while the limit was 250% and then the bank continued to breach these limits and such lending reached the level of 390% at September 2008.  Now, you were the head of AIB's Republic of Ireland's business.

The housing market is very much contingent upon first-time buyers to come in to allow people to trade up and trade down and all the rest of it, and that affordability for first-time buyers was becoming so difficult that the State had brought in a package of affordable housing, which was supposed to be subsidised housing.  In Cork affordable housing was a quarter of a million euros.  This was council housing that was subsidised at a quarter of a million euros.

Probably still the case today.  We had an influx of people coming into the country from eastern Europe and so forth.  We had a demographic where the baby boomers of the eighties were coming into house.  So you had a scenario and you had - the outlook, it seemed, was one for continued economic expansion.  We did not see how it was that there was going to be a significant change in the fact that houses were going to be more expensive and going to demand more of the proportion of disposable income to service them.  We sort of accepted that.  For that reason then, the shift in the model,  I suppose,  looking more at the capacity of the borrower to be able to meet the repayments even if interest rates rose became more the issue, rather than a concern about the inflated value of the house.

That had been in place for a long time.  What was going on in prudential circles at the time, and there is reference to it here in the paragraph just before that, what was going on at the time, was the introduction of Basel II conventions to analyse, and these were new protocols that were being introduced for the assessment of risk attaching to loans, and the thrust of those was not to look on loans as one homogeneous set, but to break them into what were called logical portfolios and to look at the particular risk attributes that are attached to each of them.  My understanding is that the regulator was also of the view that that's where they needed to go and for that reason that the old limit was somewhat ... somewhat redundant and were in conversation with AIB saying, \"How are you doing this, and actually how are you getting comfort with the scale of your exposure and is the board comfortable with it?\"  And then, as part of that presentation, AIB set out how it went about assessing its portfolio in this new way under this new methodology and the board, it seems, took comfort with that and is saying, okay well, let's then make it clear in our engagement with the regulator, let's have this new formula adopted but let's not have this indecision as to what particular standard of measurement is to apply.

If you can imagine ... earlier on I described I suppose a simple loan project where someone, a developer, has to buy land and go through that long period during which they pay for the land, they develop the housing stock and then they sell it.  Through all that time there is no revenue whatsoever to be got.  If you are dealing with a larger player that has a number of these projects afoot at one time, they tend to be at different stages of maturity so typically you'll have some projects that are closer to revenue and sales than others.  That helps to make the loan a more manageable proposal from the lender's viewpoint.  So the principle of working with a more diversified player that has experience and a track record in building houses on time and within budget, that stands.  What fell down here was that there was such a collapse of economic activity that every element of these different businesses - whether they were involved in residential development or whether they were involved in commercial development - all of them simply weren't able to produce revenue and that logic became completely unstuck.  So I am in a sense defending the principle of working with a diversified player in any industry.

They were dependent on how the earnings per share performed over a three-year period, and they depended on the performance of the share price relative to other banks.

So Mr. Daly's testimony yesterday, and I'll get it up on the screen there, it is page 2 and 3 of his opening statement.  He says, \"While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that loan-to-value ratios were, typically, less than 100% when the loan was drawn, the reality, in many cases, was that a developer's equity contribution was in the form of a rolling-up of unrealised, paper profit from other developments.

On the face of it therefore, developers had some skin in the game, but in reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions.\"  He then goes on to say, \"In effect\", and what this means in summary, \"In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It is safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper. The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash, the banks stood to take 100% of the losses and that's what happened.\"  Is that a fair reflection of the type of banking practice that you managed for AIB in your senior role?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300057#GGG00800","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429773300,"counter":2076,"content":"<p>I think if I go back to an individual case and, so, you had a scenario typically, as I say, where a developer came with a piece of land, essentially, that had been purchased at x and was now worth 2x, okay?  The bank regarded some proportion of the inherent value in that as equity, and had a position of security over it.  So from a security viewpoint it's true to say that we would have relied on many occasions on non-cash assets.  That is true.  But in giving the loan, the proposition would be much more about what assets, essentially, were going to be created with that loan, and what they were going to sell for, and the bank would have, essentially, part of the loan agreement would be, that the proceeds of the sale, for example, of each residential development would come to the bank. So it's true to say that when things happened in the way they did, which is that office developments stopped selling, houses stopped selling, then the source of repayment for the banks, cash, that also stopped.  Then the difficulty arose because the security that we held, which in many cases was equity, also began to devalue very quickly.  So I think it's true to say that in the way things ultimately developed, we were left frequently where it wasn't cash that we had recourse to, but they were assets that were of much less value.  But in the normal run, essentially if the assets that were produced off the back of that loan were sold, the bank would have collected the cash on those, all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300057#GGG00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1429773300,"counter":2077,"content":"<p>I wouldn't purport myself to have the same level of experience and knowledge that Mr. Daly would have, and in that ...

It's that there was a notional value on property that was interpreted right all the way through the process.  So, a developer could develop something in a part of Cork or a part of Dublin and, even though it's now not completed - and we've seen this with housing developments as well as they were going through phases - new values were given to them.  So, even before the development is completed, a valuation would be placed upon it even though it's now not even out in the market - there's no rents coming in or anything else - and that equity - notional equity, albeit - was now being used as leverage against another loan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300057#GGG01000","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429773900,"counter":2079,"content":"<p>Yeah.
