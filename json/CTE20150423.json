The budget, or pay, is categorised into a number of categories, namely, medical and dental; nursing; health and social care professionals; management and administration; general support staff; and other patient and client care.  In simplistic terms, the starting point would be to examine only management, administration and general support staff, and I will explain why that is not as precise as it might be.  The proportions of staff in those categories have been changing.  In 2007, the proportion of the workforce in all the front-line categories was 71.8% of all staff.  It now stands at 75.4% of all staff.  However, within the category of management, administration and general support staff are a wide range of staff who are in the front-line space, such as the clerks in hospitals who greet people at emergency departments or outpatient registration.  While they are classified as management and administration, the distinction is not easy to make.  Over the period, there has been a biasing of exits and recruitments in favour of the categories that are clearly 100% front-line.<\/p>  <p>  Among the many staff in the management and administration category, a great proportion are also doing patient-facing work.  I regard those who take care of hygiene on a ward as front-line staff.  I regard those who perform civil marriages and those who answer the calls for medical cards and issue medical cards as front-line staff, although they are categorised as management and administration due to our narrow framework within which all pay must be classified.  It is not very straightforward for me to say exactly which staff members are wholly or partially front-line or administration.  The bias is moving in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015042300002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":6,"content":"<p>Is the cleaning in hospitals done by private companies or HSE staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015042300002#KK00400","speaker":"1194"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429743600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>It is a mix of both.

When I went to visit one of them between Christmas and the new year, a huge percentage of the people on trolleys were very elderly people coming from nursing homes.  I was told the reason many of them were there was that they were dehydrated and needed a drip or had chest infections and needed intravenous antibiotics, which could not be done in a nursing home due to governance issues.  There was a question about employing community-based geriatricians.  Now that there is no moratorium and no reason we cannot employ medical staff, will it happen?  It could help alleviate the pressure on beds in emergency departments.  Elderly people in their 80s and 90s should not be taken out of their beds in nursing homes to go to an emergency department just to get a drip.  It should be done in a nursing home.

Unfortunately, Irish banks made mistakes of their own, principally by excessive lending for residential and commercial development and these mistakes became exposed at the same time as international money markets shut up shop in September 2008.<\/p> <p>  AIB lent too much to individual developers, put too much faith in cross-collateralisation, too much faith in the large net worth of individual developers.  We didn't do enough syndication or selling down of loans and, in addition, we relied excessively on risk models that proved inadequate to the cataclysmic events of '09 ... '08 and '09.<\/p> <p>  On 5 March last, the Minister for Finance and the current CEO of AIB, Mr. Duffy, made the very welcome announcement that AIB is on course to repay the total investment made by the State in the bank.<\/p> <p>  The great recession of 2008, the worst the world had seen for 80 years, didn't start in Ireland or in the Irish banks, but there's no doubt that there were decisions made in AIB which made things worse than they need have been for citizens, for employees and for shareholders.  I wish to express my sincere regret for my part in those events, and to renew the apology which I made at the AIB AGM in 2009.<\/p> <p>  In analysing what went wrong at AIB, I should point out that I resigned from the board in June 2009 and my perspective is, therefore, largely limited to information that became available before my departure - I haven't worked there for the last six years - and may to that extent, be incomplete. <\/p> <p>  A country's banking system has been described as the nervous system of the economy, and in that sense the largest indigenous bank was never going to separate itself from the dominant economic activity of the society in which it functioned.  In the years leading up to 2008, a principal engine of economic growth in Ireland was property and construction.  It created a lot of jobs in connected trades and professions, paid lots of taxes, was encouraged by the State and the banks were fully involved in it.

Local authorities collected over &euro;3 billion through development contributions imposed as part of planning permissions between '99 and 2008.<\/p><p>It's perfectly clear in retrospect that the appetite for risk was excessive and the lending strategy of AIB in respect of property was too expansive.  That's not actually how it appeared at the time.  In 2007, for instance, there was a strong national consensus widely confirmed by international commentators that Ireland was on a track of rapid sustainable expansion and development, and a good example is provided by the statements made at the launch of the national development plan in 2007.  Just one detail from it: it was planned to spend &euro;70 million a day every day for seven years on infrastructure with full employment, net inward migration, low debt-to-GDP ratio, budget surplus and buoyant tax revenue, and lots of civil servants were about to move out of Dublin.  Martin Wolf, who has been described as the most respected financial columnist, expressed the view in June 2007 that the possibility of huge calamities being generated by financial markets looked remote.  The IMF, in its financial stability report in 2006, expressed the view that risk dispersion as now organised in banks was less - made banking failures less likely.  And of course, the reverse turned out to be the case.<\/p><p>  In viewings with the benefit of hindsight, looking back now, it seems to me that a great deal of the issue in Ireland comes back to the question of whether at a certain stage a correction that was coming was going to arrive in the form of a so-called soft or hard landing.  I think that's central to the errors.  The OECD, the EU, the IMF, the ECB, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the ESRI, the great majority of published economists in Ireland and abroad, although not all, the risk section of AIB and the board of AIB all favoured the consensus of the soft landing and the consensus, of course, was entirely wrong.  <\/p><p>  There's a striking example or expression, I suppose, of this consensus comes from the OECD report published on Irish banks in April 2008.  And I think the date is important because most of the loans ... nearly all the loans would have been made by then.  And the OECD said, having looked at the Irish banks, the Irish banks were profitable and well-capitalised and provide a buffer against a future downturn.  It's easy and certainly tempting to dismiss everything that went on in 2007 as irrational exuberance, but I actually think that there were - although this is not a popular thing to say - some policies, some justifications for the policy at the time, some rational justifications, and I want to briefly mention three of them.  The first was the calculated demand for housing in Ireland, the second was the reassuring effect of Basel II, as it's called, and the third was reliance on risk modelling in banks.<\/p><p> There was hard statistical information which indicated that Ireland needed more housing.  One of the things AIB did was get independent economists to come and talk to the board every year or so, and a distinguished independent economist in the middle of 2007 brought a paper to the board, which pointed out that of a selected group of European countries, Poland was below us, but Ireland was next lowest on the list in terms of dwellings per 1,000 citizens.  Poland was 330 about, and we were about 370.  And then Estonia, Holland, UK, were all well above us, and Denmark, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain were all over 100 dwellings per 1,000 citizens ahead of us.  They were all over 470; we were at 370.<\/p><p> The second feature is Ireland has, as you're undoubtedly aware, a very unusual demographic history in the last century.  The peak birth rate in most western European countries was in the '60s; people stopped having large families.  The peak year in Ireland is 1980, so there were large groups of children born in the late 70s and early 80s and the 1980 crop will be 35 this year.  So there's the feeling that there was this group of citizens coming into the ... what I would call the house purchasing age, and we took that on board.  Those are the two things I want to say about housing demand, and I suppose the fact that there is now emerging something of a housing shortage in Dublin, certainly in some urban areas, suggests that this wasn't entirely irrational.<\/p><p> I don't want to say much about Basel II; it was promoted with banks by the Bank for International Settlements in Zurich, reinforced by the CRD, the Capital Requirements Directive.  Its purpose was to ensure that banks had adequate capital.  We bought into it heavily and expensively, &euro;200 million between engaging experts and consultants and installing the systems in AIB.<\/p><p>It went live at the start of 2008 and frankly it wasn't much good to us when the trouble came.  Part of Basel, a large part of Basel is to do with mathematical risk modelling, I remember we had to hire maths PhDs and so on to help us with this.  There was a fraud in the American operation of AIB in 2002, a man called Rusnak stole a lot of money, and immediately after that, every regulator from Washington to Warsaw crawled over AIB and, we got the services in conjunction with the Irish regulator, of a man called  Gene Ludwig, who had been a bank supervisor in the States and he investigated us up and down.  One of his recommendations was that we needed to set up a world-class risk management system and that we needed a world-class player to head it up and we duly engaged undoubtedly distinguished and experienced risk specialists from JP Morgan in New York at a very high salary.  I think ultimately 200 people came into the risk section.  At the same time, on foot of the same recommendations, we got a group internal auditor from outside Irish banking, the individual in question had been director of audit for risk and finance in Barclays Bank, then gone to work for the Italian regulator for a short while and then was engaged by AIB.  A third initiative at the time that I was involved in, was setting up a whistleblowing system.  There's a not-for-profit in the United Kingdom called Public Concern at Work, and it will act as a facilitator, and this was published to staff; they could ring up there and their messages would come only to my office and they could preserve their anonymity if they wanted to.<\/p><p> Stress testing was done, installed, and in April '07 we had a stress test that looked at what would happen if things went wrong.  There were two stresses: a plausible stress and an extreme shock test.  The extreme shock test wrote down, for instance, unzoned land by about 60%, wrote down residential by 30% and I have the various figures if you need them ... but it went for a one in 25 year downturn and of course that wasn't enough.  The stress test just didn't avail when we got a one in 100 year event.  We didn't pay sufficient attention to the fact that the stress machinery didn't cater for that event and there was what I'd call an intellectual failure, for which I have to take my part of the blame, to envisage that if there was a serious property downturn in Ireland, a really serious one, and if at the same time there was a worldwide contraction of demand so that Irish businesses started doing badly, you started having unemployment and redundancy ... and at the same time as those two things, that the wholesale money markets closed up that we'd have a very serious crisis on our hands.  When Lehman's failed on 15 September 2008, that in effect is what happened. <\/p><p> I want to say something briefly Chairman, if I can, about 2009 and what it was like.  Now it's painful, it's not long ago but it's possible, in the collapsing of the historical perspective, to forget just how bad things got say from the December of 2008.  In the autumn of 2008, the Department of Finance had estimated tax revenue for 2009 at &euro;43 billion and the outturn was &euro;33 billion.  They'd also estimated the contraction in GDP in Ireland at 1%, a 1% drop in GDP, and the outturn was 11.3% for 2009, ten times worse than the prediction.  In December 2008, a range of international banks were, this was unheard of before, downgraded.  That included Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley.  Anglo was nationalised in January 2009 and just as an indicator of how the general population felt, how public confidence had just gone at that stage, new car registrations in January '09 were 65% down on the previous year.  Irish banks were downgraded in February by Fitch and then in the spring, AIB and Bank of Ireland had to get help from the Government on capitalisation. <\/p><p> Now you can ask the question why did everyone get it so wrong?  I think it's very hard to get it right, that economic forecasting is less reliable and more complicated than people think.  Credit has to be given to Professor Morgan Kelly, he detected the bubble but even he said he thought the downswing in prices in real terms would take eight or nine years.  He also expressed the view that the Irish banks were well capitalised.<\/p><p> I'd like to say something briefly about the accounting standards that applied at the time.  After the dotcom bubble, where accounting standards had given rise to alleged opacity in the accounts of public companies, IAS 39 was introduced.<\/p><p>It prevented banks, in very simple terms, doing what was called cross-cyclical provisioning: putting something away in the good years to save you the trouble in the bad years.  It also had another effect.  It insisted that certain parts of a bank book had to be marked to market, and I don't think the people who designed it ever envisioned there'd be a day when there wouldn't be a market.  So you were now marking to market when there was no market and getting extraordinarily low values for assets.  And there's ... the best description of this - which I think is a key dynamic of the crisis - the best description of this that I've found is in the so-called EU high level group chaired by Jacques de Larosi&egrave;re ... Mr. Nyberg was a member, Sir Callum McCarthy and the great and good of European financial regulation.  It's a bit turgid but starting at paragraph 33, if I can read you into the record what they said.  It is about five or six sentences, Chairman, if you'll indulge me:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Financial institutions understandably tried to dispose of assets once they realised that they had overstretched their leverage, thus lowering market prices for these assets.  Regulatory requirements (accounting rules and capital requirements) helped trigger a negative feed-back loop amplified by major impacts in the credit markets ... Financial institutions, required to value their trading book according to mark-to-market principles, (which pushed up profits and reserves during the bull-run) were required to write down the assets in their balance sheet as markets deleveraged.  Already excessively leveraged, they were required to either sell further assets to maintain capital levels, or to reduce their loan volume.  &quot;Fire sales&quot; made by one financial institution in turn forced all ... financial institutions holding similar assets to mark the value of [those] assets down &quot;to market&quot; ... What was initially a liquidity problem rapidly, for a number of institutions, turned into a solvency problem.<\/blockquote>I would like, Chairman, to say something now about the milieu in which Irish banks functioned before the crisis.  Analysts and large shareholders, pension funds and stockbrokers were always interested in earnings per share and particularly where your earnings per share was going up as much as your peers.  If you were going up as much as your peers that was fine but if you weren't, then your share price would drop and that meant your capacity to raise money would drop, your capacity to expand would drop, vulnerability to takeover would increase.  Governor Honohan in his report in 2011 adverted to that dynamic.  The other issue was Anglo being held up to us as an exemplar and you'll all be aware of that.  Commentators in Ireland and abroad repeatedly said, &quot;Anglo is the best bank.  Why can't you be more like Anglo?&quot;  It was determined by one international consultancy to be the best bank of its size in the world.  It was the darling not just of the Irish but of European stock exchanges generally.  And I had customers saying, &quot;Why can't you be like Anglo?  Why are you always asking for more?  Yourself and Bank of Ireland give slow responses and you ask for paperwork&quot;, and things like that.  I think we tried in some way not to be drawn into the wake but inevitably we were, I think, in some respects.  Professor Honohan described the effect of this sort of competition in a memorable statement before he was the Governor.  He spoke to an economic conference in Dubrovnik in June 2009.  This is what he said, &quot;Competitive pressure on the leading banks to protect market share came especially from reckless expansion [from] one bank, Anglo-Irish whose market share among Irish controlled retail banks jumped from 3 per cent to 18 per cent in a decade&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Can I say something briefly then about the regulator?  We had a perfectly professional relationship, mostly between executives and the Central Bank and the regulator.  I would meet the head once or twice a year maybe.  We invited the CEO and chairman of the regulator to come to an AIB board meeting and they accepted that invitation.  I know there has been a lot of criticism of the regulator and that is not my business.  I am wary of sporting analogies in a serious matter such as this but I did look at ... one of the witnesses I did get a chance to look at was Professor Alan Ahearne and he was in this room on 4 March.  And he was asked by one of the members here what was needed at that time and he said what was needed was a more intrusive regulator - someone who behaved like a referee in a football match.  And it strikes me, having reflected on it since, that that's apposite, that it's instructive ... that if you've a referee in a football match which is highly competitive - and Irish banking was enormously competitive at the time - and the referee does not blow the whistle much, then the more aggressive team tends to prosper and other people can get injured.<\/p><p>Just to say one more thing about the bubble.  No bank could stop a bubble.  If, through some amazing piece of insight or wisdom which we certainly didn't have, AIB had decided on some day during this period to close up for loans and say, &quot;No more loans.  We're not lending anymore&quot;, it would have damaged the bank at the time but not as much as the crash did.  But, all of our customers who were claimants for loans would have been met within the following week by our competitors with glee, the competition was so fierce.  So, the point I make is that no bank could stop a bubble inflating; only authorities can do that.  <br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the night of the bank guarantee decision on 29 or 30 September 2008.  The committee are in possession of three separate near contemporary records which I made of the events of that night.  The main one is, of course, a seven page note, not perfect I'm afraid, but which I dictated a few days after the events of that night and which I've given to the committee.  There is also much shorter paragraphs in a memo that I sent to the CA two days later just as a couple of paragraphs that recites my recollection of what went on at the night and also a letter of complaint to another chairman of another bank which has a couple of paragraphs again about my recollection of the night.  <br\/><br\/>On Sunday, 28 September 2008 - this was a Sunday evening - AIB directors heard from the CEO at a board meeting at 6 o'clock that the word from the authorities was that two financial institutions in Ireland were likely to fail, the timescale was unknown and that a limited guarantee would be put in place for the remainder of the banks.  I furnished you in my supplemental statement a quote from the AIB minute: <blockquote>The purpose of the meeting of the 29th September which the representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland requested with the Government was to discuss the dramatically deteriorating international situation, the apparently dire staits in which Anglo found itself and the possible repercussions of Anglo's imminent collapse for Bank of Ireland and AIB.  We learned that Anglo could not open the next morning and had run out of liquidity.  The banks expressed the view that Anglo and Irish Nationwide needed to be decisively dealt with in some way by the State and then [and I emphasise the &quot;then&quot;] for a guarantee to be provided for the remaining banks to protect the surviving banks against the turmoil which would inevitably follow from an Irish bank being either liquidated or nationalised.  <\/blockquote>The Governor of the Central Bank stated during the meeting, in the presence of the Government representatives, that it would be disorderly, or ... and I remember this expression, &quot;or there could be a fumble if Anglo were dealt with mid-week&quot;, so what was needed, the Governor said, was for AIB and Bank of Ireland to try and provide &euro;5 billion each in liquidity to support Anglo until the coming weekend.  <br\/><br\/>Most of the evening was spent in efforts by Bank of Ireland and AIB to assemble enough liquidity to keep Anglo going until the weekend.  That effort was successful and, by morning, &euro;10 billion in liquidity, in excess of our own liquidity, half provided by Bank of Ireland and half by ourselves, had been assembled with its repayment within seven days guaranteed by the Government.  I want to emphasise that AIB's representatives were not involved in discussing or the making of the decision that was ultimately made.  The so-called &quot;blanket guarantee&quot; to include six banks, including Nationwide and Anglo, was not sought by or discussed with AIB.  I make no complaint about that.  I simply record the fact.  The representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland were not present in the room where the decision makers were for most of the evening, perfectly proper as well.  I first learned that Anglo and Irish Nationwide had been guaranteed along with the other four banks from the media early the next morning.  I acknowledge that the Government was faced with very difficult decisions on 29 September, which had to be made very urgently and I am not privy to the information or advice which was available to the Government on that evening.  Two days after the guarantee, I sent a note to the CEO of AIB which included the following, and this perhaps is the most encapsulated confirmation of what I think went on: <blockquote>Our name and reputation has been damaged by our perceived role in asking for the guarantee.  We have maintained silence on the fact that what we asked for was that Anglo and Nationwide, what brought us all down, be taken out of the market and then for a guarantee to be put in place.  What we did not ask for, and I underlined that in the original, was that Anglo and Nationwide should be boosted and baked into the system going forward.  <\/blockquote>The significance of the getting to the weekend, referred to by the Governor, is that at the weekend, the worldwide stock markets are closed for about two days, I think 51 hours, whereas during the week, worldwide stock markets are only closed at night for about three hours, between Japan ... between US closing and Japan opening.  Just ... finally, Chairman, to say about other options, very briefly, during that week other options, Fortis was rescued by the governments of Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands using ELA and I think that option was discussed briefly by Senator MacSharry with Professor Lane at this inquiry on 21 January.<\/p><p>Later that week, or maybe at the start of the following week, the Bank of England made a secret loan of Stg&pound;63 billion to solve the allegedly critical liquidity issues at Halifax Bank of Scotland and RBS and that wasn't announced publicly until Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, said it to a Treasury select committee in November the following year.  Since then, like many other countries, Ireland has enacted special legislation to deal with bank resolution, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 and the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, and they obviously provide much more options for the sort of events that  occurred on the that night.   Those are my opening remarks, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Gleeson, and just to say your full statement will be published as part of the proceedings and that should be online some time this morning, and thank you very much for condensing that because that facilitates us in our proceedings this morning and I will be asking both members and yourself to be concise in the engagements today.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gleeson, can you explain to the committee how AIB, which is a bank which has a history going back, I think to 1825, long before the foundation of the Irish State, a bank that was considered for ... over that period as a traditional conserving banking model, ended up during your period as chairperson being guaranteed by the Irish State and, ultimately, 99.8% owned by the Irish public?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#H00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429743600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Well, Chairman, I have tried to do something of that explanation in my opening remarks and I won't repeat what I said there but the bank was divided into five divisions.  We had an operation in the United States, in Poland and in the UK and then in Ireland it was divided into what is called capital markets and then Republic of Ireland, which is what people would know as the traditional bank that you've described.<\/p> <p>  Four of those divisions, by and large, came through reasonably intact through the crisis.  Republic of Ireland, unfortunately, became embroiled in property lending which in retrospect ran out of control, was too expansive, was not controlled by the risk models.  I suppose it's fair to say that we had, and this is not an excuse, but it is an explanation ... some of the things that I am saying today may sound like excuses, I'm not making any excuses.  I am trying to assist the committee by explaining how it seemed at the time.  We had installed this enormously expensive ... the best personnel system of controlling risk and I think that directors thought that - and it was advertised -  as a means of measuring, monitoring and managing risk and we just had excessive faith in it.  Allied to that, we went too far with individual developers.  The AIB philosophy at the time, and for years before, was \"stick with your customer\".  Try and make sure they don't go anywhere else, because we had, as you said, plenty of customers and you have to remember that big developers were often customers that we'd had for maybe 25 or 30 years; people who had often started modestly as perhaps small builders and had been successful, accumulating large personnel wealth, always repaying their loans, always coming back for more and always repaying them again.  And I'm afraid we took too much comfort in that history and we weren't...our credit processes were not strict and savage enough.  We looked at affordability and I think we have to take the blame for having processes that just did not match the cataclysm that came.  As I say, the competition was fierce.  I refer again to Professor Honohan's analysis of the competition but that's another explanation, not an excuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>And other members I'm sure will open up this debate as we proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#H00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429743600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Certainly, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Can you just clarify as well because this will assist us as we go into other questioning.

Now, let me say this to you: we would have been very well off not to have exceeded that sectoral limit.  It's a great shame that we didn't.  But if I can describe to you what was going on at the time, it was Basel II, and we were written to by the regulator in February 2007, shortly after that, and I'm going to read the first sentence ... the first two sentences.  This is the regulator to our manager:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In the light of the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive, and in particular Pillar 2 requirements on concentration risk, the Financial Regulator is currently reviewing its sectoral concentration framework.  As part of this review I am contacting credit institutions that have experienced difficulties with the current sector limit.<\/blockquote>We replied; I won't read out the reply because it's long and you've asked me to be short, but the reply did say, &quot;We are now dealing with this under Basel.&quot;  That reply was from Mr. Bhattacharya, the chief group risk officer, on 2 May, and there's two other pieces of information that I need to give you.  In June of 2007 we put in our Basel II application to the regulator, a document that I'd say ran to 1,000 pages, with all sorts of mathematical formulae.  The board, in June 2007, had to approve a sort of summary of it, and that summary included - and you have these papers - that summary included a section on credit concentration risk.  The document is called the Basel Programme Governance Workstream.  It had to be signed off and approved by the board, and that described the risk model that we were using for concentration risk, Moody's KMV portfolio manager, the one used by the Basel committee itself.  And the conclusion, having applied that model to our concentration issue, was that based on the analysis conducted - I'm skipping a lot here - &quot;AIB does not require additional capital requirement for credit concentration risk&quot;.  We sent that application in and it was approved by the regulator.<br\/><br\/>Now, as I say, let me go back to basis.  We'd have been much better off at the old limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, and you've made that point.

In that invitation I was asked to give evidence relating to a number of lines of inquiry in the context of three positions which I held in my employment with the AIB Group, specifically in the years from 1999 to 2009.  Those three roles were general manager of the strategic development unit in the bank, managing director of AIB Bank, Republic of Ireland, and as director of group strategy at AIB plc.  I just want to take the three of these in turn for a while if I might.<\/p> <p>  I was general manager of the bank's strategic development unit from September 1999 to April 2002.  That was a strategic marketing role.  In that position I had no responsibility for credit management or credit strategy.  I was appointed as managing director of AIB Bank in April 2002, and I held that position until February 2009, you may have mentioned May 2009 earlier.  I believe it is principally in the context of this role that I can be of assistance to the inquiry.  AIB Bank was the domestic retail banking division of AIB Group.  As its managing director I was responsible for all aspects of the division's activity in accordance with AIB Group policies and governance.  Specifically in the context of credit strategies, credit approval or credit risk management, activities were all conducted within policies that were set out by the central group risk management function, endorsed by the group executive committee and approved by the board of directors.<\/p> <p>  Thereafter, these activities were supervised by the group risk management function with support from the internal audit function.  As managing director of AIB Bank, I did not have any credit discretion.  My responsibility was to manage the business to the highest possible level of performance in all respects, and to do so within the credit risk policies and credit risk management frameworks that were set and ordained at group level.  Let me make it clear that, in outlining the corporate governance structure within which the AIB Bank division operated, I am doing that for the purpose of clarity.  I am not in any way suggesting that I am without a share of the responsibility for the failure of the bank.  I was part of the group executive management committee through this period and I became a member of the AIB Group board in 2007.  My voice would have been an influential one if I had questioned or challenged our credit strategy and credit positioning at these fora, but I did not do so.  While I had expected a faltering of economic activity and a pull back in the property market, I simply did not foresee the scale of the collapse that was to follow.  It is clear now that AIB credit policies were inappropriate at that advanced stage of the economic cycle.  At the time, I believe that the economy was on a more resilient and sustainable footing than subsequently proved to be the case.<\/p> <p>  With the wisdom of hindsight, this was a serious misjudgment on my part and on the part of many others within the bank and outside.  My own failing in this respect is a matter of deep personal regret and I am very conscious of the implications of that misjudgment for very many people.  In late January and February of 2009, I was informed by the AIB Group chief executive that I was being moved from my post as managing director of AIB Bank to a newly created position as director of group strategy.  However, that position never materialised in the way that was indicated to me at the outset.  I found myself from that point completely removed from discussions at executive management and board level, and without objectives or direction in terms of a work agenda.  That situation persisted until I decided to leave the bank nine months later in November 2009.  Throughout my time in this role, I had no involvement in the management of the bank and very little knowledge of developments from a credit risk perspective.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the specific lines of inquiry that I was asked to address, I have addressed each of these in my written statement.  In the interest of time, I will not read through the detail of the views and perspectives that I have to offer, but I am happy to elaborate on my submission in any way that the committee considers helpful.  I have summarised that submission, Chairman, with my personal conclusion that the failure of the bank was primarily attributed to the failure of our credit risk management policy.  Our stress testing of customers' repayment capacity was not sufficiently challenging, and our loan to value constraint on security was inadequate.  The impact of these principle factors was exacerbated by an excessive weighting of property exposure in our portfolio, an undue level of exposure to individual counter parties, and there were external factors that contributed to the difficulty.  There were inappropriate accounting protocols in my view for loan loss provisioning, there was unanticipated and increased funding costs, there was an external requirement for increased capital and all of these added to the strain.<\/p> <p>  I hope my statement is helpful to the committee.  I have relied primarily on my recollection of events in preparing material for the inquiry and this may mean that some points of detail have escaped me.  With that caveat, I am happy to address any more detailed questions that may arise.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":1311,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Forde.

So if there is a piece of property, you look to see what's the potential productivity of that piece of property, so is it to be used for residential development, how many houses can be built on it, what's the price of those houses, what's the cost of building those houses, what will the density be, how long will it take for the money to be realised.  They're meant to work it out from first principles and then stress test that and that determines the value of the property.

This was in late January, early February of '09.  And I did that at the time and I did it ... that was ... that was done in close collaboration with the chief credit officer and the risk executives.  And the product of that was, at that time, to suggest that the loan losses could be of the order of &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion.  That was my last picture of the division before I, in a sense, stepped aside.  Now that would have not led to that order of capital requirement that subsequently came.  Now things deteriorated so quickly and so sharply after that, that from one month to another the situation changed, so I can understand how ... I mean, at that stage ... I recall when that was being done, the worry and the concern from a credit point of view was that houses weren't selling, sales of completed office developments had stopped.  The worry was not so much about the fall in value as it was about the suspension of economic activity.  At that stage values were back ... house values were back 25%.

And there was a number of board discussions to specifically address that point - were we comfortable with what we were doing in property-construction?  I actually recall ... I think when that stress test in 2007 was presented to the board, that was in response, I think, to a specific request from the regulator that the board would validate and confirm its comfort with AIB's property and construction exposure.

You've to lend through a period in which land is purchased, in which houses are built and the costs are incurred before ... the revenue only comes at the end when houses begin to sell, or the office, the commercial development that has been developed begins to sell.  The loan and the cash flows are predicated on that sale happening at a particular time and, from early '08, it was obvious that activity in the market was beginning to slow; houses were not selling in the way that had been expected and what that begins to do then is it pushes out the revenues on which those loan cases are based, so, from early '08, it was obvious that there were some developers who were going ... would not meet the cash flow expectations that we had and I would describe the deterioration in the loan book through the course of '08 as that dynamic.

This relates to core document AIB PB2, page 6, item 4, or 4.2.  Very simply, Mr. Forde, the Central Bank have a licensing and supervision requirements and standards for credit institutions and the standards provided that the credit institutions should not have risk assets amounting to more than 200% of shareholder funds; that's the own funds inside in the bank.  And, in any one sector of business, or economic activity, or were considered to apply to two or more separate sectors, the limit was 250% of own funds.  Now, in July 2006, the banks' exposures to the broad property, building and construction sector, amounted to 206% ... or, sorry, 260% of own funds, which was already now going over the limit and while the limit was 250% and then the bank continued to breach these limits and such lending reached the level of 390% at September 2008.

The housing market is very much contingent upon first-time buyers to come in to allow people to trade up and trade down and all the rest of it, and that affordability for first-time buyers was becoming so difficult that the State had brought in a package of affordable housing, which was supposed to be subsidised housing.  In Cork affordable housing was &euro;250,000.  This was council housing that was subsidised at &euro;250,000.  It is probably worth less than half of that in today's market.

So you had a scenario and you had - the outlook, it seemed, was one for continued economic expansion.  We did not see how it was that there was going to be a significant change in the fact that houses were going to be more expensive and going to demand more of the proportion of disposable income to service them.  We sort of accepted that.  For that reason then, the shift in the model, I suppose, looking more at the capacity of the borrower to be able to meet the repayments even if interest rates rose became more the issue, rather than a concern about the inflated value of the house.

That had been in place for a long time.  What was going on in prudential circles at the time, and there is reference to it here in the paragraph just before that, what was going on at the time, was the introduction of Basel II conventions to analyse, and these were new protocols that were being introduced for the assessment of risk attaching to loans, and the thrust of those was not to look on loans as one homogeneous set, but to break them into what were called logical portfolios and to look at the particular risk attributes that are attached to each of them.  My understanding is that the regulator was also of the view that that's where they needed to go and for that reason that the old limit was somewhat ... somewhat redundant and were in conversation with AIB saying, \"How are you doing this, and actually how are you getting comfort with the scale of your exposure and is the board comfortable with it?\"  And then, as part of that presentation, AIB set out how it went about assessing its portfolio in this new way under this new methodology and the board, it seems, took comfort with that and is saying, okay well, let's then make it clear in our engagement with the regulator, let's have this new formula adopted but let's not have this indecision as to what particular standard of measurement is to apply.

If you can imagine ... earlier on I described I suppose a simple loan project where someone, a developer, has to buy land and go through that long period during which they pay for the land, they develop the housing stock and then they sell it.  Through all that time there is no revenue whatsoever to be got.  If you are dealing with a larger player that has a number of these projects afoot at one time, they tend to be at different stages of maturity so typically you'll have some projects that are closer to revenue and sales than others.  That helps to make the loan a more manageable proposal from the lender's viewpoint.  So the principle of working with a more diversified player that has experience and a track record in building houses on time and within budget, that stands.  What fell down here was that there was such a collapse of economic activity that every element of these different businesses - whether they were involved in residential development or whether they were involved in commercial development - all of them simply weren't able to produce revenue and that logic became completely unstuck.  So I am in a sense defending the principle of working with a diversified player in any industry.

It seems an inordinate amount of money in hindsight and in the context of what happened.  As I tried to indicate in my statement, I spent my professional life with AIB.

I do fully understand that bitterness it creates.  I fully understand the disappointment that there is with us.  I have no quarrel with that, it is justified.

So it's a judgment call as to whether it was going to last for a month or six weeks, but in broad terms I can understand that as being not an unreasonable picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#BBB01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":1964,"content":"<p>See there isn't unreasonable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#BBB01400","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429743600,"counter":1965,"content":"<p>Well, total insolvency, which equals bankruptcy, when it comes to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#BBB01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":1966,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#BBB01600","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429743600,"counter":1967,"content":"<p>I mean if the bank couldn't fund its obligations then essentially it was bankrupt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#BBB01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":1968,"content":"<p>To go back to the salary position and the whole incentive structure, that I know you explained in great detail, in relation to yourself did you then ... were you then eligible and did you get a bonus in each of the years in which you had that position of managing director?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#BBB01800","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429743600,"counter":1969,"content":"<p>I didn't get it in the last few years, as you might imagine when things got more difficult, but I got it pretty consistently through the earlier years, and the incentive for me was of two forms.

They were dependent on how the earnings per share performed over a three-year period, and they depended on the performance of the share price relative to other banks.

So Mr. Daly's testimony yesterday, and I'll get it up on the screen there, it is page 2 and 3 of his opening statement.  He says:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that loan-to-value ratios were, typically, less than 100% when the loan was drawn, the reality, in many cases, was that a developer's equity contribution was in the form of a rolling-up of unrealised, paper profit from other developments.  This was presented as an equity position.<\/blockquote>So it would have been presented to your bank and other banks as an equity position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#GGG00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429743600,"counter":2081,"content":"<p>Yes, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#GGG00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":2082,"content":"<p>He continues:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Rarely, if ever, was it in the form of cash&quot;, &quot;Rarely, if ever, was it in the form of cash.  On the face of it therefore, developers had some skin in the game, but in reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions.<\/blockquote>He then goes on to say, and what this means in summary:<blockquote>In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It is safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash, the banks stood to take 100% of the losses and that's what happened.<\/blockquote>Is that a fair reflection of the type of banking practice that you managed for AIB in your senior role?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#GGG00800","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429743600,"counter":2083,"content":"<p>I think if I go back to an individual case and, so, you had a scenario typically, as I say, where a developer came with a piece of land, essentially, that had been purchased at X and was now worth 2X, okay?  The bank regarded some proportion of the inherent value in that as equity, and had a position of security over it.  So from a security viewpoint it's true to say that we would have relied on many occasions on non-cash assets.  That is true.  But in giving the loan, the proposition would be much more about what assets, essentially, were going to be created with that loan, and what they were going to sell for, and the bank would have, essentially, part of the loan agreement would be, that the proceeds of the sale, for example, of each residential development would come to the bank. So it's true to say that when things happened in the way they did, which is that office developments stopped selling, houses stopped selling, then the source of repayment for the banks, cash, that also stopped.  Then the difficulty arose because the security that we held, which in many cases was equity, also began to devalue very quickly.  So I think it's true to say that in the way things ultimately developed, we were left frequently where it wasn't cash that we had recourse to, but they were assets that were of much less value.  But in the normal run, essentially if the assets that were produced off the back of that loan were sold, the bank would have collected the cash on those, all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#GGG00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1429743600,"counter":2084,"content":"<p>I wouldn't purport myself to have the same level of experience and knowledge that Mr. Daly would have, and in that ... I grew up in a council estate, my parents bought their home through a tenant purchase scheme, so I don't come with any big property background, but what I hear him saying here, very simply, is, there is an issue of acceleration and deceleration in the property market, and there's an issue of inflation and deflation in the property market.<\/p><p>And what was happening is that inflation was running so quick in the property market and development was at a very accelerated level, so it wasn't the case that a housing development was completed and now sold.  It's that there was a notional value on property that was interpreted right all the way through the process.  So, a developer could develop something in a part of Cork or a part of Dublin and, even though it's now not completed - and we've seen this with housing developments as well as they were going through phases - new values were given to them.  So, even before the development is completed, a valuation would be placed upon it even though it's now not even out in the market - there's no rents coming in or anything else - and that equity - notional equity, albeit - was now being used as leverage against another loan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042300002#GGG01000","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429743600,"counter":2086,"content":"<p>Yeah.

It is a great pleasure to be back at my former committee.  I acknowledge the presence of members of the Committee of the Regions who are here and also my colleagues from the Oireachtas.  I will give a brief report on the General Affairs Council, but the rest of the presentation is not particularly brief.  It is substantive and I ask for the Chairman's indulgence in that regard.  I am more than happy to take questions.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here and to hear the members' views and questions on Ireland's draft national reform programme, NRP, which has been circulated.  As the committee will be aware, the preparation and submission of an NRP is an important element in the European Semester process.  Listening to the views of fellow parliamentarians is rightly acknowledged as an important part of the process, and is something that I strongly support.  Before considering the contents of the NRP, I will refer briefly to the context in which it is being prepared.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee will be familiar with the semester process and at our last engagement at the start of March I outlined some of the recent developments.  It is worth noting that the March European Council concluded the first phase of European Semester 2015 by providing guidance to member states for submission in mid-April of their stability programme updates and national reform programmes.  Based on preparatory work in the Council, the political emphasis now in place reinforces the economic priorities set by the new Commission in its first annual growth survey, which was produced last November.  This year's process will therefore be advanced on the basis of three main pillars: a boost to investment; a renewed commitment to both national and EU-level structural reforms; and the pursuit of fiscal responsibility.  The Council invited member states to reflect these priorities in their forthcoming national reform programmes and stability or convergence programmes, depending on which they are in.<\/p> <p>  At the end of February, the Commission presented a comprehensive assessment for each member state, under the 2015 cycle of the European Semester.  This is a procedural improvement introduced for this year's process that is designed to support stronger national-level engagement with the Commission's assessment, including by key stakeholders and national parliaments.<\/p> <p>  Draft proposals for the next round of country specific recommendations, CSRs, are produced by the Commission in May, for adoption subject to amendment by the Council.  In Ireland's case, the assessment in the new country report is a broadly positive one, reflecting the strength of the economic recovery under way and supporting, in turn, a gradual unwinding of the deep imbalances developed during the crisis period.<\/p> <p>  The semester process embraces Europe 2020, the EU's ten-year plan, adopted in 2010, based around five headline EU targets in the areas of employment, innovation, climate and energy, education and social inclusion.  Under Europe 2020, each member state adopts national targets in these five areas and progress is monitored within the framework of the European Semester and reported on annually by member states in their NRPs.  The Commission's consideration of the future development of the Europe 2020 strategy will be informed by the public consultation to which this committee made a contribution in November, as reviewed in the Seanad, which I attended, in March.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, last year was the first occasion on which Ireland was a full participant in the European Semester process upon exiting our programme and we received seven CSRs in 2014.  Country specific recommendations are tailored, concrete recommendations for reforms that are considered in the relevant Council formations - on what is called a comply or explain basis - and finally endorsed by the European Council meeting at the end of June.  Ireland's CSRs covered public finances, health care spending, active labour market policies, social inclusion, access to finance, non-performing loans in the financial sector and legal services.  The draft NRP reports formally on progress in implementing them.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to report that progress is broadly on track and consistent with policy directions already firmly established at national level.<\/p><p>The draft NRP also takes stock of progress towards our Europe 2020 targets in the areas of employment; research and development; climate change and energy; education; and social inclusion.  While the NRP is a reasonably comprehensive text, it is expected to be concise and as such it is not possible to include every detail in any policy area or elaborate the full extent of Government action across each issue.  However, it provides a good picture of the range and scale of reforms being advanced by the Government to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery strengthens and remains fully sustainable.   In this regard, there is strong synergy between the approaches being adopted in Ireland and at European level.  The semester is part of the strengthened arrangements for policy co-ordination in the wake of the economic crisis.  It reflects the fact that mismanagement of one economy in an economic and monetary union can have negative implications for the economies of other member states.  We have, therefore, expressed strong support for the semester process and for the oversight it provides.   <\/p><p> I will now provide Members with an overview of the draft document, following which I will be happy to take their questions.  At its outset, the NRP will provide an overview of our macroeconomic position.  This will be further updated and aligned with the Department of Finance&rsquo;s latest macroeconomic forecasts when the stability programme update is finalised and published next week.  As the committee will be aware, our economic performance over the past year has been strong and growth is expected to continue into 2015 and beyond.<\/p><p> The NRP will also provide an update on measures being taken by the Government in respect of each of the seven country specific recommendations.  The first of these recommendations pertains to our public finances.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years, and the outlook for the period ahead is positive, as will be set out in detail in our stability programme update.  Key reform measures set out in the NRP include the following: placing multi-annual expenditure ceilings on a statutory basis; establishing an Irish Fiscal Advisory Council; broadening the tax base, including through introduction of annual property tax, abolition or curtailment of tax reliefs and increases in minimum tax rates for high earners; and devising a roadmap for Ireland&rsquo;s tax competitiveness, which was launched in budget 2015 and sets out a medium-term strategy for Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax policy.  <\/p><p>  The second recommendation pertains to reform of the health care sector.  A significant programme of reform is being advanced in this area.  The Government&rsquo;s future health strategy, which was published in 2012, is driving reforms across four strands, namely, health and well being, structural reform, services reform and financial reform.  The introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing delivered &euro;50 million in savings in 2014, with a further &euro;25 million expected to be saved in 2015.  By the end of 2014 the penetration of generic drugs had reached 68% by volume, compared to a target of 60%.  The use of individual health identifiers is another important reform which will commence with the introduction of free GP care to children under the age of six years in June 2015.  As the committee will be aware, priorities for continuing health reform were published by the Minister for Health in January of this year.  <\/p><p> Our third recommendation pertains to labour market activation, including long-term unemployment, the Youth Guarantee and reform of further education and training.  This has been a key focus for Government since taking up office, with the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work supporting job creation and helping those on the live register to return to work.  This is another area for which a detailed whole-of-government approach has delivered strong results and it is now reasonable to look forward to a return to full employment in the economy, something that would have been inconceivable a few years ago.  The Action Plan for Jobs for 2015 sets a target of 2.1 million people in employment by 2018, which is two years ahead of the original schedule.  There is a particular focus under the action plan on regional development and measures to support the domestic economy in sectors including construction, retail, tourism and hospitality and agriculture and food. The updated Pathways to Work programme for 2015, which was published in October 2014, contains a suite of enhanced reforms with special focus on long-term and youth unemployment.  For example, this year will see the roll-out of a new employment service model called JobPath which will support the long-term unemployed in their efforts to access today&rsquo;s labour market.  We all know how difficult this can be, particularly for those who have spent a number of years out of work.  The Government is determined to ensure that they have the supports they need to access work and to reach their full potential.  Approximately 57,000 education and training places are reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015, subject to demand.   A minimum of 16,000 places for the long-term unemployed are being created in public employment programmes, including the extension of the highly successful JobsPlus initiative.<\/p><p> Our fourth recommendation pertains to low work intensity households and poverty.  It is important to note that Pathways to Work is supporting jobless households access the labour market.  This recommendation reflects an ongoing discussion between Ireland and the Commission aimed at ensuring that, in addressing this issue, we are working on the basis of sound and reliable data.  There are different ways to measure low work intensity and jobless households, and if we are to be confident that our policy responses are right for Ireland, we need to ensure that the correct measures are adopted.  I refer the committee to the details set out in the NRP on this subject.  The Government is firmly committed to supporting people, including those with family responsibilities, into work, to ensure that work pays and to avoid creating poverty traps that hold people back.  We have been introducing reforms to the one parent family payment on an incremental basis, which aim at strengthening links between lone parents, who are a key cohort in the jobless household population, and the labour market.  Some 30,000 recipients of the payment with children over the age of seven years will transition from the payment in 2015.  Tailored child care schemes, including for after school care, have been introduced to support this process.  More widely, some &euro;260 million is being invested annually by the Government in child care support programmes reaching more than 100,000 children each year and an interdepartmental group has been established to explore ways of ensuring that current and future investments deliver more affordable, accessible and high quality early years and school age care and education.  The group is due to present a range of options to the Government by June 2015. <\/p><p> Our fifth recommendation pertains to SME financing and debt.  The Government has taken numerous steps to ensure that SMEs, which play an important role in our economy, can access the finance that they need to grow and thrive.  Among the key policy initiatives developed in 2014, which contributed to the evolution of a more robust and effective institutional architecture for the financing of SMEs, were the establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which is providing up to &euro;800 million of funds; the development of an innovative SME State support online tool to provide an entrepreneur with a list of the possible Government business supports; amendment of the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 and introduction of a new more flexible credit guarantee scheme; the announcement by the Minister for Finance of the commencement of work on an integrated export finance strategy in 2015; a review of Microfinance Fund Ireland; participation by Permanent TSB in the credit review process; and the transition of the NPRF into the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.<\/p><p>Our sixth recommendation relates to bank performance against mortgage arrears restructuring targets and SME debt.  Tackling mortgage arrears is a priority for Government and, as the committee will be aware, the Government will shortly bring forward a range of further actions in this regard.  The NRP sets out some of the work that has already been undertaken and the progress that has been made. <br\/><br\/>At the end of 2014, the number of private dwelling home mortgage accounts classified as restructured by the banks stood at 114,674 - an improvement of 29% over the 2013 figures.  Progress has continued in 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank set further mortgage arrears resolution targets for quarter 3 and quarter 4 of 2014, and has reported that the banks have continued to meet or exceed the targets set for them.  It has also confirmed that the banks have reported that they have met their required targets on SME loans arrears to date. NAMA, which addresses distressed real-estate exposures, continues to outperform targets and is well ahead of schedule, having redeemed &euro;17.6 billion of NAMA senior bonds, which exceeds its target of 50%. <br\/><br\/>Our seventh recommendation relates to the Legal Services Regulation Bill and court data collection.  As the committee will be aware, debate on the Legal Services Regulation Bill has resumed, and it remains the Government&rsquo;s aim to complete its passage so as to allow the legal services regulatory authority come into operation in mid-2015.  Yesterday I took the first part of Report Stage, which was later completed by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  The Bill is now going to the Seanad.  Therefore, it is making progress.  The courts caseload data committee is overseeing an extensive range of work on enhancing computerised case support systems, and this is set out in the NRP. <br\/><br\/>I turn now to the national targets under the Europe 2020 strategy.  These targets are horizontal and cross-cutting - for example, across employment and poverty reduction strategies. Our target is to raise to between 69% and 71% the employment rate for women and men aged 20 to 64, including through greater participation of young people, older workers and low-skilled workers and the better integration of legal migrants, and to review the target level of ambition in 2014 in the context of a proposed mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  The mid-term review is currently ongoing.  For 2014, the employment rate for women and men aged 20-64 was 67%, a welcome increase of three percentage points from 2012.  This increase demonstrates the continuing improvement in the labour market after a fall from a high of 74% in the employment rate in 2007 to 71% in 2008 and less than 64% in 2012, which was the worst year for unemployment in the State.  For us to reach the 2020 target, the employment rate will have to increase by 0.5 percentage points each year.  We see this as feasible, provided the recent recovery is maintained into the medium term.  As I have already mentioned, the Government is continuing to tackle unemployment and to support employment through the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.<br\/><br\/>Our target in the area of research and development is to raise combined public and private investment levels in this sector to 2.5% of GNP.  We have significantly increased our investment in research and development in the past decade and more, while also introducing a range of measures to improve commercialisation of research and build strong links between the higher education sector and enterprise.  In 2013 it is estimated that research and development intensity in Ireland was at 1.94% of GNP.  As a result, Ireland has built a strong science base and is in the world&rsquo;s top 20 countries for scientific output.  This investment in the science base has had a positive impact on our industrial development.  We are now in the process of developing a new strategy for science, technology and innovation, which is due for completion this summer.<br\/><br\/>The target for climate change and energy is to reduce emissions in the non-traded sector by 20% compared to 2005 levels, to increase the share of renewables in final energy consumption to 16%, and to move towards a 20% increase in energy efficiency.<b><\/b>On climate change, under the 2009 EU effort-sharing decision, which applies to greenhouse gas emissions, GHG, outside the scope of the EU emissions trading scheme, Ireland must limit the growth of emissions to 20% below 2005 levels over the period 2013 to 2020.  This emission reduction target under EU law is ambitious and very challenging from an Irish perspective, particularly given the large size of our agriculture sector and the scale of emissions associated with it.  Our target for the period to 2020 consists of a series of declining annual targets, and compliance must be demonstrated with each annual target in turn.  The targets for the years 2013 to 2016 are within reach, but beyond that point deficits will arise.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 is currently before the Houses, with enactment expected during the course of 2015.<br\/><br\/>On energy, the overarching objective of the Government's policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, with 10% for transport and 12% for heat.  In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.  As a percentage of the targets for each of the three sectors, this equates to 20.9% of electricity demand, and 4.9% and 5.7% respectively of transport and heat power needs, being met by renewable energy in 2013.<br\/><br\/>The national energy efficiency action plan, NEEAP, which is the overarching policy framework for energy efficiency in Ireland, contains Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a 20% energy savings target across the economy by 2020 in pursuit of EU obligations.  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  Ireland has already achieved 39% of our national target, and progress is also steady with respect to the 33% reduction in public sector energy use.<br\/><br\/>Targets in the area of education aim to address early school leaving and boost the number of people with third level qualifications.  Specifically, they are to reduce the percentage of 18 to 24 year olds with at most lower secondary education and not in further education and training to 8%, and to increase the share of 30 to 34 year olds who have completed tertiary or equivalent education to at least 60%.  The percentage of early school leavers in Ireland fell from 11.4% in 2010 to 8.4% by the end of 2013.  This represents positive progress towards achievement of our 8% target.<\/p><p>The latest EU data show that Ireland's tertiary attainment for 30-34 year olds was 52.6% in 2012.  Since 2009, Ireland has the highest rate for this indicator of all 28 member states.  In the tertiary attainment rate for 25-34 year olds indicator presented by the OECD, Ireland ranks first in the European Union and fourth in the OECD.<\/p><p> On poverty our interim target is the reduce the number experiencing consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and the target is to reduce it to 2% or less by 2020 from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.3%.  Ireland's contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to reduced by a minimum of 200,000 people the number in the population who are either in consistent poverty, at risk-of poverty or basic deprivation.<\/p><p> Following a review in 2012, the Government agreed a revised and enhanced national social target for poverty reduction, which is to reduce consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and to 2% or less by 2020.  As I have said the latest measure of consistent poverty is 8.2% in 2013.  In recognition of the higher risks and life-long consequences of child poverty, a new child-specific social target was set in the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, which is to lift 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020<\/p><p> The General Affairs Council, GAC, took place in Luxembourg this week.  The meeting was originally to focus on inter-institutional relations, however in light of the tragic events at the weekend, the Ministers also discussed the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.  As we speak the Taoiseach is attending an emergency summit of EU leaders at the European Council to deal with the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.  As a follow-up to Monday's joint meeting of Foreign and Justice Ministers, the General Affairs Council discussed what EU members states could do to alleviate the crisis in migration and the situation in the Mediterranean.<\/p><p> Ministers expressed their solidarity with the victims and the countries concerned and agreed that there was an urgent need to step up common EU action to respond to the situation.  The discussion focused on human trafficking, smuggling, border surveillance and solidarity.  The need to address the root causes of displacement and forced migration was also discussed in detail.  There was broad support for the ten point action plan proposed by the Commission and which is being discussed by the European Council today.<\/p><p> The General Affairs Council had a discussion on the proposal to revise the 2003 Inter-Institutional Agreement on Better Law Making to take account of post-Treaty of Lisbon realities.  There was consensus that in the forthcoming negotiations of the Inter-Institutional Agreement, the General Affairs Council should prioritise better regulation, programming and delegated Acts.<\/p><p> In my intervention I welcomed the high priority the Commission has afforded the better regulation agenda and highlighted some areas where further progress could be made.  Chairman, I also highlighted the role of national parliaments in contributing to the good functioning of the European Union.  Over lunch there was a discussion on the issue of counter-terrorism and measures to prevent radicalisation and to safeguard values.  <\/p><p> The General Affairs Council marked the ten year anniversary of the signing of the accession treaties with Bulgaria and Romania.  Ministers also adopted Council conclusions on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, expressing grave concern about the deteriorating situation there.<\/p><p> As the committee will appreciate the draft national reform programmes covers considerable ground across all Departments.  In my lengthy contribution I have tried to capture some of the key elements, however it has not been possible to cover every detail.<\/p><p> I am more than happy to take questions from members.  I am now at the disposal of the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#B00200","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2204,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.  It was a lengthy contribution but it was necessary because I think it is important to go through the detail of what was being proposed at the General Affairs Council.  I have a number of questions.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on the draft national reform programme.  As the Minister of State states the recommendations are tailored specifically to each individual country.  We have to comply with what is recommended or explain the reason we are not complying with the recommendations.  One of the country specific recommendations CSR 1, is the recommendation on the budget, that in order to support fiscal consolidation, consideration should be given to raising revenues through broadening the tax base.  This recommendation was made last year.  The Minister of State outlined what Ireland has done to comply we this recommendation, we have brought in the property tax, we have abolished some tax credits and we have brought in a carbon tax.  However, all of these measures were done in advance of this recommendation.  Does the Minister of State think that will be sufficient to meet the requirements for an explanation, bearing in mind that the CSR recommendations would have been written post the introduction of those taxes and post the abolition of those credits?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State may have been a member of the committee at the stage we did a report on Europe 2020, and how we would achieve the targets set in that strategy.  We concluded that the strategy would be likely to fail in the delivery of its targets if it remained a top-down and a non-exclusive process.  We thought it would be necessary to ensure there would be a partnership approach to the targets.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that there is sufficient buy-in and engagement at local and regional levels with the relevant organisations to make sure we achieve the targets set out in the 2020 strategy?<\/p> <p>  At our committee meeting we had raised the question of Macedonia and the Minister of State's response to that was comprehensive.  We were glad to see that he raised the issue at the General Affairs Council.  I thank the Minister for doing so and we very much appreciate it.<\/p> <p>  This committee is concerned about the crisis in regard to migration and the situation in the Mediterranean.  We discussed among ourselves the push-backs at the Bulgarian border.  It is getting increasingly tense with potential migrants being harried and harassed at the border.  This is a very important issue and we will discuss it again at our meeting next week to which we have invited the Italian and Maltese ambassadors and the UN special representative for global migration, Mr. Peter Sutherland.  We hope they will give us an update on the situation in order to see what we as a national Parliament can do to add our voices to the concerns about the unfolding humanitarian crisis.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#E00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2205,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I focus on health care and my first questions relates to generic drugs substitution, which has been in place for a short time.  I have seen three or four sets of figures that have been bandied around.  I am not at all convinced that we have done enough.  A saving of &euro;50 million last year and &euro;25 million this year has been made by substituting generic for branded drugs.  The penetration rate of generic drugs has reached 68% by volume of drugs.  A saving of &euro;75 million over a two year period does not sound to me as if a significant amount of work has been done on this issue.  I wonder if we have done enough in this respect.  Some 10% of drugs used in this country are generic drugs whereas the average in the United Kingdom is 80% generic drugs.  I am not saying we should reach the 80% target for use of generic drugs.  Has there been real reform, and if so, why have the savings not been greater?  Savings of &euro;75 million over two years seems very low in real terms.<\/p><p>The question is about reform, timeframe and savings.  I am not convinced.  The cost of pharmaceuticals within the health care sector went from &euro;570 million to over &euro;2 billion in a seven-year period.  With the introduction of generic drugs, we are talking about a saving of only &euro;75 million in two years.  I am worried about that.  <\/p><p> The second issue I want to raise is the crisis in the Mediterranean.  This has been very serious issue for the last two years but we had not really taken any notice of it until four to six weeks ago.  I am approaching it from a totally different point of view.  While we need to take emergency action to deal with the problem, to a large extent, Europe and America have been the contributors to that problem.  The arms and ammunition industry across Europe and the US have contributed to creating conflicts in a lot of places.  When we overthrew Gaddafi in Libya, there was a huge surplus of arms which went to all sorts of groups and we are now paying the price.  When thinking about policy in the short-term, we should be looking at the long-term consequences.  We are now feeling the long-term consequences of some of the decisions that were taken five, eight or ten years ago and are having to pick up the pieces.  Is this issue of countries selling arms and ammunition into developing countries and the Middle East on the agenda in Europe?  If so, what do we intend doing about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#E00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2207,"content":"<p>I join with the chairman and members in welcoming the Minister of State and his officials.  I have two questions.  One concerns employment under Europe 2020, which the Minister of State has, however, covered particularly well.  The other concerns child poverty.  We had aimed to lift 70,000 children out of poverty in Ireland by 2020.  There has been an increase in the number, which is over 100,000.  Does the Minister of State have any specific measures that would help to solve that growing problem and succeed where we have not done so before?  How confident would he be about those measures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#F00200","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2208,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  That was a long and detailed speech, so I will try and keep my contribution fairly short.  The Minister of State said that some 30,000 recipients of the one-parent family payment with children over the age of seven years will transition from the payment in 2015 and that tailored child care schemes, including after-school care, have been introduced to support this process.  What the Minister of State was referring to was 30,000 people losing their payment.  The big argument that many lone parents are making to us, as politicians, is that the promised child care schemes are not there and the ones that are there are too costly.  We are forcing people into employment without putting the supports in place.  I think the T&aacute;naiste said that child care would be a key element of these changes, but the spaces are not there.  How is the Minister of State going to square that circle?  It sounds positive that people are moving on with their lives, and I have not met any lone parent who does not want to get into employment.  However, there are difficulties and barriers there.  All the groups advocating on behalf of lone parents are saying that the child care spaces are not there and that is a big problem.  We need to get our act together on this.<\/p> <p>  As regards the training schemes, the Minister of State said that 57,000 education and training places are reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015, subject to demand.  What does \"subject to demand\" mean?  Does it mean that if people do not want to go on these schemes, they do not have to?  That is not what I am being told.  According to the Minister of State, a minimum of 16,000 places for long-term unemployed are being created in public employment programmes, including through the highly successful JobsPlus initiative.  I was recently talking to a group of workers who were notified that they had to go on one of these schemes.  There was one person under the age of 40 in the room.  Many of them had skills - one was a tiler while another was a carpenter - and many of them had worked in the construction industry but for whatever reasons they have not been able to get back in to employment, even part-time.  I would imagine that we need to be gearing a lot of those schemes towards young people.  I do not know what training value those workers are going to get on this course.  Some of it will be sweeping roads, cleaning up grass verges and so on, even though the argument was that they would be increasing their skill level.  They were annoyed that they were being forced down this route.  They certainly all want to get back into employment and want to upskill.  What was being offered was clearly not enough.<\/p> <p>  Although we are told almost on a daily basis that we have regained our economic sovereignty and so on, Ministers are replying to questions by saying that EU rules will dictate our budget for a long time to come and that this happens through the semester.  Our next budget will have to be against the backdrop of the so-called expenditure benchmark.  I understand the Government is seeking greater flexibility in that regard but it seems like other countries within Europe are flagrantly disregarding the rules at the moment.  We are coming in on the back of that and looking for greater flexibility, saying that it is arbitrary, even though we agreed to it.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty is that we are talking about balancing books with no understanding of the socio-economic cost of that so-called balancing.  The Minister of State is talking in terms of jobs and so on.  Ireland is second only to the US in terms of numbers in low-paid employment in the OECD.  We are the highest in Europe.  We may be talking about creating full employment, but at what cost?  We have had the recent experience of Dunnes Stores as regards zero-hour contracts and so on.  By all means, we need full employment and we all support that but I am concerned about the quality of the jobs we are creating.<\/p> <p>  Emigration is also a key issue.  Recently, just under 4,000 jobs came on offer in Canada and the visas were gone within 12 minutes.  Our young people are bright and intelligent with plenty of skills.  Many of them are leaving jobs and emigrating because they do not have any hope.  Collectively, it is part of our job to instil hope and show that there are alternatives.  The biggest thing we need to do in Europe is instil in those in power the understanding that there are alternatives to the austerity we have faced up to now.  Stimulus is the way forward and that is the big debate we need to bring to the table in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#F00300","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2209,"content":"<p>I tried to practise bilocation not very successfully for the last hour or so.  I apologise for my absence for the Minister's speech, but I have read it.  In the country-specific areas applicable to this country, how do we compare with other European countries and how well are all other European countries complying with the objectives laid down initially, which I agree with and with which we all must comply?  Are all European countries, large and small, fully complying with the general thrust of what we are doing in this country?  We have had to do it because if one does not have the resources to expend, one must cut one's cloth according to one's measure.<\/p><p>Second, the CSRs cover public finances, health care spending, active labour market policies, social inclusion, access to finance, non-performing loans and so forth.  In the area of health care, how do we compare with our colleagues across Europe in spending on health care, that is, the ratio of spending <i>per capita<\/i>in this country compared with the best in Europe, as well as the efficiency with which we and they can deliver services?  I am conscious that we all have a particular role to play across Europe in addressing the issues that have beset Europe in the past number of years.  In view of the sacrifices the people in this country have made and the sacrifices politicians had to make to take very unsavoury decisions, I would like to think that everybody was shouldering responsibility to the same extent.<\/p><p>The semester process is better than its predecessor in that it provides for regular review of the targets.  Previously, there were no reviews of the targets and by the end of the ten year period we were in a situation where no target had been met and there was insufficient or partial monitoring.  Breaches in economic performance were blatant everywhere but nobody knew about it until it was too late.  Clearly, this country is adhering to its programme and is delivering to the best of its ability in difficult circumstances.  How do we compare with all of our colleagues in the European Union, particularly in the eurozone?  The danger in a situation such as this is that those countries that were seriously in error or deficient in their performance initially might get all or most of the attention, while others that could do with a little attention might not receive the same regulatory experience.<\/p><p>The Pathways to Work scheme has been discussed.  The one-parent family payment has arisen repeatedly.  Both parties in the Government have been criticised about it on the basis that it was somewhat uncaring.  I do not believe it was.  There is provision to ensure that no loss of income should take place for the individual families.  That must apply and if it does not, somebody is not doing the job the way it was intended to be done.  In my experience, there is no need to encourage lone parents to do anything.  They will do it themselves.  That is the nature of the individual.  They want to do the best they can in their circumstances.  They will go to work as a first option, as opposed to a last option.  Lest some European bureaucrat gets the impression that people here are living a cosy lifestyle and that we only do things at their behest and as a last resort, that is not so.  In fact, in my time in public life, and I have been in public life for a year or two at this stage, I can assure the Minister that the efforts of lone parents to seek employment are exemplary, without exception, even though they are in very difficult circumstances.  What is the comparison across Europe?  What is determined in one country might not apply in another.<\/p><p>I wish to refer to two further points.  The first is climate change, the extent to which we must comply with less dependency on fossil fuels, the degree to which we can achieve our targets and the extent to which all other countries throughout Europe are achieving targets as well and making the same sacrifices that we will have to make.  We must ensure somebody does not take advantage of the situation in the European Union and say, for example, that the food sector in Ireland is a carbon rich area that puts a high level of responsibility on the economy here to produce alternatives.  It is correct that it does.  However, it should be possible to achieve the standards required across Europe without doing damage to our economy or to the other economies in Europe.<\/p><p>The last issue is bank performance in respect of mortgage arrears, restructuring targets and SME debt.  Every Member of the House, including the Minister, has struggled with this problem for the past six or seven years.  In general, the people have shouldered their responsibilities admirably.  There will always be a minority of people who will see an opportunity to make a quick buck and who will suggest that if enough people opt out they will not have to pay at all.  I hold no brief for those people.  However, there is a body of people who have been very responsible.  They found themselves in difficult circumstances six to eight years ago, which they had great difficulty working out.  Some of it was due to the collapse in the housing market, some was due to the collapse of business, some was the result of the collapse of their health and some was the result of unemployment.  However, they have faithfully managed to make a payment throughout the entire period, be it from their social welfare or whatever.  They continue to pay to this day.<\/p><p>It is very difficult to accept the attitude of some financial institutions.  They say the scene has changed, they are now over the difficulties and it is time to go back to traditional systems and methods.  My response is, &quot;not so fast&quot;.  The lending institutions also had a role in, and responsibility for, what happened to this country.  It was not a small role or responsibility.  It is fine for people to say we must return to the way we were, clean up our act and get everything in order, but we are already doing that.  It is happening.  However, there must be a graduated system whereby those people who made the effort are recognised for making that effort.  That must happen in this country and throughout Europe.  Our European colleagues must recognise the sacrifices that many people, families and businesses in this country have made over the past number of years.  Doing so would be significantly to the advantage of the European project, and obviously to us as members of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#G00100","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2210,"content":"<p>Recognised in what way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#G00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2211,"content":"<p>Not to be so explicit in the determination of the targets that they want to be met within the timescale.  For example, there are countless situations where a person who has a 25 year loan might find themselves reaching 70 years of age before the end of the 25 years.  The lending institutions saw fit to lend to that extent at the time of the institution of the mortgage, but they now see things in a different light.  They say, \"By the way, you will be 72 or 73 before this is repaid\".  \"So what?\", is the correct reply to that.

To start with the question on broadening the tax base, we welcome the fact that the Commission and the Council have acknowledged that Ireland has made significant progress in this regard.  I will not go through the property tax and the other ways in which we have broadened it to date.  Development in the future will be in the space of getting more people back to work and increasing income tax revenues in that way and increasing spending tax revenue through VAT as we see domestic demand and activity growing in the economy.  That is the next phase on which we will focus.<\/p><p>The Europe 2020 strategies are being reviewed at present.  With the exception of the education sector, many of the targets were not achieved, so it remains to be seen what the next set of proposals will be, but the Deputy is spot on: there will have to be a broad engagement across all sectors of Irish life.  This cuts across many of the questions.  Whether it is in Europe 2020 or the country-specific targets, the people who benefit most from achieving the targets in both areas are the Irish people themselves.

It is a very important part of my job to bring to the General Affairs Council the observations and deliberations of this committee, so I will continue to ensure that process works.  There was a strong intervention on Monday evening from Bulgaria.  Many countries from the southern Mediterranean are deeply affected and concerned for the poor individuals involved, who continue to be trafficked.  There was broad consensus on the initial deliberations of the Commission, but that is being discussed as we speak by the Prime Ministers.<\/p><p>There has been reform with respect to pharmaceutical spending.  Nobody is suggesting that reform has been completed.  That is the nature of reform.  The State continues to seek further savings from the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and we must also acknowledge that the process has resulted in the lowering of prices for branded drugs and will have to deliver further savings.<\/p><p><font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>In response to Deputy Keating, it is vital to support people getting back into work and child care is key to this.  Some 100,000 children are supported in the State each year.  There is the community child care subvention and the early childhood care and education scheme.  In budget 2015, the Government increased expenditure on children by &euro;96 million, including increased child benefit payment and a new payment of &euro;30 per child per week for people returning to work.  We are fully aware that we are coming from a very difficult few years and work must continue in that respect.<\/p><p>To some extent, Deputy Durkan gave my answer to Deputy Crowe's questions about the objective that people would not be out of pocket by virtue of the changes.  Deputy Crowe also asked about the demand level.  Subject to demand, as I referenced in my note, the places are reserved in the first instance for the long-term unemployed.  Fortunately, as is the case with all categories of the unemployed, the number of long-term unemployed is decreasing and there are also other options available.  Places available on the courses may not be taken up, so it is possible that places available may exceed demand.  We would have to see how that evolves.<\/p><p>In respect of the country-specific recommendations and how we compare, about which Deputy Durkan asked, on the country-specific report on budget 2015, Ireland was one of only five countries that were fully compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact.  The compliance of other countries is very mixed, but we strongly support the process.  When there are discussions about rules and how compliant we are, it is important to stress that it is for the Irish people that we are complying with these measures, which are delivering strong job creation.  The Deputy asked how we compare generally.  After some very difficult years, we have the fastest growing economy in the European Union for this year, with falling unemployment projected for next year and perhaps even for the year after.  This compliance with these recommendations for countries is in the best interests of the Irish people.  That includes the climate change targets, which the Deputy also mentioned.  Just two or three months ago the European targets for the deliberations, which will take place in Paris, were decided by the European Council.  The specific national elements of that have not been agreed, but they are under active discussion as we speak.<\/p><p>I strongly support the Deputy's comments about the continued role the banks will have to play in ensuring that solutions are found for people.  The other committee of which I was a member before becoming a Minister of State was the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  The engagement of that committee with the banks has been productive in the past and was very productive yesterday.  I congratulate the Chairman, Deputy Liam Twomey, and his committee on that engagement.  All of us who are involved as politicians are aware that, notwithstanding the very positive figures and targets that have been met for some people in banking distress, there are still many people experiencing great difficulty.  We must all must raise at any opportunity the important point that it is never too late for people who are in difficulty with lending institutions to engage, to talk to their lenders and to engage with some of the supports we have.  A significant number of repossessions that take place by court order are a consequence of people not engaging.<\/p><p>The Chairman's questions were very detailed and I am sure that my answers to some of them were a bit brief, but I am aware of the time.

I am not going to comment on the broader foreign policy actions taken by other countries, which is a subjective perspective that people would have.  At my level, as Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs and through attending the Foreign Affairs Council, we are aware there is a human crisis unfolding in the Mediterranean.  We must support and show solidarity with the countries of the southern Mediterranean, in particular, which are trying to help and support people who are being trafficked, and also look at measures to deal in a robust fashion with the traffickers.

We have also been joined by two officials from the committee.<\/p><p>For people who do not know, the Committee of the Regions is comprised of 344 local and regional representatives from across the European Union.  Therefore, it is an important institution which ensures that the views and experiences of local people are fed into EU policy.  We saw the committee during our review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  They raised many issues that ended up in our report, which we published and sent to the Commission.  The issues included making sure that we address regional disparities, and the requirement for strategies, not just from the top down, but involving local and regional organisations in a partnership-based approach, which is a point I made earlier to the Minister of State.

On behalf of the Irish delegation of the European Committee of the Regions, I thank the Chairman for inviting us to make a presentation which follows up on submissions made by our members last year on the national reform programme and the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  We wish to record our appreciation for the interest that the Chairman and his committee have taken in our activities.<\/p> <p>  I shall update the committee on some developments at regional level.  The new terms for the Committee of the Regions came into effect in January last and our mandate continues for five years.  The nine full members and nine alternate members, nominated by the Government, reflect the wide spectrum of councillors elected across the country last May.<\/p> <p>  Last January, the three new regional assemblies came into being.  The assemblies are based in the following areas: Ballymun for the eastern and midlands region; Ballaghaderreen for the northern and western region; and Waterford for the southern region.  Three regional assemblies replaced the eight regional authorities and the two regional assemblies.  However, somewhat confusingly for cohesion policy purposes, the old NUTS II and NUTS III classifications remain in place until at least 2016, with the country remaining divided in two for European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, operational programmes in the Border, midlands and west region and the south and east region, as was the case in the past.  This will run until 2020.<\/p> <p>  My three colleagues have already been introduced.<\/p><p>Our presentation will touch on the Committee of the Regions, COR,<b><\/b>European perspective, differing challenges faced by our regions across Ireland and the newer roles and structures of local and regional government relevant to achieving the European 2020 targets.  The COR has long prioritised implementation of the European 2020 strategy, with particular focus on emphasising the need to recognise and address issues at sub-national level and underlining the importance of partnership and multilevel governance.<br\/><br\/>Since 2011, the COR has been monitoring the involvement of local and regional authorities and their representative bodies in the preparation and implementation of the national reform plans across Europe.  Generally, it has been found that multilevel governance arrangements are being increasingly adopted in many EU countries to implement Europe 2020.  Naturally, these arrangements differ according to how powers are allocated in each country according to the various policy fields.  Over the years, across the EU, there is an increasing trend towards regionally differentiated approaches, along with a greater role for local and regional authorities in implementing the Europe 2020 strategy through the national reform programmes.  Last year, for example, the national reform programme in 24 states mentioned the active role of local and regional authorities in implementation, with use of Structural Funds in particular being key to achieving the Europe 2020 targets.<br\/><br\/>The COR has also found that the disparities between and within countries as measured by gross domestic product and levels of employment are increasingly due to the impact of the economic crisis and pre-existing gaps.  Whereas neither 2014 country-specific recommendations nor the countries report of 2015 make specific reference to regional disparities in the Irish context, there is a need to take account of the varying challenges facing regions.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly touch on the potential of the European Fund for Strategic Investment, also known as the Juncker plan, which has ambitions to invest &euro;315 billion in productive infrastructure based on seed capital of &euro;21 billion in EU money.  When the Minister was here, the Chairman asked if there is buy-in from the regions and that query was not answered.  I emphasise that it is important that all stakeholders in Ireland, including the local government sector, are fully informed of the fund details once they are finalised and that our authorities have an opportunity to benefit from participation.<br\/><br\/>Following lengthy planning in February, the two regional operational programmes to implement the European Regional Development Fund element of the European structural and investment funds were formally signed.  These will see investment of approximately &euro;820 million in Ireland up to 2020, with 50% provided by Brussels.  This underlines the continuing importance of EU regional policy to Irish regions.  These regional operational programmes, ROPs, are the EU's principal investment tool for delivering Europe 2020 goals and a focus on investment, research and development, information and communications technology, competitiveness of small and medium enterprises and a shift to a low carbon economy.  There will also be significant sustainable urban investment in designated gateway towns.  Given these investment priorities and their scale, we would like to see consistency and co-ordination between these Structural Funds and any investments to be developed in Ireland under the Juncker plan.  It is crucial that the new fund be used to address regional disparities and facilitate synergies for further investment across the regions.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman.  Mr. Richmond will now highlight regional imbalances and challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Freehill","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429794000,"counter":2232,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for having us back.  In Ireland, although there has been a very welcome and robust reduction in unemployment, there are marked differences in regional performance, with recovery unevenly spread across the regions.  Using the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS, III classification, since 2012, employment has fallen in the west and south west, while unemployment rates are highest in the midlands and south east.  Labour force participation rates are lowest in the Border and mid-west regions.  As far as income is concerned, Central Statistics Office figures indicate Dublin as the only region with higher <i>per capita<\/i>disposable income than the State averaged during the entire 2003 to 2012 period.  The midland, Border and west regions have continuously earned less than the State average.  For example, in 2012, the disposable income in the midlands was less than 80% of the Dublin figure.<br\/><br\/>The focus of the economic recovery has been on the greater Dublin area and although there is potential for the recovery in greater Dublin to spill over into neighbouring counties, there needs to be concerted action to prevent structural shifts that could further weaken outlying counties and regions.  Statistics can be presented in such a way as to back up differing arguments but it is undeniable that there are regional and local disparities that are best addressed with targeted actions.  For example, it is recognised that city regions are the drivers for economic investment and growth.  Dublin, therefore, is competing globally with the likes of San Diego and Shanghai, rather than locally with Sligo.  Greater Dublin and the &quot;Silicon Docks&quot; area in particular, is a global hub for ICT investment and Dublin is recognised as one of the best places in the world for technology start-ups.  However, a relative decline in Dublin's status as a financial services centre demonstrates that the city and the region must strive to improve its competitiveness and attractiveness to ensure continuing foreign as well as domestic investment.<br\/><br\/>There are major challenges facing the metropolitan area that could put future investment in jeopardy, such as the availability of reasonably priced housing, increasing congestion and the very small degree of wiggle-room with water resources now available.  Equally, the relative decline of our universities in global rankings needs to be reversed.  Whatever about average GDP rates, there are pockets of deprivation that need targeted interventions.  More broadly, these differing regional strengths and weaknesses indicate that more nuanced regional targets, taking heed of regional strengths and weaknesses, may be more appropriate than one size fits all national targets.  A particular challenge for the eastern and midland regional assembly established in January in addition to its statutory responsibilities will be to forge its identity with the wider public service sector over the coming years and develop its own operational programme for Structural Funds.  This process would start with the realignment of the NUTS regions next year.<br\/><br\/>We also very much appreciate the strong regional element of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's 2015 Action Plan for Jobs, based on the NUTS III regions.  We strongly welcome this process to support job creation across the country by supporting agencies and organisations within each region to build on their particular strengths and assets and drive new job creation projects and strategies.  The eastern and midland regional assembly area naturally includes the midlands, with its own set of priorities and challenges, and I congratulate Longford County Council and Coillte on the recent Center Parcs announcement, which is a great example of ensuring that every region has the opportunity to make the best of its own resources.<br\/><br\/>I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Maria Byrne from Limerick City and County Council, who will highlight elements of recent local government reform relevant to the national reform programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neale Richmond"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429794000,"counter":2233,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  As the committee appreciates, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gave legislative effect to commitments to reform local government and provide it with a more central role in local economic, social and community development.  The Act requires that each local authority establish a dedicated strategic policy committee for economic development, which is required to guide and support economic and enterprise development at county level.  The Act also includes the establishment of local community development committees and local enterprise offices.  The statutory function of the local community development committees includes the preparation and implementation of the community elements and the review of the economic elements of the local economic and community plans, the economic element being prepared by the local enterprise office.<\/p> <p>  The management and oversight of local development companies brings responsibility for national funding programmes to a local level, with the implementation of the social inclusion community and activation programme to support local strategies for social inclusion issues promoting access to life-long learning, employment and social enterprise.<\/p><p>The LCDCs will also facilitate the Leader element of the rural development programme by taking a management as well as an applicant role to support economic development projects for rural communities.  Under Leader, &euro;250 million will be available in the period to 2020 and the selection process for local action groups has commenced.<\/p><p> These more recent developments, in addition to the wider responsibilities of local authorities, indicate that we will have a direct impact on the achievement of elements of the national European 2020 targets, and in addressing several of the CSRs on labour market and SME policies.  This should be reflected in the National Reform Plan.  Unfortunately, however, there was no mention of these local authority roles in the NRP.<\/p><p> The establishment of three new regional assemblies in January was described by the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, as an opportunity to frame new governance institutions, to counteract unbalanced development and promote regional recovery.  The key function of the new regional assemblies will be to develop new regional, spatial and economic strategies to come on stream from 2016 onwards.  These strategies will be underpinned to ensure that all relevant public sector bodies with responsibility for economic development and enterprise promotion follow through on implementation.<\/p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, has indicated that all relevant agencies will be accountable to the regional assemblies as regards progress being made towards achieving the objectives of the new regional strategies. <\/p><p> In the Irish context, with increasing congestion in and around the capital, strategies to increase investment throughout the so-called two-tier cities, such as Limerick, would be more environmentally sustainable.  Moreover, academic studies have demonstrated that because cities like Limerick have greater potential for growth, investments in these cities will very likely show a greater return.<\/p><p> I will give a small example of something we have done in Limerick.  We have established another company under the auspices of the local authority called Innovate Limerick.  It is made up of local authority representatives and council management, as well as public and private sector businesses and representatives from education.  The key aims of Innovate Limerick are: to establish Limerick's innovation hub as Ireland's first growth accelerator; grow dynamic industry and sector partnerships; double the number of innovation partnerships and SME-FTI linkages; double the number of incubating and accelerating firms; also double the number of HPSUs; and deliver the national centre for social innovation.

As a member of the Committee of the Regions and an independent member of Leitrim County Council, it is a great honour for me to be here and I am grateful for the invitation.<\/p> <p>  I would like to summarise our position and underline what we would like to see in the NRP.  In the Irish context, the approach to Europe 2020 and the National Reform Programme process have plenty of room for improvement.  As we see it, discussion on national targets is essentially confined within a number of Government Departments, with measures selected largely from existing national policy documents to achieve them.  Ireland is not alone in this regard, but the centralised and closed nature of the process here is particularly acute.<\/p> <p>  Later this year, the mid&ndash;term review of the Europe 2020 strategy is due to be presented.  It is likely that attention will be drawn to the need for greater partnership in the development, ownership and implementation of national reform plans.  We would also expect to see expression of the need for more regionally differentiated targets.<\/p> <p>  This year in the Irish NRP we hope to see, as a general approach, at least a recognition of regional disparities and the need for specific policy actions at regional level.  Unfortunately, this was not visible in the draft programme circulated to stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the future Irish NRPs, we would welcome increased consultation with stakeholders at local and regional levels.  We would advocate giving a clear territorial dimension by setting regionally differentiated targets, with regional indicators to assess progress in a process that would include all relevant tiers of governance.<\/p> <p>  This is what we are proposing when it comes to the Europe 2020 strategy and how its targets can be achieved effectively &ndash; a whole-of-Government approach.  This includes national, regional and local government as well as other agencies and key stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  With a new national planning framework to succeed the National Spatial Strategy expected in 2016, we would expect to see more coherence and consistency with regard to economic, social and territorial planning.  Development of the NRPs must be part of, and contribute to, this coherence.<\/p> <p>  Future National Reform Programmes should be compatible with, and must inform, the priorities of the regional spatial and economic strategies, which in turn provide a framework for local economic and community plans.<\/p> <p>  In this context, we would therefore like to see the Department of the Taoiseach provide a roadmap for a more structured, continuous and constructive engagement with NRP stakeholders after the mid-term review.<\/p> <p>  I would briefly like to mention one other relevant issue concerning climate change targets.  On 1 April, milk quotas were finally abolished and this has liberated Irish milk farmers and processors to do more of what we are among the best in the world at doing.<\/p> <p>  Last week, I was pleased that the Committee of the Regions formally adopted my recommendation that EU climate change and food security policies need to be reconciled so that the most carbon-efficient and environmentally-sustainable agricultural production systems are supported.   Irish food production has an extremely low carbon footprint, but we cannot take things for granted.  Our farmers - I am a farmer myself - and scientists must continue to improve our adaptation and mitigation measures so that our potential to sustainably produce food is not threatened.  I will leave it at that Chairman but we would be happy to respond to any questions and comments members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Stenson"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2236,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions for Councillor Stenson, the first of which is on regional disparities in economic growth.

Could more be done and, if so, in what areas?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns the involvement of stakeholders in the National Reform Programme.

People might not be aware that there is greater industrial output in the Cork-Kerry region than in Dublin and the greater Dublin region.  We are doing well, particularly in the Cork region.  A report will be produced at the end of October or beginning of November about whether Cork county and city councils should amalgamate.  The population is 526,000 in County Cork and in the Cork-Kerry region it is over 650,000.  From their own experience do the witnesses think there is an advantage in the reforms that have occurred or is too early to judge?  For example, does Limerick have a stronger pitch for getting its share of the national cake because there is now a coordinated approach, instead of many local authorities competing with one another?  Would there be a better distribution of jobs and other infrastructural development if Cork city and county councils amalgamate?

I have comments and observations on all of them, maybe not in logical order but in the order of the presentations.  The witnesses spoke about the whole-of-government approach including national, regional and local government as well as agencies and key stakeholders.  Have we ever really achieved regional government?  It has been on the cards on numerous occasions.  We have had numerous reports about how to develop an Ireland of the regions, and we can talk about the Cork region, as Senator Burke did.  This point is close to my heart.  People talk, for example, about the Dublin region but there are regions within regions, in other words, there are regions within Dublin.  Quite often people dismiss Dublin or the Dublin region as if it were a single entity rather than several regions with separate issues and complications.  We have a great deal more work to do in developing a regional approach.  Do the witnesses, especially Councillor Stenson, have any comments on that?<\/p> <p>  Councillor Byrne mentioned the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP, tender process.  It was incredibly badly handled.  Much of what happened was illogical, with partnerships bidding against each other, although they were dealing with completely different regions, for example, Ballymun and Blanchardstown, which are not interchangeable.  Senator Burke mentioned the population of 500,000 in Cork city and county but in the Dublin region the population is over 1 million.  The process undermined the valuable work partnerships had done.  Does Councillor Byrne have any comments on that? <\/p> <p>  Councillor Richmond mentioned housing.  It is important, when talking about income and disposable income, to take on board the fact that there are greater costs imposed on people living in urban areas such as Cork, Dublin, Galway, and to a lesser extent Limerick, in order to provide housing.  There are significant pressures on people to provide housing.  There is a big wash-out in mortgage arrears, which in terms of the country specific recommendations, is a major issue that will hit urban Ireland in particular.  Would Councillor Richmond like to say something about the regional disparities that put pressure on people&rsquo;s disposable incomes, such as the cost of housing?<\/p> <p>  The Government has set up the Office for Government Procurement, OGP, which has centralised the tendering and procurement process for State agencies.  This creates a problem because trying to achieve best value for the taxpayer at the same time as centralising the tendering process may rule out regional competitors, for example, as happened with certain procurement for hospitals, or the leaving certificate exam papers when a Spanish company got the job.

Some may be isolated and an anchor investor is required in those regions.  I recall going to Germany a few years ago but I will not say how many.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#M00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2245,"content":"<p>Was it pre- or post-War?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#M00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2246,"content":"<p>Many people were not born at the time.  I was on one of those much-criticised junkets.  It was a learning experience and one of the first things we learnt was in Stuttgart, headquarters of Mercedes manufacturing, where there were 20,000 people worked.  The benefit was visible as one approached the city, one knew there was a big player in the area because so many ancillary industries had piggybacked on to it to make it much bigger.<\/p><p>We have to do that in this country.  I use the example of the Shannon development zone which was very effective in years gone by.  It was a co-ordinated plan and those of us who were not from that area travelled there to see what was available.  The nearby airport was used very effectively at that time, although circumstances have changed since.  It had a co-ordinated plan which affected the whole region.  Immediately one drove into the area one could sense that there was something afoot.<\/p><p> We have to replicate that performance in particular throughout the midlands, the mid-west, the south and in the north west.  I agree with the references to the development in Longford which is a worthwhile experience, a great development and a great proposal and we hope that it goes well.  It is up to the local people there to drive it on from there.  There was an equally welcome investment in the Waterford-Kilkenny area in recent times and also in Tipperary and various other regions. It is the beginning but there is a long way to go.  The geographic isolation needs to be addressed.  The social and economic deprivation to which my colleague referred has to be addressed in cities and towns, in both urban and rural areas.<\/p><p> When one is in the trenches for a while - as we all try to be - one notices things in a way that the people living there all the time do not necessarily notice.  For example, I remember canvassing in a by-election - I will not say where - in an urban area and seeing the children coming home from school and studying in stairwells that were littered with disused needles and various other items and castoffs - not the proper environment nor the kind of environment in which we would expect our children to excel.  It is not fair to them and there is no necessity for it.  We need to spend much more time addressing those social issues, including that kind of deprivation that forces children at first or second level of schooling to study in an environment that is anything but conducive to study.  Those coming from that bacground will be at a disadvantage when they go into the workplace in order to compete with others.  I support the remarks made by my colleague, Senator Aileen Hayden.  There is a great deal of scope for improvement that we have not tapped into.  It applies to all our cities and to some rural areas.<\/p><p> I referred to the question of anchor investors.  We need them, we need to look after them, we need to ensure they stay here and we need to ensure they continue to come.  No industry lasts forever in that times change and we have to be prepared.  In the context of planning we need to encourage our local authorities to try to ensure that they plan sensitively in order to give the best possible opportunity to those providing jobs in order for them to do so in the respective regions.  The local authorities should not impose restrictions to the extent that people will decide it is not worth the risk and they will go elsewhere.  <\/p><p> We need to prioritise the issues that impact most on us.  For instance, in the urban areas, access to proper areas of recreation is an issue that must be dealt with to a far greater extent than has been the case.  The Government is doing this but we must improve on it.  Access to sport is a means of deflecting attention from other activities that are not so constructive and certainly not so useful in the workplace.  I refer to basic requirements such as access to water.  Water services will become a huge issue in the future, much more than we have ever experienced.  Major industries coming to this country and existing indigenous industries will rely heavily on high quality water supply and instant availability.  They do not want to wait for two, three or ten years before they get it.  We need to have the best of modern telecommunications such as broadband available throughout all the regions.  In the area of transport there has been reference to congestion and rightly so.  In particular this is the case in the eastern region all the time.  We need to implement counter-measures.  For instance, the M50 any morning at rush hour is jammed with traffic.  It reached over-capacity a long time ago.  We need to plan for the future, not just for the moment.  The Naas dual carriageway stood the test of time for far longer than some of the more recent introductions to that area.  <\/p><p> Climate change is an important issue which has the potential to impact positively or negatively on our most important industry, in particular, in the context of economic recovery.  In the recent past, during the boom, for instance, little regard was had for the agricultural sector and nobody wanted to know about it.  Sons and daughters from the agricultural community wanted to get into development or go anywhere else other than agriculture.  When the crunch came, it showed that our basic industries were the ones that carried the responsibility and had the ability to recover much more quickly than any other sector.  I agree entirely with and I strongly support every effort that can be made to ensure that we comply with the requirements and that we do not incur carbon penalties to the extent that this might happen, resulting in the obvious negative impact on the whole industry and associated industries.  We must maximise the availability of realisable alternative energy because it is on that basis that we will be able to compete with all others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#M00500","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2248,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I will be brief in my contribution.  I refer to references in the presentation to regional disparities.  I agree with my colleagues that parts of Dublin have not seen the so-called growth and development in the region.  Many of those areas were left behind during the boom times.  They are still being left behind and another cycle begins.  <\/p> <p>  The delegates are meeting their European counterparts in committees.  Is there any sense that they understand the sacrifices and the difficulties that people have endured in Ireland and in countries like Ireland?  There does not seem to be this understanding at other levels.  People think that we have done well, that we are now in recovery mode and the country is back on track.  There is no sense of the sacrifices that have been made and the sacrifices that are still being made.  Do the delegates regard their role as complementing the Minister or do they regard their role as being separate with a separate voice and pair of eyes at local and regional level?  I am trying to tease that out for people who are listening at home.  The jargon we use in this meeting is NUTS III classification but people are scratching their heads wondering what is NUTS III.  The language we use, such as reference to LEOs, is completely different to the language used by ordinary people.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned two-tier development or recovery  when speaking to the Minister.  I spoke about job creation.  Do people in Europe understand that many of the new jobs created are low-income jobs?  Is there any sense or understanding that Ireland has proportionately the highest number of people in low-income jobs in Europe?<\/p><p>We had a spatial strategy during the boom times.  What happened to it?  That development did not happen.  The Minister is now talking about developing a new spatial strategy.  That is certainly the way to go.  The local authorities are going to oversee it.  This problem developed when all sorts of structures were in place.  The previous spatial strategy was led by the Government, but it did not happen in many regions.  I could refer to many of the places where the councillors are from, including counties Leitrim and Limerick.  There were weaknesses within the strategy.  Are the councillors confident that this will work at local level?  In my experience, the Government does not really listen to local authority members.  I am worried that if this is the driver for change, if this is how the spatial strategy is going to be rolled out, at some stage the Minister will say he does not necessarily agree with it and it will be pushed to one side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#N00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2250,"content":"<p>A number of questions have been asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#O00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429794000,"counter":2251,"content":"<p>Will I start as the lead speaker?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Freehill"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2252,"content":"<p>Perhaps Ms Freehill can start.

We thank the Chairman for facilitating that.  It is the first time such an initiative has been taken.  It is very important to recognise that we need much more interaction.  The committee can talk to us, but we cannot talk to the committee.  Perhaps we can see how that might be changed.<\/p> <p>  It was music to my ears to hear the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government say last week that it is time for the regions to play to their strengths.  I think there has been a very welcome change in attitude.  Historically, Ireland has been way behind many other countries in terms of the level of centrality of the system of governance.  Maybe this is one of the good things that might come out of the process of local government reform.  It is up to all of us to start working on this.<\/p> <p>  I would like to speak about economic growth.  There is no doubt that IDA Ireland is very regionalised.  It is working very well at that level.  There is a need to connect that into the regional assemblies.  We used to have two regional assemblies but we now have three.  All of that has to bed down.  More clarity is needed from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in terms of how we will work on that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe mentioned the use of nomenclature like NUTS II and NUTS III.  I suggest there is very real meaning in that in so far as it presents us with the figures and what we have to deal with.  A great deal of clarity is needed in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The regional assemblies are certainly up for it.  We want to work.  Although we are here from the European Committee of the Regions, we are also members of regional assemblies.  If we are to work, the regional assemblies have to work.  It is about everyone working together.<\/p> <p>  Senator Hayden asked whether this has really started.  I am saying that we need a team approach.  We had a meeting with Declan Kelleher, who is Ireland's ambassador at the permanent representation in Brussels, when we were in that city last week.  It was a welcome first step because it allows us to start moving on this and to operate in a much more coherent way.<\/p> <p>  Senator Hayden asked about the centralisation of procurement and about the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP.  Both of those questions can be answered in the same way.  A very centralised approach to all of this was probably taken.  I wonder whether a sufficient percentage of value was assigned to track records, to local knowledge and to what had been done in the past when projects were being weighed and evaluated under SICAP.  I have questions about the way that was done.  Perhaps the same thing applies to procurement, although that is saving money and probably creates much more transparency than we might otherwise have had.  I think these things always have to be looked at again.<\/p> <p>  I would like to respond to Deputy Durkan, who was a councillor at one stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Freehill"},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2254,"content":"<p>Once upon a time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#O00600","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429794000,"counter":2255,"content":"<p>We worked together.  The Deputy spoke about Germany, etc.  I come back to the point that a co-ordinated plan is needed for the regions.  One of our big difficulties is that national statistics and indicators keep being used.  We need to make much more use of our regional indicators.  I took that up at a recent meeting of the European Committee of the Regions when reference was made to 80% broadband coverage.  That was probably the national figure.  As we know, the provision of broadband in Ireland was left to the market and we saw what happened.  The Minister, Deputy White, is doing a very good job in rectifying all of that at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe referred to regional disparities.  The European Committee of the Regions is extremely concerned about the urban indicators because the presence of the wealthiest people within a city means the existence of the highest level of poverty in the same city does not show up.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to those who are low paid.  When we were waiting for the airplane with our Northern Ireland colleagues on our way back from Brussels the other day, they pointed out that salaries in the South are 15% higher, even among low-paid workers, than they are in the North.

I probably have the longest journey home and transport to Leitrim is not always the easiest.  I know my colleagues will cover everything that needs to be said.  I believe there should be better consultation with local authorities.  There is a lack of consultation in this country from top to bottom.  We can be working away, but I am not sure at times.  I do not know whether the funding is coming through to help the wonderful regional assemblies and their wonderful staff.  The western and Border regions probably suffered more over the years of the Troubles and all of that than any other region of this country.  I think we deserve better help at times.  Our transport system and everything else is not at the same level.<\/p> <p>  We have three regions in this country - the Dublin region, the southern region and the western region.  The western region might be the poorest of the three.  I believe something has to be done for our rural towns, particularly in the western region.  The centres of many rural towns are dying.  We need to get help from somewhere.  I appeal to the relevant authorities to help us through this.  I know there was a programme on RTE lately about rural degeneration.  There is no place like the west and rural Ireland.  People might be surprised to hear I would never for the life of me leave somewhere like Leitrim.  We love that part of the country.  I think there should be greater co-operation with places like our region.  I appeal to people in higher levels of authority to facilitate that.<\/p> <p>  We used to have a huge industry in our county.  Deputy Durkan mentioned that up to 20,000 people are employed in large places in Germany.  That is comparable in relative terms to what we had in Carrick-on-Shannon when MBNA employed 1,200 people there.  When people came into the town, they immediately knew something was happening.  Sadly, MBNA is gone.  The regions should be supported in things like that.  Employment should be given back to the regions.  That is what will keep the regions alive.

There are a couple of points I will address in as chronological an order as I can.  The regional spread and aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs was raised.  It is something we have seen quite a bit in the three years since the Action Plan for Jobs was launched.  It was initially focused on the larger urban areas, and definitely Dublin, which was probably necessary to restore the holes and go not for the quick fixes but for areas where it was easier to attract jobs straight after the crash.  However, we are starting to see that improve with, for example, Centre Parcs in Longford, which sounds brilliant to me.  There is an entire strategy for the midlands which is due to come on stream, we are told by the Government, in the coming months.  That could add a great deal to the regional aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs.  It is something that is greatly needed.  As my colleagues have mentioned, the co-operation between Enterprise Ireland and the IDA has been top class in terms of bringing in jobs.  We see the people going across to foreign countries and operating within the internal market to attract investment.  They are going out flying the flag and wearing the jersey.  It is something of which we should be very proud and to see a regional dimension come into it is definitely welcome.  It will allow for longer-term sustainable growth.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned an anchor investor but as Councillor Stenson mentioned in the cases of MBNA and, Councillor Maria Byrne will probably not thank me for saying it, Dell, we saw the risks that come with putting all our apples with one big anchor investor.  We feel a cluster of investors is required.  It is about having an area for the region where a number of companies come in, not just a large one-stop shop on which a whole town or city relies.  It is about a couple of companies starting from SMEs, which are the backbone of the European economy, building up to the larger ones.  They all feed in, tying into third level institutions and also second level with whatever training programmes are there.  That is where the local authorities come in.<\/p> <p>  The issue about disposable income after taxation, which Senator Hayden raised, is extremely apparent in Dublin, especially when it comes to the housing crisis.  The housing crisis is at all levels.  It is an affordable housing crisis as much as a social housing crisis.  It is the generation to which I belong which is looking to get a foot on the property ladder.  Let us face the fact that Irish people are addicted to owning property.  We must face that as an aspect of our culture.  When one is going out looking at mortgage compared to rental options in Dublin, it is simply cheaper to get a mortgage per month than to pay out rent, especially for a three-bedroom semi-detached house or two-bedroom apartment.<\/p> <p>  I do not know how popular I will be with Councillor Maria Byrne for saying that what we would like to see is local authorities and the Government playing a balancing act on the local property tax.  It is something that is coming up repeatedly.  On my authority of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which Senator Hayden will know, we reduced the property tax by 15%, as did Dublin City Council, in our first year since the local elections.  We were able to do it - the funds were in place - even though we only got to hold on to 80% of our property tax.  We cannot do that again for four years.  That is done.  We do not know what the property market will do and what sort of measures the Government will introduce on the revaluation of properties, especially in Dublin.  We have reduced the property tax by 15%, but in many places in Dublin property values have gone up 30% since the original revaluation.  Is the solution from central government and the Minister for Finance simply to freeze the valuation of properties as is at the rate, or is it to give local authorities in Dublin the opportunity to reduce it or increase it as much as they see fit in order to produce the services they need?  That is something that could address Dublin-specific concerns around disposable income.  I know a great many people who noticed that 15% coming off their bills this year.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe made some comments and suggestions.  When we go over to Brussels, we go as a delegation of nine Irish people having met beforehand.

Councillors McCarthy, Stenson and McGrath, who are all independents, sit in the European Free Alliance which used to involve Fianna F&aacute;il and the Europe of the Nations group once upon a time.  As a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor, Rose Conway Walsh from Mayo sits as an independent.  Our two Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues sit in the liberal ALDE group.

Maria Byrne and I are proud members of Fine Gael and the EPP, as are all the members of their respective affiliations, and we must do what we believe accords with our political persuasions.  We are talking about certain different things.  We will have different opinions on everything political, but that is the way it goes.<\/p> <p>  There is definitely an appreciation at a European level on the sacrifices Ireland has made.  Maria Byrne and I had a meeting with a number of leading EPP MEPs and members of the European Council, Heads of State and Ministers when we were over for plenary last week.  All of them speaking to our entire group of representatives from 28 member states cited the examples of both Ireland and Portugal as counties which have made deep and meaningful sacrifices, albeit sacrifices with a direction.  They were made for a reason, which was to get back on an even keel.  We will probably disagree politically on whether it was the right thing to do, but there is a recognition that something was done and things definitely have changed at an Irish level.  We are seeing that with the type of jobs that are coming on stream.  They are not all low-paid jobs.  We are seeing some really high-paying high-tech jobs.  Within the fin-tech sector, there is a potential in the next 20 years for 5,000 jobs with an average wage of &euro;80,000 per annum.  That is a high-quality sustainable job of the type we need to attract to Ireland and not just for Dublin, Cork or the Kerry region.  We need such jobs throughout the entire country because that is where we compete against the other European regions such as Poland and the UK, especially Scotland.

In Limerick, people welcomed the fact that the Minister came down and spoke directly.  There were people there to give advice and there was interaction.  People felt their voices were being heard, which was very important.  It was not seen that everything was happening above in Dublin but that things were spread throughout the country.  That is just a comment I heard back.<\/p> <p>  Senator Burke asked a question about Limerick and the amalgamation of the local authorities.  We have had the amalgamation of Limerick city and county councils since last year, but we sat as two separate councils leading up to the local elections, since which all 40 councillors have sat around the same table.  It has certainly involved a learning curve for everyone.  Of the old city council, only six councillors were returned whereas a significant number of county councillors from the former county council were returned.  The rest is made up of newly elected members.  Some of my colleagues come from the really urban areas while my own area goes from urban to extremely urban and rural to extremely rural and is very diverse compared with when I was on the city council.  I am covering everything from one-off housing applications to investment in the city centre.  It is very different.<\/p> <p>  Certainly there has been a great deal of emphasis on the redevelopment of the city centre.  Limerick city was governed by three local authorities previously.  One had Limerick City Council, Limerick County Council and Clare County Council on the outskirts.  A number of out-of-town shopping centres were granted permission with a detrimental effect on the city centre.  We are now operating as a unit.  Deputy Durkan referred to the Shannon Development lands and it is interesting that there is now a partnership approach between the educational institutions and Shannon Airport, which is in Clare.  There is a joined-up thinking approach that was never there before.  When I was first elected in 1999, the city operated as the city and everybody else operated separately.  The joined-up approach has certainly helped.  A number of my colleagues in the really rural areas see the city and investment in the city centre as a threat, however.  This goes back to my reference earlier to Innovate Limerick, which we set up under the LEOs and the economic development unit.<\/p><p>They have purchased six incubation units, which are located not only in the city but the county, including the Andersen plant in Rathkeale which is an extremely rural area.  Occupancy at this plant is currently 80%, with some companies having purchased part of the plant and the remainder paying rent.  A further 20% remains unoccupied.<\/p><p> We have also purchased other key infrastructure.  It is all about providing space, the returns from which will be invested in our economic development plan.  There is more joined-up thinking now than in the past.  We are on a learning curve.  It will take up to two election terms before everybody is satisfied that we are all operating on a level playing field.  However, this is the most positive thing that has happened and in the long-term it will benefit not only Limerick but the region in that we will into the future be working together rather than competing with one another.  <\/p><p> In terms of the housing crisis, there are more than 5,000 people on our housing waiting list.  Councillor Richmond mentioned that people in Ireland like to own their home while across Europe people predominantly like to rent.  I spoke only yesterday to a person who has been renting a house in an urban area, in respect of which the rent up to now was &euro;500 per month but has since been increased to &euro;800 per month.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.  <\/p><p> The Social Inclusion Community and Activation Programme, SICAP, was mentioned.  The fact that funding for urban and rural development is to be administered locally is very positive.  In Limerick, PAUL Partnership and the rural development companies now operate under one umbrella.  This means there will be equal distribution in terms of funding provision for relevant projects.  As regards the one-size fits all for the different regions, I do not think that will be the case.  Each region is different and has their own difficulties and crises which need to be addressed.  While the regions need to work together, the same issues do not arise across the board.  <\/p><p> Local SMEs are covered by our economic development unit.  Councillor Richmond referred to Dell.  I was delighted to hear the 100 job announcement by the company today.  While previously there were 3,500 people working at that plant the current workforce is only approximately 1,000, but it appears it is set to increase.  While that is very positive it is important we do not put all of our eggs in the one basket.  Job losses at that plant had a huge socioeconomic affect not only on Limerick but on the region because there were people working there from counties Tipperary, Clare and Kerry as well.  It is good see a company increasing its workforce.  <\/p><p> Recreation and sport was mentioned.  All across the country we have fine facilities in this regard.  The linkage between sport and business is to be commended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015042300002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429794000,"counter":2269,"content":"<p>I thank all of our witnesses for attending today's meeting and for their useful contributions.

In 2012, we appeared before the committee when the Chairman was a member of it.  We had a useful conversation and debate that day.<br\/><br\/><i>safe<\/i>food was set up as the Food Safety Promotion Board under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement as one of six implementation bodies established under the Belfast agreement in December 1999.  <i>safe<\/i>food implements, on an all-island and cross-Border basis, policies agreed in the North-South Ministerial Council, the most recent of which was held in Derry last Wednesday.  Departmental responsibility rests with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Belfast and the Department of Health in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>Our budget for 2015 is &euro;7.8 million, roughly &pound;6.3 million sterling.  Funding is provided by the Oireachtas and by the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Oireachtas provides 70% of the funding, with 30% coming from the Northern Ireland Assembly.  <i>safe<\/i>food does not have a direct involvement in public communications relating to food safety incidents and alerts as these responsibilities are assigned to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in the South and the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland.  Our headquarters is in Little Island in Cork, with a sub-office in Dublin that houses our marketing and communications people.  This leaves us with four directorates reporting to the chief executive.<br\/><br\/><i>safe<\/i>food&rsquo;s strategy links economic, social, and cultural factors continue to change over time, influencing consumer concerns and their perceptions of behaviour in regard to food.  The food industry continues to grow globally and, from time to time, there are outbreaks of food-borne illness or incidents that will further alter consumer perceptions and occasionally dent confidence.  <i>safe<\/i>food monitors these concerns and utilises its resources to appropriately inform and, where necessary, reassure consumers so that they may continue to make healthy and safe food choices.  We also use targeted consumer messages to further inform, support and motivate consumers to put food safety and healthy eating at the centre stage of their lifestyle choice.<br\/><br\/>Our focus has evolved from individual food poisoning crises and pathogens to an emphasis on the four c&rsquo;s, cook, clean, chill and cross-contamination; from limited individual nutrient information to a holistic approach to the obesity epidemic; from bench research to applied and behavioural research; from mass media campaigns to multi-component integrated campaigns; and from print and traditional media to social media.  We are aware of the wider public health context in which we operate and we work in partnership with Governments and professional partners across the island of Ireland to inform consumers of positive lifestyle choices to improve their health, particularly nutritional advice and good food safety practice.<br\/><br\/>Our most recent campaign was on childhood obesity, the aim of which was to communicate practical solutions that parents can adopt to help them tackle the everyday habits associated with excess weight in childhood.  To date, six television ads have been developed covering the topics of portion size, treats, fizzy drinks, physical activity and sleep.  Some members may have noted that our sleep television ad went out this week.<br\/><br\/>These messages have been augmented with radio and outdoor advertising as well as considerable digital and social media activity.  We have partnered with the HSE and Healthy Ireland in the South and the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland.  Resources have been disseminated through Early Childhood Ireland in the South and Early Years in Northern Ireland.  All GP surgeries have been circulated with leaflets detailing practical tips for parents and we have also partnered with the Irish College of General Practitioners in the development of a resource to help general practice tackle this important and sensitive issue.<br\/><br\/>Our most recent food safety campaign related to chicken and campylobacter.  With eight out of ten adults eating chicken every week, consumers need to be reminded to ensure that chicken is cooked and handled properly to avoid food-borne illnesses.  In November 2014, we launched a food safety awareness campaign in partnership with the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland with the theme, Don't Wash Raw Chicken.  Campylobacter is one of the most common causes of bacterial food poisoning on the island of Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>I would like to mention another strong piece of consumer communication in the area of obesity on which <i>safe<\/i>food is delighted to have worked, that is, the RTE programme &quot;Operation Transformation&quot;.  On review of one of the earlier programmes in the series, we spotted the opportunity to get involved in the programme and have worked closely for the past five years with the programme makers in the development and roll-out of the series.  The show and its format have been a phenomenal success across the island and is being applauded around the world.  It has been adopted in Belgium, France and the USA.  It has not only worked on an individual level in helping people to lose weight but also on a community level, managing to get hundreds of communities engaged, motivated and moving. <br\/><br\/>The 2015 programme ran for six weeks in January and February to an audience of just under 500,000, and 314 communities across the island started weight loss groups.  Some 20% of those who watched the show claimed to have lost weight, with 46% of those claiming to have lost between 0 lbs and 6 lbs.  Some 23% of those who watched the show have claimed that, since the show ended, they are being more active and 21% are now eating healthier food.  <br\/><br\/>I refer to our education initiatives.  With up to one in five teenagers leaving school early, this can impact negatively on their longer-term health, as limited knowledge about  healthy eating and physical activity is a contributory factor to the growing problem of obesity on the island.  In partnership with Youthreach and the Northern Ireland NEET forum for those not in education, employment or training, we developed <i>www.eatright.eu<\/i>and launched it in 2014 to help inform these early school leavers about nutrition and general cooking skills.  One of our successful programmes mentioned by the Chairman in his introduction was the community food initiatives.<br\/><br\/>We are in our second tranche of ten projects, which we fund for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.  These are collaborative, community projects that cover areas from Antrim to Cork.  They are targeted at a low-income audience and the emphasis is on cooking skills, growing food, nutrition and food education and food supply.  It has proved to be successful.<br\/><br\/><i>safe<\/i>food has promoted food safety and hygiene across the food chain through the establishment of all-island food safety networks.  These collaborative arrangements, called knowledge networks, create and augment linkages across the island between food safety professionals.  Many food professionals, not only North-South but also east-west, do not get the opportunity to meet and share the issues that arise.  This has been a great success over the years.<br\/><br\/>With regard to research, we have continued to undertake appropriate research and knowledge-gathering in order to address gaps in scientific knowledge related to our core areas of food safety, hygiene and healthy eating.  This builds the evidence base that facilitates <i>safe<\/i>food&rsquo;s communications to consumers and food safety professionals across the food chain.  Our aim is always to provide messages that are supported by science and that are clear, concise, authoritative, relevant and independent.  Our information must be accessible, accurate, and supportive of public policy.  I, and my colleagues, will be delighted to take any questions that members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Dolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1429780800,"counter":2283,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Dolan and his colleagues.  The importance of the body is evident from the fact that it was one of the six of implementation bodies established following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  The last point concerned research.  Does <i>safe<\/i>food collaborate with institutes of technology and universities throughout the island of Ireland on research?  One of my bugbears is the amount of duplication in this country.  Representing two southern Ulster counties, I see too much duplication and not enough collaboration at public service level in general.  There is plenty of potential for consolidating research in one university, institute of technology or research institute instead of everyone doing a little bit of this and that.  It is not putting public money to best use or getting the best outcomes from research.  I have noticed, over the past few years, more third level institutions developing food programmes and it concerns me.  It is always better to have specialist centres.  We know about the value of specialist centres in the delivery in health services.  It is similar in research and innovation.<\/p><p>We have expertise in and a focus on particular areas.  Does <i>safe<\/i>food collaborate with third level institutes throughout the island of Ireland?  I presume there is room for improvement with regard to co-operation and eliminating duplication.<br\/><br\/>On food poisoning caused by chicken, the delegates have noted that they launched the food safety awareness campaign in partnership with the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland.  There was no mention of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in that context.  Was it because of fiefdom building or defence that it was not involved?<br\/><br\/>In regard to childhood obesity and awareness campaigns, the delegates mentioned fizzy drinks.  Sports sponsorship is a related and contentious issue, particularly alcohol companies sponsoring sports programmes.  What non-alcoholic drinks pose particular dangers?<br\/><br\/>People sometimes confuse <i>safe<\/i>food and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, although I know that they have separate remits.  <i>safe<\/i>food's role is the promotion of good health and lifestyle standards.  Advertising and marketing programmes are often the only way to get the message out, but perhaps it would also be useful to go into the marketplace to meet potential consumers.  Ten years ago I was involved in the roll-out of the Food Dude programme which aimed to persuade children to eat more fruit and vegetables.  The outcome of the programme was very satisfactory.  Children were provided with various fruits and vegetables at school and by this means they often educated their own parents on the importance of consuming fruit and vegetables.  It is welcome that <i>safe<\/i>food is working with YouthReach and its counterpart north of the Border.  Have the delegates thought about working at primary school level?  I recognise that the question arises of finding resources to reach the 3,000 primary schools in the State.  However, in working with children, they will bring the message to their parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#C00400","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429780800,"counter":2285,"content":"<p>I will begin by addressing the question on the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, because I am familiar with that organisation having previously worked for it.  It had responsibility for communicating with consumers when it was established under legislation introduced in 1997.  When <i>safe<\/i>food subsequently came on board as a result of the Belfast Agreement, the authority lost its remit of communicating with the consumer.  As the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland has the remit of communicating with consumers, we partner it in that context.  It was not a case of fiefdom building.  This arrangement works well and the FSAI is happy with it.<br\/><br\/>All of our research is put out to tender and we have a good relationship with the various academic institutions.  Certain institutions have strong expertise in different areas of food science.  UCC, UCD, Queens University Belfast and the University of Ulster all have strong faculties in food sciences, but we often find that the specific areas of expertise differ.  This becomes clear when they bid for research contracts because we have an open tendering process.  Where commonalities are identified, institutions often collaborate to bid for a project, which also works well for us.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Deputy Brendan Smith that Food Dudes which was developed by Bord Bia was a great success.  Educating children offers a route to reaching their parents.  We are closely involved in developing the curriculum in this area and enjoy strong relationships with the teacher associations.  We attend their AGMs and other meetings to make presentations.  We take advantage of every opportunity to get into schools, both North and South.  We are also trying to work with creches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Dolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429780800,"counter":2286,"content":"<p>We use research to build an evidence base for our communications, whether directly with consumers or in other areas of the food supply chain.  When we commission research, we use our network of other food safety agencies to investigate whether similar work has been carried out in centres of excellence on this island and in the United Kingdom to ensure we do not duplicate research.  Approximately 96% to 98% of our more than 100 research projects involve partners from both Northern Ireland and the Republic.  Mr. Dolan referred to several institutions which are particularly strong in food safety research.  They tend to carry out many of the projects in this area because they have the necessary capacity to do so.  We also have a scientific advisory committee which advises us on research we might pursue and developments elsewhere in the world, as a way of ensuring taxpayers' money is put to good use and that we maximise the potential of research projects.  The committee also helps us to identify gaps in food safety along the food chain from producer to the consumer and to find ways of harnessing research in consumer communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gary Kearney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429780800,"counter":2287,"content":"<p>We have prepared resources for primary schools, including the Eat, Taste and Grow programme in the North and the Tastebuds programme in the South.

We have worked with creches to introduce educational resources on hand-washing sin order that children learn this message at a very early stage.  We created a rhyme about hand-washing which children can learn with their carers and teachers in the creche.  We have also worked with Agri Aware to grow food in schools.<\/p> <p>  On fizzy drinks and sponsorship, we carry out tracking research on an annual basis to identify consumer concerns about food.

Everything is interesting but we cannot afford everything.  A number of Government Departments and agencies fund food-related research, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Health.  The idea of Healthy Ireland is relevant in terms of pulling those potentially disparate groups together to prioritise areas of research.  Even the balance between bench research, which is important in the long term, and things like behavioural research that give more immediate feedback is significant.<\/p><p> One area we have tackled that is a good example from the North-South perspective is dietary surveillance - getting frequent, ongoing and quite detailed information about what people are actually eating.  We now have a group of all the relevant funders, as distinct from recipients of funding.  They are the groups that are using and want to use public money as effectively as possible.  We are agreeing a formula and have six meetings organised with the Departments North and South and the relevant funders, in which we will get together and work out a system avoiding duplication and gaps.  That is one example, but there is plenty of scope for developing even further in other areas of research.  <\/p><p> Sports drinks sponsorship is an issue involving not just fizzy drinks but all confectionery.  Sometimes it is giving the message to children that they can walk from one side of a room to another and then get a bar that contains 300 or 400 calories - it does not make any sense.  It is a funding issue for these groups, but very mixed messages are being given.  From a policy perspective, we are involved in the special advisory group on obesity in the South and the steering group on obesity prevention in the North.  We are influencing policy as much as we can.  The alcohol issue is going to come first, but this is also a genuine issue.<\/p><p> I echo what Ms Gilligan was saying about listening to both families and children.  Any initiative we have in schools is founded on what children and parents want, or what will target them and impact on them.  The resources she was talking about have as major aspects homework and exercise.  It might be a nursery rhyme or everybody might have to bring in an apple the next day or bring in an unusual fruit or vegetable.  It is all games-oriented rather than what we could call didactic, boring old stuff.  Off the top of my head, my recollection is that with Tastebuds - a primary school project which is also running in the North under the name Eat, Taste and Grow - our most recent evaluation shows that 70% of primary schools are taking it up, which is a very high rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cliodhna Foley-Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429780800,"counter":2290,"content":"<p>Maidin mhaith agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte don cruinni&uacute;.  I apologise to the friends and family I have poisoned over the years with chicken and turkey - I am one of those individuals who has been guilty of that, so the witnesses' information is welcome, although I do not want any claims coming in.<\/p><p>As committee members, we do not have many powers but we can make recommendations.  What is <i>safe<\/i>food's view on setting up an all-Ireland body that would deal with emerging food and safety issues?  The horsemeat scandal showed us that the island's food chain is complex.  An oversupply of horsemeat was combined with pressure from large retailers and their suppliers to cut costs, creating the perfect set of circumstances for fraud and all the difficulties that occurred.  Would it make sense to have some sort of neutral space where stakeholders and individuals working in this field could flag up issues of concern, or even to have some sort of whistleblower mechanism for the food industry?  If such a body had existed, the problem might have been picked up far quicker.  Would <i>safe<\/i>food, in its non-regulatory, all-island capacity, be well placed to facilitate such a body?<\/p><p>What happened to the plans for the enteric reference centre for the island of Ireland?  As far as I can remember, they were shelved by Mary Harney when she was Minister.  It was part of the <i>safe<\/i>food remit at the time and would have allowed food samples to be tested for harmful bacteria.  I imagine it would have saved Irish taxpayers a small fortune.  Under the current system, we send the samples to Colindale in England, which is a costly process.  Could the witnesses let me know the cost?  Do they know whether it can result in delays?  If there was an outbreak, the Government might wait for a number of samples to save on shipping costs.  I think they get it free in the North, but there is pecking order in which the North is placed just above the Republic of Ireland in the prioritisation of tests.<\/p><p>The childhood obesity campaign was mentioned and we all welcome that.  Obesity is a problem in both Britain and Ireland.  What is attitude of <i>safe<\/i>food, if the witnesses can comment, on the question of a sugar tax?  A tax on products that contain a high quantity of sugar has been mooted, as has been mentioned already in the context of energy drinks, soft drinks and sweets.  We have heard that the money raised in this way could be put back, for example, into the health budget.  It could also be put into promoting vegetables and fruit. <\/p><p>Is any work being undertaken with parents and guardians around how to eat healthily on a budget?  A lot of the shops in what are officially described as deprived areas stock their shelves with two-for-one offers, doughnuts, all the high-sugar foods, pizzas and so on.<\/p><p>It is almost impossible to get them to bring in fresh vegetables.<br\/><br\/>How many parents does <i>safe<\/i>food work with?  Cooking is important.  I am involved in a not-for-profit company in Fettercairn in Tallaght whose aim was to try to provide a healthy food option every day, but coming up with the calorie count for a particular meal was beyond their capability.  Does <i>safe<\/i>food know of supports for such small community enterprises?  I have worked with several groups of lone parents who were naive and did not have a clue how to cook basic foods.  There are several of those organisations on the island of Ireland.  Does <i>safe<\/i>food tie in with them?  I congratulate it on the work it does. <br\/><br\/>Cooking for teenagers is another problem.  I spoke to some students recently who said even those who are going to university and are highly intelligent do not have a clue how to make the most basic meal.  I know there are several programmes on television on that topic, but how do we popularise the culture of people cooking for themselves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#E00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429780800,"counter":2292,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked some very good questions.  We are involved in a very useful project in Fettercairn, a community food initiative, which helps people learn about food and nutrition.  It extends to providing facilities to mind children while their parents go to the classes.  It is halfway through its three-year cycle and I understand it is a great success, which is a great credit to the people doing it.  Often these communities are not ready for the bureaucracy needed to be accountable for State money, or to meet all our requirements for sending in forms and mini-accounts.  We have 20 projects, ten of which finished in 2013 and ten which began in 2013.  They all run on three-year cycles and focus on people who need that kind of basic education.<br\/><br\/>In one case a community had put in a request to rent a bus to bring people to the local town and go to the supermarket.  I wondered why they were doing that, but it was to educate people about what is on the supermarket shelves, what is worth taking down and what they should not eat, and to explain fruit or vegetables they had never heard of.  That campaign has been a great success, so much so that we hope after a three-year cycle they will be able to run themselves or find financing somewhere else.  They will often set up market gardens and sell the produce, and open a coffee shop, and that money keeps them going.  Many of the first tranche of initiatives, 2010-13, are still going as a result of the kick start we gave them.<br\/><br\/>The food chain has been very topical since the horsemeat scandal.  Last week, a North-South Ministerial Council meeting took place with both Ministers in Derry, and <i>safe<\/i>food brought in Professor Chris Elliott, an eminent professor of food science from Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast.  He made the Deputy's point to the Ministers that it is not too soon to consider what we could do on the island of Ireland to put a policy in place to address that, whether for whistleblowers or something else.  It has been done in other countries, so there is a model.  That is topical and I hope we can move on it.<br\/><br\/>The enteric reference laboratory is one of our functions.  A lot of early work was done on it.  The present system whereby we send samples to Colindale does not cost us money and it works very well, but an enteric reference laboratory on the island of Ireland would be an even better solution.  Resources are an issue.  Getting all the key players together is a difficult project and we have not managed to get it across the line.  From time to time we revisit it and it is probably time to do it again.  Dr. Kearney has been very much involved in this for the past 15 years and can give a front-line view of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Dolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429780800,"counter":2293,"content":"<p>In respect of horsemeat, we are all aware that the agrifood business is the biggest indigenous industry on the island, employing just under 275,000 people.  Food safety is a key factor underpinning the reputation and sustainability of the industry.  Since the horsemeat scandal broke, many people have done a lot of work to introduce new checks and balances.  The regulatory agencies in both jurisdictions have put in place systems, committees and groupings to study and trying to scan the horizon and come up with a plan for potential issues in the food chain or food commodities.  The Food Standards Agency, for example, has set up a crime unit, which is quite heavily staffed, to reassure consumers that everything is being done and that a dishonest approach within the food chain will not be accepted.<br\/><br\/>The European Food Safety Authority has pulled all 28 member states together in a major grouping as an initiative to examine what they can do collectively in addition to what they are doing individually to ensure that traceability along the food chain can be optimised.  The food chain is extremely complex.  The horsemeat scandal showed that.  It takes quite a long time to break down what each member state is doing by way of systems, controls, approaches and resources applied.  The scandal showed that potential vulnerabilities need to be shored up.  It may not have been a food safety, food quality or consumer issue, but it showed us that maybe not everything is right.  Food safety is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week, forever-and-ever concern.  People need to consume food and food is always produced, and we need to be on top of the game all the time.  It is not a question of putting a control in place and assuming everything will go correctly.  A great deal of effort has been put into that.  We have discussed with various stakeholders, including regulators, how <i>safe<\/i>food can assist in that type of approach.  Someone mentioned a neutral space, but we have to be careful because we are not a regulator; we promote food safety across the food chain.  It is not our role to audit traceability.  We already have very good regulatory agencies to do that.<br\/><br\/>Professor Elliott has outlined an informal approach in which industry players can come together and share information and pick up trends before they become a problem in terms of food safety further down the food chain.  Over the past few years we have established an initiative called knowledge networks.  These are collaborative frameworks linking those who work in food safety, or have a responsibility in that area, in academia, including universities and institutes of technology, in industry and in food or food-related agencies, including regulators, across the island.  The role of those networks is to identify new risks, especially emerging challenges - to gaze into a crystal ball and examine various areas and try to ask the hard questions such as what happens if the controls do not work in one place or we do not have enough information in another.<\/p><p>We have seven networks.  They are built around scientific issues of particular interest - for example, campylobacter in chicken - and we have more than 2,700 members.  These are food safety professionals, with 20% coming from industry.  We have held approximately 38 events and conferences over the last three to four years and had attendances of 2,200 people within the food chain.  People are coming together and identifying issues, especially new risks, that are coming down the track.<\/p><p> We held a very good function at the end of last year with Teagasc.  One of our facilitators who runs the campylobacter network, Dr. Declan Bolton from Teagasc, brought in the experts from those countries in Scandinavia that have resolved the campylobacter issue to greater effect than most of the rest of Europe, to learn the tips and tricks they used and how best we can apply what they applied to our situation on the island.  We use forums such as those.  It is quite robust.  There are newsletters and other support mechanisms to try to get people to talk and exchange information on a North-South basis.  The industry is an all-island endeavour.  It is about building relationships and trust so that information can be shared formally and informally.<\/p><p> The last issue the Deputy mentioned was the enteric reference service.  As Mr. Dolan mentioned, I was at the coalface on that.  It is in our legislation and we have made a number of efforts to get it over the line.  It is a very complex issue.  It is not that we are losing money by not having such a service, but the key problem for us, and the reason it was put into our legislation, is the \"what if\" issue.  If there was an outbreak of a major food problem in the Republic of Ireland, how would we get on?  There are two centres in the Republic, in Galway and Dublin, that carry out enteric services to a very high standard.  The funding streams are not always guaranteed.  Even though they do fantastic work, they need a greater guarantee or reassurance regarding funding and resources.  In Northern Ireland, the first call is to Colindale.  If there was a serious outbreak that swamped us in the Republic, we would use Colindale, but if it affected Northern Ireland there might be a delay in that respect.<\/p><p> As I said, it has been a very complex situation with many stakeholders and many priorities.  We had taken the process to a costing stage, where we identified a number of solutions.  At that point, two or three years ago, economic circumstances were unfavourable and we were asked to hold off until they were more favourable.  We are going to take a fresh look at it.  We know the issues and the people.  They have not changed.  The solutions we had in mind that we intended to cost have not changed.  We had a very good consultation with stakeholders across the island, so we have a good understanding of what people think and of what will work.  It is a case of moving onward on that process.  We hope that over the next year we will have fresh progress in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gary Kearney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429780800,"counter":2295,"content":"<p>The cookery aspect pulls together two areas of our brief, food safety and healthy eating.  It is a critical area and there is an increasing skills deficit, particularly among the lower socioeconomic groups.  The two things we have done recently were in television, because the lower socioeconomic groups watch television to a huge extent.  The audience figures are huge.  Celebrity chefs have been tried and tested, but we have found in the research that people are watching them for entertainment.  In one programme we did, called \"Take on the Takeaway\", we challenged people to cook their normal takeaway - for example, a Chinese meal - at home.  They did it with a chef helping them, but they had to do it at a cheaper price and to a quicker time so that it would be ready just as quickly.  Obviously, that is what people want when they order a takeaway.  Also, the taste would be as good as what they might get from the takeaway.  In 80% of cases, people were delighted with what they found.  There were eight programmes broadcast throughout the country and the viewership was very high.  It was broadcast twice on RTE.<\/p> <p>  Building on that, last year we did a programme called \"Angeline's Home Cooks\" in conjunction with Tesco.  Angeline Ball fronted the programme.  Previously she could not cook - she was a singer but she could not cook well - but she married a Frenchman and ended up leaning to cook quite well.  It featured items such as Granny's stew, with Granny showing up to teach three contestants how to cook it.  Again, this was not a celebrity type of meal.  It was a simple, recipe-based piece.  For example, when contestants were asked to saut&eacute; the onions, some of them did not know what that was.  There were many technical things that people who cook regularly will know, but basics such as saut&eacute;ing, simmering, grilling and so forth were explained.  The contestants were also brought to the supermarket and shown the shelves and where to find the food.  They were quite surprised that they did not have to go down some of the aisles that stocked the packaged items they were used to buying.  Again, there was good viewership.  TV3 broadcast it in conjunction with Tesco; the products could be found in Tesco.<\/p> <p>  On the education perspective, fortunately in Northern Ireland it is mandatory for all secondary school children to take cookery.  We would love that to happen in the South.  To fill that gap we have worked with St. Angela's College in rolling out a competition along the lines of \"Take on the Takeaway\".  That has run for a number of years.  We are reviewing it at present to see how we can alter it and, perhaps, get more people on board.  There would have been more than 1,000 students involved each year, not just students doing home economics but others as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Gilligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429780800,"counter":2296,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the issue of a sugar tax.  What is being proposed at present is a sugar-sweetened beverage tax.  The reason is that honey, jam and numerous other products contain sugar and can be nutritious, whereas sugar-sweetened drinks are not.  Officially we can say that we would support it.  It is one of a suite of measures that has been shown to have some merit, in the same way as calorie posting.  However, it brings into focus the bigger issue of fiscal measures in general.  The Deputy mentioned fruit and vegetables.  It would be the carrot-and-stick approach of subsidising fruit and vegetable availability and cost.<\/p> <p>  Much has happened in recent times with regard to cost in some of the low-price multiples.  It is interesting what is happening there with the supermarkets.  It is an example of how we work with our colleagues in the North.  Members will be familiar with the offers of five products for a very reasonable price, or variations thereof, that all the supermarkets in the South are advertising on a weekly basis.  The same supermarkets had not been doing that in the North.  We have linked up with our colleagues who are now putting pressure on the same multiples in the North.  It seems crazy.<\/p> <p>  The evidence is that fiscal measures work.  That is the reason we have been talking about them and working with them for years in respect of tobacco and, more recently, alcohol.  Food is next.  We must be careful that we pick good examples for fiscal measures, but there is no doubt that it works.  It is another example of the different Departments in the Government joining up to prioritise health.<\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned food poverty.  Among other things, we work with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and its counterpart in the North.  For example, we have produced a resource called 101 Square Meals which is nutritionally sound, financially okay but also acceptable.  It is a critical issue which we have found-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cliodhna Foley-Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429780800,"counter":2298,"content":"<p>Edible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#H00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429780800,"counter":2299,"content":"<p>More than that, it must be desirable.

It is not just about what is nutritionally and financially sound but also what is acceptable.  It includes limited treats, as well as a small amount of alcohol and some tips on catering for guests.  It is about what is reasonable socially and psychologically, as well as nutritionally.

Has there been any discernible improvement in that regard?  As a public representative, I represent socio-economically disadvantaged housing estates, lone parents, unemployed persons and so on.  When they come to my constituency services, it is striking how many of their children are obese.  Everything seems to be from a fast food outlet.  There does not seem to have been any decline in my area; therefore, I do not think the message is getting home.  That is not the fault of the delegates, but perhaps we need a more co-operative approach across the board between those involved in politics; education through schools, local authorities, NGOs and so forth.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Foley-Nolan mentioned \"Operation Transformation\".  I watch television very little, but I have seen a few episodes of this programme.  One in particular sticks out for me as a Kerry footballer was involved.  Kids are the ones whom we need to target.  Has anything like this been done with children as distinct from adults?  It is when children are starting in secondary school that it is probably more obvious to an individual and more hurtful to him or her.  Has any effort been made to produce something similar to \"Operation Transformation\" involving young people who have a tendency to look to their peers rather than adults?  They expect adults to be fat or obese, which is accepted.<\/p> <p>  Have the delegates seen any improvement as a result of the school PE and exercise programme?  What more could be done in that regard?  Many schools, especially in more rural areas, are contending with a reduction in the number of teachers and one of the first things to fall by the wayside is the PE programme.  Class sizes are continuing to go up and if teacher numbers are to be cut, they will be cut for what is perceived to be the least important subject, even though it may, in fact, be the most important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#H00400","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429780800,"counter":2301,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his remarks and his support is appreciated.  We know that people who are less advantaged do not eat as well.  They are not as active and we know that children in less advantaged families sleep for shorter periods of time.  All of these factors are relevant.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned teenagers and younger children.  We now know that children as young as three years are overweight and obese.  Their risk of being overweight as adults is huge.  We are not talking about the middle-aged spread but about decades of serious illnesses.  The evidence shows that what is the norm at home is the issue.  Tackling teenagers is certainly not the priority, although this must be done.  That is where the childhood obesity campaign comes from.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there was any evidence of improvement.  There are some indications.  Some of the work done as part of the childhood obesity surveillance initiative, COSI, a World Health Organization surveillance initiative, shows a levelling off in some age groups among children.  However, it is an unacceptably high level.  One in four children is overweight or obese.  I am sure Ms Gilligan will be able to provide figures for indications of positivity in our childhood obesity campaign.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned his familiarity with the estates in the area in which he works.  The challenge is dealing with the stigma attached to not having enough money or not being as well off as we perceive others to be.  We have a dilemma in which we are inclined not to emphasise the social inequalities so as not to further stigmatise people.  It is a difficult issue.

Initially, we wondered whether we might be telling parents that their children are overweight and telling them what overweight looks like.  However, when we researched the topic with parents, they said they knew that but they needed to know what to do.  They wanted practical messages.  The campaign has very practical messages, such as one needs to reduce one's portion size.  A five year old child needs half of what an adult needs.  People need to drink more water rather than fizzy drinks and cordials which often contain unnecessary amounts of sugar.  Physical activity must be increased and a child needs 60 minutes of physical activity a day, which is a very practical message and which has rolled out well.  Treats need to be reduced.  We found from those messages regarding portion sizes, for example, that one in five had thought about making changes and one in three had made changes and had stopped the child from eating everything on the plate, which is a start, because we are coming from that mentality.  Consumption of water at mealtimes has increased considerably, by 10% in the Republic and 15% in Northern Ireland.  These are all claimed behaviours but they are a start.  The proportion of people who say treats are being given once a day has dropped by 8%, from 40% to 32%, and one in three have tried to increase their physical activity.  We have also found an increase in the comfort factor, with an increase of 7% in the percentage of people now able to discuss the fact that their child may be overweight.  The level of acknowledgement that health risks may present at a later age has also increased by 6%.  That is a considerable change because we know that people have a disconnect regarding health risk.  Illnesses like diabetes, heart disease and cancers, which are the three pieces we have added to the communication as risk factors for later in life, are now being considered.  It is a slow burn, but that is where we are at the moment and there are positive signs.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the C2DE grouping, our buying for this campaign is heavily weighted towards what people in this group are watching and where they are.  For example, our CEO said that he had not seen the sleep ad yet, and I told him he would not have unless he had been watching &quot;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&quot;.  The television ads are on particular stations at particular times, when we know that our audience is watching.  Social media also plays an important role in their lives, particularly YouTube and Facebook, so we have advertising across those platforms.  Our Twitter channel and, in particular, our Facebook channel are reaching numbers of about 600,000 on an average three-week period in the campaign.  We are also in places like <i>MummyPages.ie<\/i>, <i>eumom.ie<\/i>, and <i>NI4Kids.com<\/i>, which are where these people are having conversations with one another about their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Gilligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1429780800,"counter":2306,"content":"<p>There is a way of dealing with the issue of fast food outlets targeting children, but it means involving local authorities.

Fast food provides cheap quantity and is almost instant.  For low income families, who may not have education regarding diet and so forth, all those factors contribute to making it attractive.<\/p> <p>  Another problem with young kids who become obese is that their bodies become dependent.  I was reading an article recently that stated that once the body has that dependency, while one might lose weight temporarily, it comes back almost instantly unless one defeats it at an early age.

The project was called Candy-coated Marketing and examined the level of exposure of preschool children to unhealthy products.  Needless to say, there is very little advertising for apples or grapes.

Parents are quite happy to have a strong message.<\/p> <p>  On the incentive end of things, I have heard that insurance companies are starting to consider that.  It would be a positive way of doing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015042300002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Gilligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1429780800,"counter":2313,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and for all the work they are doing.

I am pleased to be here today to bring these public hearings on the general scheme of a new public health (alcohol) Bill 2015 to a close.  Before I start, I would like to remind the committee that at the start of the year the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch and I set out our 25 actions for the year and grouped them around five themes.  First among those themes was Healthy Ireland, followed by patient outcomes and safety, the first steps towards universal health care, investment in infrastructure and facilities, and reform.<\/p> <p>  The reason we put Healthy Ireland at the top is that we strongly believe we need to improve our health as individuals and as a nation.  If we do not do that we will never get on top of chronic disease problems and illnesses that we have and will certainly never get the health budget under control in the long term.  This will involve a number of different actions.  The Healthy Ireland survey is now under way and we will have the first figures in the summer.  This is the first study of Ireland's health since Sl&aacute;n in 2007.  We will repeat that study every year to see if our policies are working.  There will also be specific actions on obesity and an event next Monday at Farmleigh to which I hope committee members are invited.  The committee members will be familiar with the actions taken on tobacco already.  There will also be a new sexual health strategy before the end of the year along with the national physical activity plan.  Alcohol fits into all that as part of a general drive towards better public and individual health.<\/p> <p>  I commend the Chairman, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, the members of the committee, other members of the Oireachtas who participated in these hearings, and all the invited guests on the sensible and constructive approach that we have witnessed over the past few weeks.   My officials and I have found the presentations and insights presented by the witnesses very useful.  I am confident that these submissions and the report the committee will produce will greatly assist me and my officials in the drafting of the final legislation.  <\/p> <p>  I am sure the committee members will agree that Ireland has a serious problem &ndash; we drink too much alcohol.  The consumption of alcohol in Ireland increased by 192% between 1960 and 2001, from an average of 4.9 litres of pure alcohol per adult to 14.3 litres at peak.  Even though this is a problem going back decades and centuries, it is much worse than it was before the 1960s.  Since this peak in 2001, alcohol consumption has reduced and in 2013 alcohol consumption per adult was 10.64 litres.  Ireland&rsquo;s alcohol consumption remains in the top five among the EU 28 member states. The European region has the highest consumption in the world.  Early statistics indicate that alcohol consumption increased in 2014 from 10.6 litres to 11 litres per person, which is worrying as it suggests that a feature of the recovering economy is going to be an increase in alcohol consumption as more people get back to work and have more money in their pockets.  It is a certainty that alcohol consumption will continue to grow as the economy grows in the absence of any policy change and that is part of why these measures are so important.<\/p> <p>  As a country, when we drink, we tend to binge drink.  I doubt many of us in this room are entirely innocent of that.  It is very much part of our culture.  Patterns of drinking, especially drinking to intoxication, play an important role in causing alcohol-related harm.  The evidence suggests that a majority of Irish drinkers engage in excessive or problematic drinking behaviours and that Irish drinkers underestimate their alcohol intake.  Ireland was second in the WHO European region in binge drinking with 39% of the population misusing alcohol in this manner at least monthly.  <\/p> <p>  Our most recent national alcohol consumption survey was published by the Health Research Board last year.  It found that 54% of drinkers were classified as harmful drinkers; 75% of all alcohol consumed was done as part of a binge drinking session; and Irish drinkers underestimate how much they drink by about 61%.  The study also shows that more than half of adult drinkers in the population are classified as harmful drinkers, and this figure does not include 20.6% of the population who abstain.  When the proportion of survey respondents who are classified as harmful drinkers is applied to the population, this equates with between 1.3 and 1.4 million harmful drinkers in the country. <\/p> <p>  Harmful drinking is more common among men than women, and most common among 18 to 24 year olds.  In this category a staggering 75% drink in a harmful way.  In addition, a considerable proportion of self-defined light, moderate or social drinkers drink six or more standard drinks on a typical drinking occasion.  This is the equivalent of binge drinking.  Even these light or social drinkers do not realise that they consume alcohol in an unhealthy manner.<\/p> <p>  The findings of this study lead to the conclusion that, among the drinking population, harmful drinking is the norm in Ireland, in particular for men and women under 35.  I am aware that over the past weeks the committee has listened to numerous speakers who have presented on the kinds of damage that alcohol misuse of this magnitude does to the drinker, families, communities and society and the economy.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme of the Bill was published last February and my Department is now drafting the Bill.  It is my intention to have the Bill ready before the summer recess and introduced in the Houses of the Oireachtas in autumn.  This legislation is the most far-reaching proposed by any Irish Government, with alcohol being addressed for the first time as a public health measure.  The significance of that might not have been fully understood by many people.  This is health legislation, rather than justice or enterprise legislation, so the regulations will be signed by the Minister for Health and will come from a health point of view.  The enterprise Minister would be coming from more of a consumer and competition point of view and the justice Minister from a criminal justice point of view.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is part of a comprehensive package of measures to reduce excessive patterns of alcohol consumption as set out in the steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy.  It is also one of the measures being taken under the Healthy Ireland framework.  The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland to 9.1 litres per person per annum - the western world average - by 2020, to reduce binge drinking in particular and to reduce the harms associated with alcohol.  I believe the legislative measures contained in the Bill are necessary if we are to achieve this aim and change our relationship with alcohol.  The Bill includes provisions for minimum unit pricing to eliminate cheap alcohol from supermarkets; structural separation in shops to reduce availability and visibility; labelling on alcohol products; restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol; regulation of sports sponsorship; and enforcement powers for environmental health officers.<\/p> <p>  Addressing the price of alcohol is an important component of any long-term approach to tackling alcohol misuse.  The price of alcohol is linked to consumption levels and levels of alcohol-related harms.  The World Health Organization states that there is &ldquo;indisputable evidence that the price of alcohol matters.  If the price of alcohol goes up, alcohol-related harm goes down.&rdquo;  Despite Ireland having relatively high excise duty, alcohol remains very affordable, particularly in supermarkets.  A woman can reach her low-risk weekly drinking limit for just &euro;6.30, while a man can reach this weekly limit for less than &euro;10.<\/p> <p>  The public health (alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price, essentially a floor price for alcohol.  Minimum unit pricing, MUP, sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol.  The minimum price of an alcohol product shall be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  I know that Dr. John Holmes and Dr. Colin Angus from the University of Sheffield delivered an excellent presentation on minimum unit pricing and the study they carried out in Ireland.  Suffice to say that the study provided robust evidence that minimum unit pricing policies would be effective in reducing alcohol consumption, alcohol harms including alcohol-related deaths, hospitalisations, crimes and workplace absences and the costs associated with those harms.<\/p><p> The study also showed that minimum unit pricing would only have a small impact on alcohol consumption for low risk drinkers.  Somewhat larger impacts would be experienced by increasing risk drinkers, with the most substantial effects being experienced by high risk drinkers.  This is because minimum unit pricing is aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner.  Alcohol products which are strong and cheap are those favoured by the heaviest drinkers, who are most at risk of alcohol-related illness and death and young people who have the least disposable income.  Minimum unit pricing is not expected to affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade in the main.  However, it will prevent large multiple retailers from absorbing increases in excise rates and from using alcohol as a loss leader.  Officials in my Department are also looking at possible mechanisms to ensure that some of the financial benefits of minimum unit pricing may flow back to the Exchequer, although if it succeeds in significantly reducing consumption, there may not be any financial benefit.<\/p><p> Some members have been calling for a ban on below-cost selling instead of minimum unit pricing.  I would like to take the opportunity to clarify why minimum unit pricing is more effective than a ban on below-cost selling.  First of all, there is no agreed definition of below-cost selling in Ireland or how it could be calculated.  If it is interpreted as alcohol being sold below VAT and excise duty then very little alcohol is sold at this price in Ireland.  The University of Sheffield study found that a ban on below-cost selling would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption and related harms.  Working out a cost price that incorporates other costs such as manufacturing, transportation and retailing is a complex, expensive and perhaps inaccurate exercise.  Banning below-cost selling would be difficult to implement, monitor and enforce.  MUP is easier to understand, measure and enforce than a ban on below cost selling<\/p><p> Others have been calling for a general increase in excise rates.  However, further increases in excise rates would render premium and higher-priced alcohol more expensive, which is unnecessary for the purpose of targeting hazardous and harmful drinkers, who purchase larger quantities of cheap alcohol.  It would be just another tax.  A tax increase would not necessarily have the same effect as a compulsory minimum price, because of the risk that taxes would not be passed on in full.  However, minimum unit pricing prevents large multiple retailers, or any retailers, from absorbing increases in excise rates and from using alcohol as a loss leader.<\/p><p> The appropriate minimum unit pricing will be chosen taking into account estimates from the report of the University of Sheffield and in consultation with the relevant Departments.  The price needs to be set at a level the evidence indicates will reduce the burden of harm from alcohol use.  In short, it needs to be high enough to eliminate very cheap alcohol but not so high that it affects the price of a glass of wine in the pizzeria.<\/p><p> We must also take into account what Northern Ireland does, so that we do not create a new issue around cross-Border trade.  I know that many members are concerned about the impact that MUP might have on cross-border trade.  The Minister for Health in Northern Ireland, Jim Wells, MLA, has also announced plans to introduce minimum unit pricing for alcohol.  My officials are in contact with their counterparts in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on the matter and we are cognisant of the requirement to work together with the North on the implementation of minimum unit pricing.<\/p><p> Finally, I will give the committee an update on the current European court case regarding minimum unit pricing.  Last February, the Scottish Inner Court of Sessions, Scotland&rsquo;s highest court, referred a number of questions on minimum unit pricing to the European Court of Justice.  The court is due to hold a hearing on this case on 6 May and we expect a judgment by the end of the year.  We intervened in this case and the relevant officials will be attending the hearing in Luxembourg.  We are hopeful that minimum unit pricing will be found to be compatible with EU treaties and rules and it is therefore important that all the necessary steps have been put in place to commence the legislation, if enacted.  However, it is a risk and the court will have to decide which is more important: public health or eliminating barriers to free trade.  It is noteworthy that the EU was initially established as a common market, the European Economic Community, a trade-based organisation, rather than one based on public health.  We will fight as hard as we can to ensure the court makes the right decision.<\/p><p> Moving on to the regulation of marketing and advertising; protecting children from exposure to alcohol marketing is an important public health goal.  There is a compelling body of research which shows that exposure to alcohol marketing, whether it is on TV, in movies, in public places or alcohol branded sponsorship, predicts future youth drinking.  Numerous longitudinal studies have found that young people who are exposed to alcohol marketing are more likely to start drinking, or if already drinking, to drink more.  Research also shows that self-regulation is not able to protect young people from exposure to large volumes of alcohol marketing and appealing alcohol advertising.<\/p><p> The public health (alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to market or advertise alcohol in a manner that is appealing to children.  It provides for the making of regulations on the marketing and advertising of alcohol and includes provisions for restrictions on broadcast marketing and advertising, cinema advertising, outdoor advertising, print media and the regulation of sponsorship by alcohol companies.  This will encompass major sporting events for the first time by putting the existing code of practice for sponsorship by drinks companies on a legal footing with enforcement powers and penalties.  The legislation will contain a commitment that the provisions on marketing and advertising will be reviewed after three years.<\/p><p> On labelling, research shows that accurate information on the alcohol content of specific beverages is essential to promote awareness of alcohol intake.  However, \"standard drink\" or units are widely misunderstood by the general public.  In order to address this, the Bill will provide that labels on alcohol products will contain health warnings, including for pregnancy; the amount of pure alcohol as measured in grams; and the calorie count.  Under the Bill, pubs and restaurants will also be obliged to provide this information to customers for alcohol products sold on draught or in measures, e.g. pints, glasses of wine and measures of spirits.  Finally, health warnings will also have to be included on all promotional material.<\/p><p> From a merchandising perspective, at the moment the Minister for Justice and Equality and I are examining the best way to implement the separation of alcohol products from other products in mixed trading premises.  Our aim is to ensure that alcohol products cannot be displayed like ordinary grocery products, but will be subject to strict merchandising requirements.  We want to do it in a manner that is not too onerous on retailers and that will not impose excessive cost on them in order to comply.<\/p><p> The public health (alcohol) Bill will be enforced by environmental health officers.  Provisions to be enforced include minimum unit pricing; health labelling; the control of marketing and advertising; structural separation of alcohol from other products; and regulations relating to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol products under section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  These pertain to restrictions on advertising, promoting, selling or supplying alcohol at reduced prices or free of charge.<\/p><p> To conclude, I believe that the public health (alcohol) Bill will act as a powerful enabler for a healthier relationship with alcohol in Ireland.  I know some people believe the measures do not go far enough, but I am confident that it is a bold and major step in the right direction.  As I said earlier, I will seek Government approval to publish the Bill before the summer recess and plan to initiate it in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the autumn.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and all of those who have participated in these public hearings for the valuable contribution they have made to this issue and for the assistance they have provided to me and my officials in the work that lies ahead.  I look forward to receiving the committee's report and reflecting it in the legislation as published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#E00200","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2323,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Minister referred to the fact that some of us are arguing for this or for that.  I just want to state that the difference in terms of approach and ideas does not indicate on any of our parts, the Minister's included, any lack of resolve.  It is about what we think may work best.<\/p><p>I give the Minister the assurance that, even without sight of the legislation, which the Minister has yet to publish, I am not going to be an obstacle to the passage of this legislation, although I am not sold on the certainty of the introduction of minimum unit pricing.  As legislators, we have a job of work to do on this matter, and my colleagues and I will be full participants in seeking to arrive at the best position.  We will not be an obstacle to an address going forward.<\/p><p> The Minister spoke about different studies and figures.  He mentioned the 20.6% of the population who abstain, but are not included in the Health Research Board's figures which show that more than half of adult drinkers in the population are classified as harmful drinkers.  Can the Minister indicate whether the consumption figures of 10.6 litres per adult in 2013 and 11 litres per adult in 2014 include abstainers, and that the figures are for the general adult population?  It is my observation as a citizen that figures in relation to average consumption fall far short of the reality for so many of our people.  I believe it would be staggering for many if the real picture was exposed.  It is way up the scale from 11 litres per person, for those who are using alcohol as part of their weekly practices.  Just to be absolutely clear, I include myself in that.  Could the Minister comment on that? It is important to point out that Irish drinkers underestimate their alcohol intake and it would be helpful if we could all be exposed to the true facts.  It might also be of help in winning greater public acceptance of the need to address this very serious matter.  The Minister makes the point that drinkers underestimate their alcohol intake by 61%.  That may be, and it may be much more than that.  <\/p><p> The Minister said the Bill would be ready before the summer recess.  Will the Minister clarify whether individual Members will have sight of it, and does \"ready\" mean \"published\"? He talks about the Bill being addressed in the Houses in the autumn, but will Members have sight of it before the recess?  The Bill includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, structural separation in shops, health labelling on alcohol products, restrictions on advertising, regulations on sports sponsorship and enforcement powers for environmental health officers.  There are other views, but I am concerned that the minimum unit pricing approach is not the panacea.  I know it is one of a number of items, and of course there has to be a package - I fully support that - but when the Minister makes the point-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#F00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2326,"content":"<p>Time, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#G00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2327,"content":"<p>I ask for a wee bit of leniency from the Chairman.  The Minister makes the point that minimum unit pricing is aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner.  I do not believe that will necessarily be the result.  My assessment is that it will mostly affect those on lower income levels.  If one looks at the current cost versus the suggested minimum unit pricing which will result from this legislation, one can see that it most certainly targets drink products which are used mostly by people on low to medium incomes.  Maybe some of those are people who depend on social protection, but I do not believe that the issue of alcohol misuse, and all the terrible negatives that come from it, are confined to one social class.  It is not.  I fear we are not addressing this in the most holistic way.  I will be addressing the issue through regulation of below-cost selling, which was rejected by the Minister.  I do believe it has to be based on the invoice price, and I believe it is absolutely a sustainable solution that should be part of the overall approach.  I have had negative reactions to my arguments for considering increased excise duties on alcohol, and I know it is not popular.  We need to ring-fence money to address the serious social problems in our communities - to educate people and provide supports for those who are wrestling with serious alcohol abuse and those who are the victims of family members' abuse of alcohol - irrespective of where we are from or where we live.  It is right across the board.  Although I am mindful of what the reaction would be, I make no apology for suggesting increases in excise duties.  It is not for the sole purpose of making alcohol more expensive, but to utilise the additional revenue in the most focused way.  I believe this is essential, and it needs to be confirmed in this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#G00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2328,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome to the committee.  I have written two European papers on alcohol-related harm.  I was asked to do one of them by the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  It  gave me an opportunity to present to the then Minister, whom I could not meet in my role at the time as chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance.  I am delighted this is being framed as a public health issue.  I believe it is critically important.  There is really strong support for this Bill.  Most contact I have with individuals and organisations is about how we can go further and what more we can do.  We have had too much talk about alcohol and we now need to ensure there is legislative change.<\/p> <p>  I differ from my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on minimum unit pricing, but I do respect his views and we have had our discussions.  We have listed to impressive presentations by Dr. John Holmes and Mr. Colin Angus from the University of Sheffield.  I am convinced on the issue so I will not use my time today on that.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that the plan to place the voluntary code for sports sponsorship onto a legal footing is not strong enough.  Let us look back at how the voluntary code came into place.  In 2003, draft legislation had been prepared by the Government and had gone to Cabinet for approval, when all of a sudden the voluntary code was brought in.  The Children's Rights Alliance submission to this committee states: \"It is worth noting that the text of the voluntary code mirrors exactly that produced by the industry, including grammatical errors.\"  I hope the industry does not have the same influence now.  The committee has had presentations on the issue of the voluntary code.  I draw the Minister's attention to audience profiling.  An example was given to the committee about a rugby match and the 25% rule.  I suggest to the Minister that it could be reduced to 10%.  Obviously I would prefer stronger enforcement, or that it was not in the way, but if we are going to do something then we should make it 10%.<\/p><p>Children are clearly being targeted with that 25%.  We should remove it as much as possible.<\/p><p> We must also consider digital and online marketing, which seem absent from this proposal.  A few years ago, Diageo announced that 21% of its marketing budget was going towards online marketing.  Recently, Finland introduced legislation banning alcohol apps that contained games, location settings and information on where the nearest place to drink was.  Clearly, these are targeted at children.  It is social engagement.  A young person who visits Youtube sees advertisements for alcohol that I do not see.  I know this from when my nephews and nieces show me clips on Youtube or other social media.  Children are being targeted.  I do not get the same advertisements.  I tend to get the weight loss ones and so forth that seem to target my age demographic.  Children get the alcohol ones.  This is telling and we should be well aware of it.<\/p><p> Who will carry out the regulation of alcohol marketing and enforcement of penalties?  Will it continue to be the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body, AMCMB?  Will the Minister discuss section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act with the Department of Justice and Equality?  It relates to the making of regulations on advertising and promoting.  Perhaps we could commence the section immediately.<\/p><p> An issue is absent from the Bill that many presentations raised with us, namely, sports sponsorship.  I do not understand why we do not simply set a date.  It is inevitable.  It is telling that neither sports organisations nor the drinks industry will give us figures for sports sponsorship.  Yesterday morning, I attended an interesting briefing given by Ms Katherine Brown of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, IAS, and organised by Alcohol Action Ireland.  She stated, \"Alcohol sponsorship of sport is a gateway to children's bedroom doors\".  She referred to the posters of our sporting heroes on bedroom doors.  It is a child protection issue.<\/p><p> What the Minister is doing in respect of labelling is welcome.  At a conference organised by Alcohol Action Ireland on Tuesday, there was an interesting presentation on whether the health warnings should include cancer warnings.  Clear evidence was given in a similar fashion to that in respect of tobacco.  Is this something that the Minister should consider?<\/p><p> The issue of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act also arose.  It relates to the separation of alcohol products.

Why can we not commence this section immediately?<\/p><p> I was concerned by the emphasis placed on the role of education in some of the submissions to the committee.  They tended to be those linked to the drinks industry.  Education informs our behaviour, but it does not change it.  I cited the example of picking up our mobile telephones while driving.  In the Minister's previous role, he introduced a law and we changed behaviour because people did not want to get caught.  I know that I should not pick up my telephone, but I swear at the Minister at least once per day when I go to pick it up, only to stop because I do not want to get caught.  I know it is wrong, but legislation is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#G00500","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2330,"content":"<p>Turn it off before getting into the car.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#H00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2331,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#H00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2332,"content":"<p>It is still distracting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#H00400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2333,"content":"<p>I do not even look at it.

I will focus on one or two points.  A recent publication by Dr. Orla Crosbie of Cork University Hospital addressed liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver and how the situation had changed in the past 20 years.  Approximately 40% of patients in these categories now are female whereas there would have been few or no female patients 20 years ago.  A frightening finding in the study is that many of these females are young mothers with young children.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, to which my colleague, Senator van Turnhout, referred.  I raised it as a Commencement matter in the Seanad this week.  If we publish legislation at the end of July, it will have gone through the process by November or December.  Implementation will take a further six to 12 months.  Why can we not consider section 9 of the 2008 Act, which clearly set out the question of the segregation of alcohol products?  According to the Minister's submission, there is an ongoing discussion with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Can we not implement section 9?  The legislation is already in place.  Section 9 could be implemented by 1 January of next year.  If we go through this legislative process, however, it will take at least a further 12 months.  Why can we not agree what needs to be done in respect of section 9 so that the industry can prepare for it and there can be a clear timeline?  Currently, there is no timeline or any guarantee that we will have passed this legislation by December.  The structures that we have discussed establishing will not be in place by the time the next general election comes around.  As such, there is no guarantee that the legislation will not be changed immediately afterwards.  Section 9 already exists.  We can implement it.  If we put a timeline up to 1 January in place, we will have implemented some change instead of living with the current ifs and buts.

I commend the Minister on what is probably one of the most progressive pieces of public health legislation, certainly in the lifetime of the Government.  In conjunction with the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015, it is up there with the previous legislation on the smoking ban in public houses.  In years to come, we will be able to measure the public health dividend from legislation such as this.  We are certainly trespassing on powerful commercial vested interests in the drinks sector and retail outlets for alcohol.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to raise specifically the issue of sports sponsorship to which Deputy Healy and others have alluded.  I have spoken to the Minister about this and written to him on it as well after the Government decision to proceed with the legislation.  Is there something slightly contradictory in the proposed legislation as envisaged not dealing with the issue of sports sponsorship and the content of his speech in which he stated, \"There is a compelling body of research which shows that exposure to alcohol marketing, whether it is on TV, in movies, in public places or alcohol branded sponsorship, predicts future youth drinking\"?  There is a lot of funding in advertising.  Senator van Turnhout referred to the online marketing budget making up 21% of Diageo's total marketing budget.  While I have heard the Minister rail against the criticism of one specific aspect, which criticism blindly ignores the many progressive areas the legislation deals with, is there a danger that as we close off a number of avenues for advertising in particular areas, the closing off of which is welcome, this budget will find its way in greater volumes into sports sponsorship?  If the Minister closes off advertising in cinemas, on billboards and on television at particular times, this money will seek an outlet elsewhere.  It is like the laws of gravity.  It will find an outlet somewhere else.  There is a danger that greater sums of money will be poured into sports sponsorship.  It is not a benevolent gesture by the drinks sector to sponsor sports.  It does it because it recognises there is a return on such investment.  This is the Achilles heel of this progressive legislation.  I would like the Minister to consider that, and while I do not expect a definitive answer on it now, I am aware he is open to further consideration of the issue.<\/p> <p>  On the argument of minimum unit pricing versus below-cost selling, Senator Colm Burke referred to the fact that with the best will in the world, passing the proposed legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas and producing the various regulations that will follow mean it is likely to be two years before we will have some gain from it.  Is there a case to be made for banning below-cost selling of alcohol under the groceries order or the legislation that banned below-cost selling as an interim measure while we await legal clarity from the European courts on minimum unit pricing, the concept of which I support?  It would be quite easy for us to take such an interim measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#J00200","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2343,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on what he has done.  I want to raise one issue.  I want to highlight the importance of this in another area, that is, mental illness.  Alcohol affects those who have some form of mental illness and it compounds the situation.  Alcohol damages the brain cells and is a cause of certain mental illnesses.  A recent study in one of our counties found that 36% had consumed alcohol at the time they had taken their life.  Another study found that half of those under 35 who committed suicide in three countries had alcohol in their bloodstream as well.  It is accepted internationally that alcohol plays a role in the area of self-harm and suicide.  The World Health Organization states that a person who is currently abusing alcohol is eight times more likely to die by suicide than if he or she was not.<\/p> <p>  Mental ill health is a vast area, especially in young people.  For example, the brains of those in their teens are developing and alcohol inhibits or affects that.  There can be life-lasting effects if there is a high consumption of alcohol by young people whose bodies are in the development stage, and their brain is part of their bodies.  That has been well researched internationally.<\/p> <p>  The area of those who have suicidal ideation but are inhibited in taking their lives is also well researched internationally.  Taking alcohol can remove that inhibition.  We often hear of persons who were in great form at a disco and they were never seen in better form, and they have drink taken.  After a certain amount of drink, they look at taking their own lives and they are less inhibited.  Often they go home and take their lives.  We all are aware of such cases.  People are very confused about why something like that would happen but a lot of it has to do with alcohol consumption by those who have a level of mental unwellness.  There is a continuum of what constitutes mental illness.  Not all mental unwellness is mental illness.  This is an area in which we can help in assisting the work of suicide prevention organisations and the office of suicide prevention of the HSE.  The Minister can, through this proposed legislation, contribute to assisting such work in trying to reduce the levels of suicide, self-harming and suicide ideation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#J00300","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2344,"content":"<p>I apologise for having to leave earlier for a while.  I thank the Minister, Dr. Holohan and Ms Luddy for attending.  I thank the Minister for his speech.  I wholeheartedly support minimum unit pricing.  One of my questions, which has already been asked, was how long it would take to put this in place.<\/p> <p>  I have two other questions.  The first relates to the structural separation in shops and supermarkets and, I hope, in petrol stations.  Who will supervise and monitor the visible availability of alcohol?  How will it be put in place?  The Minister stated that business would not be put under any extreme pressure if there were costs involved in making a separate area in a supermarket or petrol station.  One of the drawbacks, even in supermarkets and shops I have been in, is that there is a separate area for alcohol which used be at the back but which seems to be creeping up to the front where the service desk is.<\/p> <p>  How young people view alcohol is a result of the pressure on them which is caused by being unable to cope with many of the difficulties they face.<\/p><p>There is no mention of education in the report.  Maybe it will appear in another report.  I have heard people saying that education does not make any difference to people who want to drink.  As a mother, I have always spoken to my children about the ill effects of drink, drugs and smoking.  I have achieved some of my goals with them but not all.  If we are going to educate young people about the consumption of alcohol and drug addiction, it starts in the home but it must continue into school.  Is there anything in the Bill for schools and colleges?  I know from my children about the consumption of alcohol on so-called \"cheap nights\" where the price is a lot lower than it should be.  What about the sale and marketing of alcohol?   <\/p><p> Education should take place as early as primary school.  I met a little fellow a number of years ago.  He visited me in the youth club one night and I could see he was not in a nice place.  He had drunk a half a bottle of vodka before he came in and he should have been carted off in an ambulance.  Alcohol is readily available.  I welcome the introduction of minimum unit prices but I want to know how it is going to be monitored, particularly in stores, supermarkets and petrol stations.  If businesses are not prepared to pay the cost of moving drink in the aisles, how will it be tackled?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#J00400","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2346,"content":"<p>I hope I have jotted down all the questions and I am sorry if I miss any.  The analysis of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is totally correct.  It is 11 litres per person, but that includes the whole population, including the 20% of people who are teetotallers.  That brings the average down.  We have a higher proportion of teetotallers than other countries.  The intention is that the Bill will be published before the summer recess so that Members will be able to consider it over the recess and propose amendments, but that is not 100% under my control.  Things can get held up at the Office of the Attorney General or the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, meaning that it has to go back to Cabinet and committee, so I cannot promise it, but that is what we are working towards.  I want it to go through before this D&aacute;il and Seanad end.  A lot of work has been put into it and it would be a real shame if it fell to the next D&aacute;il to start from scratch or look at it again.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made the point that a minimum unit price, MUP, may affect those on lowest incomes the most.  There is a grain of truth in that because people on lower incomes are more likely to buy low-cost alcohol and are therefore more likely to be affected by this measure, though that depends on how much they drink.  If they do not drink at all it does not affect them at all and if they drink a small amount it is only going to affect them to a small extent.  The corollary of that, however, is that people on low incomes are more likely to abuse alcohol and there is a correlation between social class and alcohol abuse.  Those on lower incomes and who are poorer are more likely to abuse alcohol.  In many ways, alcohol contributes to poverty and poverty contributes to alcohol.  Poverty might drive some people to alcohol and alcohol might cause poverty for others, because if one grows up in a household where one's parents abuse alcohol, surely one is much less likely to get a good start in life.  If one drinks heavily in school or college one is not going to do as well.  If one drinks as an adult one is going to miss work and is less likely to get promoted.  There probably is a correlation between poverty and alcohol and between inequality and alcohol, so the fact that it may affect that group more in some ways strengthens the argument for it, not from the point of view of disposable income but from the point of view of public health.<\/p> <p>  Among the groups that can be counted as low income are students and children.  Students and children do not have a lot of disposable cash and they buy really cheap alcohol with it, so it will affect them more, but it is kind of supposed to, as they are the ones who are most at risk of damaging their health, their mental health and everything else from alcohol consumption.<\/p> <p>  Senator van Turnhout and others asked about the code of conduct.  At the moment the code of conduct is voluntary and not legally enforceable.  That will be replaced by regulations, by statutory instruments, by law.  It is not that we are going to put the code on a statutory footing, which, as the Senator will know from her experience with Children First, does not necessarily work anyway.  It will be done by regulation and by law.  It will not then be voluntary but will be legally enforceable, and there will be penalties.  Even if the code is not changed - and I am not saying it cannot be strengthened - it will make a difference, because the current code is widely flouted.  For example, one is not supposed to associate alcohol advertising with speed but that is done all the time.  I am ashamed to admit I was at the Bavaria City Racing event.  How could one associate alcohol with high speed to a greater extent than that?  Some of the advertisements associate alcohol with sporting prowess - one drinks a certain beer and can throw a rugby ball or hit a light switch.  That is a total violation of the code.  A similar case is where a player is heading for the try line and the Guinness turns into a ball; he catches it and scores a try.  If he has had that many pints he is not going to be good at the violin or score a try.  In fact, he is more likely to drop the ball.  <\/p> <p>  We will certainly examine the possibility of using online advertising and apps, and I would be interested if the Senator could give me more information on what they have done in Finland in that regard.  I have a sense, though, that when it comes to online advertising we will only be able to deal with it on a European or an international level.  It is, after all, the World Wide Web.<\/p> <p>  Enforcement will be carried out by environmental health officers.  They are people who work for the HSE and are part of the health family.  They go into restaurants and shut them down when there are hygiene issues and they are very effective.  They go into the pubs and enforce the smoking ban, at which they are also pretty effective, and they also enforce the regulations around sunbeds.  They will be given this additional, very important role on alcohol.  They will need to be supported and to get an increase in resources.  They are a good bunch of people.  I do not think a lot of people around the country know what an environmental health officer is, but the job they do is enormously important and very valuable.<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that health labels will be dealt with by regulation and signed off by me as Minister in the same way as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, signs off on road signs.  I agree that they should probably include a warning about cancer, because alcohol is a major contributory factor in liver cancer, oesophageal cancer and so many other cancers. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Neville and Senator van Turnhout asked about the commencement of the existing section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  That is legislation that belongs to the Department of Justice and Equality, so it would fall to the Minister for Justice and Equality to enact it.  There are two reasons it has not been enacted six or seven years later.  First, it is very onerous and requires a separate till and walls, which is perhaps is a little bit too onerous on some retail outlets.  Second and more significantly, there is no enforcement mechanism.  Even though it is a law, there are no powers to enforce it nor any penalties if it is breached, so it is an ineffectual piece of legislation and that is why it has not been commenced to date.  We will either have to bring in a mechanism to enforce it or just replace it with a new piece of legislation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked about the cross-Border issue, about which I am very aware.  We have a North-South sectoral meeting every four to six months with me, the Minister for Health, Mr. Jim Wells MLA and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly.  It is a standing item on the agenda.  We always ask how we are getting on with minimum unit pricing and we then have a discussion about it.  We have discussed the price but have not agreed one.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McLellan asked about off-licences and their proximity to schools and cr&egrave;ches.  That also falls under the Department of Justice and Equality and would be relevant to the sale of alcohol Bill and to licensing generally.  I think it would be a difficult thing to do.  I come from a very urban constituency and there is virtually nowhere that is not 100 m or 200 m from a cr&egrave;che or a school.  I would perhaps have to go to County Meath to buy a bottle of wine.  One could put it at 50 m or maybe 60 m.  One thing we will look at in that context, however, is whether we will allow advertising within a certain radius of a school.  Again, that will be tricky.<\/p><p>In urban west Dublin and in many urban areas, schools and cr&egrave;ches are very numerous.<\/p><p> Changing the age of purchase to 21 would fall under the Department of Justice and Equality legislation.  I would not be convinced as to whether raising the age to 21 would be a good idea and would have to see evidence to support it.<\/p><p> Deputy Creed spoke about sports sponsorship.  The legislation deals with sports sponsorship by regulating and restricting it very heavily.  However, we decided not to go for an outright ban for numerous reasons, most particularly that as no alternative funding source was identified, it would lead to a loss of income for sport which would then percolate down to local levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#K00200","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2348,"content":"<p>Could that loss of revenue not be offset against the saving in the public health of the nation, resulting in a dividend in the long term?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#L00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2349,"content":"<p>One potentially could, but it was not agreed.

Drink abuse among low-income families and students is more in evidence because it happens in a more public way.  People are going from their homes to a pub.  That would be the case with students.  They are not buying in drink to drink in their homes.

My understanding is that it is not only an issue of visibility, but the research does show that the low-income groups spend a higher proportion of their income on alcohol and drink more heavily.  It is not just that it is more visible, or that there are large numbers of wealthy people secretly drinking huge amounts of expensive alcohol.

The vast majority of alcohol consumption happened in the pub environment when we were younger.  The off-licence or off-trade was not a significant component of our lives.

The World Health Organization has identified Europe as the heaviest drinking region in the world.  It is noteworthy that the Irish population consumes more alcohol than the European average.  Alcohol plays a complex role in Irish society.  It represents an integral part of modern culture and is generally consumed for reasons of relaxation, enjoyment and sociability.  However, alcohol is a leading cause of global suffering, implicated in more than 60 diseases and numerous premature deaths each year.  The assistant State pathologist, Dr. Margaret Bolster, has stated that the majority of her cases are alcohol related.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland, many of those aged between 12 and 18 years are drinking regularly, and young Irish people report being drunk more often than their European counterparts.  It has been reported that young people who drink alcohol before the age of 15 years are four times more likely to develop alcohol dependency than those who wait until they are 21.  Each additional year of delayed drinking reduces the likelihood of alcohol dependence by 14%.  A number of factors influence the age at which individuals start using alcohol.  These include peer pressure, societal factors and parental factors.  Parents serve as role models for their children in imparting important health-related knowledge and appropriate behaviour.  Parents are the most influential factor on their children during their formative years.  The alcohol consumption pattern of the parent observed by the child is taken to be the norm and is a behaviour which they are likely to emulate.  As one child noted in a recent Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, report, &ldquo;If you see your parents get drunk, whether you like it or not, it will have an effect on your life&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>A recent systematic review highlights that previous research on the subject of the parent-child relationship and alcohol use have found inconclusive or weak evidence.  Mongan <i>et al<\/i>noted the need to investigate the relationship between parental attitudes and alcohol consumption and adolescent alcohol consumption in an Irish context.  Personally, we observed different drinking patterns among our peers.  We found this interesting because it is well known that peer pressure is one of the principal factors in alcohol consumption among adolescents.  We realised there must be other influences impacting adolescent drinking behaviour.  Thus, the aim of our research was to investigate the relationship between parental attitude and consumption of alcohol and their adolescents' alcohol consumption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429777800,"counter":2386,"content":"<p>We undertook a cross-sectional survey.  The topics included in this questionnaire were alcohol use, self-reported height and weight, smoking status and mental health and well-being questions, all of which were previously validated.  The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for Consumption, AUDIT-C, which is a series three questions that indicate whether or not someone is a hazardous drinker, was employed.  Parental attitude questions were taken from Research New Zealand papers and consisted of a statement with which parents disagreed or agreed or felt neutral about.<\/p><p>It determined what parents considered to be social norms and also what they thought about their own drinking behaviour.  The questionnaire was distributed to all fifth and sixth year pupils, as well as their parents, in the Kanturk-Mallow local electorate area during the academic year 2014-15.  Each parent and pupil had a corresponding number on their questionnaires in order to link their results.  This gave us a sample size of 982 fifth and sixth year students in eight schools.  We received a response rate of 37%, made up of 360 students and their parents.  Ethical approval for the survey was granted in October from the clinical research ethics committee of the Cork teaching hospitals.  The data was entered in an Excel document and transferred to IBM SPSS Statistics 20 for statistical analysis.  AUDIT-C and BMI scores were calculated according to specific instrument guidelines.  Analysis included descriptive analysis, frequency analysis and binary logistic regression analysis. <\/p><p> The mean age of adolescents was 16.89 years, the youngest being 15 years and the oldest 19 years.  The mean age of parents participating in the survey was 49.69 years for fathers and 47.53 years for mothers.  Notably, 87% of adolescents reported having a normal BMI, compared to 47% of parents.  In addition, less than 10% of adolescents had smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, and although 46% of the parents surveyed had smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, the majority of these, 72.6%, were ex-smokers. <\/p><p> Our study focused on hazardous alcohol consumption.  The AUDIT-C results showed that 34% of adolescents surveyed displayed a hazardous drinking pattern.  This was reported by 39.6% of males compared to 29.9% of females.  Some 47% of all parents surveyed were hazardous drinkers.  This was reported by 50% of fathers and 46.8% of mothers.  In regard to parental attitudes, over 90% of parents disagreed with allowing their adolescents to get drunk sometimes and rejected the idea that getting drunk is part of having fun as an adolescent.  Also, more than 80% of all parents surveyed believed they set a good example for their adolescent on alcohol consumption.  Notably, some 16.8% of parents said they would not be worried if their adolescent consumed four pints of alcohol once a month.  Almost one fifth of parents surveyed were not concerned if another parent was to supply their adolescent with alcohol.  More than 40% of parents agreed with allowing their adolescent to drink on special occasions.  It is also notable that mothers were more likely to believe that their adolescent had consumed too much alcohol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eimear Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429777800,"counter":2388,"content":"<p>Using univariate logistic regression, we investigated the impact of the father on his adolescent's hazardous drinking pattern.

Previous research has noted the importance of a minimum age for consumption.  Exposure to alcohol in adolescence can have detrimental effects on brain development and intellectual capabilities and increases the likelihood of later alcohol dependence.  The current study notes that the majority of hazardous adolescent drinkers, 68.2%, were under the legal age of consumption.  Therefore, off-licences and pubs should be monitored continuously.  There needs to be improved policing of the law regarding under age adolescents purchasing alcohol, in addition to responsible bar staff training.<\/p> <p>  Previous research has noted the impact of advertising and marketing aimed at adolescents in their formative years.  The promotion of alcohol in areas such as sport and music is becoming increasingly prevalent, and evidence shows that alcohol marketing increases the likelihood that adolescents will begin to drink, or drink more if they already consume alcohol.  The protective effects of a full ban on alcohol sponsorship of sporting events have been demonstrated in previous studies.  This evidence-based approach to reducing alcohol-related harm should be introduced by the Government.  We are pleased to see the introduction of a minimum unit price for alcohol, as proposed in the current Bill.  This has been proven to be an effective measure when tackling hazardous alcohol consumption across the population.<\/p> <p>  Over the previous number of decades, alcohol consumption has continued to increase despite public health efforts.  Education campaigns were regularly favoured when tackling alcohol consumption.  However, these campaigns have been shown to be ineffective.  Currently, the cost to the taxpayer of hazardous alcohol consumption in Ireland is &euro;3.7 billion annually.  By introducing this Bill, the Oireachtas has the opportunity to improve the lives of Irish people.  It has the opportunity to save 88 lives every month which are currently lost to alcohol-related disease.  It provides us with the opportunity to protect vulnerable children affected by their parents' alcohol consumption, as seen in every community across the country.  It provides us with an opportunity to make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eimear Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2390,"content":"<p>That was an excellent presentation with some revealing statistics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#O00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2391,"content":"<p>I extend sincere congratulations to Mr. Ian O'Sullivan and Ms Eimear Murphy on their wonderful achievement in the BT Young Scientist Competition in 2015.  This is a great credit to both of them and to their school in Kanturk.  I congratulate the teaching staff and all involved.  The presentation was excellent and, as they indicated, as legislators we have an opportunity to make an impact.  The witnesses were in the visitors' area during the earlier session.  We all committed to ensuring the passage of the proposed legislation even though we have varying degrees of confidence, or a lack of confidence, in some of the measures.  The critical point made by the Minister is that this will be up for review after three years.  That is where we have the opportunity to measure its effectiveness.  It is down to its effectiveness, which we will debate and discuss.  It is a good thing to have a variety of views reflected here.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the correlation between hazardous drinking habits in young people or adolescents and hazardous drinking habits in their parents.  There are a number of statements about this likelihood.  One of the figures is that 34% of adults surveyed displayed hazardous drinking patterns, representing 39.6% of males and 29.9% of females.  The witnesses went on to state that 47% of all parents surveyed were hazardous drinkers.  Did the witnesses extrapolate a percentage for the relationship between the young males, the young females and the parents with hazardous drinking habits?  The figures are not included in the presentation.  Do the witnesses have the figures?  If they do not have them readily available to answer the question, I fully understand.  Perhaps it can be furnished us in the future.  I am curious to know, of the hazardous-drinking parents, how many of the young males with hazardous drinking habits came from those families, and equally for the females.<\/p><p>It is a very telling point.  There are all sorts of possible outcomes.  I know many young people who have experienced, or are experiencing, difficulties in their home environments because one or both parents drink.  They would be very much opposed to the use of alcohol, never mind its abuse.  There are varying degrees of reaction, down to the individual make-up of the young person, the degree of their exposure and its impact on the quality of life in the home.  What were the witnesses&rsquo; findings in that relationship quotient, as it applied to parents and the young males and females concerned?  I thank the witnesses and congratulate them on their success, and I wish them every success in their future studies and career paths.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#O00500","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2393,"content":"<p>I welcome Ian and Eimear to the committee and congratulate them on their fantastic achievement in winning the Young Scientist of the Year award last January.

They have achieved a great deal.<\/p> <p>  In the last line of their presentation they said the Oireachtas had an opportunity to make a difference, but the witnesses have made an enormous difference.  There should be a major public discussion about alcohol consumption and abuse, involving everybody - parents and children.  We have been shirking our responsibilities in regard to it.  The witnesses&rsquo; diligent research will have an enormous impact on public health policy for generations to come.

They have provided not only their own evidence but also the statistics on which we need to base our work.  That is very useful.  This is a children&rsquo;s rights issue, for those children who consume alcohol and also because of the indirect effects of alcohol consumption on children and young people, including domestic violence, which has clear links to alcohol.<\/p> <p>  One figure that jumped out at me is that one-fifth of parents surveyed were not concerned about their child being supplied with alcohol by another parent.  One-fifth of parents are not concerned that other adults can flout the law and buy alcohol for children.  I find that really startling.  I had assumed that the people who did that were not parents.  I hope that figure, as well as the other research, gets headlines.  Parents and adults must think about that and answer serious questions.

Do Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy think people were aware of the risks associated with excessive drinking, particularly young people?  They have the experience of conducting all of this research.  What do they consider would have the effect of getting the message across to people that excessive drinking damages health?

I thank them for their excellent presentation.  It is a huge volume of work and they have shared some interesting but shocking statistics.  We have a huge problem in this country with alcohol.  The reason we have a minimum age - 18 years - for consumption is health.  Not alone is it shocking, but it is also outrageous that one fifth of parents surveyed would not be concerned if another parent was to supply their adolescent with alcohol.  The age limit is 18 years of age for a reason and no parent should supply an under-age child with alcohol.  Furthermore, it is outrageous that parents would accept it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy said there was a need for improved policing of the law on under-age adolescents purchasing alcohol, in addition to having responsible bar staff.  In my view, there is a need for improvement in policing the law in the case of parents supplying under-age children with alcohol.  I cannot get over the fact that the statistic is so high, at 20%.  It is outrageous.  I made a point to the Minister on which he was not sold.  It was about increasing the age at which alcohol could be purchased from an off-licence to 21 years.  I was thinking about the difference in the gap between a 22 and a 23 year old supplying alcohol to a 15 or a 16 year old.

The research they have produced is, to say the least, disappointing from the point of view of parents.  In some aspects, it is shocking and highlights for parents and committee members their responsibility when it comes to under-age drinking and over-indulgence in alcohol.

It took the initiative of two very young people to establish what our drinking habits were, on which I congratulate them.<\/p> <p>  When the research was conducted and the study concluded, what was the reaction of the students and parents who had participated?  Were Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy disappointed that of the 982 people who had been given the questionnaire, only 37% had responded?  I might have missed it, but was there a figure for the number of parents who did not drink?  Of the parents surveyed, 47% were hazardous drinkers, something that jumped off the page for me.  I agree with my colleagues about the parents who were not worried that their children might drink even one pint a month.  They were not at all worried that they were actually breaking the law by telling their children to do this.  <\/p> <p>  This is a wonderful piece of work, for which Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy deserve every credit.

I salute the achievements of Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy, their families and school.<\/p> <p>  As legislators, we are preoccupied with changing the law, but what jumps off the page for me is the fact that changing the law would be relatively easy.  The ingrained nature of alcohol abuse has become a cultural norm and it is much more difficult to change human patterns of behaviour.  We can ban advertising and deal with the issue of cost, but we have a societal issue to which we must face up.  In that context, we would like to think that when history is written, 2015 will be considered to have been a watershed year when the Government, society, academia and the medical profession moved and BT recognised something for the first time in many years.<\/p><p>For the first time in many years, the nature of the project that won the BT Young Scientist award was not technical, not one that scared the living daylights out of us; rather it was a social project that most of society could acknowledge and respond to by sitting up and taking notice of a problem that was a ticking time bomb.  According to the final paragraph in the submission, it is costing us &euro;3.7 billion.  The culmination of everything I have outlined will ensure 2015 will be a watershed moment.  However, changing the law is much easier than changing the cultural norms evident in the research.<br\/><br\/>Interestingly, the final paragraph reads: <blockquote>Education campaigns were regularly favoured when tackling alcohol consumption.  However, these campaigns have been shown to be ineffective.  <\/blockquote>Is this a criticism of the principle behind education campaigns?  I am aware, as I am sure our guests' school community are, of the inclination to add to schools' responsibilities; for example, they must educate students about alcohol awareness, the importance of fitness, etc.  Responsibility for solving all ills is dumped on schools, but is that the nature of how we try to inform younger people?  Do our guests share my opinion that it is not that education does not have a role to play but that we must act at a much earlier age?  At secondary school level it is probably too late.  I am in favour of doing this in primary school and confronting fifth and sixth class children with graphic presentations showing the consequences of alcohol abuse.  With due respect to the Pioneer movement which does excellent work, I am unsure whether its format - perhaps I have a dated perception of the movement - of highlighting the evils of alcohol abuse will change people.  Instead, role models, be they sports people or reformed alcoholics, could confront young people with the reality of what it is like to be that person who suffers from alcohol abuse and show its impact on them personally, their families, communities, health, financial standing and relationships with their partners and children.  It is not that education has failed, rather it is down to the way we have done it.  I would be in favour of earlier and a more graphic confrontation of the issue in the education system.<br\/><br\/>I congratulate our guests.  It is tremendous research that, in essence, summarises the problems we face.  Changing the law would be the easy part; changing societal norms willl be much more challenging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#Q00500","speaker":"986","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429777800,"counter":2404,"content":"<p>Before I hand back to Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy, if Mr. Davoren and Mr. Smith wish to comment on the questions asked or analysis of the presentation, they are more than welcome to do so at this juncture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#R00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429777800,"counter":2405,"content":"<p>I add my congratulations to Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy.  As someone who has conducted some research in this area, I was impressed and a little jealous when I read the report.  It was an area of study I had considered exploring, but had never been able to come up with an easy way of doing it.  This is not to say Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy's methodology was easy; it is comprehensive.  It is fabulous that they obtained information from teenagers and parents.  Others have considered parents or teenagers alone, but having both is what makes it fascinating.  It is great to have Irish evidence that confirms what has been observed internationally, that parents exert a significant influence and that liberal or casual attitudes on the part of parents towards their own or their teenagers' drinking increase risk.<\/p> <p>  Senator Jillian van Turnhout and Deputy Sandra McLellan appeared upset and surprised at the number of parents who had seemed to be providing alcohol for teenagers.  I speak to parents regularly in schools.  By the time teenagers reach the age of 16 or 17 years, many parents believe they are doing the right thing by giving their children alcohol.  Once they have made that decision, some of them also believe it is okay to allow other parents to offer drink in what they view as a controlled environment.  For whatever reason, they have been caused to believe drinking by teenagers is inevitable.  As a result, they give permission in a misguided effort to exert control.  However, the international evidence and this new Irish evidence indicates that once teenagers are given permission by parents to drink alcohol, they seem to give themselves permission to drink even more than they are already drinking.  Rather than helping, it makes matters worse.  There is, therefore, a lack of understanding.  There is a middle class notion that, by giving kids alcohol at home, one is somehow doing the right thing when, in fact, it does not work.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Michael Creed's comment on the Holy Grail, the ultimate challenge is to try to change cultural attitudes, not just towards drink particularly but specifically to getting drunk.  As a society, we have a particularly tolerant attitude towards getting drunk, whether one is 16 or 60 years of age.  However, I am optimistic that legislation is an important first step.  For example, in terms of drink driving, it seems that the legislation came first and the shift in attitude followed.  It is a clear message from our leaders - that is what committee members are - for the first time ever in identifying alcohol as a health issue and putting in place measures to begin turning the tide.  This will assist the public.  In fact, there already appears to be momentum among the public towards recognising this as a health issue, about which we as individuals, adults, teenagers and parents need to do more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015042300002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bobby Smith"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429777800,"counter":2406,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Smith in that this is a cultural shift.

The introduction of minimum pricing can drive the issue forward.<\/p> <p>  Questions arose about the response rate to the survey, at approximately 37%.
