I have some sympathy with the amendments put forward by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and we try to deal with them in amendment No. 30.  The problem is that the term &quot;normal farm practices&quot; is quite difficult to define legally.  Clearly, we are not trying to make it impossible or illegal for farmers to undertake normal farm practice whether with regard to bringing bulls or cows to a show or training animals for competition, etc.<\/p><p>  There are also sectors outside of farming that are involved in training animals, whether in the equine or dog area or elsewhere.  Therefore, we want to be careful we do not introduce legislation that makes it illegal to train animals in a way that is perfectly reasonable.  I am not happy our amendment deals with this fully, having talked through the consequences of it with officials.  Our amendment states:<blockquote>  In page 18, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following subsection:<br \/><br \/>  &#8220;(12) Nothing in subsection (1)(<i>a<\/i>) or (<i>e<\/i>) prevents the training of an animal by persons competent to train the animal provided -- (a) unnecessary suffering is not thereby caused to the animal,<br \/>(b) the public does not have access to the place where training occurs, and<\/blockquote>Obviously, I support condition (<i>a<\/i>).  However, looking at condition (<i>b<\/i>), we could take Monty Roberts as an example, a person who makes a living out of showing people how to break in horses in a way that is perfectly humane and a lot more acceptable than the way in which many other people break in horses.  This is something we should encourage, rather than make it illegal.  What our amendment was trying to do was to ensure that the public is not invited to see something that is cruel as a performance.  However, the by-product is that we seem to be making illegal the training of an animal in public where the training involves some level of struggle between that person and the animal, although done humanely.  We should not be doing that.  Therefore, I want to bring forward an amendment that is similar to amendment No. 30, as we do not seem to have got it quite right yet.  I intend to withdraw amendment No. 30, with a view to bringing forward a better amendment on Report Stage that will deal with the full suite of issues.<\/p><p>  The final part of amendment  30, part (<i>c<\/i>) makes a provision, provided &quot;any activity involved in the training of the animal is not prohibited by animal health and welfare regulations.&#8221;.  This covers the training element required.  This applies, for example, to Garda training of dogs to sniff out drugs or other banned products in airports.  There is a need for practical training for animals, whether conducted by a farmer, arms of the State, a Monty Roberts type of person or his Irish equivalent.  <\/p><p>  This is a very important section and it is important we stamp out practices such as dog and cock fighting and animal baiting, whereby animals are pitted against each other to entertain people.  I am aware Deputy Ferris has put forward an amendment which is a good amendment, which would provide that not only do we make it illegal to organise this type of activity, but we would make it illegal to attend or film it or to put that film up on social media.  We are trying to give the tools to the Garda to stamp out a barbaric activity where people get entertained by watching animals pulling each other apart.  However, in trying to make this section comprehensive, we do not want an implication for genuine people training animals for show or for work.  We need to get the balance right in that regard.  I feel close to that balance with amendment No. 30, but do not feel it is perfect yet.  Therefore, I will withdraw it with a view to bringing forward better wording on Report Stage.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 28 seeks to replace the word &quot;bull&quot; with the word &quot;bovine&quot;.  This is self-explanatory.  Page 17, section 15 (1)(<i>e<\/i>) categorises the throwing or casting of ropes or other appliances and refers to any unbroken horse or untrained bull.  Basically, this concerns forcibly breaking in animals and is unacceptable.  We do not want this to cover bulls only, so are using the term &quot;bovine&quot; to cover a broader range.  In other words, whether a bull is just being castrated or not should not be the issue, but that the treatment or training should be acceptable.  I agree with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v seeks in that regard.<\/p><p>  With regard to the farm practices, I want to ensure we deal with the issue properly in terms of the wording we propose.  Therefore, I will reintroduce an amendment very similar to amendment No. 30 on Report Stage if that is acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012120500005#D00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1354702200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>There is an obvious situation with regard to breaking in a horse, when the trainer will end up wrestling with the horse.  With regard to the public not having access to where the training takes place, there are many open farms throughout the country where people see farmers working with and training sheep dogs.  Therefore, I see the ban on access to the public as causing a problem.  Open farms are becoming more common and we need to be careful with the amendment.

This has been a difficult area to deal with and there has been a good deal of toing and froing between veterinary representative bodies and the Department to try to get the balance right on issues such as tail docking, when it can be justified, when it cannot be justified, who should do it, how it should be done and what restrictions and controls should be in place.  This new section is a significant improvement on the original section 16 dealing with the mutilation of animals.<\/p><p>  Concerns were raised about this section and its possible interaction with the Veterinary Practice Act.  Therefore, the section was re-worded to make clear that it does not impede the operation of that Act.  On the face of it, this section outlaws all operations other than where they are allowed by regulation or where they are carried out under the Veterinary Practice Act.  This includes a wide variety of activities including castration, de-horning and so on which are currently done on farms.  However, the intention is that these will all continue to be allowed by regulation.  The regulations will give clear guidance on what is acceptable, what time periods may apply or what equipment may or may not be used.  I do not intend to interfere with normal farming practices.  However, on the other hand I do not wish to allow a free-for-all whereby people can cut off bits of animals as they see fit.  Therefore, operations which do not benefit the animals themselves should be regulated.  Work has already commenced on draft regulations and I will be happy to forward details to the members of the committee in due course and we can discuss them.<\/p><p>  I propose to restrict the docking of tails for cosmetic and showing purposes.  It is possible to further restrict the activity by regulation if needed but I do not propose to do so at this juncture.  I do not propose to follow the route taken in Northern Ireland, which is based on the concept of a working dog, because this is an artificial concept and introduces unnecessary bureaucracy.  The option exists in animal health and welfare regulations to make provision having regard to breed and type of activity of the individual dogs concerned.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 32 to 34, inclusive, are rendered redundant by the redrafting of section 16.  Specifically, since the reference to firing has been removed, amendments Nos. 33 and 34 are no longer relevant.  This can be dealt with under regulation and it could apply at the end of the process i.e. after examining a series of other treatments and so on.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 89 is a knock-on amendment from the changes to section 16.  It amends section 52.  Since the numbering of section 16 has changed, the cross-reference must be updated.  It is difficult to deal fully with issues such as tail docking, firing and other specific practices, which may be justified in some cases but not others, in a blunt manner with primary legislation.  This is why, like other areas, we are looking to introduce a series of codes and new regulations to ensure that when these practices take place, they occur in an acceptable manner.<\/p><p>  I have spoken to vets about these issues.  Strong views have been expressed about tail docking in particular.  There have also been strong views from some specialist equine vets on firing.  Firing is a way of treating inflamed legs or shins on horses when no other treatment is available.  I have held some detailed discussions with one vet in particular to understand how and why this could be justified.  As someone who is involved with horses on a regular basis I was keen to understand how one could justify the firing of a horse's leg.  Anyway, there is justification for it in certain circumstances but we need to regulate it.  We are trying to deal with the complexity of these practices in a sensible way rather than impose a blunt ban.<\/p><p>  Having said that we are introducing some clear bans in the legislation.  For example, the new section will make clear that one cannot mutilate an animal for cosmetic reasons.  We are also making clear that a person will not be allowed to show an animal if it has had its tail docked for cosmetic reasons.  This will not be popular with some but I do not believe we should inflict pain and arguably mutilation on an animal for the purposes of making it look nice.  If there is a reason for it because it is a working animal, because there is no alternative or on welfare grounds because of the environment it will be working or operating in, then so be it and we should deal with it through regulation.<\/p><p>  There is a link with the Veterinary Practice Act.  The regulation must cross-reference several Acts and is not simply related to this legislation.  This is why we must work with vets and other organisations representative of various sectors, whether farming or other sectors, to ensure we get the regulations right and that they are consistent not only with this legislation but with the recently introduced veterinary legislation.<\/p><p>  We were trying to do the right thing with the original drafting of section 16.  However, from various conversations and discussions held it turns out it is somewhat more complex than had originally been thought.  The new section 16 allows us to deal with some of that complexity through regulation.  We can sit around the table with the people involved, primarily vets, to get the balance right between what is acceptable and what is not and under what conditions.<\/p><p>  We should not forget that regulations are not voluntary codes of conduct.  They are instruments of law but they are not defined through primary legislation.  We can return and discuss the regulations at committee level at a later stage and that is a more sensible way to deal with it.  Otherwise we would have to provide for it in this legislation and, as a consequence, we may have to amend it at a later stage, but the amending of primary legislation is not a straightforward matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012120500007#F00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354704000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 16.

It deals solely with the laying of poison.  There is no point in double and potentially contradictory legislation.  The protection of wildlife is dealt with comprehensively in the wildlife Acts.  Where poison is laid, efforts must be made to ensure protected animals are not exposed to the poison.  In reality this means simple precautions such as laying poison in pipes or metal poison boxes so that pet animals cannot access it.<\/p><p>  Subsection (6) states: &quot;In this section &quot;land&quot; does not include areas within the structure of a building.&quot;  A householder using poison to deal with a vermin problem in a walled garden, for example, will not need to put up a poison warning sign on the front gate.

We discussed cats and stray animals with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v at the last meeting.  Anyone who knows cats will agree that they are a semi-wild species.  The issue of stray cats and kittens is a grey area and in particular how to deal with them in rural areas.  Cats breed in farm sheds and they hunt vermin but these are not domesticated pets.  This section imposes an obligation on those who lay poison for legitimate reasons to minimise the risk of the poison being consumed by other animals.  The wildlife Act deals with the protection of birds in particular.  There is the need to avoid having two different legislative measures which would cause legal uncertainty.

The system we use in the context of live cattle exports is a good example in this regard.  We have in place the tightest veterinary regulations in Europe in respect of the shipping of live cattle.  As an alternative to selling them into factories, we will potentially be in a position to avail of new markets in respect of the export of cattle as early as next month.  From the point of view of price, this will be a good development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012120500009#H03600","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354705200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I accept what the Minister is saying and can accept the practicality and common sense of his argument, in that his officials cannot be authorities on animal welfare regulations in the 167 countries to which we export.

I have been involved in launching and supporting a project to develop horse racing in China which will involve Irish horses.  Some top Irish horses will go there and will be part of a growing breeding network within China.  We will ensure that welfare concerns are part of that discussion as well as the commercial opportunities for the thoroughbred breeding industry here and for training in Ireland.  I have looked at the site where the new infrastructure will be built and have spoken to the people involved.  I am satisfied that the welfare of the breeding mares that go to China will be looked after.  We have an obligation to ensure that is the case.  People would be very uncomfortable if we did not do that.  It is one thing sending an animal for slaughter to a country and another to send an animal to a country  for the remainder of its lifetime for breeding purposes and so on.  Ireland is seen as a country that sets pretty high standards in animal welfare and that is one of the reasons people in other countries come to Ireland to learn from what we have achieved, particularly regarding thoroughbreds.

In this legislation we would like to bring absolute clarity to this issue of selling animals to minors - that is, to say that a horse, which in most cases is the point at issue, can only be sold to a person who is over the age of 16.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012120500010#J01200","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354705800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Many of us were encouraged by parents to buy animals when starting off in life at the age of 13, 14 or 15.

I am sure the practice works very well when a 14 or 15 year old buys a calf and takes it home to the family farm.  I have some sympathy with what the Deputy is saying, therefore.  My problem is that, at fairs, particularly horse fairs, there is much selling and buying by minors.  Often the same animal is bought and sold at the same fair with a view to making a profit.  This is not the kind of activity that a 14 or 15 year old should be involved in.

We are looking forward to the opportunity to answer questions and get into the issues in more detail.  I will provide some background and my colleagues will speak to the substantive issues, with Dr. N&iacute; Mhuirthile taking the presentation to its end.<\/p><p>  Transgender, or trans, people are among the most vulnerable members of Irish society and experience high levels of stigmatisation and marginalisation.  Research shows that trans people experience some of the highest rates of suicidality, experience regular harassment and violence and systemic discrimination.  In Ireland, a major contributing factor to the marginalisation of trans people is the lack of State recognition of trans identities.  Legal gender recognition would provide a process for changing the gender marker on the applicant&rsquo;s birth certificate.  This is important as birth certificates are foundational identity documents which are necessary to obtain a PPS number or to get married.  In our current position, many trans people may be able to change certain identification documents - such as a passport or driving licence - to the preferred gender but they are unable to change a birth certificate.  That can have a significant impact as it can lead to them being \"outed\" when going for jobs or to university, or in any case where identification must be shown.  This puts an individual at risk and can lead to denial of services or restrict an individual's ability to travel domestically or internationally.<\/p><p>  Ireland is one of the few remaining countries in the European Union that does not allow for legal recognition of trans people.  This is despite a High Court ruling in 2007 which found the State to be in breach of its positive obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, in failing to recognise Dr. Lydia Foy in her female gender and provide her with a new birth certificate. This was the first declaration of incompatibility to be made under the ECHR and we still have not acted on it.<\/p><p>  In May 2010, the Government set up the gender recognition advisory group, GRAG, an interdepartmental working group whose remit was \"to advise the Minister for Social Protection on the legislation required to provide for legal recognition by the State of the acquired gender of transsexuals\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012120500003#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Broden Giambrone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354713000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Is there another speaker?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012120500004#C00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354713000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>We have three speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012120500004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Broden Giambrone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354713000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I am a board member of TENI and I run the Cork Transgender Peer Support Group.  I am a transgender man.  I came out to my family and friends when I was 17 years old.  When I came out it was my choice, but when I fill out a legal document that seeks my birth name and personal public service, PPS, number I lose that choice.  I must add my legal name change with my birth certificate every time I fill out a grant application or any form from the Government.  Every time this happens I hope the person reading my documentation and making a decision will not discriminate against me based on my transgender status.  A woman from the disability allowance office rang me to ask why my name had changed from a female name to a male name.  When I told her it was because I was transgender she laughed at me and hung up the telephone.  When I go out and am asked for my passport as identification to get into a premises I am sometimes turned away because my gender marker is still \"F\" and both my birth certificate name and my current name are printed on it.<\/p><p>  Everybody has a right to a private life.  I would like my right to be recognised.  Issuing new birth certificates could easily do this and prevent embarrassment, harassment and potentially dangerous situations.  My experience of being transgender does not just affect me.  It also affects my family.  I have an amazingly supportive and loving family.  My mother put herself into almost &euro;12,000 of debt so she could send me to private school because I was bullied for two years in my State school.  She took out a loan to send me to a school where I could be called Darrin, not wear a girl's uniform and be happy.  Every member of staff and every student called me Darrin instead of derogatory and cruel names.<\/p><p>  I have many friends who are straight, gay and transgender.  If a gay friend came to me and told me they had received their official diagnosis of homosexuality, I would be shocked and appalled.  Homosexuality was decriminalised 19 years ago and people now cannot imagine a time when it was illegal.  Most people do not know that transgender people must be diagnosed with a psychiatric illness to access treatment in this country because it such a inconceivable and ridiculous notion and is discriminatory in nature.  I do not believe that because I was born in the wrong body it automatically means I have a mental illness.  There is still stigma attached to having a mental health issue in this country and to force a psychiatric condition onto another human being can have detrimental effects on that person's self image and self esteem.  When a couple apply for a civil partnership they are not asked for their gay diagnoses to prove their homosexuality.  I had to prove I was happier as the man I should have always been to my mother, my siblings and my friends, and I had to prove I had a psychiatric illness.  I should not have to prove anything to a complete stranger and seek their acceptance.  I do not have to prove I am transgender enough for anybody.<\/p><p>  My mother once asked if I was really sure that being Darrin was what I wanted.  When I told her I could not go back and be happy, she just said, \"Then we can only go forward my son.\"  I always knew transitioning would never be easy, but please do not make it any harder than it already is.  All I want is to be treated as an equal and with respect and dignity, as a non-transgender person would be.  I want nothing more and nothing less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012120500004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darrin Matthews"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354713000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>My name is Victoria Mullin. I have a tax consultancy practice in Tallaght. I am transgender and I am not insane.  I am proud to be Irish.  As a nation, Ireland has come a long way from the days of the comely maidens dancing at the crossroads.  Single mothers no longer need die alone in shame or be squirrelled away in a laundry as punishment for their so-called sins.  We have witnessed the introduction of equal rights for women and the legalisation of contraception, divorce and homosexuality.  We have achieved much and many of us look back in amazement at how backward the country was not long ago.  However, those who miss the good old days of inequality can take some comfort.  They still have the transgender community to play with.  We need the help of those who do not miss those days, and we need it now.<\/p><p>  It appears it is still okay to discriminate against us, ignore our rights, ridicule us with jokes and sick advertisements and, now, it even appears okay to demand an end to our marriages.  Less than 20 years ago divorce was still illegal in Ireland.  Today, however, I and people like me face the possibility of being forced to divorce to access our right to legal recognition.  The legislation currently being prepared is based on the report of the gender recognition advisory group.  Imagine the furore that would erupt if a group was formed by the Government to report on women's rights and the Government went on to appoint only men to that group.  We would all be shocked.  No member of the GRAG was transgender or even experienced in transgender issues.  That absence is evident.  Among many of its ill-thought out recommendations, the report clearly states that people in an existing valid marriage should be excluded.  The group demands that we must divorce our husbands or wives before the State will recognise who we are.  This is not some nightmare scenario from the Nazi period of the 1930s, but it might be our life in Ireland in the 21st century.  Legal recognition should not be contingent on the destruction of our marriages and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012120500004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Victoria Mullin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354713600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I have been asked to address the committee on the legal aspects of the introduction of gender recognition legislation.  I reiterate that Ireland is obliged to do something to recognise the preferred gender identity of trans people as a result the High Court decision in Foy <i>v<\/i>. An t-Ard Chl&aacute;raitheoir No. 2 from 2007.  It was the recommendation of the gender recognition advisory group that legislation would be the most effective mechanism by which to achieve recognition.  I am conscious of my limited time to talk so I will keep the critique brief but I am willing to answer questions afterwards.<\/p><p>  The gender recognition advisory group report outlined six qualification criteria that must be met in order for an application for gender recognition to be successful.  These are as follows: residency or Irish birth registration; a minimum age of 18 years; people in existing marriage or civil partnership are excluded; there must be evidence of a settled intention to live permanently in the recognised gender; the person must live for a minimum of two years, full-time, in the role before being recognised; and the person must have final diagnosis of gender identity disorder and relevant medical supporting evidence or have gone undergone gender reassignment surgery with medical evidence thereof or be recognised in an alternative jurisdiction.  I will critique only three of these criteria.<\/p><p>  The minimum age criterion is an oddity given that it is legal to consent to undergoing treatment for gender identity disorder at 16 years of age without parental consent.  One can do it before the age of 16 with the consent of parents.  Obliging people who go through a transition early in life, particularly in the case of intersex children, who may have been assigned a gender at birth that does not reflect their identity or subsequent bodily development, to live with incorrect identification document under the age of 18 years is particularly injurious when we live in a society where the vast majority of schools are single sex schools.  This is recognised in the High Court in S <i>v<\/i>. An Bord Ucht&aacute;la in 2009.<\/p><p>  The more problematic aspects of the scheme are the two my colleagues referred to - the marriage and medical issues.  To require couples to divorce where one party has transitioned subsequent to the marriage, in order for that person to be legally recognised in the preferred gender identity, is constitutionally unsound.  Article 41.3.1&deg; protects the institution of marriage.  For divorce to be possible, according to the Constitution, a couple must live apart for four or five years with no reasonable prospect of reconciliation.  This is not the case where marriage survives one spouse transitioning gender.  For the trans spouse to be recognised, the couple must split up the family and perjure themselves in court in order to obtain a divorce so that the trans spouse is eligible to make an application under the proposed legislative scheme.  This is particularly invasive to the rights of the non-trans spouse and any children of the marriage to remain members of the marital family.  As an alternative, we suggest the legislation makes no mention of marriage or divorce.  We recognise this could create an apparent anomaly where, post recognition, there would be what appears to be a same-sex marriage.  However, we argue this is not the case.  In law, the crucial time when the validity of marriage is assessed is the moment at which the marriage was entered into.  We see this time and again in the case of nullity.  The practice is to consider the situation of the individuals at the time the marriage was contracted.  By analogy, if the person is 78 when he or she is discovered to have been underage at the time of marriage, it does not retrospectively validate the marriage.  Similarly, we argue that in the case of trans marriages, both presented and were legally recognised as being of the opposite gender at the moment of marriage, they contracted a valid, opposite sex heterosexual marriage that continues to be legally valid.<\/p><p>  The second issue is the medical evidence required by the gender recognition advisory group.  This is either a diagnosis of gender identity disorder or evidence of having undergone gender recognition surgery.  Previous examples of this diagnostic criteria can be seen in the UK Gender Recognition Act of 2004.  When this was introduced, it was welcomed because it dispensed with the need for applicants to undergo any form of treatment prior to recognition.  This represented best international practice at the time.  Now, eight years later, it has become the subject of criticism.  As legislation is confined to the specific diagnosis of gender identity disorder, it excludes a number of people who might need the rights contained in the legislation, such as intersex individuals, those born with bodies combining both male and female biological characteristics.  Additionally, the medical diagnosis itself is under review and yesterday it was announced the wording would change so that gender identity disorder no longer exists as a medical condition and is replaced by gender dysphoria.  This immediately invalidates the English legislation.  It seems shortsighted to knowingly import an archaic diagnosis into Irish law.  The requirements to have undergone gender recognition surgery is a throwback to exceedingly outmoded understandings of gender identity, which the UK Act was lauded for abandoning.  It is impossible to access treatment without a diagnosis and so the requirement for intervention is worryingly retrograde.<\/p><p>  Increasingly, international human rights discourse recognises the need to depathologise legal gender recognition to acknowledge that legal rights should not be contingent on medical treatment pathways.  The current foremost example of international best practice in the area is the legislation introduced in Argentina last May, which simply enables an individual seeking recognition to complete a form outlining the preferred gender identity without any subsequent evidence or information.  Thus, the person becomes the final arbitrator of the legal gender.  This simplicity of the Argentinian scheme neatly avoids the potential pitfalls of the gender recognition advisory group's scheme.  It is to this model that TENI suggests the Oireachtas looks in seeking a precedent for how to approach the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012120500005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tanya N&iacute; Mhuirthile"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I think witnesses for their presentation.

It is difficult for us to estimate how many transgender people there are in Ireland.  There are a great many reasons for this.  People do not come out.  There is no formal process for people to come out so we cannot give definitive figures.  In the past year, however, more than 600 people have reached out to Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, through our support and information line.  In 2011, we know that 300 people went to different support groups throughout Ireland.  The way they deduce broader transgender populations in Scotland is that they assume that for every person who goes to a support group, one can multiply that figure by ten.  In any case, we are looking at thousands of transgender people.  As Irish society becomes more open and more inclusive, more people come out.

That is under the Minister's remit.  One of our concerns is about the delay.  Many of these issues were raised during the process when the gender recognition advisory group invited submissions.  If one reads through the GRAG report, the voices that come across most strongly are much more the medical experts - the psychiatrists - who put in submissions.  One does not hear the voice of transgender people and their experiences, which is one of the reasons we wanted to have Mr. Darrin Mathews and Ms Victoria Mullin to speak to that.  Their voice is important as the legislation will affect people's lives.  Many of the issues were raised through the submission's process, both written and oral, and yet they did not make it into the GRAG report.  I caution about that danger.  It is five years since Dr. Foy won her case and still we are waiting.  That is the challenge.<\/p><p>  The Minister spoke at the fourth European transgender council that TENI held in September.

I am seeking a supplementary sum of &euro;685 million in 2012. This is necessary for two reasons: there is a need for a higher Exchequer subvention for the social insurance fund because PRSI contributions will be lower than expected this year and a higher live register figure than provided for in the Estimates.  The figure of &euro;685 million is made up as follows: &euro;418 million for a higher Exchequer subvention to the social insurance fund owing to lower than expected PRSI receipts; &euro;264 million to meet higher expenditure on Vote schemes and services and administration; and &euro;3 million in respect of other balances.<\/p><p>  I propose to provide further information on the composition of the first two items.  The higher Exchequer subvention to the social insurance fund is made up as follows: lower social insurance fund income, with an estimated outturn of &euro;6.63 billion in 2012, some &euro;454 million or 6.4% less than the original estimate owing to a shortfall in PRSI receipts, offset by lower expenditure on social insurance fund schemes expenditure of &euro;8.87 billion, or approximately &euro;36 million or 0.4% lower than estimated.  Arising from lower PRSI receipts and slightly lower expenditure, the Exchequer subvention will be &euro;2.23 billion.  This represents a shortfall of approximately &euro;418 million or is 23% higher than estimated.<\/p><p>  The excess on Vote 37 schemes, services and administration in 2012 is &euro;264 million.  There are two main elements: there has been an overspend of &euro;271 million on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance arising from a higher live register figure, which is offset by an underspend of &euro;7 million on all other schemes, services and administration funded from the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  There is expected to be an average live register figure of 437,300, compared to a figure of 425,000 provided for in the Department&rsquo;s Estimate.  The additional cost is expected to be &euro;235 million, with the overspend of &euro;271 million on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance being offset by an underspend of &euro;36 million on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Apart from jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, expenditure on all other schemes, services and administration, when taken together, is expected to be just below target.  While additional sums are necessary for a number of schemes, these are being compensated for by anticipated underspends on other schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FA32012120500002#A00400","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354705200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her presentation.  The sum of &euro;685 million is enormous.  In the news yesterday and today there has been much emphasis, as there was yesterday in the D&aacute;il, on the deficit in the health budget, which is approximately &euro;380 million.  This is almost double that amount.  A frightening amount of extra money is required at the last moment.  I do not blame the Minister personally, but it seems a little strange to shunt it into a committee to be discussed on a day on which we are all very busy and have other commitments.  An enormous amount of taxpayers' money is involved.  I understood things were to be done differently and did not expect to be at a committee meeting for a relatively short period of time discussing the expenditure of &euro;685 million of taxpayers' money.  Obviously, we do not oppose the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p>  The reason for the overspend on jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit is obviously the live register is higher than anticipated.  Will the Minister confirm that the average figure is approximately 12,500?  The bigger sum of approximately &euro;418 million is due to the fact that income in the social insurance fund is lower than anticipated.  Fewer people have contributed to it because fewer than anticipated are at work.  Does the Minister have the figure for the difference between the number at work and the number the Government had anticipated at the start of the year?  I note the overspend on jobseeker's allowance is offset to some extent by an underspend on jobseeker's benefit.  Will the Minister comment on whether this has anything to do with the change in the rules for the jobseeker's benefit scheme with regard to moving from a six day to a five day period?<\/p><p>  Estimated expenditure on the supplementary welfare allowance was just under &euro;160 million, whereas actual expenditure has exceeded &euro;180 million.

It is obvious that no one will oppose an Estimate for money that will go to the most vulnerable in society.  My only problem is that it has arrived on the day of the budget and we have not had more time to debate it and to tease out some of the major failures underlying the Estimate put before us on last year's budget day, an Estimate that was revised twice during the year.  There was a failure in terms of predicting how bad the situation would get and how some of the heads in question would be left short or reach their targets.<\/p><p>  The main change is the shortfall in the Social Insurance Fund.  It could have been predicted, albeit not to the full degree.  It is short &euro;400 million, which is a substantial amount.  Some of that could have been predicted, given the number of people who are unemployed and dependent on jobseeker's benefit and the fact that people are living and drawing their pensions for longer.  The Social Insurance Fund is set up in such a way that, in times of recession, it will be short and dependent on fund transfers from the Exchequer.  No one is arguing that this should not happen.  In times of plenty, the fund is supposed to be bumped up to the point at which it becomes sufficient to address the cyclical nature of the economy.<\/p><p>  This shows up the fact that our society and the Government in particular face a major challenge in ensuring that people are in work.  This Government and the previous one did not live up to it.  If people were working, the Social Insurance Fund would not be as short as it is.  This is the key element for each of the heads under discussion.<\/p><p>  Continuing to cut social welfare has an effect on the number of people employed.  If there is less money in people's pockets, it has a knock-on effect on the local economy and those supplying it.  Later today, we will see whether the Minister for Finance has any news in terms of protecting endangered jobs.<\/p><p>  A number of heads are short.  For example, the FIS requires an extra &euro;32 million, some 16% of the Revised Estimate.  Not only does this relate to my point on more people being out of work, but it also means that those currently in employment are on reduced hours.  They are underemployed.  A number of studies, including one by this committee, have been done on how to address this issue.  Given people's low incomes, they can apply for FIS.  It is a safety net for the working poor.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Dea touched on a further matter, namely, the T&uacute;s, or yellow pack, community employment, CE, scheme.  It could not spend &euro;18 million plus.  The JobBridge scheme could not spend &euro;11 million plus.  We requested that the Minister for Social Protection protect the CE scheme and increase the number of places thereon, yet it is not succeeding to meet its targets.  The key point is not that people are refusing to take up T&uacute;s or JobBridge placements.  The figure for subhead A21, the back to education allowance, shows that the Minister is seeking additional money.  T&uacute;s has &euro;16 million extra.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FA32012120500004#C00200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354706400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The sub-committee does not have the power to approve or amend the Estimates.

I thank Deputies Willie O'Dea and Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh for supporting the Supplementary Estimate which is needed to enable us to continue to pay all recipients of social welfare that they so strongly defended in their contributions.  We had to wait for the PRSI receipts for November which, as stated by Deputy Ray Butler, were the PRSI receipts for the self-employed.  We had to do it this week because the authorisation of the D&aacute;il, in terms of the money we have to spend, expires this week.  Obviously, this would have had dramatic consequences for those in receipt of social welfare.  That is the reason for the delay.  Also, this year 30 November fell on a Friday and 1 December on a Saturday, which meant we did not receive the Exchequer returns until Tuesday.  Where these dates fall earlier in the week, we receive the returns quicker, often on the following day.  We brought the Supplementary Estimate before the sub-committee as soon as we could and I thank members for accepting this.<\/p><p>  Deputy Willie O'Dea asked about jobseeker's allowance.  The average live register figure underlying the 2012 Estimates is 425,000.  It is expected that the outturn for the year will be approximately 437,000, resulting in a higher cost of &euro;235 million for jobseekers' schemes.  This is made up of an excess of &euro;271.4 million on jobseeker's allowance which is offset by an underspend of &euro;35.7 million on jobseeker's benefit.  There is, thankfully, an underspend on jobseeker's benefit because fewer people are losing their jobs.  The employment figures at the end of November indicated that there were 417,000 people unemployed, which I accept is too high.  In terms of the live register, this is 12,000 fewer than in November 2011 and 7,000 fewer than in November 2010.

Second, the country has a demographic bonus which, in many ways, would be the envy of countries such as Germany.  We have many families with children and many older people are living longer.  From a social insurance or social welfare point of view, we must boost the Social Insurance Fund in order that we can meet the claims arising from that demographic bonus.  Many countries in Europe have populations that are shrinking rather than expanding.  Despite our economic difficulties, our population is expanding.  Pension and retirement payments for older people being such a large proportion of social protection expenditure is one of the reasons it is essential to ensure the contributions to social protection funds, PRSI, are sufficient to fund people's expectations in respect of contributory and non-contributory pensions.  In the future, as we will have more retired persons compared to the number of persons of working age, we will have to ensure not only people are covered for the contributory pension but also that they contribute enough for this to happen in order that we can fill the gap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FA32012120500008#G00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1354708200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>That completes our consideration of the Supplementary Estimate.

This is an airport that is offering a different service and it is a lean and commercially successful operation.  In the economic times we are in, that is a hell of a lot to offer.<\/p><p>  In the past 18 months we have engaged with the Government to inform it of this new model of airport management.  We have approached it with eight proposals.  In 2010 we commissioned a study from Shannon Development which showed the airport could create an additional 500 jobs in the region.  We have also proposed that we can double our contribution to tourism and the region overall.  Recently, the Government announced an enormous package of incentives for Shannon Airport.  One of the unfortunate effects is that it might appear that Knock Airport is against Shannon Airport and the mid-west region.  This is not the case.  We have always been fully supportive of the development of Shannon Airport and regional development.  When I was chief executive officer of the Western Development Commission, I proposed to Shannon Development that we have an all-west strategic approach to development.  When I was managing director of Knock Airport, I sat on the board of the Shannon task force to bring more tourists into the region.  As recently as 2010, the airport met Dr. Vincent Cunnane of Shannon Development to work together.  From this, the Government decided to have a scoping study undertaken by Shannon Development.  The reason I am emphasising this is there is a history of co-operation between the airport and the region and Shannon Airport and the Shannon region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012120500004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Scollan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354700700,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Scollan and Mr. Gilmore for a fine presentation.

As I am aware others wish to ask questions, I will focus on one or two issues.  I ask for clarification on the request for fair treatment.  I have been attempting to establish what the airport is seeking.  It uses terms such as process in parallel, fair treatment and meaningful recognition as a strategic airport.  What should the Government do in the current circumstances?  We should bear in mind that the business report on the separation of Shannon Airport states that it is seeking to recover lost passenger numbers from Knock, which is a frightening prospect in that the business plan on which the Government has based its decision is not only about growing Shannon, but also about taking from the good work that has been done by Ireland West Airport over the past 20 years.  The witnesses skirted around this issue by speaking about co-operation between Shannon and Knock but it seems to me that the gloves have come off.  Shannon is being established as a separate entity with a clean sheet and it will start to aggressively market the airport.  What are the implications of this development?  They were referred to in the context of declining numbers but any objective observer would acknowledge that Knock has survived very successfully not only against competition, but also in the face of prevailing economic winds.  From a neutral position, why should it be any different if Ireland West's model is seen to be successful irrespective of the competition?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012120500006#E00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1354701300,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I have seen at first hand the development of Ireland West Airport.  Some of my family worked there in a voluntary capacity on the famous day in the 1985 when it opened.  We are not just speaking about an airport in County Mayo which is located less than 20 minutes away from where some of us live, but also a region stretching from Donegal to Galway, Westmeath, Longford and Cavan that has been successfully served by the airport.  Since I was first elected I have attempted to facilitate engagement between the airport and the Government.  Part of that engagement was arranging for the witnesses to appear before this committee but I did not realise the timing of our meeting would be so topical.<\/p><p>  The witnesses have stated that the announcement made on Monday will adversely affect Knock.  What needs to be put in place at this stage?  They have outlined measures that can provide the support they need to overcome the disadvantages they now face.  Can they give an indication of the level of subsidy provided to Shannon over the past two to three years and the extent of its losses over the same period?  What was the extent of the losses suffered by Knock over the past two to three years and what level of subsidy did it receive from the Government?  It is phenomenal that the airport's business grew by 11% in 2011 and 5% in 2012 given the current context for the aviation industry.

I do not wish to get into an argument about Shannon and Knock airports because both provide a great service to their respective areas.  I was interested to learn that for an airport to be sustainable it needed to handle approximately 1.5 million passengers.  Knock's passenger numbers are currently 700,000 and are moving towards the 1 million mark.  How will it reach the 1.5 million threshold?  Will it look to develop international routes, industry in the airport, cargo services or other ways of increasing business?  Is it at a disadvantage due to the nature of the links in the north west?  It is the only part of the country that has not been linked up with the motorway network, whereas Shannon has an advantage in terms of motorway access.  The failure to complete the motorway network in the north west is a disaster not only for the region, but also the entire country.<\/p><p>  I ask for clarification about how the community trust works.  The witnesses indicated that Ireland West Airport is community owned but they also say it is a private airport.  How does that system work?  If the airport is a community trust, it would appear to belong to the people.  <\/p><p>  Knock receives a small subsidy from the State.  I assume the Government intends to continue that subsidy.  The witnesses have not indicated that the subsidy is under threat.  We know what is planned for Shannon in terms of writing off its debts and allowing it to stand on its own.

Shannon has stagnated under the weight of the DAA because it has not been allowed the space to grow independently that Knock has enjoyed.  For one reason or another, Shannon was hamstrung in its development.  It is regrettable that the opportunity for Shannon to become independent is being criticised.  At the end of the day there is room for both airports because they have different models to promote.  What level of engagement does Knock anticipate now that Shannon will be set free of debt and allowed to aggressively pursue business?  It is in the interest of both airports to work strategically together to develop the west of Ireland.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport recently suggested that different forms of incentives may be made available for the development of airports.

Following intense growth over the past number of years, has Mr. Scollan a strategy to more than double passenger numbers to make the airport sustainable?  I presume the ability to increase passenger numbers depends on his ability to attract airlines to the airport and that is chiefly done through charges.

First, we are looking for strategic engagement between the Departments of Transport, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance and the Cabinet in the same way as for Shannon Airport.  Second, we had plans to create 500 jobs and we needed an infrastructure roll-out fund to do that.  That involved approximately &euro;23 million to be spread over several years.  We said to Government, \"Let us look at a creative way of attracting investment to lead to these kinds of jobs\".  Third, there was an infrastructure roll-out of the same amount in terms of the airport.  The airport has been invested in very little over the years.  Approximately &euro;23 million has been invested compared with ten times that amount in Shannon Airport.  We asked for a modest financial package.

However, after that, the Department has advised us that there will be limited, and possibly no, funding for regional airports.  Depending on the economy and so forth, we will potentially be in a treacherous position.  We are carrying &euro;10 million of debt on our balance sheet as a result of infrastructure projects undertaken with the Government over the past number of years.

This is effectively a development fee, which has been in place for the past 20 years.  We are the only airport on the island that has such a charge.  In this way we are self-funding the airport, and at 700,000, our passenger numbers continue to grow despite the penalisation, as one could argue, of people who use this airport compared to the State-funded airports.  However, they continue to vote with their feet; 700,000 passengers will use the airport this year.  That is a great endorsement of our business model.  On that basis we are confident we could grow and sustain the airport.

As Mr. Gilmore said previously, we do not know what those are.  This is not an anti-Shannon issue; it is just that we would welcome total transparency on the supports given to all airports so that people can see whether there is genuine value for money.  For instance, we know there has been approximately &euro;150 million in capital investment, although we do not know these things for sure.  We know, for instance, that there has been funding for immigration facilities at Shannon, which gives it a major competitive advantage over other airports.  At that time we would have welcomed an invitation to tender aimed at, let us say, Cork, Shannon, Knock and the different airports in the west that are capable of landing transatlantic traffic.  For instance, we know there are significant troop movements - 200,000 to 300,000 - through Shannon, which bring enormous levels of income.<\/p><p>  At the State airports air traffic control is free.

Why is there not a motorway starting in Sligo and going down into Galway to give us better access?  It took us approximately 22 years to get scheduled bus services into the airport.  We only succeeded two years ago in getting the route 66 Derry to Galway service to stop at the airport.  Up to then we had no scheduled bus services and we are trying to operate international airport access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012120500008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Gilmore"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354702500,"counter":265,"content":"<p>We do not wish this.

North of a line from Dublin to Galway there is nothing apart from the Dublin to Sligo line.  The one little star was Knock airport.  We have heard the history of passenger growth, 99% punctuality, and a subvention of 87 cent per passenger compared with 6 cent to 8 cent in the other airports.  The airport is funding 94% of its operating costs and employs 100 people, with another 900 in indirect employment.  It makes a significant contribution and serves a growing list of international destinations.  My question is to the Minister.  Why is he punishing a successful operation?<\/p><p>  I have two questions for the witnesses.

They should be benchmarked against an airport such as Knock for efficiencies and how to do business.  There needs to be a reality check.  Knock is of no greater or less importance to the west and mid-west region because it is a trust for the people rather than being owned by the State.  Everything must flow from that.

Obviously, it is an important hub for people to travel into and out of an area but it is also a catalyst for development throughout the region.  One of the problems is that we are looking at the subsidy purely as a cost rather than as an investment.  An subsidy for an airport such as Knock would be minimal and would be a very good investment because it is a catalyst for creating business in an entire region and keeping a region alive.<\/p><p>  I agree with the points raised about connectivity.

I have a few brief questions.  To return to the Booz report, why did the Department not carry out an evaluation of the impact of the proposals for Shannon on Knock, Cork and Kerry airports?  The proposals will not just affect Knock but will have a regional dimension.<\/p><p>  I am surprised by the Minister's comment that Shannon and Knock are competing for one pool of the population.  Shannon has a far bigger catchment than just the area north of it, while Knock has a far bigger catchment than just the area south of it.  The people in between have the benefit of both airports.  Does the delegation believe it is because there is a perception within the Department that Knock is a regional airport while Shannon is an international airport?  Is it the case that because Shannon is a State airport and Knock is a community airport there seems to be an attitude block in respect of the development of both airports in a partnership-type approach?  How would the delegation envisage Shannon and Knock working together?  The best objective would be to see a co-operative approach between both airports, with Shannon going for a particular type of business and Knock going for another type of business.  It does not make sense to have two airports on the west coast competing head to head for the one type of business coming into the expanded region.  A co-operative approach would be a far more effective tool to expand the throughput in both airports.  I am surprised by the plan that has been produced, which is focused on taking business away from Knock rather than bringing a counterbalance to the Dublin Airport Authority, which has such a disproportionate number of passengers compared to the two other airports.  <\/p><p>  Could the delegation elaborate on the regional enterprise hub?

The first question concerned the level of engagement with the Department and the Minister and whether Knock has a sustainable future in the context of the decisions about Shannon.  We have had 50 meetings in the past 18 months with political and Civil Service representatives, particularly those from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, so there has been a significant level of engagement.  We met with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on 5 July 2012, at which time we presented the full plans from Knock.  Prior to that, we presented our thoughts on the expansion of tourism to various Ministers, including the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport, Deputy Ring.  In the meeting with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, we pointed out the dangers of pursuing a one-track approach with Shannon and said that we supported the Shannon initiative but that it needed to be done in parallel or there would be potential legal and State aid implications.  When those meetings went no further, we then felt it was important for us to take the matter to the Taoiseach and we look forward to meeting him and whoever else the Government will bring to the table to discuss what has been happening and how we can resolve this without legal recourse.  Have we a sustainable future in the face of this?  Any company facing this would say it did not.  Knock will not say that.  We have fought through difficulties for 27 years.  We were built in a recession and we are in a recession now, but we will keep going.  It will take a lot to stop us and a lot to stop us expanding.  There is no point in being silly and thinking we can continue to do this in the face of this type of competition, but we are not going to give up.<\/p><p>  Deputy Mulherin asked what the Department's view of Knock airport was.  The Department has told us repeatedly that the Minister's clear view is that the Department is engaging with the State airports and it sees Knock as a private entity - the Department's words, not ours - and, therefore, there will be no funding for Knock after 2014 unless additional funds were made available from the Exchequer.  A question was asked about funding after 2014.  The default position is that no funding will be made available after 2014.  <\/p><p>  A question was asked about what our contribution to the region is and how many people we employ.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012120500009#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Scollan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354703700,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Does the Minister or Department acknowledge that Knock Airport will be disadvantaged and has either suggested any way in which the playing field could be levelled?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012120500010#J00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354703700,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Our interaction with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is very cordial, professional and regular with regard to tactical day to day and year to year operational issues.

We have had very successful audits with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and various aviation experts.  With regard to the Department, the technical operation of the airport could not have been better over the years.  Since May 2011 we have had successive strategic meetings.  On eight occasions I have met an assistant secretary general at the Department and had eight other substantive conversations on this issue.  This is at the core of the issue, because at one stage the Taoiseach felt it was important for high-level dialogue to take place involving the Department and we did this.<\/p><p>  At these meetings we made proposals and explained what we are explaining at today's meeting.  We exhausted this process on 5 July.  After the meeting with the Minister when he rejected the financial proposals referred to by Senator Mooney we asked whether we could do the same as Shannon Airport whereby the Government would hire international experts - such as Booz and Company which worked with Shannon Airport - to work with the airport to come up with a strategic international plan.  After all, we run an airport and we are not international investors.  The Minister stated he would convey this to the Secretary General of the Department.  We had further meetings after 5 July with the assistant secretary general for aviation in the Department and his team.  We found this other proposal was not forthcoming.  It had not been adopted or accepted.  We had two if not three meetings with the Department, and by September we realised we had exhausted every possible attempt to engage strategically with the Minister and the Department.<\/p><p>  At this stage we reluctantly took the decision to go public.  We only went public on this because we realised an announcement was going to be made and that the Government would go ahead with it.  We do not usually do our lobbying in the public arena; for the past ten years we have worked with the Government in a business-like fashion.  We have never made public statements against Government policy.  We have been forced into this and we are very regretful because we prefer to co-operate with the Government and the Department and we have had an excellent relationship with the Department over the years.  We would prefer if the Government set Knock and Shannon airports on a level playing field and then told us to co-operate.

The level of engagement between the Government and Shannon Airport with regard to route development is staggering.

I will also address a few of the other questions asked by members.  We estimate that we picked up approximately 25,000 additional passengers as a result of the termination of services at Galway Airport.<\/p><p>  Deputy Naughten asked why the Government had not carried out a competition assessment of the impact of proceeding with the separation of Shannon Airport.  We do not know.  One would need to ask the Minister directly.  We can only surmise that other pressures were being applied to progress the Shannon issue.  While we understand why it was done, we disagree with it.  The report commissioned by the Government advised against it, yet it is the result.<\/p><p>  We were asked whether the airports could co-exist.  The answer is \"Yes\", but we compete.  As commercial entities, we compete across all areas.  Our catchment areas overlap across one third of the region, particularly in County Galway.  We compete for non-commercial airline business.  The Chairman mentioned cargo, but other business includes the maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft.  The airport started a number projects in this regard recently and we are starting to grow a small number of jobs, but we are competing with Shannon.  All airports compete, and finding a way to work with Shannon in a \"co-opetition\", if I may call it that, would be difficult.  However, we are open to discussion.<\/p><p>  As the chairman of the airport pointed out, we engaged in a process three years ago.  A team of six Shannon Development executives were at our airport for approximately eight months and went through all of our numbers and financials.  The plan that was drafted was produced by one of the most professional development agencies in the State.  It is an expert in developing aviation parks at airports.  The plan outlines the blueprint for the 500 jobs and the incentives and structures required.  Unfortunately, that plan has not gained any traction to date.<\/p><p>  Deputy Calleary asked about the niches into which we will grow.  Obviously, one is tourism.  This year, we have embarked on an access from Europe project that has attracted approximately 16,000 visitors to the region.  Of those, one in every two is a first-time visitor to the west.  If these visitors spend between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000, we estimate an overall additional spend of &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million in the region.  First-time visitors come to the region because of direct, low cost access.  They stay within a one hour's trip of where they visit.  Without access, they would not reach the west.  They would fly to the east coast, do day bus trips to the Cliffs of Moher and spend no money on the west coast.<\/p><p>  We have examined the issue of cargo, but Shannon and Dublin are major hubs in that regard and cater well for the country.  Cargo also requires an intensive level of infrastructure to be built around the airport.  It is not an area on which we would focus, given the issue of the industrial base.  Tourism, leisure and aviation-related businesses are our focuses.  We have a great deal of space, some 300 acres of development land, that is ripe for investment and can create hundreds of jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012120500011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Gilmore"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354704300,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I will give a further answer.

I formally propose that the Minister appear before us at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012120500011#K00800","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1354704300,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Our work programme takes us up to Christmas, but we should consider the Senator's proposal afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012120500011#K00900","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1354704300,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I am not asking that a timeline be set, only that it be as soon as possible.
