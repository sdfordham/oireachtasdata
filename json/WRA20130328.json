It has transformed a continent that for so long was torn apart by war and division, shattering the lives of millions.  This has been achieved through an unprecedented process of political, economic and social cooperation among the countries of Europe over those decades. The history of the European Union is one of evolution and transformation as it has grown and deepened to meet the challenges of each era. <\/p><p>  The unprecedented economic crisis that has faced the Union and, more especially, the euro zone over recent years is the challenge for our generation. With 26 million unemployed across the European Union, the crisis has undoubtedly placed many of our citizens under great pressure. As the European Union continues to respond, it is imperative that we ensure that our citizens do not become alienated or isolated from the European project, and that its core values prevail. <\/p><p>  The need for popular understanding of and support for the European Union, is now more crucial than ever. While it is a challenge for us all, this is a particular responsibility for elected representatives at national and European level. <\/p><p>  The European Union, in advancing plans for a strengthened Economic and Monetary Union, has acknowledged the need for a social dimension and for enhanced democratic accountability and legitimacy. As we take further steps to respond to the economic crisis, it is vital that social aspects, and democratic accountability and legitimacy are central to our efforts.  They cannot be treated as an afterthought. Governments, national parliaments and the European Parliament have a key role to play in this regard. It will be important to get the balance right between the appropriate roles at national and European level. <\/p><p>  We are also exploring the social dimension of Economic and Monetary Union ahead of a report from President Van Rompuy in June. And Ireland is actively contributing to that important debate.<\/p><p>  Democratic accountability and legitimacy are also key priorities for the Irish Presidency. These issues have been the focus of comprehensive and constructive discussions at high-level events hosted by the Presidency in Dublin recently, including the Informal Meeting of Ministers and State Secretaries for EU Affairs, as well as the COSAC Chairpersons Conference. <\/p><p>  This year is also European Year of Citizens. Following its launch in Dublin last January, Citizen&rsquo;s dialogues have been organised across Ireland and throughout the wider Union. This is an ideal opportunity to celebrate the rights and benefits we enjoy, as citizens of the European Union, and to engage in a broader debate on the future direction of our Union. Whatever course that takes, it must maintain at its heart the interest of the citizens of Europe. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800053#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800053#WRA01250"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[15524\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800053#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide an outline of what he and An Taoiseach discussed with American President Barack Obama during their meeting at the White House on March 19.","asker":"981","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach and I discussed a number of issues with President Obama during our meeting on 19 March, including the economic situation in Ireland, the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, Northern Ireland, the prospects for immigration reform in the US and the situation in Syria.<\/p><p>  We briefed the President on developments in relation to the Irish economy and gave an update of recent developments in the Eurozone.

The issue is regularly discussed at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, most recently earlier this month when High Representative Ashton briefed on the latest round of negotiations which took place in Almaty last month.<\/p><p>  The concerns to which Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme have given rise are documented in a series of UN Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency resolutions dating back to 2006.  The IAEA has reported at length on Iran&rsquo;s continuing failure to provide clarity on, and facilitate unimpeded access to, its nuclear activities and facilities.<\/p><p>  The IAEA&rsquo;s most recent report makes clear that this continuing non-cooperation makes it impossible for the Agency to resolve concerns about aspects of the Iranian nuclear programme, including those which concern possible military dimensions to that programme.  There is no dispute with any country seeking nuclear energy for peaceful purposes within the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  However, this requires that each country seeking such energy cooperates fully with the IAEA.<\/p><p>  To date, Iran has failed to address satisfactorily a number of concerns raised by the international community.  Regrettably, therefore, it has been necessary to impose several rounds of restrictive measures.  The imposition of sanctions is not an end in itself and they are not aimed at the Iranian people.<\/p><p> The sole aim of these measures has been to convince Iran to return to the negotiating table and to engage with the E3+3 in order to address the serious questions regarding possible military dimensions of its nuclear programme. <\/p><p>  I have no doubt that the EU&rsquo;s measures, complemented by tough sanctions imposed by other countries, have led to Iran&rsquo;s belated acceptance of talks.  I welcome last month&rsquo;s discussions in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and the technical meeting last week in Istanbul, and I consider it positive that further talks are planned for Almaty on 5-6 April.  This effort can only succeed, and sanctions can only be reversed, if Iran is prepared to negotiate genuinely.  A credible package of confidence-building proposals was put forward last month by the E3+3.    I very much hope that Iran will engage seriously with these proposals and work rapidly to resolve the outstanding issues in relation to its nuclear programme and the serious concerns raised by the international community. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800053#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Commission on the Status of Women","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800053#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[15521\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800053#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has received a report from Ireland&rsquo;s participants in the 57 UN Commission on the Status of Women; and if he will provide details of what was discussed.","asker":"981","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is the principal global policy-making body on issues relating to gender equality and advancement of women. The 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women took place from 4 to 15 March 2013. The priority theme for the session was the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls. The outcome aimed for in this regard was a set of Agreed Conclusions, which are negotiated by all states and, in accordance with normal practice, adopted on the basis of consensus.    <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s official delegation to the CSW was led by Ms Kathleen Lynch T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality with responsibility for Disability, Equality, Mental Health and Older People.  It included officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In addition, representatives from civil society organisations were part of the delegation.<\/p><p>  The EU was represented in the negotiations on the Agreed Conclusions by the EU Delegation, supported by the Irish Presidency.  Following extensive negotiations, consensus on the Agreed Conclusions was reached on 15 March 2013.  Ireland, working closely with EU and other like-minded partners, contributed actively to what has been widely received as a positive outcome.   Previously identified national priorities are clearly reflected in the Agreed Conclusions, including a strong condemnation all forms of violence against women and girls; recognition of the linkages with gender inequality and discrimination;  a commitment to end impunity; and references to women, peace and security, women human rights defenders, and the need for coordinated, multisectoral services.  New elements incorporated into the Agreed Conclusions include the role of men and boys in addressing the issue, and the role which victims and survivors can play as agents for change.<\/p><p>  The Agreed Conclusions (currently in unedited format) are available on the website of the 57th Session of the CSW. <\/p><p>  In addition to the negotiations on the agreed conclusions, the Minister of State chaired a number of side events.   The first of these, entitled &ldquo;Mobilising communities to prevent and respond to violence against women &ndash; lessons learnt from Uganda&rdquo;, looked at Irish Aid&rsquo;s work in Uganda. The second, entitled &ldquo;Addressing Gender Based Violence in post conflict and fragile states &ndash; a case study of Sierra Leone&rdquo;, presented the results of research carried out by the Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence.  The Minister of State also participated in a European Union event, at which she outlined the National Strategy developed by Cosc, and a side event organised by the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.  <\/p><p>  Additionally, the Minister of State participated in a high-level consultation on &ldquo;Accelerating Zero-Tolerance to Gender Based Violence through the HIV response&rdquo; which was organised by UN Women and UNAIDS and co-sponsored by Ireland.  Her programme also included a series of bilateral contacts with a number of other Ministers and officials.<\/p><p>  Ireland also co-sponsored an event with Amnesty International and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which focussed on the risks faced by women human rights defenders and at which our Permanent Representative in New York was a panellist. We co-sponsored a further event organised by the Uganda based NGO, Raising Voices, which looked at implementing an evidence based approach in addressing violence against women and girls.  An event supported by Australia, South Africa and Ireland explored the potential of new media in supporting survivors of violence against women. The range of side events contributed to raising awareness around these issues among those attending CSW while also showcasing Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in efforts to eliminate violence against women and girls both domestically and internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800053#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Projects","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800054#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[15591\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800054#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount of money spent on cross border peace initiatives in 2010, 2011, 2012 and planned for 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding to cross border projects through its Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds.

I also met with the local representatives of Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland and ESB International for an update on new business development, including a number of case studies which we discussed in depth. I had the opportunity to launch a joint venture between an Irish company and their South African partner and to visit three other Irish companies which are expanding their business in the region.  My visit to South Africa culminated with the Greening of Table Mountain, organised by Tourism Ireland, which received considerable media coverage both locally and in the international media.<\/p><p>  I am confident that my trade visits to South Africa, including this most recent visit, are supporting ongoing efforts to further develop Ireland&rsquo;s economic engagement with South Africa and the wider southern Africa region.

There have been systematic abuses of human rights, extremely high levels of sexual violence and rape, and widespread recruitment and use of child soldiers.<\/p><p>  European Union Foreign Ministers regularly discuss developments in the DRC and are working actively to support peace efforts.  A regional Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement for the DRC and the Region was reached on 24 February in Addis Ababa, following discussions involving the parties in the DRC and neighbouring countries and international representatives.  I have welcomed this agreement, as have High Representative Catherine Ashton and Development Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, on behalf of the European Union.  It is now vital that the parties build on this framework agreement.  I welcome the decision of the UN Secretary General to appoint former President Mary Robinson as Special Envoy to the region, and can assure her of the full support of the Government, and of the European Union.  Her exceptional skills and experience, as well as her global profile, and reputation make her the ideal choice for this extremely challenging role.  She is expected to travel to the region in the coming weeks to meet the leaders who signed the agreement and to work closely with them to ensure that there is full and active implementation of its terms.<\/p><p>  Ireland has raised the human rights situation in the DRC at the Human Rights Council through national statements on a number of occasions, most recently at the 19th Session in March 2012. EU Council Conclusions on the Union&rsquo;s priorities at UN Human Rights Fora, adopted on 18 February 2013, state that the EU supports the Human Rights Council to address the state of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Following a resolution adopted at the 19th Session of the Human Rights Council in March 2012, on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Council is scheduled to consider the situation in DRC again at its 24th Session in September 2013.  Ireland will continue to monitor the human rights situation in the DRC closely and use our membership of the Council to raise our ongoing concerns in relations to human rights abuses and violations.<\/p><p>  Ireland is providing very significant ongoing support in response to the serious humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Last year, through Irish Aid, the Government provided over &euro;10 million in assistance to those worst affected in the crisis.  Earlier this month, we announced the provision of a further &euro;3.8 million in humanitarian funding.  Of this funding, &euro;2 million has been provided to the UN Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC. This provides quick and flexible funding to UN humanitarian agencies and to NGOs on the ground and aims to assist nearly four million vulnerable people in the DRC. The remaining &euro;1.8 million is being provided to Irish Aid partners, Christian Aid (&euro;450,000), Concern (&euro;450,000), Tr&oacute;caire (&euro;300,000) and Oxfam (&euro;580,000).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800054#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800054#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[15533\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800054#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the World Bank report on the Palestinian economy, which states that Israel's system of checkpoints and restrictions in the occupied West Bank has inflicted long-term damage on Palestinians' ability to compete in the global market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>While much attention has focussed on the difficulties produced at an individual level by the network of controls and movement restrictions which Israel imposes on Palestinians, these measures have cumulatively also had a disastrous effect on the Palestinian economy.  The economy of the West Bank effectively collapsed under the impact of these controls over ten years ago;  and the degree of growth seen in recent years represents only a very partial recovery of some of that lost ground.  The daily movement of Palestinian workers into Israel was severely reduced.  Exports of goods are subject to unpredictable and often lengthy delays, which are fatal for the fresh produce which constitutes most of the exports of the West Bank and which make it impossible to build up relations with importers elsewhere.  While some of these measures may originally have had a security rationale, their continued imposition now would appear to be primarily related to the security not of Israel but of the Israeli settlements planted in the West Bank.  The continuing restrictions on exports seem designed principally to prevent competition with Israeli producers.<\/p><p>  It is fair to note that there has been some improvement in recent years.  There has been a significant reduction in the number of Israeli checkpoints internal to the West Bank and a small increase in the number of permits to work in Israel, although the conditions imposed on these workers are very difficult.  These partial relaxations have been far too little, however, to allow normal economic activity to resume.<\/p><p>  The World Bank report is only the latest document to draw attention to these problems and their consequences in terms of a continuing high level of unemployment and dependence on outside aid. These are clearly ideal conditions in which militant groups can increase their support.<\/p><p>  Along with its EU partners and others, Ireland has pressed Israel to allow Palestinians free movement in their own territory and normal economic relations with Israel and the outside world. The Office of the Quartet Representative has engaged with Israel bilaterally on these lines for some years.  The results, I have to say, have been disappointing;  Israeli officials and leaders seem to agree in principle but proposals to relax controls and stimulate growth are not given practical effect.<\/p><p>  Ireland will continue to seek to focus international attention on this critical aspect of the conflict in the Middle East.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800054#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800055#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[15602\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800055#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he raised the issue of the proposed Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland as specified under the Good Friday Agreement with the Northern Secretary of State and Northern Executive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[15536\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800055#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if, in view of the fact that we are a year on from the joint statement from An Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, he will detail the outstanding issues yet to be implemented in the Good Friday and St. Andrews agreements; and the actions taken by the Government to ensure its full implementation.","asker":"1008","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 33 together.<\/p><p>  The Government remains firmly committed to ensuring the full and effective implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreements.  <\/p><p>  In contacts with the British government, we continue to stress the importance of implementation of all aspects of the Agreement, including of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland which takes account of the separate and specific context of Northern Ireland.  We continue to urge all the parties in the Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared future for the people of Northern Ireland can be based.<\/p><p>  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern Ireland, the Irish language and the languages of the various ethnic communities, as part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland.  In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and to working with the Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  <\/p><p>  It also called on the incoming Northern Ireland Executive to work to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language. The British legislation giving effect to the St. Andrews Agreement included a specific requirement on the Executive to adopt a strategy setting out     how it proposed to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.  <\/p><p>  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive. In that regard, my colleagues the Minister for Arts, Heritage &amp; the Gaeltacht, Mr Jimmy Deenihan T.D. and Minister of State Dinny McGinley T.D. have had ongoing discussions on the matter with their counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  On 11 July 2012, Minister N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n launched a consultation process which concluded on 27 November on strategies for the Irish language and Ulster Scots.  Inputs from the consultation process are now being considered.<\/p><p>  Last November I visited An Chult&uacute;rlann in Belfast which is a very impressive Irish language and cultural centre.  I had the opportunity to meet with some of the city&rsquo;s leading Irish language activists and to hear their concerns regarding the promotion of the Irish language including their views on an Irish language act for Northern Ireland.  Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland, most recently when they attended the official opening of Gael&aacute;ras Mhic Ardghail in Newry on Monday 18 February.<\/p><p>  The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement also provided for the establishment of a Consultative Civic Forum as a consultative mechanism in Northern Ireland on social, economic and cultural issues. The St Andrews Agreement provided that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North\/South Consultative Forum appointed by the two administrations and representative of civil society.  In September 2008 the Irish Government submitted proposals for the role, format, membership and operation of a North South Consultative Forum to the Executive for its consideration, and facilitated three consultative conferences, the most recent of which was in January 2011.  The review of the Civic Forum by the Northern Ireland Executive has not yet been completed.  At its meeting on 2 November 2012, the North-South Ministerial Council noted the current position on a North South Consultative Forum and agreed to review the issue at a future NSMC Plenary.<\/p><p>  I hope that we can take this opportunity of the 15th Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement to recall the vision of a shared society which inspired that Agreement and re-dedicate ourselves to the achievement of that goal.  While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, we should not lose sight of the progress that continues to be made, including, most recently though the establishment of the North South Inter Parliamentary Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800055#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Treaties","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800055#WRC00450"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[15582\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800055#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide an update on the additional steps that have been taken to reform the institutional architecture of the EU since the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[15926\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800055#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is satisfied that the European institutions are sufficiently coordinated in terms of policy objectives to be in a position to identify a crisis before it occurs and as a result deal with any such issues more effectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[15927\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800055#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to encourage his European colleagues to focus more effectively on the various issues affecting the EU inside and outside the Eurozone; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 73 and 74 together.<\/p><p>  An unprecedented economic crisis has faced the European Union, and more specifically the euro zone, over recent years. While our response has being sometimes criticised, great strides have, in fact, been made in dealing with these exceptional and complex circumstances.  EU institutional architecture per se has not fundamentally altered.  Indeed, Treaty change would be required to introduce many such changes, and I am not convinced that current circumstances would best be served by Treaty change in itself.  Instead, what has happened is that many new instruments and mechanisms have been developed to cope with emerging challenges.  At the beginning of the crisis, there were no effective support mechanisms to assist Member States in trouble. The Union has put in place the rescue mechanisms for Member States in difficulties, firstly on a temporary footing, the EFSF and the EFSM, and then a permanent support mechanism, the ESM.<\/p><p>  Similarly there have been significant improvements in the economic governance structures in place through agreement on a series of measures including the &ldquo;six-pack&rdquo;, the Euro Plus Pact and the Stability Treaty. The &ldquo;two-pack&rdquo; of economic governance measures, on which the Irish Presidency recently secured agreement with the European Parliament, will improve our ability to anticipate where problems arise. <\/p><p>  Alongside improvements in economic governance, it became evident that economic surveillance, the discussion of economic and fiscal policies, needed to take place in a more integrated manner. <\/p><p>  This led to the introduction of the European Semester process which is now in its third year. As Presidency, we are working with partners and the Commission to ensure that the process is as effective and meaningful as possible. The March European council saw the conclusion of the first phase of the Semester. We are making efforts to correct perceived imbalances in the management of the process and aiming to be as timely and inclusive as possible in the way we deliver on that process.<\/p><p>  Beyond economic governance and surveillance, it became clear that the Union needed to strengthen what underpins our Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This new strengthened EMU will be built on a more integrated financial framework or banking union. Last December, EU Finance Ministers agreed an ambitious timetable for delivering the various elements of banking union including; the Single Supervisory Mechanism; CRD IV; the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive; and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. Earlier this month, the Irish Presidency reached provisional agreement with the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism. This was a top priority for the Irish Presidency. The agreement, which we as Presidency have also brokered, on CRD IV will see the risk profile of the European banking system lessened over time. As Presidency, Ireland is working intensively to make further progress on the various strands of banking union. An operational and effective banking union will help to address one of the key brakes on Europe&rsquo;s recovery.<\/p><p>  Beyond the short and medium term steps already taken, there is an appreciation among EU leaders that further deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union may be necessary in order to underpin the euro as a stable and credible currency into the future. <\/p><p>  The European Council, in December last, asked President Van Rompuy to consider and consult further on four strands &ndash; coordination of major economic reforms; the social dimension of EMU; the feasibility of contracts for competiveness and growth between governments and EU institutions; and solidarity mechanisms. President Van Rompuy will present a &ldquo;time bound roadmap&rdquo; on these issues to the June European Council. <\/p><p>  As Presidency, Ireland fully supports President Van Rompuy in his further work and we are facilitating discussions in the relevant Council formations.

The meeting reached agreement on the announcement by Commissioner Piebalgs that up to &euro;250 million in European Union development assistance for Mali will be made available this year.<\/p><p>  The meeting in Brussels was addressed by the Foreign Minister and the Finance Minister of Mali, who provided updates on the latest situation in the country.  They made it clear that the immediate development priorities of the Malian authorities were the rebuilding of basic infrastructure in northern Mali following the destruction caused by retreating militant groups, the funding of basic social services and the financing of elections due to take place in July.<\/p><p>  In response, EU Ministers outlined bilateral approaches being undertaken in support of basic services, employment opportunities for young people and ongoing humanitarian needs.  There was agreement among Member States that EU support to rebuild basic social services in Mali was a priority, but that appropriate safeguards, in the form of technical assistance and audits, must be put in place given the inherent risks of working in such a fragile environment.  The Commission indicated that the provision of development aid would be based on four essential criteria: implementation of the political roadmap; macro-economic stability, public financial management and budget transparency.  During the discussion, I stressed that support for the Malian authorities should also be linked to progress on human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles.  The Malian Foreign Minister committed to establishing a Commission for Dialogue and Reconciliation and said that all the communities of northern Mali would be invited to participate, including the minority Tuareg community.<\/p><p>  The situation of internally displaced persons and refugees was also discussed and EU Ministers outlined bilateral support from Member States.  I noted that over &euro;9 million was provided by Ireland in 2012 for emergency food, water and healthcare to communities affected by the crisis across the Sahel region.  Some &euro;1.25 million of this funding was for life-saving assistance to vulnerable communities in Mali as well as Malian refugees who have fled the conflict to Burkina Faso.

The Neighbourhood has been identified as a priority area of work for the High Representative and the EEAS.  There are also important linkages between neighbourhood and enlargement policy, for which the Commission has overall responsibility.  While an expansion of the EEAS role in this area might be a logical development over the longer term, in the short to medium term the focus should be on ensuring coherence and effectiveness of EU policy, regardless of whether the EEAS or Commission is in the lead.

We welcome the progress that has been made in increasing cooperation between EU delegations and member State missions through the new joint programming initiative which is being rolled out on a trial basis in partner countries.

Conversely, the renewed electoral mandates now of both the Israeli Government and the US Administration provide an important opportunity to restore momentum to the process.<\/p><p>  While it is important not to overstate matters or to create false expectations, President Obama&rsquo;s visit to Israel last week represented an early move on the part of the United States to explore this opportunity.

These restrictions have been imposed in response to actions by militant groups in Gaza but their effect is impacting very negatively on the whole population.  One of them has been the confining of fishing boats from Gaza to a zone only three miles from the coast.  This has led to the complete depletion of fish stocks in that narrow zone and thus the effective loss of one of the few natural resources available to people in Gaza. <\/p><p>  I therefore welcomed the extension by Israel of this limit to six miles, following the renewed ceasefire in Gaza in November, and I hoped for further relaxations in this regard.<\/p><p>  It is very disappointing, therefore, that in recent days Israel, in response to missiles fired from Gaza at Israeli population centres last week, both closed the border to transfers of goods and restricted the fishing limit once again to three miles.  It is to be hoped that these are temporary responses to a specific event and that they will be ended quickly.  I deplore, however, this apparent return to a policy of penalising the population as a whole for the actions of militants, a policy which I consider both unjust and counterproductive.  The militant groups in Gaza who fire these missiles have already demonstrated that they do not care very much about the impact of their actions on the population around them.<\/p><p>  Equally, I firmly condemn the action of firing missiles at Israeli towns with the express intention of killing civilians and spreading terror.  It is difficult not to conclude that, by doing so during the visit of President Obama to Israel, and as he spoke to revive Israel&rsquo;s engagement in peace efforts,  those responsible quite intentionally hoped to provoke a response against the people of Gaza and a setback to peace efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800058#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Programmes","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800058#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[15534\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800058#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if enterprises based in Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are currently receiving financial support from EU programmes; and his views on whether Irish companies and persons should be discouraged from investing in enterprises in Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":139,"content":"<p>EU cooperation programmes with external partner countries, and entities located in them, are administered by the European Commission; my Department is not in a position to monitor enterprises in those countries or entities which might be in receipt of some degree of EU support.

It is not the first time that allegations of chemical weapons use have been made in the current Syrian conflict. Reports concerning the use of a known chemical weapon appeared in December 2012 but have not been confirmed or independently investigated. We do not, as of yet, have any information relating to the reports of an alleged attack on 19 March.  UN Secretary General Ban announced on 21 March that he had agreed to undertake the investigation requested by the Syrian authorities.  The investigation team will include personnel from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Health Organisation.

Notwithstanding Syria&rsquo;s non-adherence to the Convention, the reported use of these weapons in Syria will need to be addressed at the forthcoming Review Conference of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which will take place in The Hague from 8 to 19 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800059#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nuclear Proliferation","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800059#WRG00450"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[15511\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800059#WRG00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the need for Israel to open its nuclear programme for inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and join the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty without delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>Ireland has for some time called upon Israel to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) without further delay and to place all of its nuclear facilities under comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.

The joint EU-US High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth, set up following the last EU-US Summit in November 2011, was tasked with identifying policies and measures to further increase EU-US trade and investment including a possible trade and investment agreement to support mutually beneficial job creation, economic growth, and international competitiveness.  That High Level Group issued its Final Report to EU and US Leaders on 12 February 2013.  The Report concluded that a comprehensive agreement that addresses a broad range of bilateral trade and investment issues, including regulatory issues, and contributes to the development of global rules, would provide the most significant mutual benefit of the various options which had been considered.  The Report therefore recommended to Leaders that each side initiate as soon as possible the formal domestic procedures necessary to launch negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement.<\/p><p>  In a joint statement on 13 February 2013, EU and US Leaders welcomed the Report&rsquo;s recommendations and confirmed that each side would initiate the internal procedures necessary to launch negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. <\/p><p>  In this context, on 12 March the European Commission agreed a draft negotiating mandate which is to be presented to EU Member States for approval by the Council of Ministers in order to start negotiations as soon as possible, still during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council.

President Higgins had a very positive meeting with Brazil&rsquo;s President Dilma Rousseff during which they discussed the growing bilateral relationship, in particular as regards trade and education. The President also met with political and business leaders in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia.

Both objectives featured prominently in the meetings the Taoiseach and I held in Washington with the US Administration and Congress during the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.

These discussions focussed on how the EU can best promote a peaceful resolution to the crisis and alleviate the sufferings of so many Syrians caught up in this violent conflict since March 2011.<\/p><p>  At the Council meeting on 11 March, my EU colleagues and I had a valuable exchange with the UN\/League of Arab States Special Envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, who briefed us in detail on the current situation in Syria.  Special Envoy Brahimi was honest in his assessment and expressed the clear view that only a negotiated settlement can salvage what is left of Syria and offer the hope of an end to the conflict.<\/p><p>  At the informal &ldquo;Gymnich&rdquo; meeting last weekend in Dublin, EU partners reaffirmed their full support for the Special Envoy Brahimi in what he is doing.   We also made clear that the priority for the EU is to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to the crisis.<\/p><p>  Considerable attention has also been devoted to reviewing the current EU sanctions which apply against Syria.   We want to ensure through these measures that pressure remains on the Assad regime to stop its repression and to engage in a process of political dialogue with the opposition.  At the 18 February Foreign Affairs Council, we agreed to renew the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months, until 1 June.  At the request of the European Council on 14-15 March, we again discussed this subject at the informal meeting held in Dublin last weekend.   We agreed to continue our discussion at the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg on 22 April with a view to reaching a common position ahead of the 1 June renewal date.<\/p><p>  There is also a need to ensure full accountability in relation to the gross human rights violations and war crimes which have been committed by all sides to this conflict.  Ireland has been to the fore within the EU in supporting calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court.  In January we joined 57 other UN members in co-signing a letter sent by Switzerland to the President of the UN Security Council which called for referral to the ICC.   I also issued a joint statement on the same subject with my Austrian, Danish and Slovenian counterparts the same month.<\/p><p>  As a new member of the UN Human Rights Council, we have been active during the Council&rsquo;s most recent session in building support for a strong resolution on the current human rights situation in Syria.   This resolution, which calls for referral to the appropriate international criminal justice mechanism in the case of gross human rights violations, was overwhelmingly adopted by the Council on 22 March.<\/p><p>  The plight of millions of ordinary Syrians remains a growing concern for Ireland and its EU partners as the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, in and outside Syria.  Ireland and its EU partners are making a major contribution to the UN-led humanitarian relief operations.   The EU is collectively the largest donor to such efforts, having contributed some &euro;600 million in aid to date.  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance to Syria over the past year amounts to &euro;7.1 million.<\/p><p>  The conflict in Syria has been a major priority for Ireland and the EU over the last two years and will likely remain at the top of our foreign policy agenda during Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. We will continue to use whatever influence we have in our Presidency role and at all levels of our international engagement to support and promote European and UN efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800059#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Graduate Support Schemes","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800060#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[15886\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800060#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the initiatives he proposes to take to encourage more Irish graduates to apply for jobs in European Union Institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>Since Ireland joined the European Union, Ireland has been well represented in the EU institutions relative to its population, including at very senior level.

The EU&rsquo;s achievements in this regard were formally recognised when it was awarded the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize.  Over six decades, the EU has consolidated peace between former antagonists, exported stability to its neighbourhood and been the first regional organisation to make a tangible contribution to peace and security beyond its borders.  In this regard, the EU already plays a leadership role in the promotion of peace.  The European Commission currently focuses its activities on the root causes of conflict and the building of sustainable peace.  In addition to deploying instruments relating to economic development and social cohesion, the Commission concentrates on the rebuilding of critical state institutions plus transitional justice and reconciliation efforts.  The European External Action Service (EEAS) promotes peace at all levels, ranging from, for example, high-level mediation between Serbia and Kosovo (which is conducted by High Representative Ashton) to the work of a newly created EEAS team on conflict prevention, peacebuilding and mediation which provides training on early warning, conflict analysis and mediation and which is helping to build conflict prevention capacity in third countries.<\/p><p>  In combination, and in the spirit of the EU&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;Comprehensive Approach&rdquo; to crisis management, these various instruments and resources enable the European Union to make a decisive contribution to the promotion of peace.

The agreement calls on the authorities of the DRC to reform their security forces in order to re-establish the State&rsquo;s authority in the east of the country, as well as to carry out basic institutional reforms.  The countries of the region, for their part, pledge to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their neighbours.

Both historically, and in many cases up to and including the present day, African countries have been faced enormous difficulties, including food insecurity, poverty, protracted conflict, environmental degradation, weak government capacity, unequal global trading relationships, severe infrastructural weaknesses, poor governance, debt and the effects of HIV\/AIDS.  In an effort to help the countries of the continent confront these far-reaching challenges, we channel some 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance to Africa.  <\/p><p>  As the Deputy notes, some countries in Africa continue to face particularly acute challenges in terms of conflict and food insecurity.  Through Ireland&rsquo;s emergency humanitarian budget we respond quickly and effectively to needs arising from such emergencies as well as to the effects of natural disasters across the continent.  <\/p><p>  The international humanitarian system has undergone significant reform since the Asian tsunami of 2004.  Important lessons have been learned in the intervening period from the shortcomings in the international response and major steps have been taken to improve the effectiveness, predictability and accountability of the system as a whole.  Ireland has played an important role in this process in practical, financial and policy terms.  <\/p><p>  Together with a number of other like-minded donor countries, we have worked particularly closely with the UN&rsquo;s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to put in place new systems to improve the way in which aid is delivered and to ensure that coordination on the ground is improved.  <\/p><p>  Central to these efforts has been the establishment of the Cluster System, which brings together different aid agencies working in sectors such as shelter, nutrition, water and sanitation.  Another important development has been the establishment of the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which is a pool of funding held by the UN and which can be released within hours of a disaster.  Ireland, which was one of the original advocates for the creation of this fund, has contributed almost US$130 million to it since 2006.  We continue to support these and other innovative policy approaches at UN level.  <\/p><p>  At EU level, there have also been improvements in coordination between Member States and the European Commission, which together constitute the largest donor of development assistance in the world.  The European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, adopted in December 2007, commits the EU to working to provide an emergency response based on need and to upholding the principles of good humanitarian practice: humanity, neutrality, independence and impartiality.  Under our EU Presidency, Ireland is currently chairing the Council Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Assistance and continues to work to enhance coordination and ensure a timely and effective response to crises. <\/p><p>  At home, we have also made a number of significant changes in how we respond to humanitarian emergencies.  A portion of our emergency funding is now pre-positioned with partner agencies for immediate release in a crisis.  This reduces red tape and ensures aid can be disbursed in the critical hours and days following an emergency.  In addition, we have developed a network of humanitarian stockpiles around the globe and close to zones vulnerable to natural or other disasters.  This means that emergency supplies can be airlifted at short notice directly to where they are needed.  We have also established the Rapid Response Corps, a roster of skilled and experienced volunteers who make themselves available to deploy at short notice to work in humanitarian emergency situations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800061#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":199,"content":"<p>Question No. 80 answered with Question No. 71.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":200,"content":"<p>Question No. 81 answered with Question No. 67.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800061#WRJ00700"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[15935\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800061#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the international community continues to support a recognition for women rights in India with particular reference to the need to bring about a cessation of violence against women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":203,"content":"<p>The Government of Ireland is aware of attacks on women in India in recent months and is concerned about the situation.  <\/p><p>  I have been informed that India&rsquo;s Parliament recently passed into law the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance (2013) in response to recent attacks on women.

Special housing needs refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.

For example, individuals who are in the <i>first seven tax years of their qualifying loan<\/i> are entitled to a higher interest ceiling, on which the rate of relief is applied.

Revenue officers can raise assessments also on the amount of excise duty payable where they believe a person has an excise duty liability.<\/p><p>  In early 2011, in response to the escalation of the fuel laundering threat, Revenue strengthened the fuel-licensing regime for auto fuel traders, with effect from September 2011, to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market.  Following the enactment of new licensing provisions in the Finance Act 2012, this regime was strengthened further and a new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.  Under the provisions of the Finance Act 2012, Revenue also introduced new supply chain controls from January 2013.  These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  This information will provide assurance about the distribution of all fuels and identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and distribution patterns.<\/p><p>  In the period 2011 to 2012, Revenue closed 89 auto fuel retail outlets because they were unlicensed or operating in breach of licensing conditions.  In this period Revenue also seized over 2 million litres of fuel and detected and closed 20 oil laundries.  In view of the links between organised criminals and the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other law enforcement agencies.  A Cross-Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, involving all relevant agencies from the State and from Northern Ireland, facilitates co-operation among these agencies in dealing with the illegal fuel trade.  Arising from its work, a number of groups operating in both jurisdictions and involved in the production and distribution of laundered diesel, have been targeted for investigation.<\/p><p>  In addition, Revenue is working in close co-operation with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs on obtaining an improved and more effective fuel marker.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in May 2012 on a joint approach to seeking a new marker for rebated fuel and a joint 'Invitation to Make Submissions' (IMS) issued in June 2012 for this purpose.  The final date for submissions was 30 November 2012.  The IMS generated international interest and twelve submissions were received by the closing date.  These submissions are being evaluated at present.<\/p><p>  I am informed by Revenue that the effectiveness of the new rules will be closely monitored and evaluated.  If, as a result of this evaluation or due to other developments in this illicit trade, Revenue bring forward further proposals for additional powers then my record in this area shows that any such proposals will be given favourable consideration in the context of future Finance Bill provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800063#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800063#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[15922\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800063#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Kildare is required to make tax return for 2011 in view of the fact that they ceased trading in the 2009\/2010 tax year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they registered the person concerned for income tax in May 2010, following receipt of a notification from that person that they had commenced to trade on 26 April 2010.

Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms &ndash; or through a combination of these. Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one document.<\/p><p>  However my Department is mindful that greater clarity would be useful for schools and parents and accordingly my Department is currently in the process of preparing a comprehensive statement of existing policy within the boundaries of one document. Naturally the new policy statement will not be exclusive. Policies are subject, of necessity, to change from time to time. Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents.<\/p><p>  My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs. In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.<\/p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and\/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs\/strengths\/abilities emerge.<\/p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.<\/p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.<\/p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act. While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.<\/p><p>  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.<\/p><p>  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to develop policy and programmes for children with special educational needs, including those with autism, and will continue to take relevant professional advice into account in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800065#WRN01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":287,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[15863\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800065#WRN01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to recategorise Down Syndrome as a low incidence disability to enable children with Down Syndrome to be entitled to resources in mainstream education to ensure they reach their full potential; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[15959\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800065#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a child, who has Downs Syndrome does not qualify for an special needs assistant in school, and therefore does not qualify for the necessary supports to enable the child to fully participate in the school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 118 together.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of this Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with Down syndrome, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs. The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required, to ensure such placements are provided for.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise that pupils with Down syndrome who have care needs may receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupil's disability categorisation. However, many children with Down syndrome currently do have access to SNA support.<\/p><p>  In relation to the provision of additional teaching supports, pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.<\/p><p>  I have asked the National Council for Special Education to provide me with policy advice on the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability. This advice will be included in the NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs which is currently in preparation and which is expected in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800065#WRN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800065#WRN02200"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[15882\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800065#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding a proposed building project for a school (details supplied) in County Cavan; when this project is expected to move to the next stage; the likely timescale for the project to reach construction stage; if his attention has been drawn to the fact there is an urgent need to provide appropriate permanent accommodation in view of the sizeable increase in enrolment in this school over the past number of years; the substantial costs involved in renting accommodation on a different site and the extra demands on personnel with a second school site apart from the main school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>The major building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning.<\/p><p>  A Revised Stage 2(a) Submission is currently with my Department for review.

The abolition of State pension transition and the standardisation of the pension age at 66 from 2014 is part of a series of measures aimed at improving the sustainability of pensions in the future.  Growing numbers of people want to work or may need to work beyond the State pension age as people are living longer.  The abolition of State pension transition removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.  Recipients of State pension contributory can continue to work. <\/p><p>  There is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  In relation to the employment relationship, responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer\/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000\/78\/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down by employers within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, which must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.   Enterprise policy and equality issues come within the respective remit of my colleagues, the Minster for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Justice and Equality. <\/p><p>  An interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group was initiated to consider the cross departmental policy issues arising that may support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems.  The interdepartmental group, established in August 2012, is chaired by the Department of Social Protection, and includes representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement has also been undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children. <\/p><p>  The issues under consideration are the broad range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers; enterprise issues, employment and equality law issues; proposals regarding deferral of the state pension, and consideration of occupational pension issues.  It is expected that the Group will prepare preliminary proposals detailing measures which may encourage participation and retention in the labour market of older workers and present proposals to Government in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800067#WRP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":338,"content":"<p>Question No. 128 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Supplement Appeals","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800068#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[15837\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800068#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork was refused mortgage interest supplement and if she will expedite a decision on this appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":342,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 28th  February 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800068#WRQ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":343,"content":"<p>Question No. 130 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800068#WRQ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[15862\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800068#WRQ00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an invalidity pension appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 15th  January 2013.

I have also appointed four other Board members, who together with the Chairman, have the particular range of skills and experience to ensure that the public interest, and the interest of the affected homeowners, will be well served. <\/p><p>  Following receipt of the report of the independent Pyrite Panel at the end of June 2012, my Department and I engaged in extensive discussions with the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond resulting in their agreement to establish a not-for profit entity to operate a pyrite remediation scheme under the supervision of the Pyrite Resolution Board. I am hopeful that the entity will be established as quickly as possible and it will work closely with the Resolution Board in the delivery of an efficient and effective remediation scheme for homeowners. Appointment of Board members of the entity will be a matter for the three construction stakeholders who are setting up the entity and while staffing will also be a matter for the Board of the entity it will be the subject to discussion with the Pyrite Resolution Board.<\/p><p>  The Insurance sector did not engage constructively with my Department and did not express any willingness to be involved in a resolution process.<\/p><p>  My Department is engaging in preliminary discussions with a number of financial institutions facilitated by the Irish Banking Federation with a view to securing a loan facility which the not-for-profit entity would draw down to permit the earliest possible commencement of pyrite remediation works. The detailed negotiations with the prospective lenders on the terms and conditions of this facility will be concluded by the not-for-profit entity. The loan facility is intended to defray the costs of pyrite remediation work and ancillary costs only. <\/p><p>  From information supplied to the Pyrite Panel (March 2012), it appears that, in general, the pyrite problem is confined to five local authority areas, i.e. Dublin City, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly. Seventy four (74) estates with 12,250 ground floor dwellings were identified to the Panel during the course of its work as possibly having pyrite problems. Of these dwellings, the Panel understood that approximately 1,100 dwellings have already been remediated or were in the process of being remediated at that time and approximately 850 dwellings had a claim with a guarantee provider. Taking a pessimistic view, the Panel concluded that the remaining 10,300 ground floor dwellings represented the maximum estimated future potential exposure to pyrite problems. Having regard to the robust methodology used by the Pyrite Panel in arriving at the above figures and the rate of presentation in Ireland, I believe the figures represent a reasonably accurate picture of the extent of potential exposure to the pyrite problem. However, the Panel also noted that not all dwellings in estates where pyrite has been identified will manifest pyritic damage and the reasons for this are detailed in the pyrite report. <\/p><p>  In December, 2012 the Government approved the imposition of a levy on the quarrying and insurance sectors as a mechanism to fund a pyrite remediation scheme as recommended in the pyrite report. Primary legislation is required to underpin the imposition of the levy and my Department is currently advancing the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bill to provide for this. It is my intention that the Bill will be published and enacted in the shortest possible timeframe. <\/p><p>The purpose of the resolution process that my Department and I have been advancing over the latter part of 2012 is to provide cost effective remediation scheme for homeowners affected by pyrite who have no other avenues of redress. The establishment of liability is a matter for the Courts, and it is matter for homeowners themselves to decide if such a course of action is appropriate to their own particular circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800072#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Grant Payments","counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800072#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":433,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[15842\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800072#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will consider introducing a scheme to provide loans to low income families for the replacement of windows; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":434,"content":"<p>Local authorities have powers, under section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 to make available housing loans for, inter alia, the construction or acquisition of houses.

The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.<\/p><p><br \/>  To ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and, at the same time, that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006. <\/p><p><br \/>  This focused review will examine the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise, proximity and visual amenity and any other potential impacts, as considered appropriate, as well as ways of building community support for wind energy development.<\/p><p><br \/>  The press notice - issued on 30 January 2013   &#8211; marks only the initial stage in that review process. It is essentially a pre-draft consultation intended to inform the preparation of revised draft guidelines. This early consultation allows for the public and other stakeholders to input into the process at an early stage. Other stakeholders that will be consulted include the Environmental Protection Agency and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  All statutory planning guidelines issue first in draft form for public consultation over a period of a couple of months. Once the consultation period is closed the submissions received on the draft guidelines are considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines. The draft guidelines will &#8211; like all other new or revised guidelines &#8211; go out for extensive public consultation for a period of 6 weeks to 2 months. The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is Quarter 4 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  Planning legislation provides for extensive public notification of proposed development at the development management stage, including proposed development for wind energy purposes. For example, article 17 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 &#8211; 2010 requires an applicant to erect a site notice in order to lodge a valid application for planning permission. Article 19 of the Regulations requires that this notice must be placed in a conspicuous position on or near the main entrance from a public road to the land or structure concerned, so as to be easily visible and legible by persons using the public road. Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure. The site notice must contain the date on which the site notice is erected and state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the 5 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application. The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than<b><\/b>2 weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application. Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements, it may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.<\/p><p><br \/>  Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose. Each planning authority must decide which newspapers should be included on its approved list of newspapers to ensure that the newspapers used for the purpose of such notices have a sufficiently large circulation in its functional area.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition the planning authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations. <\/p><p><br \/>  Any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The Board in some instances, at its own discretion, holds oral hearings in relation to cases being considered by it, further adding to the opportunities to participate in the decision-making

This is in line with the relevant recommendation in the report of the independent Pyrite Panel.  The methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage will be prescribed in regulations which are currently in preparation and will be finalised shortly.<\/p><p><br \/>  The primary route for homeowners to demonstrate significant pyritic damage will be in accordance with the recently published standard by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, <i>IS 398 &#8211; Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &#8211; Part 1<\/i>  . This standard provides guidance on the visual condition assessment, sampling regime and testing to be carried out to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage. The standard must be used for all assessments and testing undertaken on or after 29 January 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  Where testing has been carried out prior to the publication of the above standard, it is possible that it may meet the requirements of the standard; however, there may be a requirement for some additional testing or interpretation of the test results by a geologist. In addition to assessing the test results, a visual condition assessment will also be required to be carried out by an engineer or other competent professional to confirm significant pyritic damage.<\/p><p><br \/>  To claim an exemption a homeowner must obtain a certificate, from a competent person, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage on the liability date. The certificate will confirm that a visual assessment and relevant testing of hardcore material has been undertaken. Where a certificate confirming significant pyritic damage has issued in respect of a property on or before a liability date, that property will be deemed to be exempt from the LPT for a period of three consecutive liability periods.<\/p><p><br \/>  Special arrangements will apply in respect of 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners getting relevant certification to claim an exemption. While homeowners who do not have the relevant certification on the first liability date of 1 May in respect of 2013, or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014), will have to pay LPT for those periods, they will be able to reclaim the tax paid if they have a relevant certificate by 31 December 2013 and notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing on or before 31 January 2014. Additionally, homeowners will have the option to choose whether to designate 2013 or 2014 as the first of three consecutive liability periods for exemption if they get a relevant certificate before 31 December 2013 and make an election to the Revenue Commissioners specifying one of those dates on or before 31 January 2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  While I am conscious that the certification process necessary to confirm significant pyritic damage may appear onerous for the homeowner, it is, however, necessary having regard to the multifaceted nature of the pyrite problem. In this context, it should be noted that the Pyrite Panel alluded to the unpredictability of pyrite within an estate with even adjacent dwellings reacting differently, one showing damage and the other displaying no damage. This may arise due to different builders operating in an estate and\/or as a result of multiple sources for the sub-floor hardcore material used. The Panel noted that not all dwellings in an estate where pyrite problems have been identified will manifest pyritic damage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800073#WRV01100","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Applications","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800073#WRV01150"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[15960\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800073#WRV01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if in the context of the purchase of affordable housing, it is his intention to reform the claw back provision, which was put in place, in order to prevent persons selling the house within a specified period of time as otherwise the difference in value would have to be repaid back to the council; and if in view of the significant decline in house prices, that this clause could now be discontinued in total","asker":"1063","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":458,"content":"<p>The claw-back provision is intended to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes.

Most support to the seafood sector is co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund and is covered by the Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013.  Financial supports for the construction, installation and modernisation of aquaculture enterprises are provided by BIM and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta through the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme.  This Scheme was originally part of the Irish Seafood National Programme, but was moved into the co-funded Seafood Development Programme in 2012, as part of a revision of that Programme following its 2011 interim evaluation.  As part of the original development of both programmes, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) was conducted.  During the course of the public consultation on that SEA, the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland) raised concerns about the possibility of sea-lice emanating from salmon farms negatively affecting migrating wild salmon.  The Minister for Communication, Energy and Natural Resources supported these concerns.  Rather than delay the finalisation of the programmes, it was agreed to exclude salmon farms from financial support under the Irish Seafood National Programme until such time as the sea-lice issue has been satisfactorily resolved.  This temporary restriction on development grants was included in the text of the Irish Seafood National Programme (page 99).  While my Department has kept this matter under review with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the matter has not been resolved and the position remains that salmon farming is excluded from the financial support programmes for commercial aquaculture.<\/p><p>  With the transfer of the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme into the co-funded Seafood Development Programme in 2012, the text of that Programme was amended to provide for the continuation of the temporary restriction on financial support to the salmon farming sector.  The temporary restriction was also included in the eligibility criteria approved earlier this month for the next call for applications under the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme.  My Department's policy on sea lice controls is strictly evidence based.  The control protocols are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State and are more advanced that those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons: the inspection regime is totally independent of the industry; data obtained as a result of inspections is published; treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.<\/p><p>  In 2008, the State introduced a new Pest Management Strategy, supplementing the control regime already in place.  This has resulted in a steady decline in average sea lice numbers on farmed salmon since its inception.  The protocols have been the subject of detailed investigation and testing by the EU Commission in response to a complaint from a member of the public in respect of the effects of sea lice on wild salmon.  On 11 October 2012, the Commission closed its investigation of this complaint in the State's favour following its examination of all relevant matters.  The Commission has also indicated that it regards the sea lice protocols operated in Ireland as representing best practice internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800079#WRBB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries","counter":583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800080#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":584,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[15895\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800080#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the statement by the Inland Fisheries Board of 29 November 2012, that development and operation, of fin fish farms, could impact on wild salmon and sea trout stocks and their habitat, has been taken into account in formulating his policy on salmon farms and aquaculture; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":585,"content":"<p>Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) has submitted an application to my Department for an Aquaculture and a Foreshore Licence for the cultivation of Finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay.

Dublin.  These are Trinity House School, Oberstown Boys School and Oberstown Girls School.  Under current arrangements, the children detention schools are authorised for detaining males under 17 years and females under 18 years of age<\/p><p>  In relation to staffing levels in the children detention schools, one of my priorities as Minister with responsibility for this area is the full implementation of the requirements of the Public Service Agreement on the Oberstown campus.  A significant step forward was achieved in this regard on 25 February 2013, with the implementation of a campus &ndash; wide staffing roster agreement to apply in all three children detention schools.  A key feature of this roster is the facility to deploy staff on a cross campus basis in any of the three children detention schools, on the basis of identified need.  I understand that this aspect of the roster has been implemented and I welcome the cooperation of staff to date.  One of the aims of this system is to ensure that adequate staffing levels are maintained, in that staff which may be surplus to requirements on a short term basis in any of the three children detention schools on the campus can be redeployed to one of the other sites where the requirement for staff may be more pressing.  Such flexibility of operation is a key requirement of the Public Service Agreement.<\/p><p>  I understand that notwithstanding the progress that has been made, there are some implementation difficulties which have been experienced recently on the campus with the new roster, including the need to address issues relating to rates of absenteeism and attendance management.  These issues are being managed by the Board of Management of the Oberstown campus, working with the Directors of each children detention school and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  However, I note that this is the first time that all three children detention schools have been placed on an identical rostering system and some difficulties are perhaps to be expected.  I have been advised by the Chairman of the Board of Management and the Irish Youth Justice Service that these issues are being addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>  The Oberstown Board and the Irish Youth Justice Service, with independent assistance in line with best practice, have recently arranged for an examination of a number of claims relating to safeguarding and general work practices in Trinity House School.  This approach has been notified to HIQA and I expect that the Board will shortly be in a position to adopt a position on the matters raised, based on the need for fair procedures to be adhered to in all respects.<\/p><p>  I am also advised that there are a number of individual employee grievance cases on the Oberstown campus which are currently before the Board and the Irish Youth Justice Service, and that these cases are being urgently assessed with a view to having a complete resolution of them at the earliest possible date.<\/p><p>  The Directors on the Oberstown campus are responsible for the immediate control and supervision of each children detention school under the Children Act, 2001.  This role includes responsibility for compliance with all relevant health and safety requirements, subject to any general guidance that may be required in this area by the Board of Management.  I  am not aware of any specific issue which would raise concerns in this area and would expect the children detention schools to operate in a manner compliant with health and safety law and practice.  I note that the children detention schools are subject to inspection at any time by the Health and Safety Authority<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800080#WRCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800080#WRCC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[15775\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800080#WRCC01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the Children First legislation will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect.

The necessary actions are being implemented as part of the Government&rsquo;s reform programme for children&rsquo;s services, the most radical reform of child welfare and protection services ever undertaken in the State. The integrated delivery of these reforms will ensure that responses to many of the ICDRG recommendations will be mainstreamed into the work programme of the new Child and Family Support Agency.<\/p><p>Detailed work is underway to implement the ICDRG recommendations as follows: <\/p><p>- Legislative Reform &ndash; in order to support the rights of children generally, and particularly those who require the intervention of child welfare and protection services, the Constitutional referendum on children was held in November 2012. Issues related to the in camera rule and child care court proceedings have also been subject to legislation.  The Child Care Act 1991 (Section 29(7) Regulations were made in November 2012 facilitating the public reporting of child care court proceedings by researchers. These regulations have facilitated an independent project under Dr Carol Coulter which is carrying out research, for publication, on child care hearings in the courts.  The Government has recently published the Court Bill 2013 to directly address issues related to the in camera rule.  The draft Heads of the Children First Bill were considered by the Oireachtas Committee on Health &amp; Children and the report of the Committee is being considered by my Department in the development of these legislative proposals.  Consideration is also being given to strengthening legislation regarding the provision of aftercare. I recently met with experts and representatives of organisations working with young people in care to discuss the approach. <\/p><p>- Organisational Reform &ndash; preparations are advanced for the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency.  The Agency will be an essential vehicle for ensuring the ethos of quality and accountability called for by the ICDRG is strongly reflected in children&rsquo;s services.  The Heads of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill have been approved by Government and drafting of this legislation is advanced.  Significant operational and industrial relations preparations have taken place including notification of almost 4,000 individuals of their planned transfer to new Agency.<\/p><p>- Operational Reform - A central feature of the new Agency will be a new Service Delivery Framework which will prioritise serious child protection referrals while providing for development of new &lsquo;Local Area Pathways&rsquo; which will involve a greater use of community-based services to address child and family welfare concerns in a timely &amp; effective manner.  Significant work has taken place in relation to this service redesign.  A group has been established in the HSE to work with the Irish Youth Justice Service on the needs of the most vulnerable youths, in line with the needs highlighted in the Child Deaths Report.   Work is progressing on development of a National Child Care Information System to comprehensively address issues of record keeping and data management.  The procurement process is now at contract stage.  The ICDRG highlighted concerns in relation to social worker assignment and care planning. As of Quarter 4 2012, data indicates that 92% of the total children in care population had an allocated social worker.  There has been a significant improvement in recent years noting that as recently as 2009, for example, some 17% of children in care did not have a social worker.  In the case of children in special care and high support facilities, 100% had allocated social workers.   87.6% of the total children in care population had a written care plan as defined by the Child Care Regulations, 1995.  In the case of children in special care and high support facilities, 100% had written care plans.  Two out-of-hours pilot projects in Donegal and Cork were commenced and independently evaluated. The HSE has reviewed the Evaluation Report and prepared a business case for a National Out of Hours Social Work Service. The HSE is in discussion with relevant staff representative associations.<\/p><p>- Workforce Development - this Government completed the recruitment of 260 additional social workers proposed in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan. Over 1,400 social workers are employed in Children and Family Support Services and the introduction of 260 additional social workers represents a significant strengthening of the workforce.   Arrangements for the induction, training and supervision of these staff have been put in place.  Support for all staff includes the introduction of national guidance, such as Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook, and supervision of the implementation of this guidance.<\/p><p>- Oversight - Last July, I launched the first-ever HIQA &lsquo;National Standards on Protection and Welfare of Children&rsquo;. HIQA recently announced the commencement of inspections of child protection services, in line with new standards. Meanwhile 10 cases identified in the ICDRG report have been referred for independent review under Dr. Helen Buckley.  One of these reviews has already been completed.  Specific work is proceeding in relation to the Review Group&rsquo;s recommendations regarding mechanisms for the independent review of child deaths.  It is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements are developed in a manner that is fully consistent with the major organisational reforms currently in train including the transfer of child protection services from the HSE to the CFSA and the recent expansion of HIQA&rsquo;s inspection regime to cover all child protection services.  My Department has also consulted with colleagues in the North in order to share learning from the respective approaches to child death review.<\/p><p>  I trust these details illustrate the seriousness with which the ICDRG report is being advanced.  Finally, my Department has also used the detailed research undertaken in the report to highlight more general policy issues across Government, including for example discussions on the preparation of a National Substance Misuse Strategy, which is expected to be considered by Government shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800081#WRDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800081#WRDD00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800081#WRDD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[15826\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800081#WRDD00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Kerry, who wishes to continue in employment will be permitted to work beyond their sixty-fifth birthday; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":614,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800081#WRDD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services","counter":615,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800081#WRDD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":616,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[15850\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800081#WRDD00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding funding for a project (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":617,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is referring to respite services for children with life-limiting conditions.  My Department administers a National Lottery Discretionary Fund from which small once-off grants are paid to community and voluntary organisations, providing a range of health related services. If an organisation wishes to make an application for National Lottery Funding they should send in a formal application. Detailed procedures, along with the application form are set out on the Department's website - www.doh.ie.  The HSE receives an annual capital allocation for the building, equipping and furnishing of health facilities.   There are always more construction projects than can be funded from the Exchequer's capital health care allocation. The HSE is required to prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs of completion over the period.  The method and timescale for the delivery of health care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors; it is a dynamic process constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in 2010 the Department of Health published Palliative Care for Children with Life-limiting Conditions in Ireland &ndash; a National Policy (DoH 2010) which provides the foundation and sets out clear direction for the development of an integrated palliative care service for children and their families, across all care settings.Following on from the publication of the policy, the National Development Committee for Children&rsquo;s Palliative Care (NDC) was established by the HSE. The NDC is co-chaired by the HSE and the Irish Hospice Foundation. It includes a representative from my Department. The Committee has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the national policy recommendations. The committee&rsquo;s emphasis on partnership is reflected in its membership comprising statutory, voluntary, professional, and parent involvement.<\/p><p>  On 4 March 2013, the Irish Hospice Foundation and LauraLynn, Ireland&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospice, in partnership with the HSE published a report titled &quot;Respite Services for Children with Life-limiting Conditions and their Families in Ireland &ndash; A Needs Assessment&quot;.  The report provides a national overview of service provision and future respite requirements as part of a palliative care service for children in Ireland. The report identifies some of the challenges involved in planning for respite care such as difficulties with definitions and terminology; determining the numbers of children who require respite care and the numbers currently availing of services; the extent and location of current service provision; the perhaps at times unnecessary distinction between disability services and palliative care.<\/p><p>  The report provides an indication of what is currently available and what is required at a national level to provide for the respite needs of children and families. The report acknowledges that a significant level of respite support is already being provided but access is inconsistent around the country and can be dependent on diagnosis and\/or geographic location. <\/p><p>  The report will assist the Department of Health and the National Development Committee for Children&rsquo;s Palliative Care in planning for the respite needs of children with life-limiting conditions, and is a useful contribution to filling in the gaps in the understanding and knowledge of the way respite services for children are organised.

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  Since its establishment there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services and a challenging socio-economic climate.<\/p><p>  Hospitals across the country have experienced a surge in presentations to ED, as would be expected in the winter months, resulting in high demand for admissions and a consequent rise in trolley waits. Recent outbreaks of influenza have created additional logistical difficulties in relation to the admission, movement and discharge of patients in some hospitals. Those hospitals have released media messages advising non-attendance and restrictions on visiting.  The SDU continues to monitor ED activity closely, engaging with key hospitals via teleconference and on-site meetings, collaborating in putting in place a range of measures to assist with patient flow and reviewing the available data for trends in relation to the reported levels of high activity.<\/p><p>  Despite these pressures the year on year improvements continue nationally. Numbers recorded on trolleys at the end of 2012 showed a marked improvement of 23.6% less than 2011 which equates to 20,386 less people. From 1st January to 15th March, there has been a total of 15,220 patients on trolleys: this is a reduction of 2,258 patients or 12.9% on the equivalent period last year. Priority now is to reduce long waiters (over 9 hours) as we move to a six hour patient journey target.

Additionally, &euro;31,032.50 of Free Travel Pass (FTP) funding has been allocated to WCRT from January to June 2013, with a further proposed allocation of &euro;31,032 from July to December 2013.  This represents a total 2013 allocation of combined RTP and FTP funding of &euro;322,262.50 for the provision of RTP services in West Cork. <\/p><p>  My aim\u00a0is\u00a0to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making \u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system.  This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1st April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. \u00a0<\/p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community. \u00a0However, given\u00a0resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.\u00a0<\/p><p>\u00a0 The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline. \u00a0 <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established. \u00a0I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding\u00a0West Cork\u00a0or any other part of the country,\u00a0but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure\u00a0later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs. \u00a0 <\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.  \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800084#WRGG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Maintenance","counter":687,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800084#WRGG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[15876\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032800084#WRGG00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount of direct Government funding provided to each local authority for road maintenance for each of the past five years; the amount of funding used for road maintenance by each local authority from their own resources for each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"973","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":689,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.
