One challenge is that the London-based agency will not grant rights to perform in community centres and parish halls.  They will also only grant a specific number of performance rights and if groups are lucky enough to qualify for all-Ireland drama competitions, there can be delay in getting additional performing rights.  We must also remember that local drama festivals are extremely important to local towns and villages.  In my own county, festivals such as those at Kiltyclogher and Carrigallen are very important to local businesses and economies.  We also have drama groups in Tubbercurry in Sligo.

The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all their forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.  Art and drama, in all their forms, are very much part of the fabric of Ireland and our international reputation.  Ireland has a proud tradition of amateur drama.  Many of our performers, playwrights and directors started out in amateur drama and progressed to the likes of our national theatre, the Abbey, and other stages worldwide.<\/p> <p>Primary responsibility for the promotion and support of the arts is devolved to the Arts Council, which provides significant support for drama in Ireland.  The council, although funded by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and specifically in its funding decisions.  The Drama League of Ireland, in turn, aims to support, nurture and enhance the aspirations and activities of practitioners in the amateur theatre sector through education, training, advocacy and advisory services.<\/p> <p>The issue of performing rights and their ownership is not a matter for the Department; nor, I understand, does the Arts Council have any particular role in the matter.  This is essentially a commercial issue for agents representing writers.<\/p> <p>In respect of participation in arts and cultural activities generally, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is currently developing our first national culture policy, which will be welcomed by all those involved in culture and drama.  This provides an important opportunity for everyone to have their say on what we want to achieve in terms of our arts and culture over the next decade.  The development of Culture 2025 will provide a chance for us to reflect on the important role culture plays in our lives.  It will also create a platform to bring together cultural bodies and groups at local, regional and national level.  Perhaps that will provide an avenue for the concerns mentioned by Senator Comiskey to be raised.<\/p> <p>Of particular relevance is the 12% increase in the budget of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for 2016.  This will provide additional funding across a range of areas, including a new investment programme for regional arts and cultural centres and a boost in funding for the national cultural institutions and the Arts Council.  This investment will be of particular relevance to amateur dramatic groups.  This Government is working to assist arts and culture at all levels; however, it does not appear that either the Department or its statutory agencies have a role to play in how agents negotiate on behalf of writers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#B00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

I will ask that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na details requested by the Senator be provided to him.  I will revert to him on that point.  I thank him for raising this important matter.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs being smuggled into or out of Ireland.  I am advised by Revenue that, as part of its risk-focused approach to the discharge of its role in this regard, harbours and inlets along the coastline - including along the south-west coast - are monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis from the point of view of the potential for smuggling.  Revenue is conscious of the dangers and threats from smuggling of all types, including drugs, using seagoing vessels.  Revenue's enforcement infrastructure in combating the threat of smuggling includes two customs cutters, which are deployed to patrol the coastline and undertake maritime intelligence gathering duties.  They provide Revenue's Customs and Excise with ready access to vessels, whether commercial or leisure, operating in the waters off the Irish coast.  The decision on whether to board and search a vessel is based on risk analysis and profiling, which is informed, <i>inter alia<\/i>, by an evaluation of national and international smuggling trends and threat assessment, journey frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  I am further advised by Revenue that patrols of the coastline by the cutters are kept under constant review to take account of available intelligence and emerging smuggling trends.<\/p><p>Apart from the time spent at sea, the crew of both cutters work closely with their land-based colleagues and coastal communities in developing intelligence and following up on information regarding risks and smuggling threats that are brought to their attention.  It is worth mentioning that the crews of these vessels are also trained and certified to carry out deep rummage - detailed searching - of vessels.  This is a core skill and competence for the detection of deep concealments and the thorough post-seizure searching of vessels.  Outside of the focus on vessels to which I have alluded, I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that the crew members and passengers, where relevant, of such vessels who enter the State are subject to the same checks as any other arrival, including individual profiling, and are liable to be checked by Revenue customs staff on a risk-focused basis.<\/p><p>Revenue officers liaise with local garda&iacute;, harbour masters and the Coast Guard regarding drugs and also with trade interests in respect of fiscal products.  This work is supplemented by Revenue's customs drug watch programme, which incorporates a coastal reporting mechanism and allows members of the public and maritime and local communities to report, in confidence, suspect or unusual movements at sea or around the coast through a confidential 24-7 freefone facility.  Such sightings, examples of which include vessels anchored or making landings in remote areas, shipping being observed away from designated shipping lanes and vessels signalling ashore or operating without lights, when reported to Revenue are fully evaluated and appropriately actioned by Revenue.  Revenue promotes the drugs watch programme - I am happy to have an opportunity to do so now - and encourages the public to contact it on 1800 295 295 in the strictest confidence.  I encourage people, including the Senators present, if they have information as regards specific incidents of drugs smuggling into the country, to bring it to the attention of Revenue.  Such information will be dealt with in the strictest confidence.<\/p><p>Revenue is a fully integrated tax and customs administration and I am advised that it is not possible to disaggregate the resources deployed exclusively at any given time to the detection of illegal drugs.  Revenue has approximately 2,000 staff countrywide engaged in activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  These activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.<\/p><p>Let me say something about collaboration and co-operation with other State agencies and about the international arena.  Revenue's customs service collaborates at national level with the Garda and the Naval Service as part of the joint task force on drugs interdiction and at international level with its partners in significant and ongoing operations.  Internationally, Revenue continues to co-operate with administrations, agencies and services where areas of common interest exist, particularly in the area of countering drug trafficking.  Revenue officials attend and participate in many international fora, such as the Customs Co-operation Working Party, CCWP, and the Pompidou Group.  Under the auspices of Europol, Revenue supports, participates in and implements the European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats, EMPACT, plan.  In addition, Revenue maintains an effective working relationship with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs across the broad range of revenue and customs functions, with the UK Border Force and with the UK National Crime Agency.<\/p><p>The national drugs strategy is the Government-directed strategy to deal effectively with the problem of drugs in Ireland.  The overall strategic objective of the national drugs strategy 2009-2016 is to continue tackling the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  I commend Revenue on its success in supply disruption and seizures.  This demonstrates the professionalism and capability of Revenue in delivering on our drugs prevention policy.  Revenue will continue to attach a high priority to its role and activities in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#C00700","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

Saying that 2,000 personnel in Revenue are involved is something I could have checked on Google.  How many of those personnel are dedicated to this?  Identifying the people in communities who are involved in drug smuggling is long-term, slow and strategic work.  Drug smugglers do not just arrive on a boat one day and unload.  A bit like how Revenue combats smuggling, they do so by intelligence-led surveillance.  They spot vulnerabilities, identify the most suitable locations for smuggling and pick the time and date.  We need specific resources dedicated to combating smuggling.  There are 2,000 people in Revenue, but most of them are collecting our taxes.

I acknowledge his continued interest in this issue and likewise that of my colleague, Senator Michael Comiskey, who has also raised the matter.  I know they have an interest in everything that is going to happen to the cottage and everything around it in the run-up to our commemorative period for 1916.  The matter has been raised with me by many members of Leitrim County Council at executive level as well as by elected members of the local authority.<\/p> <p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in Leitrim, such as the L6196, is the statutory responsibility of Leitrim County Council, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from the council's resources and are supplemented by funding made available by the State.  The selection and prioritisation of these works is, therefore, a matter for the council.<\/p> <p>Ireland has a little less than 100,000 km of road in the network.  The maintenance of the national, regional and local road networks is a substantial financial requirement for local authorities and the Exchequer.  I will set out some context in respect of the challenges involved in meeting that need.  In 2008 funding for our local, regional and national road network stood at &euro;2.3 billion, while funding for the same road network for this year is approximately &euro;760 million.  Continual challenges arise because the available funds do not meet the amount of work that needs to be undertaken.<\/p> <p>I announced the 2015 regional and local road allocations on 3 February this year.  Leitrim County Council was allocated &euro;6.6 million, including &euro;3.3 million under the restoration improvement grant programme and &euro;1.57 million under the discretionary grant.  In addition - I am keen to emphasise this point - in July this year the council received an additional &euro;546,000 as part of the Supplementary Estimate under my Department.  The Supplementary Estimate will be going through the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.  Additional money was made available to Leitrim County Council and it was up to the council to decide how it allocated funding.  The position is that all available funding from my Department for this year has now been allocated.  The original base funding was made available in the way I have described.  Then, additional funding was made available at the start of the summer to allow local authorities to plan works they deem necessary across the balance of this year.  Therefore, I will have no additional funding available for this year.<\/p> <p>I will continue to look to secure the best possible allocation for local and regional roads with a view to next year, but it remains the case that it will be up to local authorities to decide how they wish to allocate funding.  The road in question must be seen in that context as well as in the context of the funding that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has already made available to fund work which, I acknowledge, needs to be done at the cottage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#D00800","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the Minister for his response.  Naturally, I am disappointed.  I was approaching the matter on the basis that I understand the council is not only seeking funding for the road to the Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada cottage, but that similar projects in other parts of the country require funding as well, specifically, Banna Strand, County Kerry.  Perhaps the Minister has received representations on that matter too.<\/p> <p>I took the view that in light of the imminent commemorations, a special allocation might be made by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the works.  I am keen to put on the record that according to the area engineer, the cost of providing road maintenance, resurfacing and the provision of a lay-by in what is a narrow mountain road, as my colleague, Senator Comiskey, knows well, is not inordinate.  Moreover, if the problem is not addressed, it will create traffic chaos since we expect an increase in tourist traffic as a result of the commemorations next year.  According to the council, the cost is a modest &euro;100,000.  According to what those in the council have told me and others, the council simply does not have that money available given the priorities.  The Minister has indicated that the considerable difference between the 2008 allocation and the current allocation would give the truth to that view.<\/p> <p>Small local authorities like Leitrim County Council have a small rate base.  Consequently, they rely more heavily than any other county on the allocation coming from Government.<\/p> <p>As the Minister is aware, there has been an all-party non-party approach at Leitrim County Council repeatedly in recent years to try to get some money.  I wish to put on record that approaches have been made to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which does not provide money for roads.  The Office of Public Works spends public money on maintaining the cottage because it is a national monument.  Leitrim County Council is allocating money having acquired land adjoining the cottage for a car park.  That is badly needed because car parking in the immediate vicinity of the cottage, as Senator Comiskey will testify, is rather poor and somewhat limited.  The council is making efforts in so far as it can.<\/p> <p>I wish to put another question to the Minister.  The Minister indicated that the allocation was made in February this year.  Presumably, the Minister will be making announcements for the 2016 programme.  When does he anticipate that he will make announcements on the allocation under the roads programme to local authorities such as Leitrim County Council?<\/p> <p>Overall, I am grateful to the Minister.  I know his heart is in the right place on this question.  I am not in any way attempting to be political about it.  This is a non-political issue.  We are proud of the fact that Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada comes from our county.  The people of Kiltyclogher have particular pride in the fact that he comes from their community.  Collectively, the people of the county will acknowledge that in the context of the commemorations next year this is an attempt to make the road more accessible for what will be increased traffic on the road.<\/p> <p>If a tour bus goes up that road in its present condition, it will be queueing for hours.  I hope there will be some sort of accommodation and some improvements.

The Government needs to explain why it would send our troops abroad when, quite evidently, they will be required at home.<\/p><p>The Leader two weeks ago quite generously said he would facilitate a debate on a united Ireland.  A study was launched yesterday in the Harvard Club in Manhattan, Modelling Irish Unification, done by a leading academic from the University of British Columbia who is the director of the Institute for European studies.  It examined three different scenarios regarding unification, as well as regulation, tax harmonisation, the benefits in terms of cost reductions in transportation, currency issues and how the economy in the North would receive a 4% to 7.5% boost in its GDP if unification took place.<\/p><p>The study also showed that over an eight-year period there would be a &euro;36.5 billion increase in productivity in the North and on the island.  A &quot;Prime Time&quot; survey showed that 80% of people in the South are in favour of unification in their lifetime, that is, over the next two decades.  I thank the Leader for organising and facilitating the debate on this.  Our job is to argue for and against the proposition.  I am favour of it and all political parties on both sides of the House state their aim is to achieve peaceful unification, as per Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and the Good Friday Agreement. <\/p><p>We need to examine studies such as that launched yesterday in America and determine how we can work towards the aims of Articles 2 and 3 and the Good Friday Agreement.

While there has been a mixed response to it, overall it should be a positive development for the all-island economy.  We will be able to attract investment to the island, which can only benefit us, and I say this as somebody who comes from the Border counties.  Could the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, come before the House to outline the implications for the reduction in the 12.5% tax rate and the latest Government spin on the jobs plan?  I do not know if we have plan No. 55 or No. 56 since the Government was formed.  It would be interesting to hear if anything positive is to come out of it.  Due to the imminent reduction in corporation tax in 2018, the Achilles' heel, despite the positives for the all-island economy, is that the Border region may be squeezed as a result and industry and jobs sucked into the conurbations of the north east and Belfast in the same way as they have been sucked into the greater Dublin region to the detriment of other parts of the country, despite the Government&rsquo;s statistics.  I have raised the issue with the Minister in the House and he has refuted it.  When anybody raises the question of the dispersal of jobs to the regions, the Government response is that job development is not confined Dublin.  However, the perception is that it is confined mainly to Dublin and, outside of it, to Galway, Limerick and Cork.<\/p> <p>There is a need for the creation of a cross-Border enterprise agency that would provide incentives to industry thinking of locating in Ireland, particularly after 2018, and that would make the Border regions more attractive.  A wide schedule of initiatives could be brought into place, including road and industrial infrastructure, apart from any tax breaks or other incentives that could be given through the local enterprise offices that are part of local authorities.  The future of the Border regions could be under threat in terms of attracting jobs once there is an all-island economy which would have a level playing field regarding corporation tax, which is a major plank of Government policy, and one which we would all defend to ensure there is more foreign direct investment.

The discussion should include the Action Plan for Jobs.  This has been a significant week as, for the first time since 2008, unemployment has fallen below 9% from its peak of 15.1%.  In addition, the number of people who are unemployed has fallen below 200,000 for the first time since 2008 and employment has grown in all eight regions.  Surprisingly, the growth in jobs in the Border region stands at 12%, which is good news.  In addition, approximately 56,000 additional jobs were created in the past 12 months and the number of people in part-time employment fell in the past 12 months, with the result that the number of people in full-time employment increased by 59,400.<\/p> <p>Much work remains to be done.  The roll-out of the regional action plans is a positive development, but if we are to remove a further 3% or 4% from the unemployment rate, which remains stubborn, we must ensure the regional action plans kick in and are effective.  I very much welcome the launch of the regional action plan for the west on Monday last.  I call for a debate with the Minister on how these plans can be maximised in order that jobs can be extended into more peripheral regions of the west and elsewhere.  I have in mind towns that have suffered badly in the past decade, such as Ballinasloe, County Galway, where a thousand industrial jobs were lost in the past ten years.  The regional action plan for jobs for the west must make a difference to places such as Ballinasloe.  We should also discuss with the Minister ways in which we can ensure that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland prioritise investment in regions that have lost out.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the announcement yesterday by the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs that &euro;1.2 billion of European Union Structural Funds will be spent in Ireland in the period from 2014 to 2020.

In the context of the statement issued this morning by the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, that he will resign his position as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and, as such, leave the political stage, it is important to acknowledge the very important role he and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, played in recent weeks in helping to forge a political conclusion to the talks at Stormont.  It is also important to note that the claims made some weeks ago that politicians in the North could not work together to forge deals have been shown to be completely unfounded by the deal reached this week.  This agreement was forged between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in before being presented to both Governments, which is very different from what happened on previous occasions.  It is by no means an ideal conclusion to the discussions, as Sinn F&eacute;in is not happy with many of the elements of the deal.  However, when one acknowledges that the Tory Government in Westminster is trying to impose a high level of austerity on the North and notes the lack of tax-generating powers devolved to the Northern institutions, one must welcome the positive aspects of the deal.  It is equally interesting to note some of the political rhetoric we heard at the time of the crisis that resulted in the commencement of the talks.  Certain leaders of political parties on this side of the Border stated at the time that the Assembly should be brought down.  Great leadership has been shown and we should acknowledge the role played by both the main parties in the North in that regard.  The debate on this new agreement will be very important. <\/p> <p>I encourage Senators to attend a presentation at 1 p.m. in the AV room to launch the Irish appeal for the release of Arnaldo Otegi and other Basque political prisoners.  This is a very important issue on which the Seanad should be much more vocal.

I presume that may account for his certain quiet voice and reticence in public speaking at times.<\/p> <p>On the Order of Business, I ask that instead of Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulations Bill 2011, we take Second Stage.  It is four years since we discussed the matter.  The passage of time indicates that we should revisit these issues.  It is also a completely different Bill from the one we discussed four years ago.  It has 75 pages and 220 amendments, approximately three quarters of which have been tabled by the Minister herself.  There is no urgency about this matter.  The Government has delayed long enough in reforming the legal profession and there are no reforms proposed in the Bill.  There are no roles for MABS, citizens advice centres, the consumer commission, FLAC, or university economic departments.  Instead, there is an amazing section 34 where the staff of the Law Society and the Bar Council join the new body.  Those who have been preventing reform are invited in, and they are given pensions under section 30.  I do not know what follows next - compulsory jobs in the Department of Health for the tobacco industry or compulsory jobs in the Road Safety Authority for speeding drivers.  It is bizarre to bring those who have been preventing reform for the past 38 years into the new body with pensions.  Large chunks of this Bill are bizarre.  It is so long since we considered it properly that we should take Second Stage and then deal with Committee Stage later.  I second Senator Quinn's proposal to amend the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#K00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I second the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Wilson.<\/p> <p>I will comment on what my good colleague, Senator Barrett, has said regarding the legal services Bill.  This Bill was mooted four years ago.  If we are being honest in this House, it was basically set aside until the Law Society, of which, I confess, I am a paid-up member, and the Bar Council in one sense bullied their way with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  It is going in the direction of a concoction of a Bill that is not good for the public at large.  Whether one is a solicitor or a barrister, one serves the people and there must be rules and regulations.  I agree with much of what Senator Barrett said about it being so long since the Bill was mooted.  The Bill that was first published four years ago and the one that is appearing now, as amended in the D&aacute;il and with amendments today, are so different that it is like comparing chalk with cheese.  We should take a step back on this for fear of not getting it right.<\/p> <p>We have been waiting probably 50 years for a Bill to reform how legal services are provided.  We are coming up to Christmas and the end of term, and with an election coming, it appears there is a rush by the Government to get this done, irrespective of what the outcomes will be.  If we get the wrong outcomes, the public, the citizens, whether unemployed, working class or well-off, in west Cork, Donegal or on the streets of Dublin, are the ones who will suffer from rushed legislation.  We should stand back.  If we have to sit a few days extra coming up to Christmas or sit a week earlier in the new year, I am in favour of that because rushing this through at this stage, having regard to the fact that it has been parked up for four years, does not make sense at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#K00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#K00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>It is important that we have a debate in this House as soon as possible on the agreement in the North which has been reached by all parties and by both Governments.

I note that as a result of the agreement, which was reached between Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP and both Governments - both Governments were part of the negotiations and the talks - there is no increase in tuition fees, no bedroom tax and no water charges, and there is &pound;585 million of additional funding to support the most vulnerable.  I agree with Senator Cahill that we cannot merely put the blame for the welfare reform cuts and the fact that we do not have enough protections in this regard on the shoulders of the British Government.  The Irish Government was also part of the negotiations.  The Irish Government was not part of working with Sinn F&eacute;in to get a better deal for citizens in the North.

It protects the institutions and democracy in the North which is what we all want to see achieved, but there are some very tough decisions that will have to be made by everybody in the context of that agreement.

God only knows where poor old Ireland would be without them but, in these days and years, they want to set up only in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Therefore, we need to develop indigenous companies on a more regional basis.  As stated previously, I know from experience - and anything that is written by people in business - that those in the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance have not got a clue what it is like to run a business.  The only people who create jobs in this country are those who set up new businesses.<\/p><p>I asked for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to be invited before us to discuss female entrepreneurs.  Female and male entrepreneurs require the same things; they need a supportive environment and incentives, particularly those relating to tax, to encourage them to start businesses.  We are no longer competing with Britain.  It is now more attractive for Irish people to set up in Britain.<\/p><p>Mr. Brian Caulfield, chairman of the Irish Venture Capital Association, has dismissed as irrelevant the cut in capital gains tax from 33% to 20% on selling a business because it is limited to the first &euro;1 million.  He argued that the Government should have moved to make the capital gains tax regime much more competitive and pointed to the United Kingdom.  We are absolutely not on an even playing field with the United Kingdom.  There is a need for an urgent discussion in the House with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, on the encouragement of indigenous companies and entrepreneurs.  How are we to deal with a possible British exit from the European Union and the issue of corporation tax?  I am delighted to have been part of the group pushing for a corporation tax rate of 12.5% for the North.  My friend who died two years ago, Sir George Quigley, was the key driver of the campaign to have the same rate in both the North and the South.

Senator Cahill mentioned the legacy issues.  Until they are dealt with, the North and the Republic will continue to be haunted by the past.  On this side of the Border, we are not very good at getting rid of the past.  Dealing with legacy issues is very important and there will be no long-term settlement across the island until this is done.<\/p> <p>I support - if necessary, I will second - the proposal of Senator Barrett that the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 not proceed to Committee Stage and instead be recommitted to Second Stage.  We are dealing with an entirely new Bill.  Sometimes a throwaway phrase sums it all up.  When the Minister for Justice and Equality was questioned about the opposition to the amendments and accused of completely watering down Deputy Shatter's Bill, she said her proposals were pragmatic.  We all know what that means when it comes from a politician; it means he or she is just trying to find a short-term solution to get over the difficulties.  It might be a pragmatic solution but it is not what people wanted, nor is it what was demanded of us by the troika.  It is only a fortnight ago that the troika was in town.  Once again, it reminded the Government that we have major issues with legal structures that need to be addressed.  Surely the purpose of the legislation should be to ensure we have the very best people practising law and that citizens can access the legal system in a fair and reasonable fashion.  Where disputes and difficulties emerge, there should be proper, independent structures in place to deal with them.  The amendments presented to us go completely against that set of necessary parameters.  If the Minister wants to defend her ideas, that is fair enough.  However, she should be publishing and introducing a new Bill.  It is completely wrong that we are dealing with well over 100 amendments that absolutely overturn the purpose of the Bill, as published.  We will proceed later today to take what is called Committee Stage but I am of the view that we must return to the drawing board.  That may be disappointing but we have been waiting four years for this legislation.  As Senator O'Donovan said, the public has been waiting for many decades for the legal system to be restructured.  I acknowledge it is not the Leader's call.  He is just told to squash the Bill through using the numbers available to him.  However, it is bad practice and bad law.

Will the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation intervene and relaunch the Shannon Estuary task force which went out of existence about four or five years ago?  It would timely, as we head into a general election and things are generally on the rise, that we would attract some of the major heavy industries that all of a sudden seem to want to congregate in Third World countries and eastern Europe.

From many of the accounts that were given on the RTE programme, the effects such drugs can have on individuals are frightening.  We simply do not know their impact but they are clearly not positive.

There are operational matters which require photographs to be taken and vehicles to be moved but not that there would be such long delays.  The Minister is looking at the matter and he will deal with it in the near future.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Neill mentioned farm payments.  The issue was raised last week by Senator MacSharry who suggested that the farmers concerned were not being paid.  That was the information he had been given and people were not getting their farm payments.  I am happy to clarify that matter for the Senator and all other Senators.  I can confirm that advance payments of the basic payment scheme and greening payment began issuing in Ireland on 16 October 2015, which is the earliest that payments for these scheme can commence under the governing EU regulations.  In addition, I can confirm that the level of the advance payment was set at 70% for 2015 rather than 50% heretofore.  The increase in the advance payment for 2015 is due in particular to the difficulties encountered in the dairying and pigmeat sectors.  Therefore it was a response by Government to the issue.  To date, 107,900 farmers have received basic payment scheme payments totalling &euro;680.6 million.  The greening payment is a new payment for farmers this year.  While the amount due under the greening scheme is calculated as a separate payment, it is paid in the one payment with the basic payment scheme payments.  Payment of the areas of natural constraints scheme payments commenced on schedule on 23 September.  There are no advance payments under this scheme.  To date, 82,240 farmers have received payments totalling &euro;175 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In Sligo - the Senator referred to this last week - more than 3,500 out of 3,840 farmers with entitlements under the BPS have been paid and 300 farmers out of 4,000 have received their ANC payment.

I will do everything to have the Bill dealt with comprehensively, as should be the case with every item of legislation.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Donovan raised the same issue and stated there is an urgent need for reform of legal services, which is long overdue.

She is correct that they represent the strength of our economy.  With regard to the issue she raised about capital gains tax, the Finance Bill will be before the House in early December and she can raise it with the Minister for Finance at that time.<\/p> <p>Senator Brennan asked whether the Narrow Water bridge project will be resurrected.

If memory serves, I think a great deal of its income comes from sources other than the State.  During the pre-legislative scrutiny phase at the joint committee, of which I am a member, we spent quite a while looking at this.  As such, I welcome section 28.  It establishes that a lot of cultural organisations being funded through the taxpayer for artistic expression also have a commercial role whereby they must make money and attract income whether through merchandising, recordings and other commercial ventures.<\/p> <p>I have two questions for clarification from the Minister on the section.  Do the rules on employment in this area of commercial ventures include a restriction on public appointments?  Do the rules on appointment impact directly on the commercial side?  We know that through the austerity period there was a prohibition on recruiting key members of staff at all national cultural institutions.  We know about the National Library.  I congratulate the Minister on the announcement yesterday of the capital investment in that regard.  It is much needed.  There is a prohibition on keepers, curators and positions all across our national cultural institutions because of the cutbacks.  My concern is whether section 28 makes it clear that the CEO of the National Concert Hall, or NCH, can employ people in subsidiaries, joint ventures and commercial activities, a requirement of which is that they ultimately support the overall mission of the body.  Will the CEO need to go through the rigmarole of applying to the Minister's Department and then waiting for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to weigh in?  In that case, six or eight months will have gone by before a person can be recruited.  Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Norris, &Oacute; Clochartaigh and I have all been involved in commercial and artistic ventures where the Irish phrase \"Tapaigh an deis\" is in question.  There is a moment when a recording must be done, a broadcast carried out or a tour arranged.  Will the NCH be obliged to wait eight months for a piece of paper and for one Minister to talk to another?  A year may go by and the opportunity to recruit may have passed.  I want clarity and confirmation on that.<\/p> <p>My second question is on income.  If a national cultural institution makes money, it goes back to the Exchequer.  That is the case with the National Library.  Suddenly, there is no sign of it.  Is there an incentive for the NCH to exploit, a term I use in a business sense, commercial opportunities to leverage the impact of cultural activity?  If joint ventures or subsidiaries of the NCH are making money, can the NCH keep the profit to reinvest in its work or does it have to go the Exchequer, never to be seen again?  If the money has to go back, that would disincentivise joint ventures or the leveraging of any commercial activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#P00800","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>The NCH can employ people casually on a commercial basis.

The Bill is a working recipe for the coexistence of the old and the new, which can ensure our legal services sector does not end up at a permanent competitive disadvantage and provide people who use legal services with better and more competitive choice.  The Legal Services Regulation Bill will deliver on the programme for Government commitment to establish independent regulation of the legal profession, improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints.<\/p> <p>After 30 years of reports and recommendations, the Bill, with the enhancements we will make to it in the Seanad, will provide for the independent regulation of the provision of legal services in the State and a far more transparent legal costs regime.  It contains substantial provisions, which will promote competition, help reduce legal costs in Ireland and support Ireland's economic competitiveness.  These very important reforms, which are good news for customers and small business enterprises, will improve equity of access to the justice system for all.  All of this will be achieved by balancing in law, in the stated objectives of the Bill and by amendment where necessary, legal professional principles and the interests of those who avail of legal services, this time in a more modern way under an independent regulator.<\/p> <p>Let there be no doubt that while the Bill does not obstruct the traditional form of legal practice, it demands that legal practitioners do not obstruct the Bill's reforms.  While some observations have been critical of the proposed new regulatory regime and some aspects of today's anticipated amendments, they have missed the point.  The new regime is being built by specific statutory provision on the foundation of an independently nominated regulatory authority, an independent complaints committee, an independent practitioners' disciplinary tribunal and a full suite of High Court powers and safeguards.<\/p> <p>As passed by the D&aacute;il, the Bill already comprises 158 sections spread over 13 Parts.  During its passage through the D&aacute;il, more than 235 amendments were made, and I will lay out for the Seanad very briefly the amendments I am about to propose.  They will see the replacement and reconfiguration of two Parts of the Bill to reflect the co-regulatory framework now in place between the new legal services regulatory authority and the Law Society.  This was foreseen in some of the amendments in the D&aacute;il, but the Bill was skeletal in some areas with a great amount of work to be done, which is what I am bringing forward today.<\/p> <p>Provision will be made for the possible transfer of the complaints handling staff of the Law Society and the Bar Council into the new body, to ensure adequate working capacity and expertise as we move from the old system to the new.  I am glad to say such a transfer has received support from all parties in the D&aacute;il and, I am led to believe, the Seanad has the same view.  It makes sense to ensure the ability of the new complaints facility to hit the ground running and gain early public confidence.  The societies have been doing this for decades.  There has never been independent regulation.  This is a serious transfer of function and we must take account of procedures and practices, history and expertise in the transfer to the new body of certain obligations.  We must ensure the new body works in tandem with the established bodies and nothing is lost in translation so the consumers and practitioners do not lose out on the expertise in handling issues, such as the financial compensation fund, which has been built up so painstakingly over a long period.<\/p> <p>On foot of the amendments proposed, all public complaints, no matter what their subject matter, will be made to and remain in the hands of legal services regulatory authority to be prosecuted to a conclusion.  The authority will have the power to go back to the relevant body, such as the Law Society, and I will go into detail in this regard.<\/p> <p>The provisions on inspections and search and entry will be strengthened, legal services advertising will be brought in line with EU directives and there will be a strengthening of existing provisions on cost, including the chief legal costs adjudicator replacing the Taxing Master.  There will be more transparency on fees, and there is quite an amount of detail on this point.  A two year review clause is built in, at the end of which note will be taken of how consumer and competitiveness issues have been addressed over the two year period.<\/p> <p>This is a quick summary of the approach, and I will now discuss the amendments.  This group of amendments relates to consequential amendments to the Solicitors Acts which, I note, are from 1954 to 2008.  We are speaking about Acts from over a long period, all of which had to be looked at and various amendments made to arrive at the point where we have a new independent authority.  This issue may also arise on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment with regard to a collective citation.  Amendment No. 154 is with regard to section 3 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1960 and substitutes a new definition of \"misconduct\" which will refer to the definition of \"misconduct\" provided for in the legal services regulation Act.  This is to ensure there is equivalence between the two pieces of legislation in investigations.  It is very straightforward and technical.  Amendment No. 155 amends section 2 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 with regard to the definition of \"authority\" to mean the legal services regulatory authority under the Act.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 156 is important and substitutes a new section 14A into the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994.  It deals with the powers of the Law Society to investigate alleged misconduct by solicitors.  With the new arrangements on complaints and procedures, it is necessary to clarify what powers the Law Society will have to investigate complaints.  Subsection (1) of the new section 14A sets out what the Law Society may investigate where it receives a complaint about a solicitor or where the authority requests it to carry out an investigation.  Subsection (2) provides that the society should conduct an investigation in compliance with a request from the authority, because the authority can request the Law Society to conduct an investigation under section 50 of the legal services regulation Act.  Subsection (3) permits the Law Society to issue a direction or more than one direction to a solicitor where it considers that the act or omission of the solicitor warrants a sanction.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This will apply except where the Law Society considers that due to the gravity of the concerns raised, the matter should be referred to the disciplinary tribunal I mentioned in the context of subsection (6).  Subsection (5) provides that where a solicitor takes the measure or measures specified in the direction of the Law Society, the matter shall be considered as determined.  Subsection (7) relates to notifications to be made to a solicitor on the determination of a complaint.<\/p><p>These follow on from the major changes we have made on the role of the LSRA handling disciplinary issues.  Amendment No. 157 amends section 26 of the Solicitors Act, which relates to the provision of professional indemnity cover.  New provisions on it will be provided in the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  The amendments are designed to ensure continuity with these provisions.  Accordingly, the amendment ensures that the Law Society may make regulations in this matter but only with the consent of the authority.  The amendments also provide that the regulation may extend to solicitors in legal partnerships, multidisciplinary practices or limited liability partnerships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#T00600","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We had some brief discussion on this matter this morning during the Order of Business.  If we are being totally honest, the Bill that we see before the House now has changed from that presented by Deputy Shatter four years ago.  Then it was like a two year old male tiger, full of teeth, steam and gusto and now we end up with a little lamb with little teeth that one would find in the mountains of West Cork.  There has been a total change.  I am a member of the Law Society and it appears to me that the two big legal professions have coerced the Government to water down this Bill from what it was originally supposed to be.  I make that observation at the very outset.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that we need to have independent regulation.  That is something I advocate.  As Senator Barrett mentioned on the Order of Business this morning, it seems that the existing staff of both the Law Society and the Bar Council will be subsumed into the new authority.  That creates a doubt in my mind about how independent the new authority will be.<\/p> <p>The Minister mentioned the issue of cost.  One of the catalysts of this legislation was the coming of the troika to this country which pointed a finger at the matter of legal costs.  I wish to place on record the fact that approximately 25% of the solicitors in this country, while they do not have a monopoly, are in a very strong position.  There are solicitors in Dublin charging the Government, Departments, and commercial people &euro;455 per hour.  In other places, such as Bantry, Castlebar, Castleblayney or any rural town in Ireland where there are solicitors, a solicitor would be very lucky to get &euro;75 an hour.  The huge costs charged by a small number of major companies are a problem.  They advise the Government and NAMA.  I say this as someone who practised in a small town and made a living there.  A huge proportion of these costs revolves around ten or 15 big firms.  I always make the point that there are qualified young solicitors and barristers who cannot even get onto the payroll because they cannot find jobs.  The idea is that this Bill will resolve the matter of costs through regulation and the trust.  It will not and cannot resolve the whole area of costs and transparency unless there is some sort of parity.  If one seeks advice from a solicitor on a will, for example, in Castlemaine in Kerry or Tullamore, the charge is &euro;100 or &euro;150.  There has to be some balance because the costs to solicitors are the same.  The licence fee that I pay to the Law Society is no different than the fee paid by a principal in a main firm in Dublin that employs 100 solicitors.  If we do not grasp the nettle that is the regulation of costs, this Bill will fail on many issues.  I can tell the Minister that 75% of practising solicitors in Ireland would concur with what I am saying.  Some of them are struggling to survive.  They have mortgages like everyone else.  Not long ago, I was driven into the city from the airport by a young taxi driver who is a qualified barrister but who had no work.  If the perception in Europe is that we are all creaming it, they are wrong and are going down the wrong road.<\/p> <p>We are on Committee Stage and I do not want to labour the point.  I am concerned about the new regulatory authority.  Is it another quango?  Will it be efficient?  One can say it is not relevant to this particular section.  The troika said that Ireland should sort out its legal services - the Bar association and solicitors.  If that is done and the same monopoly is retained in which 25% control the major income and major fee per hour and the other 75% suffer, we will not have solved the issue to which the troika referred.  I am talking about solicitors in particular.  I cannot say strongly enough that the version of the Bill introduced in the House four years ago is so different from that now before us that if a law student studied it, he or she would say it is completely new legislation.  I have great respect for the Minister and I do not say this in a derogatory way towards her or her officials but perhaps they should have gone back to the drawing board, produced a new Bill with the changes incorporated in it and started afresh rather than moving from a big ship to a small boat.  That is the impression I get.  We are dealing with a totally different Bill.  However it is dressed up, those are the facts.  I put that on record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#U00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I wish to express my complete disappointment with this Bill.  It does nothing about the conveyancing monopoly which imposes a cost on every person who buys a house in this country.  The costs are way in excess of those which obtain in the United Kingdom.  That damages our competitiveness.  The Bill does nothing about the right of audience to a barrister without having a solicitor present.  It seriously disappoints the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission which, in one of its former guises as the Competition Authority, has been advocating what I have been saying for the past ten years.  The amendments arrived late on Tuesday after the deadline for our own amendments.  As Senator O'Donovan said, this is a completely new Bill and the Minister has shown scant regard to the House by the way she has proceeded.  We asked to have a new Second Stage today and to have the weekend to discuss it.  At the last count, there were 220 amendments over 77 pages - 159 from the Minister, 37 from me, and 24 from Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  The Minister has changed the emphasis completely.  She has ignored Stephen Kinsella in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the troika.  This is a Bill written by the legal profession for the legal profession.  That is why its members are allowed to transfer over to the new body.<\/p><p>On the Order of Business, I asked what is next if the people from the Bar Council and the Law Society who are involved in structuring reform transfer to the new body with their pensions topped up.  What is next?  Will the tobacco industry have a right to have people employed in the Department of Health?  Will speeding motorists get jobs in the Road Safety Authority?  This is total capture of Government by a vested interest.  The Minister has ignored both what the National Competitiveness Council has said and the burden put on people trying to buy houses.  It is totally producer based and that is why it is so disappointing.  I refer here to both the content of the Bill and the way it is being pushed through the House today.  I have heard several Members of the Lower House saying &quot;What a pity we did not run with the Bill four years ago.&quot;  This Bill is a travesty.  It is a huge victory for the incumbents.  I see no representation from MABS, FLAC, university law departments or the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  It is totally producer based, setting up a quango which will do much the same job as the Bar Council and Law Society have been doing up to now.  We have a problem in respect of excess legal costs that will have to be addressed some time.  This Bill will set up a quango to address some of those issues in four years' time but we have known about the issues, as the Minister said in her press release, for 38 years.  Why not tackle the conveyancing monopoly now?  That is the basis on which the super normal profits are made and which has built up our bloated legal structure.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sean D.

We will be going through the amendments one by one, but this Bill shows a Government reversing from what the troika wanted and from what every citizen in Ireland wanted, that is to say, a more efficient and lower-cost legal system than what we have now.  There must be great happiness in the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland with the version of the Bill before the House today.

I wish you had not said that because it is unhelpful from my perspective.  The Minister is welcome and I am sure we will have a substantive debate this afternoon and beyond.  I concur with what was said previously to the effect that this is really a new or fresh start.  To use the awful phrase, we are where we are.<\/p> <p>I am unsure whether it was Peter Mandelson, when working for Tony Blair, or Mr. Emanuel, when working for President Obama, who coined the phrase that we should never waste a good crisis.  I am mindful of that phrase because of the crisis that resulted in the economic meltdown of the country a few short years ago and the subsequent arrival into town of the IMF and the troika with their list of proposals, suggestions and demands, most of which have been enacted.<\/p> <p>This brings me to reflect on the fact that one of the big-ticket issues as far as the troika was concerned, as recently as a fortnight ago, was the way law is practised in this country and the way it impinges on the cost of the legal provision for every citizen.  Of course, it is not simply a question of every citizen or taxpayer in the country.   Anyway, I heard Professor Kinsella being interviewed yesterday afternoon.  He made a pertinent observation about the vast cost to the taxpayer of the legal bills for every Department and virtually every agency of State.  If we fail or refuse to challenge legal costs, it is not only the so-called private citizen or householder who is affected.  The taxpayer who is footing the legal bills for every Department and Government agency is being affected as well.  Certainly, there was an expectation four short - or long - years ago when this Bill was introduced.  I served briefly on the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality at that stage.  There was an expectation that when the Bill was passed we would see a new regime in place and that the cost of the provision of legal services would be reduced.  There appears to be no indication that we are going in that direction.<\/p> <p>The Minister made certain remarks in her opening statement.  It was useful that the Minister prefaced the debate with the remarks to the effect that she sees this as good news for consumers.  I imagine the Minister believes that.  Yet the only response of consumer champions or consumer associations to date has been one of regret and disappointment.  They believe what they believe and the Minister believes what she believes.  I call on the Minister to clarify why she believes it is good news for consumers.<\/p> <p>The Minister also made what I deem to be a very honest statement, if she was quoted correctly.  Of course, the Minister is not always quoted correctly.  Anyway, yesterday a newspaper reported the Minister describing the Bill as a pragmatic solution in response to some of the criticisms.  I did not hear the Minister say it, but she was quoted as pronouncing that this was a pragmatic solution.  We experience great difficulties in the way we try to do political business and carry out reform in this State and in respect of the law.  One of the reasons we often fail is that pragmatism wins.  It is a neat, handy and short-term solution, but pragmatic solutions to big issues are not required in this case.<\/p> <p>I agree with what Senator O'Donovan has said about the major variance in legal costs throughout the country.  Let no one be in doubt: there are many barristers who are failing to eke out a living in this country and many solicitors likewise.  Not every legal practice has a lottery machine in the back room of the premises.  However, the general cost of legal services in this country is still extraordinarily high by European and world standards.  When this almost new Bill is passed and these sections and amendments are all pushed through, we should ask ourselves honestly what will have changed and whether law be more accessible from a financial perspective to the citizen on the street.  The answer is clearly going to be \"No\".  We have substantial issues to take up with the Minister as we peruse this legislation.  They relate to the concept of regulation, the independence of regulation and the new practices required.  All these questions will have to be at the centre of the debate.  It is difficult to accept that what is now before the House is in any way related to what was published in 2011.  One particular route was taken at that stage but it appears to have been reversed.<\/p> <p>The Minister rightly referred to legislation going back to the 1950s.  Obviously there is a need for major updating.  However, I believe we are in danger, following the changes proposed in recent weeks or months by the current Government, having waited for four years, of putting through changes to a reform Bill which will negate its entire purpose.<\/p> <p>I look forward to the Minister's defence of her amendments.  In fairness, the Minister had to present this legislation to her Cabinet colleagues.  They now seem to be at one on the matter.  The heavy hand of forces outside Government appears to have worked on this occasion.  The consumer and the economy are the losers.  So often the Taoiseach refers to building a modern, dynamic, creative and inventive economy.  If we are to be the famous best small country in the world to do business, then issues such as the practice of law and the cost of same need to be dramatically reformed.  They will not be fundamentally reformed arising from these amendments.  I look forward to the Minister's observations on the amendments.<\/p> <p>I do not believe it would be the end of the world, from a reform or a political perspective, if it were not possible to push this legislation through the D&aacute;il and Seanad before the term of this Government ends, because we need to get it right.  Maybe it is a question of only parliamentary days rather than weeks left.  After all the waiting, consultation and submissions, there is a danger that we could pass legislation which, while bringing many improvements - in fairness, all legislation does - does not really push the buttons required of us and demanded of us, rightly, not only by the troika but by consumer champions in this country as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#V00500","speaker":"1205"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

This is extremely significant for consumers.<\/p><p>To speak in broad terms, the other great change is the one to bring about an independent system of regulation for practitioners in both professions.  Again, this is a significant change about which many practising lawyers are unhappy but, nonetheless, it is an important and welcome one that will provide for significant lay supervision.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett, in particular, spoke about who should be on the legal services regulatory authority.  Section 8 of the Bill provides that lay members should be nominated by FLAC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others.  There will be a really important input from those bodies with human rights expertise and so on.  That is important.<\/p><p>People have been making issue about the transfer of staff but I believe there was general support for it in the D&aacute;il.  Senator Conway will remember that when the justice committee had hearings on this Bill some years ago, staff transfers comprised a significant issue.  Reference was made to the need to ensure continuity of expertise and adequate competence in the new regulatory authority.  If one examines the provision, one sees it is only giving the authority the option to transfer staff.  It strikes the right balance.<\/p><p>I have two other points.  On section 33, Senator Barrett mentioned university law schools.  That is a subject close to my heart, of course, and I know that university law schools are looking at this with great interest.  Section 33 will empower the authority, once it is established, to take soundings and examine the evidence basis for extending the provision of legal education to the universities and other entities, in addition to considering the unification of the legal profession, which I believe would be a welcome reform but for which we need to see the case.  A good balance is struck between the necessary reforms that need to be carried out now on costs and independent regulation and setting up a basis for further reforms.  This is the start of a reform of the legal profession that is long overdue.<\/p><p>Among the reforms that have been in place for many years now are those to allow solicitors rights of audience before all courts.  Senator Barrett should note that solicitors do have rights of audience before all the courts, but very few solicitors choose to exercise them.  In fact, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Shatter, was one of the few practising solicitors who appeared quite regularly in the superior court.  This is a matter that requires cultural shift.  However, the sorts of changes being brought about in this Bill will certainly help to expedite the cultural shift that is needed urgently in the legal profession.<\/p><p>It is a contradiction to say we urgently need reform of the legal profession and then object to this Bill coming before us now, a few months after Second Stage.  We need to get this Bill through.  I am glad there is to be a review clause in it.  There is a two-year review clause.  It will ensure that we keep our eye on the ball in terms of the reform of the legal profession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#V00600","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I concur with Senator Bacik and welcome the Minister to the House.

The latter did substantial work on it.  In this regard, Senators Bacik and O'Donovan, other colleagues and I were quite active.  Many of these issues were ironed out at the time.  When we took Second Stage here on 13 May, it was the end of one journey and the beginning of another.

That has all been filled out in great detail and we will have an opportunity to go through it today.<\/p> <p>Some of the comments made by Senators, which I appreciate were summary, do a disservice to the scope and scale of this legislation.  Independent regulation is to be achieved for the first time, along with independent means of dealing with complaints.  This is important.  There is to be an independent statutory framework set up for the first time.  I could comment on the various points.  The cost regime is quite significant, as Senator Barrett should note.  His point on conveyancing is addressed in the Bill, as recommended by the Competition Authority.  We have taken it on board, along with any of the points the authority has made in several memoranda to the Government and several detailed responses on the way the Bill has been drafted.<\/p> <p>The troika welcomes the Bill.

I reject completely the idea that this is a completely new Bill.  It represents detailed work on significant changes to the legal profession.  Significant changes are being introduced for the first time and there is to be important new regulation, representing the right way to go.

There are five legal members and six lay members.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that we need to move on to the detail of each amendment.  I mentioned that there is a very detailed cost regime.  A new office of legal costs adjudicators is to replace the Taxing Master.<\/p> <p>It is to be significantly more difficult for excessive charges by lawyers to stand.  The legislation makes it quicker and easier for clients to have their bills assessed and reduced, where applicable, efficiently and effectively.  These are all major changes, as evident in comments by many.

There are 80 pages of amendments and the original Bill is 130 pages.  To say the legislation before us is not close to being a new Bill is not exactly correct.  Amendment No. 156 is to substitute a new section, amounting to nearly two pages of change.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Denis O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1988\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1988&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have some concerns about it.  First, it refers to the new legal services regulatory authority.  In reading this new section contained in amendment No. 156, I am a little confused.  As I understand it, it can deal with a complaint from the public without it going through the Law Society or, I presume, the Bar Council, but this refers in particular to the Law Society.  It is a little difficult to fathom.<br\/><br\/>The Law Society also has a twin-track role in investigating a complaint against its member.  I say that, and I am a little confused, because if we are talking about independence of the new regulatory authority, subsection (7)(a) of amendment No. 156 states:<\/p><blockquote>Where the Society considers that the measure specified in <i>section 61(6)(a)<\/i>of the <i>Legal Services Regulation Act 2015<\/i>is the appropriate measure to be taken as respects the finalisation of its investigation, it shall notify the solicitor concerned to that effect and specify the precise measure (including in the case of a restriction or condition to be placed on the practising certificate of the solicitor, the precise restriction or condition).<\/blockquote><p>As I understand this, at all stages it seems that the Law Society has a twin-track role in the investigation of a complaint, either directly by a member of the public independent of the Law Society or by a group of people against a solicitor or a firm of solicitors.  Subsection (7)(c) of the same amendment states:<\/p><blockquote>Where the Society issues a notification pursuant to paragraph (b) and does not receive the written consent of the solicitor concerned within 21 days to the imposition of the specified measures [I presume it will be some sort of constraint on how they practice], it shall apply to the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal for the holding of an inquiry under <i>section 71 <\/i>of the <i>Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 <\/i>by it into the matter, in so far as the Society has not found that the concerns giving rise to its investigation of the matter are unfounded or that the act or omission concerned does not warrant the imposition of a sanction under this section.<\/blockquote><p>If this new regulatory authority makes a decision, the Law Society, on my reading of it, must accept it.  There can also be an application to the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal for a further hearing.<br\/><br\/>In the case of some of the big guys who held us all to ransom as members of the Law Society and who went off with &euro;50 million and &euro;70 million and never came home, this gives significant scope where there is an initial investigation which can go on subsequently to the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal.  Therefore, there is investigation after investigation.  If there is a judicial review of the matter in the High Court and Supreme Court, the investigation, particularly of a serious complaint, could extend to two or three years.<br\/><br\/>Debate on amendment No. 1, even though it is technical, also takes in amendments Nos. 154 to 157, inclusive.  We have agreed to debate them together.  Amendment No. 156 in particular is a lengthy new amendment that needs more explanation, as far as I am concerned.  It certainly is not simple.<br\/><br\/>In changing this Bill for solicitors, I make the point, while not trying to go outside the remit of the section, that a small fisherman in the Beara Peninsula or a small farmer in Connemara should have the same right and access as a multi-millionaire.  If this is as difficult as it seems, the person living in a remote part of Ireland will find it difficult to jump all the hurdles required under this new section.  It certainly is not making it simple, which it should be.<br\/><br\/>Let us say a complaint is made and this new regulatory authority states the solicitor should not be allowed practice if it is a serious issue, should only practice under the supervision of somebody else or should be fined or reprimanded in some way.  There seems to be another tranche of proceedings which that person could instigate, I presume through the Law Society, or the Law Society could say that the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal would kick in, and that is another tier of investigation.  It is certainly far from simple and it is certainly something the troika did not envisage.<br\/><br\/>I do not know whether this is something that has been recommended by the Law Society or agreed to, but it is a lengthy section.  The Minister might clear the air on amendment No. 156, which is part of the first tranche of amendments.  Maybe I am confused or I misunderstand it.  Reading it through, it does not make the area of complaints and discipline simple.  If anything, it makes it more convoluted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#W00500","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Donovan.

We will be going into considerable detail on that because that is about how the complaints and discipline are dealt with.  It sets up the entire framework for the new authority dealing with all complaints.  It will be very straightforward.  If anyone else has a complaint, it goes to the legal services regulatory authority, LSRA.  It can then seek the help of and, if necessary, get inspections and reports from the Law Society's financial experts because, as Senator O'Donovan will be aware, the solicitor's financial affairs will continue to be overseen by the Law Society but under the supervision of the LSRA.

Sections 30 and 31 of the Bill as published are being remodelled again into the new Bill, Part 3, to better specify the inspection powers of the legal services regulatory authority in line with any modern inspection regime.  Part 3 of the Bill outlines all the expected powers that one would assume a strong independent regulator would have.  This section defines the role of inspector within the meaning of the Bill, with amendments Nos. 39 to 46 inserting the new Part of the Bill.  Amendment No. 39 inserts a new section that provides for the appointment of inspectors and is all about the inspectors.  It is very similar in nature to the provisions in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.  Under the provision the authority can appoint either members of its staff or other persons whom it thinks fit to act as inspectors.  The section makes it clear that a person appointed as an inspector will be furnished with a warrant of appointment by the authority.  Amendment No. 40 inserts a new section 37, an important provision which sets out that the purpose for which an inspection can be carried out can be defined in general.  It is intended that the legal services regulatory authority will have inspection powers and investigation powers in relation to compliance and general compliance practices.<\/p> <p>While the authority will exercise these powers in relation to solicitors and barristers, it will not overlap with the separate inspection powers of the Law Society of Ireland, which will be retained under the Act.  In regard to complaints made to the authority, section 37 provides that an inspector may carry out an inspection where a complaint is being made or is deemed to have been made to the authority under the Act regarding inadequate service.  Where a complaint regarding excessive legal fees has been made or is deemed to have been made to the authority, it can appoint an inspector to bring the information together and do the necessary work.  An inspector can also be appointed where a complaint has been made to the authority regarding an act or omission on the part of a legal practitioner which may be considered as constituting misconduct.  If any of these complaints are made there is a straight route to the authority.  Complaints can be made, inspectors can be appointed and an investigation carried out into the compliant by an independent body, with an inspector appointed.  As I said previously, this is a consumer-friendly process.<\/p> <p>In addition, the section provides that the authority may carry out an inspection in order to ensure compliance by a legal practitioner in relation to any requirement imposed on the practitioner by this Act, in relation to any regulations made under the Act which are applicable to the practitioner and in relation to any code of practice issued or amended under section 20.  Amendment No. 41 inserts a new section 38 into the Bill, which is a key provision that specifies the powers of an inspector under section 36 with regard to the inspections carried out.<\/p> <p>I will summarise what the inspector can do in response to any of these complaints.  The inspector can enter, inspect, examine and search any place where he or she believes an activity is being carried out in connection with the business of a legal practitioner.  For example, the inspector can enter a premises where it is suspected, or where there are reasonable grounds for believing, that books, records or accounts are being kept or other documents stored in various forms which relate to the business of a legal practitioner.  The inspector may require a legal practitioner, or any other person in the place, to produce the books, records and documents for the inspector.  Senators can see what the general approach is.  It is to have a robust inspection regime that can follow up and have the necessary authority and powers to get the information together to make a determination on it.  The inspectors can also require any legal practitioner, or any other person present at the place concerned, to give the inspector such information and assistance as the inspector may reasonably require or to answer relevant questions.  On foot of a court order obtained from the High Court, the inspector can also carry out certain actions where necessary, including seizing and retaining books, securing data equipment or any associated apparatus for later inspection, and, for the purpose of preserving records for later inspection, the securing of the place or any such place where that may reasonably be necessary.<\/p> <p>This section and these amendments are all about the powers of the inspectors who will be operating under the legal services regulatory authority and who will have quite robust and stringent powers of inspection.  It is an inspection regime which will operate under the legal services regulatory authority with all the powers that I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#Y01400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I understand that all these powers are necessary, but will the Minister indicate whether there is any mechanism within the authority that could conduct preliminary investigations?

We are speaking now about the powers of inspection, because the discussion is around Part 5, and this is where I go into the detail of how the complaints will be handled.  In answer to the Senator's query, yes, there is a mechanism to deal with that type of situation.  It is quite clear that there has to be an assessment in the first instance.  The complaints can vary from anonymous complaints to those that are very serious and those that have other motivations.  We know that this can happen in any walk of life.  The authority will have a triage system, and the complaints process will include triage for admissibility types, attempts at informal resolution or mediation where appropriate, referral to the complaints committee of the authority, and, where necessary, referral for determination of misconduct by a legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal.  Like any complaints process, it is a system that in the first instance can assess what is the level of complaint and make a reasonable judgment on that.  Depending on that judgment, it can then go to the most serious level of inspection, which I have just described, or, after the triage, it may be decided that the complaint does not warrant further investigation.  This type of process is followed all the time by other bodies.  The legal services regulatory authority will be in a position to do exactly that.  Senator O'Donovan asks a fair and relevant question because there does have to be an assessment of the complaints as they come in and an assessment of the way in which they should be dealt with depending on their seriousness and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#Y01600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her clear response, which clarifies the worries I had in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#Z00100","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\nGovernment amendment No. 8:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed. to.\r\n\r\nGovernment amendment No. 9:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\nGovernment amendment No. 10:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\nGovernment amendment No. 11:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 12, 47 to 49, inclusive, and 115 are related while amendment No. 49 is a physical alternative to amendment No. 48.

A definition of PII is inserted and there are two sections to clarify the issue of professional indemnity insurance for legal practitioners.  It is proposed that section 38 is to be replaced by a new section 38, which is reworked in order to better clarify the obligation on solicitors and barristers to have adequate professional indemnity insurance, including when they are providing services through the new business models being created by the Bill, such as legal partnerships, multidisciplinary practices and limited liability partnerships.  This is necessary for the consumer and in the interests of clients, they will not be permitted to practice unless insurance cover is in place.  All legal practitioners will be under an obligation to comply with the relevant regulations and the authority is being given the power to approve any existing group schemes, as long as they are already compliant with regulations.<\/p> <p>Section 39 sets out the regulatory authority's professional indemnity insurance regulation-making powers in addition to making new regulations, including where none exists, such as the case with the new business models.  The authority will have the power to set monetary amounts regarding the minimum level of cover and maximum excess amount that the authority considers appropriate to each type of legal practice.  The objectives of the regulations are set out and these include elements that are important to the consumer.  They are to protect the client's money and interests, encouraging high standards at a reasonable cost, proper consideration of any different levels of risk that might apply to different types of legal practices and ensuring that adequate cover is in place in all cases.  These provisions are similar to what was contained in the previous section 38 but they are more robust and detailed.  In some ways, what we had was a more skeletal approach to the issues but as the Bill has developed, we have filled them out, as we have done with the inspection regime.<\/p> <p>Senator Barrett's amendment suggests the use of the world \"shall\".  That is part of the section being proposed.

I agree there should be compulsory insurance cover for professional indemnity.  I remember when I returned from England in 1981 that I opened my little practice and was probably one of the first to volunteer for professional indemnity.  It cost me &pound;750 at the time and it was a lot of money then.  My concern is whether the professional indemnity cover would take into account turnover in cover.  I am subject to correction but there seems to be no more than two firms in the State offering professional indemnity insurance.  Normally, 95% or 97% of professionally practising solicitors may have to carry the burden for the rogue solicitors or those who are negligent in one way or another.  In ensuring that we have professional negligence insurance, is there sufficient competition in the market to guarantee fair play across the board?  I have a feeling that we are tending towards a monopoly, with just one or two big players providing insurance and holding the gun to solicitors' heads.  That affects the small guy rather than the big guy, who can afford to carry that level of cover.  Professional negligence insurance is now probably several thousand euro per year.  A person from a firm with six or seven solicitors told me recently that before it starts on 1 January each year, it must set aside &euro;50,000 for professional negligence insurance, despite not having a claim in the past ten years.  Perhaps this may be the wrong time to raise the issue but I will say it anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#Z01000","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I thought the Senator was going to ask about the business of the solicitors and the cost.

There is a need to recognise the expertise of the staff in the establishment of a new body.  I emphasise that this is being done under independent management.  That is the key point.  Less than half of the staff - approximately 18 people - are transferring across.  We often talk about the need for expertise and skill in the handling of complaints.  While that is the reality of what has happened in the past, there is now completely independent management.  We have a timeframe for the various pieces of work to be done by the legal services regulatory authority.  We cannot ask it to do absolutely everything in the first year.  We have to be realistic about the various tasks given to any new body.  However, we have said that the legal partnerships need to be up and running within six months.  By allowing these new partnerships, we will introduce competition into the market and change the way legal services are provided.

I am afraid, with the best will in the world, that a delaying mechanism is being used.  There is no need for it because the research has already been done.  It is quite easy to compare the cost of conveyancing in this jurisdiction with the cost of conveyancing in the United Kingdom.  I do not see a case for delays in a matter of serious public concern.  I remind the House that during the boom period, house prices went from two and a half times the average income to 12 times the average income and the legal profession made an absolute fortune from being linked to house prices.  That is the anti-competitive aspect of the legal sector about which the troika and the competition commission are concerned.

We have to be careful not to overwhelm it in its initial stages.<\/p> <p>I remind Senator Barrett that the evidence from the research into the new approach to conveyancing in England is that the new approach has not taken off to any significant degree.  I think that is an interesting point for us to contemplate.  There seems to be a reluctance among the general public to make the kind of move that has been allowed for in England.  We want the consultation to be done here.  We want to move on it.  The experience in England is an interesting marker because it shows that after the change was made, the take-up was apparently very small.

She is quite right when she says that the share of the independent conveyancers is quite small.  However, they have put manners on the established soliciting firms, to use a colloquial term.  Their costs for conveyancing are much lower.  I do not care how many new conveyancers there are.  We have to get away from the system that involves 1.5% of the price of a house, or approximately &euro;5,000 in the case of a semi-detached house in Dublin.  The work in question can be done for &pound;250 across the water.  That is totally uncompetitive.  Perhaps it will take a handful of conveyancers to induce that competition, as the Minister has said.  Previous evidence from the Prices Commission and other bodies has suggested that conveyancing is used in solicitors' firms, particularly in the bigger firms, to cross-subsidise many of their other activities.  The house purchasers about whom we were concerned when we introduced the residential tenancies Bill and other legislation get a bad deal from the present way Ireland organises the conveyancing monopoly held by solicitors.  We know that they would do far better in the UK.  We also know that it does not take many of the new conveyancers to secure a more competitive outcome.

I was the secretary of the West Cork Barristers Association in my younger days.  What happens now is that people ring around from one solicitor to another to find a fellow who can do it &euro;100 cheaper.  It is extremely competitive.  Maybe there was a monopoly during the boom, when bigger firms controlled much of this activity, but I think that has gone.<\/p> <p>I would like to put a final point to the Minister before I conclude.

I will make two quick points in that respect.  First, e-conveyancing, about which we have heard a great deal at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, will undoubtedly provide for a streamlined and less expensive procedure.  This important initiative, which is in train at the moment and will not need legislation, is being driven by a number of bodies.  Second, section 33 as it stands does not make provision for a specific timeframe within which the legal services regulatory authority must make its report to the Minister on the creation of the profession of conveyancer.  It might be worth putting in a specified timeframe, as Senator Bradford has suggested.  I remind the House that clear timeframes of two years and four years, respectively, have been set for the reports on changes to legal education and on the potential unification of the profession.

I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill forward.  In a general sense, we concur with most of what has been brought forward in the Bill but we will raise a number of issues later on.  I thank the Minister's backroom team for its briefing on amendments yesterday.  I wish to put on record that we did not think it was right, fitting or correct that so many substantial amendments were brought forward with so little time left to parse them.  I note and concur with the points made by Senators previously but shall comment on the amendments and the section.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is conscious of the fact that the amendment is on the composition of the authority and I think Senator Bacik has made a Freudian slip because she agreed with me on this matter earlier.  Sinn F&eacute;in would prefer if the Minister would bring forward, and we ask her to consider doing so before Report Stage, an amendment proposing that the authority should consist of 13 members and of the following persons: three persons nominated by the Law Society of Ireland; two persons nominated by the Bar Council of Ireland; one judge of the Superior Courts nominated by the Chief Justice; one person nominated by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation; one person nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; one person nominated by the National Consumer Council; one person nominated by the Free Legal Advice Centres; and one person selected by the Chief Justice from such persons as are nominated by non-profit legal advocacy groups, as defined in subsection (6), operating in the State.  For such purpose each such group shall be entitled to nominate one person for selection as follows: one legal cost accountant nominated by the Institute of Legal Cost Accountants; and one person selected by the Chief Justice from such persons as are nominated by legal education institutions, as defined in subsection (7), operating in the State.  For such purposes each such legal education institution shall be entitled to nominate one such person for selection.  I note the points made by Senators previously that they concur on this issue.  The rest of the suggestions were on the running of the authority, how the authority could elect its members, how it would select a chair, etc. and we also outlined the roles of the authority.<\/p> <p>I disagree with the ruling out of order of amendment No. 15 on a technicality because there is merit in the changes we sought.  The purpose of the amendment was to increase the membership of the authority from the 11 members proposed by the Government up to 13 members.  We did not seek a huge increase.  We simply wanted to ensure that the authority was broad enough, fit for purpose and covered all of the different stakeholders that need to be covered.<\/p> <p>We are very positive about most of the provisions in the legislation.  It is important to emphasise that no provision has been made to afford free legal aid organisations a position on the board of the authority.  We feel there should also be representation by an employers' organisation and the trade union movement in order to represent workers' interests based on the social partnership model.  The present Government proposal lacks such a provision.  Our suggestion would improve what has been put forward.<\/p> <p>On another note, there have been issues recently concerning competency in the Irish language.  On particular State boards there have been no individuals with competency in the Irish language, which is something that we should look at as well.  A number of legal issues have arisen recently which pertain to language and people exerting their rights to have their cases, for example, heard through the medium of Irish.  I ask the Minister to clarify if the legislation provides that the board would comprise a number of people who are proficient in the Irish language, which we feel is important in this type of scenario.  We shall consider tabling such an amendment on Report Stage.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#BB02800","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I wish to make an observation on the appointments process.

It is practically the norm nowadays that chairpersons-designate of State boards appear before the appropriate committee for debate and dialogue.  I am not aware of any case in which a committee expressed dissatisfaction with a nominee.  From the point of view of political reform and the work of the average Oireachtas Member, as opposed to Ministers who sit around the Cabinet table, it would be useful to keep the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality engaged in this process through dialogue and discussion with the nominees before their formal appointment.

There is no reason to revisit or reconsider these sections as they are still understood to be a great improvement on the original provisions because they address the issue of independence.  This was widely debated before my time as Minister and important changes were made in the D&aacute;il.  The changes put to rest, as it were, the concerns that had been expressed regarding the actual and perceived independence of the authority from the Government.  A significant number of amendments were tabled on this matter.  We do not want to have any absentee members, although I accept Senator Barrett's point, which I assume refers to international expertise.

Last week, the Oireachtas elected Senator M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill who is not resident in the State.  An incredible record of service has been given to the Seanad by persons from Northern Ireland.  No one has ever stated that they should not be here because they are not resident in the State.  There is no point in making our points in Stormont or extending hands across the Border in friendship if we choose to preclude citizens of Northern Ireland from membership of the proposed new authority on the basis that it may cost too much if a member lived in Newry or elsewhere in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>There are many capable individuals in the law in Northern Ireland and the various reforms introduced there could be of great value to us.  Since the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed, the State is supposed to be on good working terms with Northern Ireland and that is mainly the case.  I believe this proposal is an oversight.  When I think of Gordon Wilson, Martin McAleese, Seamus Mallon and John Robb, all of whom served in the Seanad, and Senator Cahill, a current Member, I wonder how on earth this section was included in the Bill.  I also wonder if it is compatible with European law, given that Ireland is part of a common market in services.  I accept the Minister's point that we want international expertise.

We need expertise but the Bill, as it stands, discriminates against people from Northern Ireland.  I am sure that is not the intention of the Minister or Cabinet.  I also wonder if the proposal is compatible with European Union rules given that we subscribed to the principle of the free movement of people a long time ago.<\/p> <p>Most important, the change I propose would bring a dimension that would be of use to us.

Given the magnitude of the task the Minister has outlined to the House and the sheer volume of the legislation dealing with it, the normal practice of boards should be followed of having a meeting once a month.

This section relates to the staffing of the new legal services regulatory authority.  My amendment No. 28 inserts a new subsection (4) which is intended to clarify the status of the staff of the new body as public servants.  This means they will not be working as civil servants for any Department or office, thereby reflecting the independent nature of the new authority.  My amendment No. 29 inserts a new section relating to the transfer of the staff of the Law Society or Bar Council.  As I said, there has been wide political support, including from the Senator's party and, indeed, all parties on Committee Stage, for finding a suitable way to deal with the very expert and suitably qualified staff of the Law Society and the Bar Council whose public complaints functions are being taken over by the new authority.  We are talking about 18 full-time equivalent posts or thereabouts.<\/p> <p>Under the proposed new section, staff who opt to become staff of the new regulatory authority, under designation by the Minister for Justice and Equality, will enjoy terms and tenure no less favourable than those they currently enjoy, will retain their existing and accumulated pension entitlements, will become public servants and will become, from the date of their appointment, members of the single public servant pension scheme.  The proposed transfer of a discrete number of such staff makes good sense.  The complaints function of the new authority will be at front line of the new body in dealing with the public.  It is essential that the new authority's complaints regime has the capacity to operate effectively from day one while also having its own corporate identity.  Any staff who transfer in accordance with the provisions of this section will work under the independent regulatory authority, to which they will be answerable, and will be made amenable to its ethos as an independent statutory regulator of the legal professions.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is proposing in his amendments Nos. 25 and 27 that staff should be brought in subject to consultation with the professional bodies.  However, it is very important that the new authority, as an independent regulator of the legal professions, would be able to configure its staff to meet its statutory functions and objectives.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendments.  In any event, members of the professional bodies will be included among the membership of the regulatory authority.  In regard to amendment No. 26, I fully appreciate the Senator's wish to find a workable and fair solution in regard to the existing complaints handling functions of the Law Society and the Bar Council.

Will the employees who become fully pensioned civil servants under this section be appointed at general service grades?  Will they be able to transfer out of the authority into other areas, which would rather negate the point of bringing them into the body in the first place?  Will the cost of assuming staff into the State service at elevated points on a payscale and with a consequent elevated pension entitlement not significantly increase the expenditure associated with the establishment of the new regulatory authority?  It seems an inappropriate way to proceed.  Surely the correct method would be to define the role, advertise it and let the best qualified persons apply rather than just taking private staff and making them into fully pensioned civil servants?  The positions should be put out to public competition in order that all relevantly qualified persons may apply.  If it turns out the best people are, in fact, those the Government is proposing to make fully pensioned civil servants, then so be it.

However, we must send the message forth that the spirit of the changes proposed in this legislation must result in the majority of the staff coming from outside the current confines.

Could we also prescribe that the initial staff complement would include at least a majority of people who did not previously work for the other agencies?  While we are not putting a bar on staff from the Law Society of Ireland or the Bar Council applying for posts, for which some of them will be eminently qualified, we should try to ensure a majority of the staff at the new authority would be new.

Education and training is first, followed by subsection (1)(b) on unification.  Subsection (1)(c) deals with the creation of the new profession of conveyancer.  We have discussed the urgency of that provision, given that some studies would indicate there are significant differences in the costs for that service between the United Kingdom and here.  In that context, I suggest that this provision be moved up the list.  My amendment proposes a new subsection (1)(d) which gives the consumer the right of direct access to a barrister other than through a solicitor.

I gather we have a surplus of barristers who are available and have the necessary skills and qualifications.  Why can people not approach them directly?  Would that have a good impact on cost?  That is the purpose of amendment No. 34.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 35 reflects the concern that, as legal services are developing, they are becoming increasingly oligopolistic, dominated by three or four firms.  Senator O'Donovan has referred to that.  It will damage the cost structure of the sector.  It is a matter of increasing worry in respect of the economics of the professions.  I gather that all but one company on the FTSE 100 are audited by the \"big four\" accountants.  The concentration of a small number of legal firms, from three to five depending on how one measures them, should be a matter of concern to the authority as it sees how the sector is developing.  Amendment No. 35 seeks to address this issue.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 36 is one we have discussed already.  It covers the question of whether the work programme can be brought forward, earlier than in two years.  As we have mentioned, the two-year period is specified to deal with the education of the legal profession.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 38 concerns \"reports on the creation of a new professional conveyancer, including the conduct of conveyancing by other professions, the extent of monopolistic provision of legal services in the State and the right of direct access to a barrister\", rather than through a solicitor.  The reference in the amendment to \"other than through a barrister\" is a mistake on my part but what I am trying to say is implicit.  Should the work programme that is envisaged have different priorities after Members of the Seanad and the wider public have expressed their views?  Conveyancing is urgent, as is the right of audience.  I found, in preparing for this debate, that there is concern over the increasingly monopolistic concentration ratio, as mentioned by Senator O'Donovan.  I refer to the dominance of the sector by the big firms.  There is concern in the National Competitiveness Council about the high cost of legal fees.  Can we introduce more competition into conveyancing?  The Minister referred to this earlier.  Can we use the stock of barristers better by allowing people to approach them directly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#GG02000","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>We have already discussed the issue of conveyancing.  I have said to the Senator that I will revert to him on this on Report Stage having examined it.  I take the points the Senator makes.  Obviously, I will have to proceed while taking into consideration the range of other reports requested and the sort of sequencing that exists.  I do not want to swamp a new authority with responsibility for producing many different reviews in a very short period, particularly in the first year.  I will certainly examine the conveyancing issue.  The Senator has made a very strong case in that regard.  Let me see what I can do about it.<\/p> <p>Section 86 of the Bill already provides for direct access to barristers.  As the Senator knows, in non-contentious matters there is statutory provision in this regard for the first time, and that is important.  The creation of the new legal partnerships, which will be up and running in 2016 after the six-monthly report, also deals with the question of access.  There is to be statutory recognition and regulation for the first time of the 100 barristers who operate outside the Bar Council and whose number is probably increasing.  This also deals with that issue of access.  However, we have said the LSRA should carry out a review of this.  That is provided for.  I hope that gives the Senator an idea of the approach we have been taking to this issue.<\/p> <p>That we are now dealing with limited liability is supportive of smaller firms, particularly of solicitors, many of whose practices have actually wanted to merge around the country in order to provide what might be regarded as a more comprehensive service.  The chance of this happening will improve with limited liability, and that will make for more competition and probably a better service and access, or a different service and different form of access than we have at present.

This is the situation where the Law Society under the oversight of the legal services regulatory authority will retain its existing investigative, protective and disciplinary powers in the financial regulation of solicitors under the Solicitors Acts.  The Law Society will continue to oversee implementation of the solicitors' accounts regulations, to carry out routine financial inspections of solicitors, to investigate financial infringements and prosecute them before the newly set up Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal.<\/p> <p>Part 5 of the Bill deals with complaints and discipline.  They relate mainly to procedures, into which I have gone in some detail, to be followed by the authority in dealing with such issues.  Amendment No. 50 inserts a new section 40 which includes various definitions.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 51 is an important provision which specifies what is meant by misconduct by legal practitioners in the context of this legislation.  I did say earlier that an act of omission by a legal practitioner could be considered to be misconduct, of which there is a definition.  The list of reasons has been discussed with the professional bodies and it includes: fraud and dishonesty; breaches of the solicitors Acts; offences under this Bill; inadequate service; excessive costs; the commission of an arrestable offence; behaviour likely to bring the solicitors&rsquo; profession into disrepute; and behaviour likely to bring the barristers&rsquo; profession into disrepute. <\/p> <p>Subsection (2) sets out the manner in which the complaints or disciplinary tribunal established under the Bill or the High Court in considering a matter of excessive costs can determine whether an act or omission should be considered as constituting misconduct.  It is very important, consumer friendly and necessary to have it in the legislation.  We often hear from individuals that certain acts were not carried out or followed through.  The Bill deals with that issue. <\/p> <p>Amendment No. 52 concerns the making of complaints under the Bill.  It defines the three main reasons a person may complain to the authority: the act or omission of the legal practitioner constituted misconduct; the legal services provided by the legal practitioner were inadequate; and the amount of costs sought by the legal practitioner was excessive.  <\/p> <p>Subsection (2) provides that from the commencement of the Bill complaints may be made only to the authority.  That is a major change in regulation.  This gives the authority responsibility for the handling of all complaints against legal practitioners.  <\/p> <p>Subsection (3) makes it clear that where a report or an interim report of an inspector under Part 3 is received by the authority, an officer of the authority may make a complaint in respect of the legal practitioner.  <\/p> <p>Subsection (4) is a key provision which provides that where the Law Society, following an investigation under the solicitors Acts, considers an act or omission of the legal practitioner constitutes misconduct, it must notify the authority.  It has to bring any investigation where this is found to the attention of the authority and give its views on the circumstances such that the matter shall be deemed to be a complaint made by the Law Society.  However, subsection (5) provides that subsection (4) shall not apply where the matter either constitutes a breach of, or is related to, an act or omission which constitutes a breach of the solicitors' accounts regulations.  <\/p> <p>Under subsection (6), the authority is required to notify the Law Society of any complaint received about a solicitor.  That is extremely important. <\/p> <p>Amendment No. 53 inserts a new section 43 which provides guidance on the referral of complaints by the professional bodies to the authority.  It lays out the procedures they are to follow in sending complaints to the new regulatory authority.  The section provides that following commencement of the Part where a client of a barrister makes a complaint to the Bar Council, the Honourable Society of the Kings Inns or the Law Society, it shall be referred to the authority and the client shall be deemed to be the complainant.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 54 is a technical provision on the making of a complaint to the authority, that the period beginning on the making of a complaint to the authority and ending two months after the complaint is determined under this Part shall be disregarded in reckoning any period of time for the purposes of any limitation period in the making of an application for adjudication of a bill of costs under Part 10.  That gives some leeway for the complaint to be considered rather than counting the time from the moment the complaint is made.<\/p> <p>Section 45 provides that where a complaint is withdrawn but the authority considers it to be in the best interests of the public to do so, the authority may proceed or continue to deal with the complaint under this Part.  This is quite important because if there is a public interest issue, even though the complaint is withdrawn, the authority can proceed to deal with it.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 56 is a key provision that gives the authority the power to make regulations regarding the making of a complaint and the procedures to be followed by the authority and the complaints committee in investigating such a complaint.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 57 is a standard provision which relates to fees for the submission of complaints and which provides that the authority may, by regulation and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, prescribe fees for the making of a complaint and circumstances where they may be refunded.  How it handles complaints is dealt with in amendment No. 58.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 59 deals with the point Senator Denis O'Donovan raised about the fact that not all complaints received by the authority will be worthy of further investigation.  This provision gives legislative standing to the principles on the admissibility of complaints received by the authority.  The section lists a number of instances wherein the authority may determine that a complaint is inadmissible such as complaints that are vexatious or without substance or foundation.  There has to be a clear way in law for the authority to deal with such complaints.  Other instances arise where the act or omission to which the complaint relates is the same subject matter of a complaint previously determined under the Bill; the act or omission of a solicitor to which the complaint relates is substantially the same as a complaint previously determined by the High Court or the Law Society; the act or omission of a solicitor to which the complaint relates was the subject of criminal or civil proceedings in which a final determination was made by the court in favour of the solicitor.  The section goes into the detail of the range of situations that will guide the legal services regulatory authority in dealing with a complaint.  The authority may defer consideration of a complaint until a final determination, including any appeal, rehearing or retrial in civil or criminal proceedings, has been made.  I am sure people will see that this makes absolute sense.<\/p> <p>There is a section that allows the independent authority to request the Law Society to investigate any matter relevant to a complaint against a solicitor.  Section 50 permits the authority, the complaints committee or the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal to request, in relation to a complaint against a solicitor, that the Law Society carry out an investigation under the Solicitors Acts into any matter relevant to the complaint.  The section further provides that the Law Society shall comply with the request and within one month of receiving the request furnish the authority with an interim report on the matter, together with an indication of when the final report will be available.  The section makes it clear that any interim or final report of the Law Society shall be admissible in proceedings under this Part.<\/p> <p>I have gone into a lot of detail on this section, but it is very important to be aware of what we are trying to do.  It is a question of oversight and giving confidence to the public that there is a fair and equitable regime in place for complaints and disciplinary issues and that all of the detail has been covered in respect of instances of fraud or dishonesty, breaches of the Solicitors Acts, inadequate service, excessive costs and so forth that can now be dealt with by an independent body.  There is also a role for the Law Society and the Bar Council, but this is an independent body which will deal with these issues.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Obviously, the compensatory fund will remain with the Law Society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#JJ00300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 51:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 52:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 53:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 54:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 55:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 56:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 57:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 58:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 59:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 60:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 61 to 67, inclusive, and 93 are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.

Basically, these are the Parts of the Bill that deal with the range of areas concerning the efforts the authority will make to facilitate resolution of complaints.  For example, amendment No. 61 permits the authority to seek resolution of complaints relating to inadequate service.  Amendment No. 62 allows the authority to consider excessive costs.  The purpose of amendment No. 63 is to set up a mechanism within the regulatory authority to enable a review committee to consider reviews requested by a party to a determination of the authority under sections 51 or 52 and it lays down the membership of that review.  Amendment No. 64 allows the authority the power to offer assistance where it is considered that the conduct of the legal practitioners could constitute misconduct.  In this regard, I note that I may table a further amendment on Report Stage with regard to the definition of misconduct that will apply and perhaps in respect of some related matters.  For the information of Members, I also intend to table some further amendments on Report Stage to deal with the legal issues regarding the precise transition arrangements, new regimes and cut-off dates as to when the new definitions of misconduct, etc., will apply.  I will deal with this on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 66 is about the admissibility of various statements and amendment No. 67 inserts a new section 57, which specifies that the authority shall prepare and publish guidelines on the manner in which the resolution of complaints by informal means may be conducted.<\/p> <p>I stated at the outset of this debate that when it comes to considering complaints, there will be a form of triage system.  In the first instance, one must establish whether the complaint is admissible and I have said quite a bit about that.  Second, there will be a triage system and then there will be the assessment of the complaint.  This may or may not go to the disciplinary tribunal and this section is to describe how the resolution of complaints by informal means will be conducted.  Senator Barrett will appreciate why I cannot accept his proposed amendment No. 93.  As it is set out, it would defeat access to the informal resolution of excessive fee complaints it is intended to make available to the public under the current text of the Bill.  The purpose of the informal complaints track is to provide an alternative to the taxation of costs, as this can be a costly or cumbersome option for members of the public to pursue.  This informal option does not prevent a legal practitioner from being subject to a complaint of misconduct about grossly excessive fees.  I hope that clarifies matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#KK02500","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":391,"content":"<p>As Minister stated, this pertains to setting up the procedure to deal with the costs aspects.

It is a suggestion to the Minister that it may be useful to have a referee present.  Would this prevent prolonged discussions, if the two parties could identify a person who can give them a verdict on this matter and could decide to not use up valuable legal time having debates about it?  It would be great to have a referee who would be available to be frequented, were the parties to so desire, and it is a question of whether to point them in that direction.  I will not press the amendment but that which I have outlined is the idea behind it.

Perhaps this matter should be examined as part of the two-year review, when one will be able to see how many cases were referred, what was the scale involved, whether there was a question of reviews backing up or something similar and whether a new method or more people were needed on the review committee.

Amendment No. 68 is a key provision which obliges the authority to refer a complaint to the complaints committee where it has determined that the complaint is an admissible complaint, and we have already discussed the range of areas where a complaint can be made or where the matter has not been resolved in accordance with the informal procedures.  This amendment deals with the way that will be handled.  The membership of the complaints committee is outlined in detail.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 70<b><\/b>inserts a new section 60 relating to the investigation of complaints referred by the authority to a divisional committee.  It gives details of the exact procedures that must be followed when referring the authority to the divisional committee and the duties of a divisional committee regarding an investigation.  Where the committee considers that the complaint could be resolved under sections 51<b><\/b>or<b><\/b>52, it shall refer the complaint to the authority for further action.  The options available to the divisional committee are spelt out in the legislation also.  There is also a subsection that provides that where the committee considers that the act or omission warrants the imposition of a sanction, it may issue a direction to the legal practitioner to take such measures as the committee considers appropriate.  It goes into all the details of how complaints will be dealt with, the sanctions that can apply, the action that can be taken and the way the committee will work.<\/p><p>There is a list of measures which may be imposed by the committee.  I would bring the attention of Senators to those, a number of which I will read out.  They include a direction to the practitioner to perform or complete the legal service concerned; a direction to arrange for the completion of the legal service; a direction to complete specified modules of continuing professional development, which is looking at the professional development issue; a direction to the practitioner to put aside all fees that were associated with the legal service; a direction to the practitioner to refund all or some of the fees already paid for the legal service; a direction to the practitioner to take any other action in the interest of the complainant; a direction to withdraw or amend an advertisement; a direction to pay a sum not exceeding &euro;5,000 as compensation; a direction to pay to the authority a sum to cover the costs of the investigation; and a direction to pay to the authority an additional sum where the practitioner did not co-operate with the committee.  A range of issues are dealt with in those measures.  There is also the section that deals with appeals to the disciplinary tribunal by legal practitioners against determination of the divisional committee or a sanction imposed by a divisional committee.<\/p><p>Section 63 provides that the authority shall, every six months, which I believe is an appropriate timeframe, publish a report outlining the number and type of complaints received, which is why I said there is transparency in this Bill; the nature and outcome of the complaints; the number of complaints referred to the complaints committee; and the number of those complaints which were determined by the complaints committee, including details on sanctions imposed.<\/p><p>While I appreciate the intentions behind Senator Barrett's amendments, I do not propose to accept them because the number of members and the divisions of the new complaints committee of the Regulatory Authority is intended to facilitate the efficient processing of the thousands of complaints that will come before the Regulatory Authority based on current caseloads.  Halving the committee's membership along the lines proposed would immediately create a backlog about which I would be concerned.  This section goes into detail on how complaints are being dealt with, the responsibilities of various committees, the issues that can be dealt with and the sanctions that can be imposed.  It deals with all the relevant issues around those provisions.  As Senator Barrett can see, this list of issues and sanctions is strong and supportive of consumers who may have concerns about the kind of legal service they have received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#LL00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 68, under the new complaints regime, and I may have misinterpreted the Minister, there will not be 27 people hearing the case.

That is providing for the establishment, in law, of the new legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal.  Unlike the existing disciplinary framework where each legal profession has its own disciplinary tribunal, the new tribunal will deal, from the enactment of the Bill, with the professional conduct of both solicitors and barristers.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 75 inserts a new section 65 into the Bill.  The new section being inserted under this amendment largely replicates the existing section 63 of the Bill.  It increases the threshold of membership and that better reflects the combined workload of the existing tribunals under which each panel of three averages ten meetings per year.  The initially proposed membership of 16 would have been inadequate to deal with the new disciplinary tribunal's anticipated workload and I would have been afraid that that would have led to a backlog of cases.<\/p><p>Another key change made under this amendment is that each division of the disciplinary tribunal shall be not less than three persons.  The existing text of the Bill had provided in addition that each division should not be more than five members.  However, having considered this aspect further, it was decided that for the sake of consistency of procedure and fairness all divisions of the tribunal should be of three persons.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 76 is similar to what was in place previously.  It corresponds to section 64 of the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il and Second Stage of which was passed by the Seanad.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 77 inserts a new section 67 which expands the existing two-line provision in the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il to take account of additional functions - the ones I have outlined - that will now be carried out by the disciplinary tribunal.  These will include, for example, appeals from the regulatory authority or from the Law Society to the tribunal in relation to determinations or sanctions, about which we have just spoken, that the complaints committee might put in place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It will also include appeals by a legal practitioner against a determination or sanction made against him or her by the complaints committee.  For its part, the complaints committee will also be able to refer matters to the disciplinary tribunal where it considers this appropriate.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 78 inserts a new section.  This amendment is necessary to allow for the fact that the legal services regulatory authority and the Law Society will present evidence to the new legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal grounding the contention that there has been misconduct by a legal practitioner.  Whereas the legal services regulatory authority will do so in relation to public complaints, including those where it requests a financial report about a solicitor from the Law Society, the Law Society will do so in relation to matters that have come to its attention in overseeing the solicitor accounts regulations.  They will deal with different elements.<\/p><p>Section 69 is with regard to the regulations that will need to be made for an effectively functioning disciplinary tribunal, with some slight adjustments to allow leeway for parties besides the regulatory authority and the legal practitioner concerned to make submissions to the disciplinary tribunal.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 80 is quite long but is largely the same as its precursor, which is section 69 of the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  It contains a suite of supporting powers which enable the legal services regulatory authority to enforce attendance at its hearings, to compel the discovery under oath or affirmation of documents and to sanction obstructive or unco-operative behaviour, including by imprisonment or fine.  However, there is one new subsection, which enables the Law Society to come within the remit of the disciplinary tribunal in the prosecution of financial infringements which come to its attention under its retained financial regulatory role.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 81 reflects section 69 of the Bill and sets out the steps to be taken by the disciplinary tribunal in holding an inquiry, with regard to how it deals with witnesses, takes evidence and takes advice.  There are new additional provisions in the new version of the section, which cover those cases in which the legal services regulatory authority will make appeals to the tribunal against determinations or sanctions imposed by a division of the complaints committee.  In other words, the additions to the original section 69 now found in section 71 are there to facilitate the new and additional appellate functions of the disciplinary tribunal.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 82 inserts a new section 72 into the Bill.  This reiterates what was in the D&aacute;il in section 70.  It sets out the range of sanctions that can be applied by the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal.  One can see as we go through the Bill that in each case one must describe how each body deals with complaints, the complaints it can handle, the sanctions it can impose and whether there is the possibility of the decisions of one body being appealed by another.  This section examines the role of the disciplinary tribunal which, as I have stated, will take over from the two committees which previously dealt with disciplinary issues.  We will now have one body, namely, the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 83 deals with appeals against a decision of the disciplinary tribunal.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 84 relates to appeals to the High Court, and leaves the menu of sanctions that can be imposed through the High Court to a separate section.  In its new configuration, the section deals with the High Court&rsquo;s ability to hear appeals by persons so entitled under the new section 73, which we have discussed. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 85 provides that where the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal decides to pursue a case for High Court sanction and the legal practitioner takes an appeal against this, the court is first to consider that appeal.

The amendments are a genuine attempt to improve the legislation because we have said that we are very positive about this legislation.  We believe the Minister may need to look once more at the levy.  We wish to raise the concerns of people in the Bar Council in particular that the levy is a fair one and that it reflects the volume of complaints against barristers.  They have also expressed concerns that the levy is too high and could negatively impact on many barristers who are at the earlier stage of their career or who are struggling financially with their practice.  It might affect rural barristers also and those who may work in less lucrative practices.  This is why we tabled our amendment.  It is unfortunate that it has not been taken into consideration but perhaps the Minister might take on board the sentiment which we put forward and she might consider it for Report Stage.

These include legal partnerships which are partnerships between solicitors and barristers or between barristers only and multidisciplinary practices and which allow for the provision of legal and other services by one firm.  As a result of amendment No. 99 and other amendments tabled, the Bill will provide for the introduction of limited liability partnerships in respect of both solicitors partnerships and legal partnerships.<\/p> <p>I will deal with the contextually minor amendments in this grouping before discussing amendment Nos. 100 and 101.  As per amendment No. 102, complaints relating to the proposed business models will be handled by the authority.  Under amendments Nos. 103 and 105, a small fee may be charged by the authority concerning the notification of a legal partnership or a multidisciplinary partnership that is about to commence business.  Obviously, such partnerships will have to have strict indemnity insurance.  A further amendment in this grouping aims to bring the Bill into line with the new personal insolvency culture whereby a person should no longer be prevented from operating within a business environment merely because he or she has entered into a formal debt arrangement.<\/p> <p>I will now deal with amendments Nos. 100 and 101.  The relevant sections currently provide that no professional code which is a code of practice drawn up by a legal professional body such as the Law Society of Ireland or the Bar Council shall prevent a legal practitioner from providing legal services within a legal partnership or a multidisciplinary practice.  Senators will be aware that a legal partnership is a partnership between either solicitors and barristers or between barristers only.  It is a new creature of this Bill which has been prohibited up to now under professional rules.  Multidisciplinary practices are firms that will be able to provide both legal and other services together under one roof.  These are also currently prohibited under professional rules and the Bill provides for their introduction, subject to the outcome of a formal public consultation process under Part 8.  I was advised by the Attorney General that the approach in the Bill, as published, which seeks to directly interfere with the professional codes of the legal professional bodies is at high risk of vulnerability to legal challenge on the grounds of undue interference with the professional bodies' constitutional rights of association.  The original sections would, in effect, dictate to the legal professional bodies who they may include and exclude from their membership and it is this, in particular, that opens up the provisions to the possibility of successful legal challenge.  As it is understood that such a legal challenge is not unlikely and in the interests of achieving the overall goal of the Bill, I am tabling these amendments because these new provisions still provide, as a matter of law, that barristers and solicitors may provide their services through one of the new business models, that is, they will have a statutory right to do so but the provisions have been reworked so as to avoid the risk of undue interference in the legal professional bodies' control over their own membership.  In effect, this will mean that any lawyers who want to work through legal partnerships, multidisciplinary practices or limited liability partnerships or as employees will be able to do so.  It will clearly remain the right of the legal professional bodies to decide whether such lawyers can also become members of their associations, such as, for example, the Law Library.  However, Senators should note that subsection (2) of both revised sections explicitly prevents any legal professional bodies from preventing their own members from doing business with other lawyers who choose to operate within the new business models.  These are very important provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#OO00500","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 84, as amended, stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>On this section and all of those sections relating to multidisciplinary practices, the Minister and I have a difference of opinion from a philosophical point of view.  The amendments that the Opposition has tabled relating to the sections which deal with multidisciplinary practices are based on our opposition to those practices where solicitors, barristers and accountants operate under the same roof and for the same company.  Our understanding is that this model has failed internationally and our fear is that the best and brightest of the legal profession will be secured by the wealthiest companies in society, namely, big businesses and large corporations, to the detriment of the average citizen seeking legal representation.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants a level playing pitch for all citizens and is particularly concerned that those in rural communities will be able to access - through the offices of local solicitors and as is generally the case at present - the services of barristers with the appropriate skills to represent them.  We fear that corporatisation will happen with the multidisciplinary practices and that we will see a centralisation of the most skilled in the area so that when people with less money in their pockets seek top-quality representation, they will find it difficult to access.

That is very consumer-friendly.  Under Part 10 all legal practitioners will be required, under section 123, to issue a notice to clients, written in clear and understandable language, which will set out the legal costs that will be incurred or are likely to be incurred when they take on the work.  That addresses the precise point the Senator made.  Section 123(4) sets out in great detail what the notice must contain.  The purpose of that section is to oblige all legal practitioners to disclose likely costs up front or, where this is not possible due to complexity, to give detailed and meaningful estimates.  The Senator is correct that this matter has frequently been the subject of complaint in the past.

The new Chapter provides for the introduction of an option for solicitors firms and legal partnerships to operate with the benefits of limited liability within a limited liability partnership business model with protection for the consumer in the form of both professional indemnity insurance and ongoing regulatory oversight by the authority.  The amendments include the introduction of an option for both ordinary solicitors' firms and legal partnerships which are partnerships between solicitors and barristers or between barristers only, as provided for under Part 8, to operate with the benefit of limited liability within a limited liability partnership model.  It is proposed to allow such firms, subject to certain safeguards, to limit the personal liability of the individual partners of the firm for its debts, obligations and liabilities.  This is in line with precedent in several other comparable common law jurisdictions in which partnerships have been changed to allow for LLPs.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 126, it should be noted that the LLP provisions are not at this stage being extended to cover multidisciplinary practice provisions.  As it is considered that the business forms which may be assumed by MDPs when they come into being and, in particular, whether they should be able to operate in full as LLPs when some of the professions participating may not be otherwise entitled to avail of such partnerships, is something which should be covered in the research and consultation process.  The specific features of the new regime for LLPs include a system of authorisation and registration subject to appropriate fees through the LSRA of those partnerships that wish to become LLP and the maintenance of a publicly available register of these.  Protection will be provided for the consumer in the form of an obligation on the firms to have substantial professional indemnity insurance.  We discussed the PII earlier.  The authority will have the power to set higher limits for the personal indemnity insurance if it sees fit in respect of the legal firms operating as LLPs as opposed to traditional partnerships.  The authority will be required to maintain a register of limited liability partnerships.  It provides for automatic loss of the shield from personal liability for partners who are found to have committed misconduct or crime in certain circumstances.<\/p> <p>There is a clawback provision where a partner takes money out of the business when its assets exceed its liabilities, ongoing oversight by the legal service regulatory authority with an option to direct compliance and enforce by recourse to the High Court as necessary to enforce compliance.  LLPs will be required to notify clients and creditors upon registration and commencement as an LLP.  In the event of an insolvency of an LLP, the property of the partnership will be available to the creditors.  In addition, there is a new section 113 which outlines the procedures involved in the cessation of operations as a limited liability partnership.  Amendment No. 133 inserts a new section that permits the authority to make regulations on the operation of limited liability partnerships.  <\/p> <p>Amendment No. 134 disapplies section 3 of the Registration of Business Names Act 1963 with regard to partnerships operating in this Bill.  Instead, anyone changing name as such a partner will be covered by the relevant provisions of the Bill.  <\/p> <p>The final amendment in this section makes it clear that although section 27 of the Companies Act 2014 prohibits the use of the description \"limited\" in business names, in certain circumstances under the Bill, the description can be used for limited liability practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#SS00100","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 126:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 127:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":658,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":659,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 128:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":660,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":661,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 129:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":662,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":663,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 130:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":665,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 131:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":666,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":667,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 132:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":668,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 133:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":671,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 134:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":672,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 135:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":674,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Sections 106 to 108, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":676,"content":"<p>SECTION 109<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 136:<\/p><blockquote>In page 89, to delete lines 16 and 17.<\/blockquote> <p>This is something that arose before and Senator O'Donovan has made a suggestion on it.

In the interests of both transparency and fairness, this section places on a statutory footing a committee, consisting of the persons listed in section 145(2), to consider applications for the granting of this title in accordance with a range of balanced criteria.

A key purpose of the amendment is to bring the State into compliance with Article 24 of the EU services directive.  That EU directive requires, in general terms, the elimination of any rules, practices or regulations that are unreasonably restrictive on a lawyer's right to advertise.  The European Commission had expressed a view that some advertising practices in Ireland, particularly those regarding barristers, are too restrictive and had issued a letter of formal notice in October 2014 to the effect that infringement proceedings for a breach of the directive could be taken at any time.  In this context, my Department worked with the Commission, and, later, with our own draftspersons at home, to ensure the new wording of section 158 would bring Ireland&rsquo;s legal services advertising regime up to date and into line with the directive.<\/p><p>The new section begins by providing a general entitlement for legal practitioners to advertise their services, whether as individuals or as lawyers, working within the range of partnerships that will be created by this reforming Bill.  It goes on to provide a regulation-making power for the new authority to make advertising regulations that will be applicable to both solicitors and barristers.  As a matter of common sense, the section provides for some consultation on the making of the regulations with the legal professional bodies or with any other bodies the authority considers appropriate but it is the authority that will have the ultimate say in what the regulations will contain.<\/p><p>Subsection (4) provides, in line with Article 24 of the EU services directive, that the regulations shall not impose any restrictions on the advertisements unless such restrictions are necessary both for the protection of the independence, dignity and integrity of the legal profession and for an overriding reason relating to the public interest.  Any restriction must be both non-discriminatory and proportionate.  These caveats clearly impose a high threshold regarding the imposition of restrictions, so the overall message is clear, namely, that all lawyers will be able to advertise freely and widely and across an unlimited range of media.  This is in line with the Commission and the EU directive.<\/p><p>As a matter of public policy, and given the need to ensure high standards will still prevail, subsection (5)(<i>d<\/i>) sets out that it will not be permitted for lawyers to advertise in a way that, in the opinion of the authority, is in bad taste or materially false, or offers an inducement to any person to make personal injuries claims.  The clause on personal injuries advertising is considered essential for the continued avoidance of the ambulance-chasing culture that is in evidence in some other jurisdictions.  While lawyers will still be able to advertise the fact that they handle personal injuries cases and have an expertise in the area, the prohibition in place since 1994 on specific inducements to make personal injury claims will stand.  In a similar vein, it will remain prohibited to advertise in inappropriate locations such as hospitals, funeral homes and cemeteries.  It will bring us into full compliance with the directive.<\/p><p>A small amendment will be made to the Solicitors Acts on Report Stage to strengthen the existing and necessary prohibition on non-solicitors operating inappropriate, so-called &quot;legal harvesting&quot; websites which can avoid any requirements for accuracy or good taste and refer potential clients on to solicitors, for a referral fee, in full contravention of the Solicitors Acts.  Senators van Turnhout and Heffernan have proposed some amendments to the amendment regarding legal services advertising.  The insertion of the word &quot;regulation&quot; after &quot;professional code&quot; is unnecessary due to the fact that the definition of &quot;professional code&quot; in section 2 of the Bill already comprehends &quot;regulations&quot;.  It would be an unnecessary duplication.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I cannot accept the second amendment, which proposes the deletion of subsection (5) because this is a crucial \"principles and policies\" provision without which the authority's regulation-making power would be utterly without boundaries and without meaning.  The authority must be able to specify what types of advertising are acceptable and Senators will please note that the subsection is prefaced with the word \"may\" as opposed to \"shall\", so it does not mean that the authority will necessarily confine itself in these ways.  In this instance, it is given flexibility.  It will have a menu of criteria from which to draw when drafting the regulations.  Some might think that such advertising should not be restricted in any way at all, but I have sought in the drafting process to maintain a very careful balance between allowing lawyers to advertise completely freely, while maintaining certain balances around what those advertisements contain, which I believe are in the public interest.  We do need to maintain standards.  As I have said, the wording of section 158 has met with the approval of the European Commission.  Governments had not complied with the directive, so there were threatened infringement proceedings, but if we accept this section 158, they will disappear, so I would be very slow to undo the section, given that this section is fully compliant with the European directive and has the agreement of the Commission in that regard.<\/p><p>The switching around of the wording in the third amendment seems to make no difference in the intended meaning, so I do not think it is necessary.  On the final amendment, the definition of \"inappropriate location\" has long been on the statute book without controversy and it gives clarity to the overall intention to maintain certain standards in advertising.  It has long been public policy not to allow lawyers to engage in \"ambulance chasing\" or to prey upon distressed or bereaved persons in order to gain work and I see no good reason for that to change now or for standards to drop in that regard.  I hope I have addressed the various relevant points regarding whether 158 meets the directive and why I do not believe the amendments being proposed are necessary, because most are already comprehended within the existing definitions, and, in the case of the final one, the definition of \"inappropriate location\" has long been on the statute book and has not given rise to any particular problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#UU02700","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":761,"content":"<p>On the section, Senator van Turnhout was very <i>au fait <\/i>with many of the deliberations involved and asked me to give her some cover in the Chamber today as she is unable to attend for various reasons.  On section 158, I am glad the Minister has clarified that it was under direct threat from the European Commission.  I was a little concerned about whether fines had been issued but she has clarified that is not the case.<\/p><p>On section 158(5), Senator van Turnhout has asked me to put it on the record that she feels this subsection should be deleted as it serves no justifiable purpose that section 158(2) does not already cover.  Section 158(2) provides for the only permissible purposes under the services directive that restrictions can be put on advertising.  All the extra specifications in subsection (5) will leave the State open to enforcement and litigation.  They also illegally restrict competition for legal services to the detriment of customers and the competitive market.  I have been asked to put this on the record and I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV00200","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 153, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":763,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 153 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":764,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 153:<\/p><blockquote>In section 158(8)(b), to delete &ldquo;electronic address or any information provided by the legal practitioner that is accessible electronically&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any advertisement provided by the legal practitioner that is accessible electronically&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>On that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV00500","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":765,"content":"<p>We have discussed them already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":766,"content":"<p>Has it been discussed already?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV00700","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":767,"content":"<p>Yes, they are all discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV00800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":768,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV00900","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":769,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 153 being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV01000","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":770,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV01100","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":771,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 153, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":772,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 153 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":773,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 153 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":774,"content":"<p>Section 158 deleted<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":775,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":776,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 154:<\/p><p>&ldquo;PART 14\r\n\r\nAmendments to Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2008<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":778,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 155:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":779,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":780,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 156:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":781,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":782,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 157:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":783,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":784,"content":"<p>Schedules 1 to 3, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":785,"content":"<p>Is it possible for me to make a number of points on some of the points that emerged for Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV03000","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":786,"content":"<p>The Minister can do it after the next part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111900002#VV03100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":787,"content":"<p>TITLE<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447929000,"counter":788,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That the Title be the Title to the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447929000,"counter":789,"content":"<p>I wanted to make a point in respect of a number of amendments that I want to bring on Report Stage.  We have discussed some of them today.  Some relate to pre-action protocols in clinical negligence cases and some transitional provisions which we discussed earlier.  There is also an amendment to update the protected disclosure section of the Bill in light of the Protected Disclosures Act of 2014 with some cross-references and to provide for some repeals and amendments to the solicitors Act.  Quite a number have been suggested by various Senators, including one in respect of non-residence in the State and the inconsistencies between sections 17 and 19.  There is a question here on the disclosure of information by the authority and its interchange with the principle of legal privilege.<\/p> <p>An amendment may be inserted to require consultation with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission by the authority when it is conducting the review and to give clarity around the timeline policy for the administration of complaints, which continues to be three years as a matter of policy.  Another amendment may clarify how appeals from claim amounts on the compensation fund will be handled and there may be a reference for information to be passed to the Chief Justice if and when a barrister is struck down from the role of practising barrister due to serious misconduct.  Another amendment will ensure the authority proves in regard to its resolution of complaints regarding excessive fees.  There may be an amendment to section 153 to make a small distinction between solicitors and barristers to take account of their slightly different roles, as well as an amendment to the definition of \"practising barrister\" to ensure all barristers, like solicitors, have to complete a period of apprenticeship before offering legal services to the public.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some improvements may be required to clarify Part 5, the complaints section, in regard to timeframes and there may be more consequences for Parts 9 and 10.
