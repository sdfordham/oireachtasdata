The main aim of the document is to ask member states to develop and implement reforms based on the specific challenges identified in their education and training systems by the European Union&rsquo;s growth and jobs strategy - Europe 2020.<\/p><p>  The fourth item of business at Council will be the adoption of Council recommendations on the validation of non-formal and informal learning.  This recommendation invites member states to establish validation systems for non-formal or informal learning with the aim of recognising the full range of an individual&rsquo;s knowledge, skills and competences, that is those acquired not only at school, university or other education and training institutions but also outside the formal system.  The recommendation invites member states to establish validation systems linked to the European qualifications framework by 2015, with the possibility of obtaining a full or partial qualification on the basis of non-formal or informal learning.<\/p><p>  The fifth item of business at Council will be a policy debate on improving teacher quality and status.  This discussion is particularly timely in two respects; the first being the current reforms taking place in teacher education in this country and; second, the fact that teacher education will be an area of focus during the Irish Presidency.  The contribution to the debate will focus on these two areas.<\/p><p>  I will make a presentation to Council on the priorities of the Irish Presidency.  These have been outlined in the briefing note which my officials have supplied to the committee.  It is customary  for the incoming Presidency to update Council colleagues on what they plan to achieve during their Presidency term.  I will now outline our priorities for the forthcoming Irish Presidency, starting in January.<\/p><p>  Ensuring sustainable growth and jobs will be the main overall theme of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency.  Education and training have a key role to play in the achievement of this main Presidency theme and in tackling and resolving the current unemployment crisis across Europe.  The central importance of education and training to economic recovery is recognised in the Europe 2020 strategy.  One of the five headline targets in the strategy relates to education and training.  Quality and equity are the two core themes around which we have decided to focus all of the activities of the education and training dimension of our Presidency.  Intensive preparations on our programme and calendar of events have been under way for some time.<\/p><p>  On the legislative side during the Presidency the two main themes on our agenda will be the following: the first is the Erasmus for All programme, about which I have already spoken and the second is a new directive on the recognition of professional qualifications within the European Union.  We have set the objective of obtaining a first reading agreement with the European Parliament on the regulation establishing Erasmus for All.  Achieving agreement on the programme is a key task of the education and training agenda and has been the focus of discussion at three Presidencies to date.<\/p><p>  The second priority for us will be the directive on professional qualifications.  I will also give priority to obtaining early agreement with the European Parliament on a new directive to amend the 2005 directive on the recognition of professional qualifications.  The modernisation of the directive is one of the levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence, which were set out in the Single Market Act 2011.  It is therefore a priority for the Council, Commission and the European Parliament.  The directive sets out the procedures which must be adhered to by competent authorities when recognising the qualifications of professionals migrating from other EU member states.<\/p><p>  In addition to the legislative agenda we will give priority to advancing EU level co-operation on a number of key topics, in particular the wider skills agenda, teacher education, higher education and the ongoing implementation of national qualifications frameworks and the European qualifications framework itself.  The Department has full responsibility at national level for both education and skills agendas.  Hence, we consider we are very well placed to contribute to consolidating the thinking at EU level across the full range of education and training stakeholders.  In this regard we intend to continue the process of integrating education and training into the Europe 2020 process for ensuring growth and jobs to a greater extent.  An upcoming flagship Commission communication on rethinking education will inform our consideration of the skills issue and, subject to the timing of its publication, I envisage the adoption of Council conclusions responding to it at the February education Council.  Under the Copenhagen process for enhanced co-operation in vocational education and training, the assigned semester theme for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency is quality assurance and a meeting of directors general of vocational education and training will progress this agenda item.<\/p><p>  I wish to make the following point on teacher education, namely, high quality teaching is vital to achieving better student outcomes.  This conclusion has been shared by multiple researches in various situations across the world.  The Irish Presidency will propose the adoption of Council conclusions on improving policy support for the teaching education profession as well as holding a linked conference on the role of teacher educators.  The conference is being organised in this country by the Teaching Council.  We will also hold a Presidency conference organised by the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate on improving assessment and evaluation for better learning and school systems.  In line with the overall Presidency theme of quality, the conference will reflect upon and respond to the recent work of the Commission on assessment of key competences in schools and that of the OECD on evaluation and assessment frameworks for improving school outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400004#D01100","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352899500,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I will start with the spokespersons.

As is the case with many Departments there are some issues in education on which we must work together at European level and one of those is the funding for the Erasmus programme.  I welcome that that will be increased in the coming period because with our economies integrating and our markets mutually dependent it is crucial that we ensure there is good interaction at an educational level with universities in other countries and movement among students during their education.<\/p><p>  Regarding the Presidency, the Minister outlined some of the meetings that will take place and the initiatives on which he will be working.  Are there two or three key objectives he would like to achieve by the time the Presidency moves on from us in the middle of next year?  He might outline that.

That is appropriate given that we are awaiting a report on the future of higher education.

He spoke about the Erasmus for All programme and I think he said there were funds of &euro;19.1 billion across Europe for the Union programme for education, training, youth and sport.  That is very positive.  The Minister might indicate how much Ireland will get of that funding and what he will prioritise.  I ask that question because we had a Nobel laureate economist, Professor Pissarides, in the Seanad last week who said that in a recession Ireland should not pull back from education and training.  He further stated that it should priorities short courses in particular, which is what we are doing, to make people more market ready.  As the Minister is aware, we can have the typical arts or science degree but without a specialism the person may not be market ready or employable.  To where will the Minister direct that money in addition to what we are doing currently and who can draw down those funds?<\/p><p>  It was interesting to hear that 4,000 out of 15,000 of the world's universities are located within Europe.  Deputy McConalogue asked the Minister what he hoped to achieve at the end of our six-month Presidency.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of this but there is no university in Europe, including here, that has a smoke free campus.  The campuses of 744 universities in America are smoke free.  I understand there is a willingness on behalf of universities here in terms of health promotion and student health and well-being to pursue that.  Is that something the Minister would examine during this Presidency?  It is an opportunity for Ireland to give leadership on this issue, and it is not too difficult to achieve.  Ash Ireland is very keen to see it happen.  Is that something the Minister would look to achieving?  I believe smoke free campuses would be well worthwhile.<\/p><p>  The Minister also mentioned the teacher education focus.  I welcome the focus on quality of outcomes, but how will that happen?  What does the Minister expect to achieve at the end of our Presidency in that regard?<\/p><p>  In terms of teacher education outcomes, is the Minister focusing on any particular area?  Will it be science or IT education?  What teacher education outcomes in particular will we focus on during the Presidency?<\/p><p>  I am pleased to hear about the validation of formal and informal learning as a priority of the Presidency.  How will that work here?  Is that to do with our qualifications framework?  What is the Minister talking about in that regard?  It is useful that we validate forms of learning that take place in Foroige clubs, for example, because they often reach the children in ways that schools cannot do and if that was validated it would give a new status to those informal learning settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400005#E00500","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1352899500,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I am glad there is such a spotlight on education as part of our Presidency and that it will be at the heart of the EU's 2020 strategy.  That is crucial, particularly in the context of tackling issues such as mobility, youth unemployment and issues in which there is a great deal of value added at the European level.  We must have our own strategies, as must other states, but there can be a huge amount of value added when European countries work together.<\/p><p>  I have two questions, one of which is on the Erasmus programme.  I join my colleagues in welcoming the increase in the budget but my concern is the way we ensure that Irish students avail of it.  That is the key issue for me because we have always had poor participation rates in Erasmus compared to other EU states.  As part of the Irish Presidency to what extent does the Minister have an action plan to increase Irish participation in Erasmus?  What does he see as the major obstacles to greater Irish participation?  How does he plan to advance that as part of the discussions with his colleagues?  A bigger budget is welcome but if it is a bigger budget for everybody else it does not necessarily give us the payback we want here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400005#E00600","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352900100,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Let us consider issue 5 on the agenda for the Council meeting of 26 November, namely, improving teacher quality and status at a time of scarce resources.

In the 1980s and 1990s, ESF funding was very important to our development.  There are a considerable number of ESF-funded courses that predated free fees.  Can we get this kind of funding again?  It would obviously help with our third level funding issue.

If I miss any, I ask to be reminded of them.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy McConalogue&rsquo;s opening question on funding for Erasmus for All, the money is due to double in real terms over seven years. In the past seven years, there have been approximately 18,000 Irish students participating in the programme abroad.  However, this is only half the number of foreign students coming to Ireland, which is regrettable.  We are going to try to obtain more information on all the factors surrounding this.  We hope to have a postgraduate student who has gone through the Erasmus programme talk to second level students on the programme's benefits.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy McConalogue's second question, it is important to recognise that a good Presidency &ndash; the upcoming one will be Ireland&rsquo;s seventh since joining the Union in January 1973 &ndash; is one that gets the business of the Union done efficiently and effectively and which advances the collective decision-making that has already taken place.  In the main, Presidencies from larger countries tend to have a double agenda - a national agenda and an overall European presidential agenda, usually in that order.  Ireland has been known for running successful Presidencies.  It is expected right across the board that our upcoming one will be successful also.  Having been in Brussels last week, I noted the expectation is perhaps higher than might be warranted.  It is like expecting Donegal to win the all-Ireland two years in a row.  One might aspire to it but it may not be easy to achieve.<\/p><p>  The second point that is important to recognise, and which has only begun to sink in among many in the permanent governments of all member states, is that the European Parliament now has co-decision-making powers along with the Council of Ministers.  It is no longer the rubber stamp it once was.  For example, the European Parliament will have the power to reject the next Commission after the European elections in June 2014.  Mr. Pat Cox, when President of the European Parliament, threatened to veto the appointment of a new Commission unless one of the candidates, whom I believe was proposed by the Italians, was replaced by another because of questions over his suitability for the role to which he was to be assigned.  In referring to the permanent government, I mean no disrespect to my colleagues who are present.  Many commentators do not realise that, as with every Parliament in the world, the European Parliament has grown by acquiring an increasing number of powers, to the point that it is now engaged in co-decision-making.<\/p><p>  As a politician and parliamentarian, my job is to get through the two items of legislation.  I refer to the new Erasmus for All programme, which encompasses a number of other programmes.  The relevant authorities have used the brand name of Erasmus in the creation of Erasmus for All.  It will be critical to get it through the Parliament.  There is considerable work to be done in regard to it.  It would be a good day's work for Ireland to have it put in place on behalf of the Union given that the programme will run for the next seven years.<\/p><p>  The Parliament has a key role to play in respect of the second item of legislation.  I met the rapporteur of the relevant committee and the chairperson of that committee, Mr. Malcolm Harbour, during my visit last week.  The meetings were designed specifically to tee up the relationship between Ireland&rsquo;s upcoming Presidency and the Members of Parliament, in particular.   Both meetings were followed by a lunch for the Irish Members, from all the various parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in from Northern Ireland, with a view to outlining our agendas.  We received many indications of help, support and co-operation.<\/p><p>  The second issue, which we discussed briefly, concerned professional qualifications.<\/p><p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked about the multi-ranking issue and the question of regional clusters.  Universities, for a variety of reasons, are now subject to a ranking system that is arbitrary and biased and does not measure the full effect of what is happening therein.  The Shanghai index, which is the one most known to many of us, was basically constructed within the People's Republic of China to consider the deficit in the third level education system measured against that of the United States.  The objective was to set a standard to which China could aspire by way of ranking various universities.  Other indices have emerged, including the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, which has appeared in various forms.  There are now three or four indices that rank universities.  They are very significant, just as a tourist guide is for a tourist visiting a particular location, but one cannot take every tourist guide ranking system at face value.  Of the top 100 universities in the QS ranking system, 29 are North American, 19 are British, and eight or nine are from the Commonwealth or the British English Anglo-Saxon sphere.  The rankings are biased because those concerned use selection criteria on the basis of which they know they will emerge stronger at the other end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400006#F00500","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352900700,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Will other new measures be taken?  I wish to follow through on this issue, if possible.  It is useful that the percentage of finishers in respect of the JobBridge programme stands at 52%.  However, many of them are not continuing and while there may have been 10,000 starters, this does not mean there were 5,000 finishers.  What other new initiatives of that nature are being considered?  For example, the same Nobel laureate did not really recommend the youth guarantee programme being considered by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  He felt it was too expensive in the first instance and, second, that simply giving people a four-month employment or training opportunity in this environment is not adequate, given our long-term unemployment problem.  I believe this Erasmus for All proposal constitutes a wonderful opportunity if we can get more out of it.

They do not always work to the full extent to which they were designed and on entering such a programme, some participants find it really were not for them.  The Senator, as a professional educationalist, will be aware of such matters with regard to people starting a course and then finding it does not necessarily give them what it is they had hoped to get.  I am reluctant to state how much money Ireland will get in this regard because while the aspiration is to increase it by a significant amount, it is subject to the overall multi-annual financial frameworks agreement, which is far from clear at present.  At the last Council meeting, Prime Minister Cameron indicated his opposition to any increase in the budget and indeed, he seeks to have the budget reduced.  Moreover, the House of Commons recently voted to take a position on the budget which will strengthen his hand in negotiations.  A four-day meeting has been scheduled for later this month.  Recently, the Taoiseach indicated that if a four-day meeting is intended and is being prepared for but if the British position is they intend to veto it anyway - the budget requires unanimity - then there is not much point in going to the meeting in the first instance.  We are in an extremely volatile political space.  For example, if no agreement is reached on the budget, a default mechanism within the European institutions will take effect whereby the budget as it currently stands will roll over on an annual basis without any adjustment.  In other words, the existing budget will roll over.  While it is akin to stopping the clock, the money will be provided.

Following recommendations from an international review group, called Initial Teacher Education, we have decided to implement a recommendation on the rationalisation of teacher education provision.  That is on top of a decision made on implementing the literacy and numeracy strategy, whereby Irish primary school teachers would now have an educational period of four years rather than three.  Those four integrated years would focus on acquiring pedagogic skills, rather than getting half courses as quasi university arts courses.  There has been an academic drift in terms of course provision to bring colleges historically out of the teacher training space into a university space.  This saw a migration within the curriculum towards a third-level arts degree of a generic kind, rather than an educational qualification with the focus on pedagogical skills.<\/p><p>  As I said earlier, the quality of teacher training and teachers is universally accepted as being the key to great outcomes.  So the period will be for four years with the focus on pedagogical skills and two years for the H.Dip. at second level, again with the focus on pedagogical skills.  There will probably be a change in the way that secondary school teachers typically evolved whereby they were in a school and went to the local university.  Let us say it was St. Joseph's College in Galway, known as \"the Bish\"; they are well regarded within the school, go into university, which is the other side of the cathedral in Galway, do three or four years there, come back to \"the Bish\" to do their H.Dip. and end up being a secondary school teacher in the same space.  From cradle to grave, therefore, that is their educational experience.  Some of them turn out to be wonderful teachers, do not misunderstand me, but they do not necessarily have a wider life experience.  It means that they are not necessarily equipped to teach in other teaching environments.<\/p><p>  It would be my objective - and we are still in the process of evolving this - to ensure that in order for teachers, particularly at second level, to be qualified and have experience in their training and apprenticeship period before becoming permanent, they would have taught in the free voluntary VEC sector and possibly in some areas of further education as well.  In that way, they would have a range for dealing with a wider community. <\/p><p>  I am not sure what we have got from special educational needs assistants.  We are conducting research within the Irish situation to see how effective special educational needs assistants are.  In theory, special needs assistants should work effectively to make themselves redundant.  However, a dependency situation arises.  While the recipient of the special needs assistant may become independent in terms of toilet training, other manifestations of dependency may emerge.  In some cases, there is a problem at the end of primary school if they have developed such a personal relationship with the SNA - and this has been communicated to me in individual cases - that the SNA should stay with them going into second level.  While that is extremely understandable for an individual case, and very emotionally charged, it is not what the SNA was designed to be in the first instance.  A new kind of need has expressed itself in that regard.  The NCSE is doing some research in this area and I will come back to the committee about the Irish experience.  Deputy Harris also suggested that we examine what other countries are experiencing in that area.  I am informed that the bi-annual meeting of the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education will take place here in mid-May 2013, although the venue has yet to be confirmed.  That will be an opportunity to share best experience and best practice.<\/p><p>  I think I have covered everything, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400008#H01700","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1352901300,"counter":64,"content":"<p>No.  The Minister may have answered my question when I was out of the room, as I had to go next door for a quorum.

As the committee can see, one of the slides shows that D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g council conducted a survey in 2009 about relationships and sexuality education.  In 2009, 74% of students did not receive any sexual education at all and only 26% of students in the senior cycle did.  The graph shows: 63% of students never received relationships and sexual education within senior cycle at school; 19% received it once a week; 8% received it every few months; 7% received it more once a week: 2% received it once every two weeks; and 1% received it once a month.<\/p><p>  In 2007, the then Department of Education and Science conducted a study on relationships and sexuality education implementation.  These are merely a few statistics showing the reasons, according to teachers and principals, it is difficult to teach the curriculum.  Some 82% of teachers and principals stated that, because the curriculum is overcrowded, they do not get to the whole curriculum in the year.  Some 71% of them found it uncomfortable to talk about sexual education in a class and, therefore, did not teach it.  Some 67% of teachers and principals state that there is too much pressure on examination years and, therefore, this subject is left behind.<\/p><p>  Comhairle na n&Oacute;g also conducted a survey in Donegal in 2011.  This is the most recent survey conducted by Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  I pick Donegal specifically because its Comhairle na n&Oacute;g has been coming back year in, year out in trying to help sexual education in schools.  Many surveys have been done around Ireland but this is the one that I decided to speak about today.  Donegal Comhairle na n&Oacute;g came back with the following information.  There is gender segregation in schools.  Certain schools will only teach girls or will only teach boys relationships and sexual education, they split up classes and divide students up in this teaching.  It has shown that topics depend on the teacher's preference, and not on the health of the students.  Also, LGBT issues are rarely ever addressed in schools.  Mainly because of these problems, children then must find information for themselves on television, on the Internet, in the media and from their peers who give them inaccurate information on sexual education.  As the committee can see, it has led - we do not have any concrete evidence on this - to the rise of teen pregnancies in Ireland.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for listening and I will now hand over to Mr. McCarrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400010#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Davina Clancy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352902200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I am a member of the national executive.  I am here today representing the constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown's Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and to speak to the committee about mental health.  Mental health is a vast and complex issue, but there is much that can be discussed.  This year 14 comhairl&iacute; are dealing with topics relating to mental health.  It is important to all comhairl&iacute; across the country, from Donegal to Dublin, from Cork to Carlow, or Louth to Leitrim.  It is being discussed all the time.  We see through the work of the AGMs that this issue is being brought up consistently and that many comhairl&iacute; are doing work to combat this.  It is not isolated to these counties of the 14 comhairl&iacute; which are working on it.  It is coming up in most comhairl&iacute;.  Some comhairl&iacute; choose not to work on it because it is difficult to get concrete achievements in this regard.<\/p><p>  The issues that continuously come up at comhairl&iacute; in this area are the lack of mental health services and the lack of awareness among teenagers about mental health services.  There are some good resources available, such as Jigsaw, Reach Out, Headstrong, For&oacute;ige and the HSE, but we found that often young people are not aware of do not know how to access these resources at all.<\/p><p>  There is a need for schools to provide information on mental health services.  The schools can implement this in counselling services, in anti-bullying policies and by raising the profile of existing services.  Schools can do a great deal to improve mental health by improving anti-bullying policy.  They can tackle the issue there.  By having someone to talk to, they can help boost positive mental health.  In the curriculum, such as SPHE or RSE, much can be done on mental health to have someone to talk to.<\/p><p>  On mental health services, the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national executive met Mr. Martin Rogan, HSE assistant national director for mental health.  I also got the chance to meet him at the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g showcase last week.  He stated that the mental health services are under a great deal of pressure, that there have been staff reductions of 16% but that human contact is very important in solving mental health, and that the services are there but it is really an issue of awareness.  After our meeting with him, it was clear that there are mental health services for young people available but many do not know about them or how to access them.<\/p><p>  Comhairl&iacute; across the country have done much work to combat this.  There are many different innovative and effective projects that Comhairle na n&Oacute;g has undertaken to promote positive mental health.  Louth Comhairle na n&Oacute;g has developed an app about coping with mental health issues and promoting positive mental health generally.  A number of comhairl&iacute; have also produced mental health videos, for example, Waterford Comhairle na n&Oacute;g which produced \"Mind Matters\", in which they interviewed celebrities, psychiatrists and young people about mental health.  One can read about all the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g mental health initiatives in the national showcase programme.<\/p><p>  There is a certain stigma towards mental health.  When one things of mental health one thinks of mental illness or depression, and much can be done to improve this.  We need to talk to someone and reduce the stigma towards mental health and the comhairl&iacute; have done much work on reducing depression and anxiety in dealing with these, and about body image and feeling positive about oneself and one's own mental health.<\/p><p>  We are here today to represent the work that these comhairl&iacute; have done.  It is certainly not isolated to these comhairl&iacute;.  Much can be done by teachers and in schools.  Much progress has been made in recent times and we do a great deal in the future.  Progress can still be made.  Far too many children are being bullied in school and committing suicide.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee and pass over to Ms Donnelly who will speak about the solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conn McCarrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352902200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I represent Mayo Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  First, I want to repeat that the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national executive has a youth representative from every county and city authority and the feedback we are getting is coming from young people the length and  breadth of the country.<\/p><p>  What we have found is that many secondary schools are experiencing a very low standard of RSE and SPHE.  Young people really need a consistent RSE and SPHE curriculum, one that will be the same in every secondary school.  A standard needs to be met.  The only way that this can be achieved is if SPHE teacher training becomes mandatory because we need competent teachers.  As the committee can see from the Department's study, many teachers do not teach RSE because they themselves do not feel comfortable with it.  The only way one will combat that is if one trains them up and makes it so that they are comfortable in teaching young people RSE and SPHE.<\/p><p>  The teaching of RSE and SPHE links in considerably with mental health as well.  Schools can play a major role in providing information for young people about services.  If there is an adult or teacher in every school, he or she can point a young person who is having a problem in the direction of help even if the adult or teacher cannot help the student within the school.<\/p><p>  I hope that our presentation today has let the committee know a little about the work the comhairl&iacute; are doing around the country.  We also wanted to bring to the committee's attention how important these issues are to young people.  We encourage the committee members to contact the comhairl&iacute; in their constituencies, learn about what kind of work they are doing and, hopefully, help them in their projects on these issues.  We also ask the committee members to take into consideration the opinion of young people in every decision they make.  We invite them to our national executive meetings.  If they want to talk to us about any issues or anything that they are discussing within the committee, we would ask them to do so.  We would be happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400010#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1352902200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I say, \"Well done\", to everybody for the presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400010#K00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1352902200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g for coming in and for their presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400010#K00500","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352902800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from Comhairle na n&Oacute;g for their presentation.

It is certainly not easy to make presentations and it took us a long time to be able to speak publicly.  I know exactly what they are going through.<\/p><p>  I agree with Senator Power on the importance of the sex education programme.  I am disappointed to hear that some teachers are unable to deliver the programme.  I presume it is a sensitive subject for people<\/p><p>  My son is a GP and he recently opened a practice in Killarney.  He offered consultations to secondary students for &euro;25 because he knows people are becoming sexually active at that stage and need to discuss matters with medical professionals.  This initiative has been very successful.  Perhaps GPs around the country could try similar initiatives.  He has also seen a number of female patients who do not seem to find it a barrier to speak to a man.  GPs might consider offering a supplementary service to that provided by teachers.<\/p><p>  Youth mental health is an important issue.  A Jigsaw pilot programme in County Kerry is now closed but I am glad to note that it is reopening in January.  Like Senator Power, unfortunately I will have to leave the meeting shortly to discuss similar matters.  Youth suicide rates in County Kerry are 50% above the national average.  Many of the individuals involved were very young.  After a suicide occurs there are often comments on Facebook about the individual concerned.  There is a danger of glorifying suicide by describing the deceased as a great boy or girl.  Do the witnesses think it morbid that people would leave messages for someone who died in tragic circumstances? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111400011#L00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1352902800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I know a bit about Dail na n&Oacute;g because I was a member of the first D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g for County Wicklow before a Comhairle na n&Oacute;g had been established.

The delegate report indicates that efforts are ongoing to make the process work more effectively and demand more from it, which is welcome.  I have spoken to a number of individuals who have been involved in Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g.  They desire to be listened to rather than dealt with by Departments as a mere box ticking exercise.  The witnesses have proven to us that they are delivering on their agenda.  I thank them for their choice of topics for this discussion.  Young people tend to deal with issues that relate solely to our own narrow lives, such as third level fees, but they have chosen wider societal topics.<\/p><p>  It is astonishing and unacceptable that 71% of teachers in 21st century have told a survey by the Department of Education and Skills that they do not feel comfortable teaching RSE.  If there is insufficient confidence on the part of teachers to engage with their students, we have a real problem.  We can develop all the wonderful policy documents we like but if there is reluctance in the classroom to deliver the programme we will have to pursue the issue with the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p><p>  The Oireachtas has established a cross-party group on mental health.

I used to teach teenagers and I was used to more traditional forms of bullying before the days of mobile telephones, Facebook and so on.  I was struck when we had the first case of bullying by text and modern social media that it was much worse than traditional bullying.  The individual set everything up at home among class mates such that when they went to school the following day, no one would speak to a particular student.  It has an horrific on the individual affected.  What is the best way to tackle that form of bullying?<\/p><p>  What are the delegation's thoughts on reducing the voting age?

They had a successful showcase earlier this month in Croke Park, which was attended by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g delegates from all over the country.  I congratulate them on this work and on the issue they highlighted there.  They need to be careful about what Deputy Harris said and look at what happened him.  He is a fine public representatives and judging by their contributions, the representatives have bright futures.<\/p><p>  The two issues raised were mental health and social, political and sexual health education.  We have a long way to go to ensuring the way we deal with both issues in our education system is appropriate to the needs of students.  As Senator Power outlined earlier, my party has put together a mental health document and we would be interested in Comhairle na n&Oacute;g's response to that.  The challenges facing young people have evolved rapidly in recent years and our education system has not responded as appropriately as it should have.  A great deal of work needs to be done.  Mental health is the greatest health concern of young people and the way we handle it leaves a great deal to be desired.<\/p><p>  There are gaps in the system in the context of social, political and sexual health education.  Our education system teaches students academically but it does not equip young people with many of the wider skills needed for life.  We fall down on that and we should focus on ensuring when people go through the school system, they have an opportunity to learn about all aspects of life and are equipped for the wider world.  English, Irish, mathematics and so on are obviously important but it needs to be ensured pupils get a rounded education.  I very much look forward to working with the representatives.

These are two important issues.  With regard to religion and sexual health education, very often when something is put in place, everybody says the job is done and everything is okay.  It is good for us to receive the information Comhairle na n&Oacute;g has provided in this regard, for example, that the delivery of RSE is not good on the ground.  This is partially related to our development as a country and the Catholic influence and so on.  The practice of religion in the country influences all parts of our life, including education but, at the same time, young people in countries with a much more liberal view about sexual education wait longer to have sexual relationships and make much more mature and informed decisions.  If anything, our conservative background is working against us in practice and, for example, as Ms Clancy mentioned, Ireland has a higher rate of teenage pregnancy.<\/p><p>  Questions have been asked about what can be done to address mental health issues in the curriculum.  Initiatives have been implemented in other countries in this regard.  There is an issue about trying to give people positive mental health skills and whether people should have time to reflect, whether mindfulness should be taught and how we deal with stress, anxiety and so on.<\/p><p>  Senator Power suggested that the committee should send our complete schedule.

A few weeks ago I read many newspaper articles about a particular suicide, but not one of those articles included helpline details for any young person reading them.

The way to deal with it is to equip people with the level of self-confidence and self-respect required to deflect it so if anyone attempts to bully them it will not affect them.  I feel strongly about this because our education system does nothing to promote self-confidence in young people and places a massive emphasis on academic development over social development, which is wrong and crazy.

During the debate on the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, I raised the point that the Oireachtas has the final say on approving or rejecting the budget produced by the Government.  There is a responsibility on the Government to have an assessment of the budget's impact and its social and economic cost to the citizens.  The same obligation does not exist within the Commission.  The problem is that we have the implementation of a one-size-fits-all fiscal rule across Europe, regardless of whether the jacket fits.

At that point, the original text as proposed by the Commission only had the independent body option.  In the first reading, Ireland, together with several other member states, managed to convince the Council that this was a bit restrictive, and the text adopted by the Council states \"independently produced or endorsed\".  There was a concern that should an independent body produce, for example, a very optimistic forecast, this would put us in a difficult position in which we would be required to base our budgetary forecasts on what we viewed as an over-optimistic macroeconomic forecast, with consequent effects on revenue.  We continually raised this issue with the Commission, making the point that such a forecast might even be in conflict with its own forecasts for the Irish economy.  It recognised that this might happen and suggested there would be a logical iterative process between bodies, so whether one took the independent body route or the endorsed route, the Department would be able to cope.  The object is to take away what it sees as the danger that existed in the past whereby member states, for whatever reason, adopted what it viewed as unrealistic forecasts.

Deputy Doherty referred to the tension there might be between the Department, endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, and an outside agency on growth forecasts.  Is it possible that we could get an transparent outline framework of the model assumptions for growth?  It is an area that resembles a blizzard.  We are told what the Department's growth forecasts are but no one has an idea of the outline framework of the model used to produce them.  The ingredients for arriving at the forecasts are presumably the same.  They are the measurable elements of economic activity, but they go into a framework of modelling that will produce different outputs depending on where the twists and turns are in it.  Is that not correct?  We are all able to make Lego, Airfix and Meccano models.  The public deserves an outline framework of what the models are built on.<\/p><p>  Deputy Donnelly asked who are the bureaucrats in Europe and what qualifications they hold.  These are good questions because we are told the aim is to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact objectives in the medium term.  The simple parameter is a 60% ratio of debt to national income or GDP.  I do not know if the case has been made sufficiently relevantly for Ireland that national income, which applies to the indigenous economy, is different from the gross domestic product of a depot economy, as in the old British Empire, which had the East India Company in parts of India and so on.  Multinationals generate goods and services in this country and debt-to-national-income is a different equation from debt-to-GDP.<\/p><p>  The Commission is not too concerned about the composition of the budgetary mix as long as Stability and Growth Pact targets are in prospect.  When penalties begin to kick in or adverse report card comments are made, quite apart from the measurement under this arrangement taking cognisance of the fact that the state is falling down, the rest of the world and his wife knows that such a country is in troubled waters anyway and will be unable to raise money.

The European Commission issued a press release in September 2011 to present a proposal for a FTT.  The tax would be levied on all transactions in financial instruments between financial institutions when at least one party to the transaction is located in the EU.  The exchange of shares and bonds would be taxed at a rate of 0.1% and derivative contracts at a rate of 0.01%.  The Commission estimated the FTT could raise approximately &euro;57 billion every year.  This estimate was on the basis that FTT would issue in all member states.  However, members will be aware that this will now not be the case.  The Commission proposed that the tax should come into effect from 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  The Commission decided to propose a new tax on financial transactions for two reasons.  The first was to ensure the financial sector makes a fair contribution at a time of fiscal consolidation in the member states.  The financial sector played a role in the origins of the economic crisis.  Governments and European citizens at large have borne the cost of massive taxpayer-funded bailouts to support the financial sector.  Furthermore, the sector is currently under-taxed compared with other sectors.  The proposal for a FTT would generate significant additional tax revenue from the financial sector to contribute to public finances.  The second reason is that a co-ordinated framework at EU level would help to strengthen the Single Market.  Today, several member states, including Ireland, have in place a form of FTT.  The proposal would introduce new minimum tax rates and harmonise different existing taxes on financial transactions in the EU.  This will help to reduce competitive distortions in the Single Market, discourage risky trading activities and complement regulatory measures aimed at avoiding future crises.  The FTT at EU level would strengthen the EU's position to promote common rules for the introduction of such a tax at a global level, notably through the G20. <\/p><p>  The revenues from the tax would be shared between the EU and the member states.  The current proposal is that part of the tax would be used as an EU own resource, which would partly reduce national contributions.  Member states might decide to increase their share of the amount collected by taxing financial transactions at a higher rate.  Members of the committee may be aware that the issue of how revenue from the tax will be allocated is still up for discussion.<\/p><p>  At the ECOFIN meeting in June of this year it became clear that an EU-wide FTT would not be agreed, and those countries who favour the tax will now try to introduce it by way of enhanced co-operation, in which at least nine countries must participate.  This requires those countries to write to the Commission asking it to produce a formal proposal for such a directive.  Eleven countries - Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Italy, Slovakia, Estonia and Greece - have written to the European Commission to this effect.  On 23 October 2012, the Commission submitted its proposal for a Council decision to authorise enhanced co-operation in the area of the FTT. <\/p><p>  Under the terms of the Commission's original draft directive, the FTT would have applied to financial transactions which were carried out by a financial institution established in the EU, or by a financial institution that was not established in the EU but transacted business with another EU financial institution or was acting on behalf of a person who was established in the EU, whether the institution was acting for itself or for a third party.  The tax would have applied whether the transaction was undertaken in a regulated market, over the counter or as an inter-group transaction.  The term &quot;established in the EU&quot; has a broad meaning.  It includes financial institutions from outside the EU which transact business with an EU-resident person, company or individual.  This is a specific mitigating design feature in order to respond to the risk of relocation.  The terms &#8220;financial instrument&#8221;, &#8220;derivative&#8221; and &quot;financial institution&quot; are drafted very widely and cover the vast majority of transactions in financial instruments.  However, many financial activities are not considered to be financial transactions in the context of the FTT, which follows the above-mentioned objectives.  Share and bond issues and most day-to-day financial activities relevant to citizens and businesses remain outside the scope of FTT, as do insurance contracts, mortgage lending, consumer credits, payment services etc.  Also, currency transactions on spot markets are outside the scope of the FTT, which preserves the free movement of capital.  However, derivatives agreements based on currency transactions are covered by the FTT since they are not currency transactions as such.  In addition, the issue or redemption of shares or units in an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, or alternative investment fund will be liable to the FTT.<\/p><p>  We have not yet received a revised Commission proposal for the enhanced co-operation FTT.  While the enhanced co-operation countries have requested the objectives and scope be based on the original Commission proposal, we understand the Commission is considering whether some adjustments are required to their original proposal to reflect the smaller number of member states that would be applying it.<\/p><p>  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank were requested to prepare an assessment of the FTT as drafted by the Commission.  This report was circulated to Oireachtas Members and published in July.  Given the wide variation in the estimated revenue yield from a FTT when different factors are taken into account and the uncertainty as to the form the tax would take, the report states that more detail would be needed on the final shape and scope of the tax before a definitive conclusion could be reached about its impact on the Irish financial system and taxation revenue.<\/p><p>  The report indicates that the net revenue gain for Ireland from the introduction of a FTT is likely to be modest.  Based on assumptions used by the Commission, the report estimates the potential yield from the FTT to be between &euro;490 million and &euro;730 million.  Under the Commission's proposal, two thirds of this yield would have gone directly to the EU to fund its budget.  If the EU retained two thirds of the yield, on the basis of the yield estimates in the ESRI-Central Bank report, the net yield to Ireland would be in the region of &euro;163 million to &euro;243 million - not dissimilar to the current yield from stamp duty on share transfers, which was &euro;195 million in 2011.  Ireland would have been forced to abolish this if it were to introduce a FTT.<\/p><p>  The report identified some disadvantages and potential disadvantages to the introduction of a FTT.  The first was the impact on the financial sector.<i><\/i>A FTT could displace financial sector activity, especially when alternative locations are readily available - in this case the UK.  This would pose a real risk to Ireland given that the financial services sector accounts for 10% of GDP and approximately 33,000 jobs.  The second was the macro-economic impact: a FTT would probably lead to a lower level of economic activity in the financial sector, which might also result in lower receipts from income tax and corporation tax.  The third potential disadvantage was the impact on the Exchequer<i>.  <\/i>A stamp duty  of 1% applies to transfers of shares in Irish companies.  The Commission's proposal would involve the abolition of this tax and the loss of existing stamp duty revenue, approximately &euro;195 million in 2011.<\/p><p>  Ireland will not be among those countries participating in the FTT by enhanced co-operation.  Ireland's position is that a FTT would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres.  If it cannot be introduced on a global basis, it would be better if it were introduced on at least an EU-wide basis, rather than only in the eurozone.  This would prevent any distortion of activity within the Union.  This is in line with the Commission's desire that the tax should be applied on a global basis.  Such an approach would avoid the risk of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions.  A FTT could affect the financial services industry, especially in the IFSC, and lead to some activities moving abroad, particularly if it were not introduced on an EU-wide basis.  A FTT could affect transactions in Irish Government bonds, particularly in the secondary market, and may also affect the ECB's ability to give effect to its own monetary policy via the repurchase or repo market.  A number of countries such as Sweden and the UK have also raised this point in respect of their own debt management.  Of concern to us is the Commission's own projection that a FTT could reduce EU growth and raise the cost of using financial products for ordinary non-financial companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012111400010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Brenda McVeigh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352909700,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McVeigh and her officials for coming before us to discuss the Council directive and the Council decision.

As this matter moves forward, will the Department be examining the level of transactions in which Ireland currently engages with the countries that are to participate in the enhanced co-operation mechanism?  Does it intend to calculate the revenue for Ireland from its transactions with those countries in the first and second quarters of next year?  Although the Department has provided an estimation of the projected income, if we engage in an exercise such as that to which I refer and identify the revenue that will be foregone by not imposing a tax on these transactions, we could obtain an idea of the real income level involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012111400011#K01800","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352910300,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I suggest we would always monitor developments in regard to any draft directive that would impact on our financial institutions but first and foremost the Commission's proposal was not supposed to be introduced before 2014.

I thank Ms McVeigh for her presentation on the FTT.  The Government's approach to this is the right one maybe for the wrong reasons but its approach in terms of opposing the tax in the format being suggested is definitely the right one.  Also, in her presentation she said that the Government believes that it is best that the EU budget is funded through own resources and not through a tax-raising measure.  The idea of a financial transactions tax is one Sinn F&eacute;in supports.  We have supported the concept of a financial transaction tax on a global basis or on a European-wide basis.  We have supported the idea of a Tobin tax and this is where we differ from the Government in that we believe it should be focused on addressing poverty and inequality.  I note Ms McVeigh said that traditionally Ireland has been opposed to the hypothecation of tax revenues, dedicating a part of revenue for a specific tax for a specific purpose.  Many taxes are raised in this State for specific purposes.  We have just had the introduction of the household tax which we are told is to be put into a local government fund.  If the Government leads on the principle of having a tax that would be focused on addressing poverty and inequality, that would be fine and it is the right position to oppose enhanced co-operation.  The idea that the Commission would have an independent stream of revenue to fund its own programmes is wrong.  This country has a long tradition of being a champion in addressing poverty and inequality internationally but, unfortunately, in our State the statistics are getting worse for our own people.  There is an onus on the Department to not only assess what other models are coming before the Commission or what other member states are saying but also to present its own proposal on this.  I am conscious of the fact that the Europe-wide FTT is not on the table.  I would be interested to hear what measures the Government is taking to steer a tax that would be acceptable to the Government.  What proposals is it putting on the table other than only reacting to the proposals coming from the Commission or from other member states?<\/p><p>  The Chairperson mentioned the possibility of an opt in and opt out to this proposal in terms of enhanced co-operation at a later stage and while I accept the fact that the FTT could be restructured depending on which members are included and that it could be decided to proceed with this, fundamental points have been outlined in terms of the Government's position, namely, that it is opposed to a non-EU-wide tax being levied and opposed to the Commission using this as a source of funding.  I am not sure what kind of scenario could unfold that those two criteria could be satisfied.  Ms McVeigh might outline to the committee the tests the Government might have in that respect and if those tests would measure any proposals  The Government is taking the right position on this maybe for the wrong reasons but it is the right position.  I would like the Government, even though it might not be successful, to lead on the idea of introducing a global financial transaction tax.  Unless countries like ours make those demands, we allow others to steer the debate.  Even if we are not successful at this time, hopefully some day we will get a consensus that a type of Tobin tax should be introduced to address issues around poverty and inequality and it is probably on that focus my party and the Government would disagree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012111400012#L00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352910300,"counter":194,"content":"<p>On what the Government might be doing in trying to lead proposals, we have said repeatedly that we have a stamp duty model in place.

It is a tried and tested model.  We have suggested that a stamp duty model is something the Commission should examine putting in place in a harmonised way throughout the countries.  It would have to be teased out a little bit further but it is a successful stream of revenue for a number of member states and something we believe should be examined as well.<\/p><p>  On the tests for opting in and opting out of the proposal, it needs to be highlighted that 11 countries to date have indicated they will opt in to the enhanced co-operation procedure.

As to whether this proposal has been teased out enough, we have been open in saying that there are gaps in the current proposal and that it needs further testing.  We would welcome sight of an impact assessment of even the FTT proposal that is on the table never mind one that might come forward eventually probably sometime during our Presidency.

I am a little concerned that we have allowed ourselves to see a long shadow looming over this country in the area of financial transactions, etc.  It is a shadow that should not be there because there is not even a proposal yet.  It alarms me that the country has decided to stay outside a conversation.  They have said we should have a conversation with not less than nine members out of 27, one third of the participants in number, to see if we can address the following, which Ms McVeigh sets out on page 2.  It states:<blockquote><br \/>This will help to reduce competitive distortions in the Single Market, discourage risky trading activities and complement regulatory measures aimed at avoiding future crises.  The financial transactions tax at EU level would strengthen the EU's position [and so on] to promote common rules for the introduction of such a tax at global level notably through the G20.<\/blockquote>This is the germ of a good idea because even the leaders of Europe are thinking about the urgent necessity for a single supervisory regulator for the banking system and that that regulation would be seen to be working before they even start opening the levers of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  We have an opportunity, therefore, as a member of the EU that has had the biggest financial explosion in the EU.  We talk about &euro;64 billion in capitalisation.  That is not the figure.  It is &euro;135 billion of loan losses across the institutions in Ireland.  The six Irish-owned ones account for about &euro;100 billion.  We saw in a report only three weeks ago that Certus, the wind down vehicle of Lloyd's Bank, has taken over the Bank of Scotland Ireland loan book, which reached a peak of about &euro;40 billion, and has written off &euro;22 billion.<\/p><p>  We had a report last week from the Bank of Ireland.  Amidst the noise the journalist magnified about pensions and salaries was the far more sinister aspect, namely, that on its balance sheet was &euro;105 billion of total loans and a total provision against those loans of only &euro;7 billion, with 74% of that loan book in mortgages, buy to let properties, property development, property investment in construction, etc.  We are told that bank is among the most capitalised banks in Europe.  It could not be when we had the biggest credit and asset bubble bust in the eurozone.  There is not a chance that &euro;7 billion of provisions will suffice.  It should start at &euro;20 billion and perhaps rise to &euro;25 billion.  That is an &euro;18 billion shortfall in capital and it does not matter what the headlines say today about a bond of &euro;1 billion being issued, taken away and so on, and Wilbur Ross and his friends putting in &euro;1.1 billion for 35% of the bank.  That bank has a mismatch on funding and assets, maturities on assets and assets in the wrong sectors that would blow the minds of anybody with experience.  <\/p><p>  We have to get real so that we can tell our creditors in the eurosystem that we need about &euro;70 billion of creditor capitalisation, the elimination of the ELA in IRBC - this is all banking related; that is the reason I am going into it - the tearing up of the promissory notes, and a renegotiation of the capital funding of the two operating remainder banks to ensure that in turn those banks, under proper management, can start sorting out the assets they have, including the &euro;105 billion in the Bank of Ireland, the approximately &euro;120 billion in AIB, and the others because-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012111400014#N01300","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1352911500,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The Deputy is half way through his time and I do not want it to expire but Ms McVeigh will have to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012111400014#N01400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1352911500,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I have a few questions that follow from that.

It states on page 23 that the Community also intends to introduce a uniform system for the taxation of companies but has not yet worked out proposals on the subject.  That such a uniform system is still not in place some 40 years later perhaps demonstrates the practical and difficult obstacles that would have to be overcome to put it into place.<\/p><p>  CCCTB would introduce new common rules for calculating and allocating company taxation across the European Union.  It would involve a new sharing mechanism, essentially a rule of thumb that proposes that the individual taxable profit base of each company within an international group would be aggregated or pooled to form a consolidated tax base.  That consolidated base would be re-attributed to those same companies based on their presence in any member state, that presence being measured by a formula accounting for the scale of assets, the number of employees, payroll costs and sales in any member state by comparison with those of the group as a whole.  Each member state's share of the profits would then be taxed at national tax rates, thereby preserving national sovereignty over the rate of taxation.<\/p><p>  Ireland's position on the CCCTB is well known.  We are sceptical about it.

Does a company invest in Ireland because we have water around the island and, therefore, invading land-based armies have at least one further obstacle to overcome?  The European experience is they had two extremely serious wars within 20 years of each other.  Moreover, they had experienced other wars earlier, as well as the subsequent Soviet blanket over eastern Europe after the Second World War.  People running companies and boards of companies do not talk about this but they think about it.  Perhaps that is a bigger reason so many multinational corporations, MNCs, come to Ireland with their foreign direct investment.  It is not simply because of corporation tax at a rate of 12.5%.  I believe, professionally, they would not even blink an eye were the headline rate at 15%.  Moreover, this could be worth a serious amount of money for the Exchequer on an annual basis.  Based on the last corporate profit tax returns, it would amount to &euro;600 million.  For any companies contemplating coming to Ireland, it would not put them off because as members are aware, they do their tax planning on a global basis, which ascertains what is the effective tax rate.  However, as I noted in respect of the earlier presentation, we again have created a shadow that might not be there.  I invite Mr. Tobin and his colleagues to be brave, to think differently and perhaps to suggest to the Government and the Cabinet that a corporation tax rate of 15% could be cemented in for the next seven years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012111400016#P01900","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352912700,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy may be trying to get me to move away from talking about the common consolidated corporate tax base to talk about something else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012111400016#P02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Tobin"},{"type":"speech","time":1352912700,"counter":274,"content":"<p>The word \"corporate\" is common to both conversations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012111400016#P02100","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352912700,"counter":275,"content":"<p>It certainly is.

Essentially, if one had a company with a particular level of profit, that profit would be put into a central bucket.  It would be reallocated back to be taxed at the individual tax rate of an individual European country, depending on what percentage of sales were carried out in each country, the percentage of labour, the number of employees in each country and the percentage of assets.<\/p><p>  The Commission has posited that this formula would be on the basis of three thirds.  One would make one's estimation on the basis one third of fixed assets, one third of sales by destination and one third of payroll.  The Commission has always been careful to say that ultimately this is a political decision.  It would, therefore, be up to the Council to decide how it finally wants to allocate the profit, and what final formula it would like.  <\/p><p>  Given that the financial crisis has engulfed the whole eurozone and the wider community, it is fair to say that most countries are now more reluctant than they have ever been to potentially give away part of their tax base and allow a new system to reallocate it based on a formula that probably has not been fully worked out.  While the sharing mechanism and consolidation element of the proposal is central to what the Commission has brought forward, in the current environment the level of scepticism around the consolidation element of the proposal has probably increased quite significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012111400017#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Tobin"},{"type":"speech","time":1352913300,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The recommendations and the next steps to constructive engagement are, as Mr. Tobin said, the right way to go.

The aim of the committee's examination is to prepare and publish a report on the strategy and response of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the economic crisis, the Department's new recognised responsibilities for trade promotion, and how well the Department is performing in respect of the programme for Government measures for trade promotion and economic recovery.<\/p><p>  The committee commenced this process earlier this year with a formal adoption of a scoping document and a meeting with senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the key State agencies involved in trade and investment, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Forf&aacute;s.  A delegation of the committee had 30 trade-related meetings in three cities in the United States over six days in June.<\/p><p>  After today's meeting, the committee will examine the way in which the visa system supports or inhibits trade promotion, meet with organisations with perspectives on the promotion of agricultural exports, and hear international perspectives from business organisations, as well as from chambers of commerce.  It is essential we hear the views of the key players in the private sector who operate at the coalface of our international trade.  Accordingly, we will now hear from IBEC and the Irish Exporters Association.  Both are members of the Export Trade Council which was established by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am sure they have views on how it is performing too.<\/p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.

We participate actively in that group together with CEOs from several of our member companies.  We are very happy to work in partnership with all the Government Departments involved in the group and, indeed, with the State agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland.  This council has met on a number of occasions and I think, as the council is developing, there is a greater understanding of each other's positions and we are happy to see that there is a greater engagement with the private sector taking place as the council evolves.  We would like to see that continue into the future.<\/p><p>  IBEC and its sectoral associations greatly value the role played by Irish ambassadors and embassy staff abroad in a number of different areas, including trying to solve or help us solve market access issues and in their new role in terms of co-ordinating and supporting trade missions and the work of the agencies abroad.  We think this is a very welcome development that there is an Ireland Inc. approach with all the agencies and the embassy staff, led by the ambassador, working together. <\/p><p>  IBEC's own trade council meets on a quarterly basis and has done for a number of years.  We interact with Government officials involved in trade policy and promotion on a regular basis through our trade council.  The council formulates the business position on trade policy but I will come back to that later.  <\/p><p>  We were also delighted to work as part of the Forf&aacute;s steering group on the report, Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally, which was published in June this year.  We feel the recommendations of this report should be taken on board and we have emphasised that at the Export Trade Council.  Again, we are very happy to work in partnership with Forf&aacute;s and the State agencies in regard to implementing the recommendations of the report, specifically in building the marketing expertise and sales expertise of Irish SMEs and indigenous companies and also in improving the language skills in Ireland and building on foreign language capability.  <\/p><p>  On 30 November, IBEC in collaboration with UCC and Enterprise Ireland will run its second workshop on doing business in China.  This is an initiative to try to enable SMEs and large Irish companies, when they are doing business in a market with which they are not that familiar, to gain an understanding of the culture in that market and of the differences of doing business in that market.  This has been a good collaboration with the Institute of Asian Studies in UCC and Enterprise Ireland.  <\/p><p>  On the international front, in addition to the work we do in Ireland, IBEC is the Irish member of Business Europe, the leading Brussels-based organisation which brings together 41 different business and employers' confederations.  We interact with the EU Commission and the EU Parliament as a group with Business Europe which strengthens the position in Ireland.  <\/p><p>  We actively participate in the organisation's international relations committee.  I sit on that committee and my colleague, Ms Paula O'Dwyer, sits on the free trade agreement and the WTO working groups.  I also chair the organisation's network for developing relations with the United States.  It was in that context that I did some work in collaboration with Business Europe and the US Chamber of Commerce which I will refer to later and which was the subject of the material I sent to the Chairman of the committee ahead of the visit to the United States.  <\/p><p>  IBEC is also the Irish member of the Europe Services Forum which promotes trade in services globally.  This is an emerging part of business and trade in Ireland.  As members will know, approximately half of Irish exports are services exports.  In addition to manufacturing exports, we have a strong services exports side.  Mr. Danny McCoy, IBECs director general, will meet Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the EU Council, tomorrow to outline IBEC's business priorities for the Irish Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111400003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352909400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I am delighted IBEC is supporting the Africa strategy because in the coming months many African politicians will come to Ireland.

The Irish Exporters Association was established in 1951 and was the organisation which had the low corporation tax rate introduced in Ireland.  Originally, it was to apply to export profits.  It kicked in in the early 1960s and subsequent organisations such as the IDA utilised it to very good effect to increase our foreign direct investment.  The organisation represents companies which account for 70% of export activity.  In terms of the specific brief in regard to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, initially we will look at the role of embassies and the trade portfolio, on which we will give some insights.

My experience with Enterprise Ireland, in particular, has been very positive.  It is really important that we have people on the ground.  Many years ago, when my export business was starting out, I attended a half-day forum chaired by three of the main exporting companies in Ireland, including Glen Dimplex.  The big message was that if one wanted to be successful in the export markets, one would only be successful by having feet on the ground.  It was emphasised that it did not mean employing a sales person and having him or her on the ground, that the CEOs of businesses needed to be heavily involved.  Linked with this, the impact of officials, embassy staff, Enterprise Ireland staff and IDA Ireland staff cannot be underestimated.  It is very important and a dramatic statement of intent to those involved in the markets in which we are trying to become involved in terms of our commitment to these markets.  I advocate strongly that if there are cutbacks to be made, they should not be made in the export sector.   We are heavily involved in China.  There was an office in Guangzhou with one person, but it was closed down.  That was a big mistake.  Out of all those employed globally by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and in the embassies, one person is tiny.  The key message is that we need support and help on the ground.<\/p><p>  Instead of having three addresses in export markets, with IDA Ireland located in one place and the embassy and Enterprise Ireland in others, we thought it would be a superb idea to open Ireland House.  It was to be one operation in one building in each of the markets in whcih we were involved.  There would be a number of ways in which the work done would be complementary.  Obviously, exporters interact with different people, including staff in IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the embassies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111400004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Slein","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352910000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Coming up to the last general election, we were delighted to see the proposals for the new structure for the Department and the subsequent incorporation of trade into foreign affairs.  It has worked very well as far as we are concerned.  There is some more work to be done but we are already seeing exceptionally good returns from this new structure.<\/p><p>  Our rate of exports to Asia is extremely low, coming to 5%, while it is 20% for most other European countries.  Again, most of our embassy and promotional support activity tends not to concentrate on this region.  We have presented the recommendations of our Asia trade forum and strategy to the Department.  I agree, as Mr. Slein said, that there needs to be more investment in this area.  I note IDA Ireland&rsquo;s chief executive officer, Mr. Barry O'Leary, recently stated there needs to be more time and effort to attract foreign direct investment but it is difficult if the resources are not there.  We know the country has difficulties with its resource bank.  However, if one has to reduce resources, it should not affect front-line forces such as embassies and field supports in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  We need more embassies abroad and promotional staff.<\/p><p>  We made a detailed proposal for the need for an Africa strategy at the Export Trade Council.  Ireland has always had a good aid strategy for the continent.  Up to 11 of our embassies are dealing with aid with the exception of our South African embassy which has just appointed Mr. Fred Klinkenberg to head up the trade portfolio there.  The Government has taken up our suggestion and is beginning to train up some personnel in the other African embassies.  It needs much more push, however.  We have doubled our exports to Africa over the past two years.  By the end of the decade, exports to Africa could come to &euro;24 billion if the embassy, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia structures work together.  That is much more than we will get out of China and yet we are hearing a lot about the China trade.  It is important to get a balance on this and play to our strengths.  We have a significant embassy structure in Africa, unlike our position in China, and there is an opportunity to build on the goodwill created by our historic and current contribution to education, training and aid in Africa.  Many other countries are moving into Africa and eating our breakfast when it comes to trade.  We need to press on there.  A recent Export Trade Council meeting agreed on a &euro;2 million pilot project for fresh trading initiatives in Africa with half of the funds coming from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the other half coming from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p><p>  The committee is aware we cannot negotiate joint free trade agreements as they fall to the EU.  We noted the joint economic commissions were languishing, doing nothing.  We raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his team.  They moved on it and on 7 November 2011 he had a meeting with his Russian counterparts on this issue.  He got it working with Russia, one of our fast-growing economic markets in the BRIC countries.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, pushed it further.  There are opportunities to extend this further.<\/p><p>  Tremendous benefits are coming out of the Export Trade Council structure.  One significant problem we are encountering is the difficulty the Irish visa regime creates for business people, as well as for students and tourists.  We have had a significant move on this through the Export Trade Council.  An interim structure was put in place for the London Olympics this summer.  A more permanent structure is at the final stages of negotiation for implementation with the British embassy which will allow for the sharing of biometrics.  It will give us a much more streamlined process and open up these markets, as well as the tourism and education sectors.<\/p><p>  There are many opportunities in these areas and much good work has been done but a lot more needs to be done.  We would stress, however, that the Department is under-resourced and needs fresh funding in the next budget.  We are confident that such a move will deliver additional returns.  We encourage the committee to push for it when possible.<\/p><p>  The key sign-off during the Irish EU Presidency will be the EU-Canada free trade agreement.  We pushed very hard on this and made several presentations on it early last year.  The Canadian ambassador informed us Ireland was likely to be the largest beneficiary of this agreement.  It is important it is signed off during our presidency.  There are so many developments in the EU but they are very slow.  This agreement would get us a clear win if we could get it signed off during the presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111400005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1352910000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Of all the BRIC countries, has Russia the fastest growing trade with Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111400005#D00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352910000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Yes.

The question is relevant for IBEC as well.  Does IBEC monitor the performance of our embassies and agencies abroad?  We cannot afford to fail with the objectives and exercises we are undertaking.  We must get real value for money and we must get results.  Some of what we were saying was somewhat aspirational.

The committee meets all of our ambassadors on a regular basis, as well as visiting delegations.  We recently met the Congolese Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Tourism.  The Congo is a vast country.  It is the Brazil of Africa, a vibrant continent, the economy of which is growing at a rapid pace.

The delegates referred to the Kenyan who was the leader of the African group of ambassadors when we met them.  They want trade links.  Yesterday a Minister pleaded with us to invest in the Congo.

Previously, our scale of operation has, to an extent, excluded us from participating in these tenders.  The report produced for us by Schuman Associates in Brussels, in collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Irish Engineering Enterprises Federation, specifically looks into this.  There is a proposal between us and Enterprise Ireland to develop a cluster of these engineering companies here to become involved in tendering to win business.

We are already members of the Asian Development Bank.  Obviously, there is a cost involved in joining, but it is well worth considering.<\/p><p>  On the question as to why we chose UCC, the answer is simple.  UCC came to us and asked us if we would be interested in developing something with it.  We worked with UCC for over a year to try to tailor its programme to be as business focused as possible and when we reached a stage where we were both happy with it, we ran a workshop together a year ago.  That was very successful and well attended and we now have a second workshop planned.  There is good interest in the workshop, which will be a full-day workshop in IBEC.

These connections will make it much easier for us all to trade through Africa.  The big advantage is that certain people are considering markets they would not have considered previously.  It takes time after the initial assessment.  If the connections are good for people and cargo, it is worth pursuing, but it can take up to two years.  We, therefore, need the airways to continue to provide these services.  If they do, it will yield long-term benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111400009#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1352912400,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I would like to return to the point I was making about direct flights, an issue on which the Dublin Airport Authority and some of the multinationals are working.

They can buy seats on an airline just as anybody else can, although the European Unon might have issues with this.  This is the most important air route we could have.  I am sure it is a matter of concern for everyone present that we should have it but do not.<\/p><p>  The issue of consulates which has been mentioned also came up in San Francisco.  Given that there are 40,000 Irish passport holders in the Bay Area, it is clear that the consulate in San Francisco pays for itself.  Irish people, apparently, lose more passports than people of other nationalities.  The way we are organising our consulate service is not acceptable, as we are losing great people in San Francisco.  Nearly everybody who becomes the deputy gets a very good job in the Bay Area.  We have come across some great honorary consuls.  It is ridiculous to expect the consulate in San Francisco to cover an area almost the size of western Europe.  One cannot have the job done in such circumstances.  There are honorary consuls in San Diego and at other locations.  We have pointed out that huge costs are not associated with honorary consuls.  It is a touchstone.  If the representatives of an Irish company were arriving in Denver, for example, there should be somebody there to deal with them.  Other countries do these things.  We do not, even though it would not cost very much.<\/p><p>  We have our report on the global economic forum.  I am sure the delegates were present at the most recent forum.  Many concerns have been expressed about the third forum.  I have highlighted the issue at the committee.  Many said at the second forum that not much had happened after the first.  It was suggested very busy people who had been willing to give of their time to the project - time is money for such persons - would not continue to do so if results were not being seen by the time the third forum was held.  The emigrant investor programme was mentioned as an example of what had been achieved in the meantime.  It will be of concern to IBEC's members to learn that one application under the programme which was announced at the start of the year has been processed.  I understand a further three applications are in the pipeline.  That is poor, by any standard.  It should be a no-brainer.  It should be churning out stuff.  I am using this to indicate what we will have to mention as an example of what we have achieved in two years when we are inviting people to attend the third global economic forum.  If this achievement rate is anything to go by, we will not have a third forum.  It will be said we are not achieving.  I would like to get the delegates' views on the global economic forum.

One of the key issues with all of these initiatives is that it is hard to measure their impact.  It would be useful to find a means of undertaking some cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the holding of an event, or the establishment of a consulate, actually yielded a positive return.  Our instincts tell us that it should, but that is not scientifically based in any way.  It has been suggested that as a country, we probably need to come up with some criteria for determining the value of some of the decisions being taken.  We need to assess whether doing X is more valuable, in terms of international reach, than doing Y.  Would we get more value from holding a third global economic forum than from spending money on The Gathering or other events?  It is a flaw in our policy process that we find it somewhat difficult to measure these things in a real way.  We tend to rely on instinct, touch and feel.  The best information comes in the form of feedback from companies.  It would be much more effective if some cost-benefit analysis or scientific approach was used when some of these decisions were being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111400009#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Butler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352912400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Senator Mark Daly will be aware that our main embassy in the United States is in Washington and that we also have consulates general in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and New York.

After that, businesses can usually work well with them.<\/p><p>  One of our colleagues on the national council has just come back from the United States and has pointed out that every state has its own rules and regulations with regard to every commercial agreement.  He was just trying to get one line changed in an agreement and he had to go through three different local state rules and use local state agencies to go over the agreements again, as well as having to pay $1,500 each time for a one line or, as he maintained, two word change in a contract.  This is where a consul, if he or she is switched on, can ease the situation in any particular state.  However, one has to gauge whether it is worth it, whether to have consuls in every state or in which states to have them, and whether it is value for money.<\/p><p>  It is an issue right across the embassy structure.

How do our exports break down in terms of percentage between FDI and indigenous companies?  Mr. Whelan talked about visas.  Should we join Schengen, in his opinion?

Our exports had dipped down very heavily so, as they are coming back up, comparison levels can get lost in the year-to-year situation.  Generally, our manufacturing side has been suffering and our services side has been growing extremely rapidly and continues to underpin Ireland as one of the top locations for services export globally.  What we need to be careful of is that 75% of all our FDI last year came in by way of services companies, and this could be a long-term concern for exporters on the manufacturing side.

We can get too focused on year to year figures whereas we should look at the longer trend.  In addition, it is true to say we rely on growth elsewhere.

While we would like to see more opened, three of our embassies have had to be closed owing to the economic climate.  However, there is a hidden other sector that we should look at.  Dublin city has an international office.  Dublin is the capital of Ireland.  Many multinationals are based in the Dublin region.  Many years ago, Ireland entered into negotiations with San Jose which resulted in the development of a productive relationship between this country and an Irish-American mayor and academic.

They were brought in by a Cork company which has since shifted its manufacturing plan to China.  Are we pulling all the strings together?  For example, we have been hearing about airline operations to America.  When the Lord Mayor of Dublin visited China he was able to open doors that were phenomenal for the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, which entered into negotiations with two or three Chinese airlines with a view to establishing links.  Do both organisations recognise the value of Dublin, the capital city, as a marketing tool?

I am trying to elicit from Dr. Ivory whether IBEC is on the sidelines or proactive in trying to make this happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111400012#L00300","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1352914200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Before I allow Dr. Ivory to answer that point, I will allow in Senator David Norris who is very anxious to contribute.

I offer my apologies; I wished to contribute during Private Members' business.<\/p><p>  The delegates are most welcome and it is very interesting to hear what they have to say.  As they can imagine, I come at this issue from a slightly different perspective.  Although they were delighted at the change in name of the Department, I was concerned by it because I could see a recalibration in the direction of trade rather than human rights.  It is very important that we keep human rights to the fore.  As for returning to the markets, off with everyone, as I do not believe they will last that long.  Ultimately, it is likely that within 50 years capitalism will be banjaxed and I hope that will be the case.  Of course, we are going to re-enter the markets.  We are being patted on the back by the troika and all kinds of people.  Dr. Wolfgang Sch<font color=\"#222222\">&auml;uble visited Ireland to tell<\/font> us how well we were doing and that we were an example to be pointed to.  Yes, that is so - at the price of evictions and having soup kitchens.  Did I ever think, as an Irishman, that I would see day when we would again have in this country soup kitchens and evictions, just as we are about to celebrate 100 years of our glorious struggle for freedom?  There is, however, a contrary view.<\/p><p>  Life is very complex, even in a business sense.  I have dipped my toe in the water of business, successfully enough, but for reasons other than commercial.  It is fascinating and one gets a great kick out of it because it is like a game, something wonderful like Monopoly.  However, I point to its two-sided nature.  Patents running out is a problem for Ireland in one sense, although in another it is good for us.  On the one hand, we bemoan the fact that patents are running out, while, on the other, we push as hard as we can to ensure they run out for the big pharmaceutical companies in order that we can have generic drugs and reduce the cost to the health service.  There is a very curious and interesting balance.<\/p><p>  I have two questions.  I am delighted to hear Terminal 2 is doing so well, although when I was in it last week, it was virtually empty.  It is, however, a beautiful building.  To me, it is almost a symbol of the difficulties the country faces - a stunning and wonderful building for an anticipated market that has not materialised and may not do so, although I hope it does.  <\/p><p>  My first question is on human rights.  China and low-hanging fruit have been mentioned.  Again, this is fascinating.  What an irony it is, however, that it is the Lamborghinis and Bentleys of this world which are picking the low-hanging fruit in what is still supposed to be a Communist country.  There is a wonderful refreshing irony, but I wonder about it.  One might consider what has happened in Tibet, for example, and the recent considerable increase in the number of Tibetan Buddhist monks who set themselves on fire and killed themselves.  At what stage, if ever, do human rights enter the equation?  I do not imagine this question is asked very often by the delegates and I do not blame them for this, but is there any point at which human rights enter the equation?  Perhaps there is not.<\/p><p>  My second question concerns the corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Mr. Whelan has mentioned that his organisation was involved in creating this tax in 1951.  I have always been a little worried about it because it seemed fragile and represented something artificial, something that would lead to situations where companies would have an office with a nameplate in the International Financial Services Centre through which profits would be manoeuvred and accounted for tax purposes.  I am delighted if the country can make money out of it, but I wonder if there is an exit strategy, just in case the measure comes unstuck.  I do not believe, however, that it will as a result of a direct attack, in a political sense, by France, Germany and the Dutch.  It is far more likely to come under attack because people have now woken up, for example, to Starbucks.   There is a big stink about Starbucks which has made a vast profit on which it has paid no tax whatsoever because it has a deal with the Dutch.  We should note the hypocrisy.  The Dutch are the ones who want to screw to the wall the Greeks - and us - while they are fiddling as hard as they can.  They can make a profit out of this by recycling and money laundering, which basically is what is going on.  It is the same with the French.  They are no longer after us but chasing Facebook and Google for their profits.<\/p><p>  I reiterate my two questions.  It will not surprise nor shock me if the delegates tell me there is no point at which human rights will ever enter the equation but I ask the question in any case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111400012#L00500","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352914800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

A large proportion of our expertise in international trade - even that of indigenous companies - comes from companies which spin off from multinational companies.  We have been obtaining good returns from the corporation tax rate.  I accept that there is a need to develop many more indigenous companies.  It must, however, be borne in mind that when we do develop such companies, they end up being taken over by multinationals.  As a result, they are suddenly outside the loop again.  We find that the published and actual effective rates of corporation tax differ.  For example, the Netherlands has all sorts of deals available which lead to its effective rate being reduced to a rate below ours.  In addition, the French have an effective rate which is very similar to ours.  The corporation tax issue is occasionally singled out, but, by and large, our rate is probably reasonable, particularly if various deals are not put in place to reduce it.<\/p><p>  Deputy David Norris referred to an exit strategy.  The position in this regard is similar to what would happen if one were trying to execute an exit strategy from the global banking structure and the related bonus culture.  Unless everyone agrees to something globally, those with the skills to manipulate financial markets will move to wherever they can minimise their tax exposure.  It is the same with corporation tax.  Ireland is only one player on the global scale.  It is a reasonable player which provides clear governance rules for investment and the return on investment out of the Irish market.  Ireland is not a banana republic.  If we remain on our current path, we will continue to do well.  We would only execute an exit strategy if other countries also began to exit.  Meanwhile, we are reasonably well positioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111400013#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Whelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352914800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Our well-known position is that we are 100% committed to maintaining the rate of corporation tax.  That will continue to be our position which we have defended successfully in the past and we have the ability to do so again in the future.  Our corporate tax regime is transparent, while those in other jurisdictions are less so.  For example, other countries have many more exemptions and ways of paying less tax which are not apparent from the headline rates that apply.  There will always be discussion of tax levels.  As the eurozone moves forward and meets the challenges facing it and as the European Unions discusses its challenges, all of these issues will arise again.  We must be prepared to defend our corporation tax rate in that context.<\/p><p>  On human rights, companies are increasingly cognisant of their corporate and social responsibilities.  A raft of international legislation is now in place in this regard.  I refer to the UN Convention on Human Rights and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions which we have signed.

The embassies of other countries might be run by 40 to 50 staff, while Ireland's may only be operated by four or five.  This aspect must be taken into consideration.  Our embassies do a great job with the limited resources available to them.  I would like our embassy network to be expanded.

This deterioration leads to problems such as potholes, wheel track rutting, increasing roughness, cracking and loss of skid resistance.  The authority undertakes condition surveys of the full national road network each year using specialised vehicles.  Measurements taken include the road profile, rutting, cracking and other deterioration characteristics, as well as the skidding resistance characteristics.  With rapid improvements in recent years in laser and video technology and the capacity to record and process ever-greater quantities of digital data, the authority has adopted increasingly sophisticated techniques.  In particular, in 2011 and 2012 we first used new crack detection and processing technology for our motorway routes.  Cracking is the principal manifestation of failure on pavements, and the ability to monitor its progression year-on-year now provides us with an improved capability to manage the major deterioration mechanism of our pavements.<\/p><p>  In November 2011, the authority published its new standard for skid resistance management, HD 28\/11.  The standard sets out how the provision of appropriate levels of skid resistance for national roads will be managed and details how measurements of skid resistance are made and interpreted.<\/p><p>  Renewal and surface treatment of pavements is a high priority for the authority as it is central to maintaining the functionality and safety of the network.  Every year hundreds of renewal and treatment schemes are carried out.  The renewal works associated with pavements are prioritised on the basis of the annual survey results and the skid resistance assessment, while maintenance works such as the fixing of potholes are decided locally.  The volume of work carried out in any year is largely determined by the available funding.<\/p><p>  Access to motorways is prohibited by the Roads Acts 1993 and 2007 except in specified circumstances such as for maintenance or for emergency services.  If the motorway in question is part of the trans-European road network, the provisions of the EU directive on road infrastructure safety management are also relevant.  This directive, transposed into Irish law by SI 472 of 2011, contains various provisions with regard to road safety and it is unlikely that access would be allowed other than in exceptional circumstances.  Junctions on motorways may be approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la as part of a motorway scheme.  However, if the motorway in question is part of the trans-European road network, the proposed junction would have to have undergo assessment as prescribed by SI 472\/2011 before being submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is considerable detail concerning these provisions and related design requirements in the design manual for roads and bridges, which is accessible online at <i>nra.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>  A number of national roads cross into Northern Ireland, including the N1, N2, N3, N13, N14, N15 and N16.  There are, of course, many non-national cross-Border roads also.  The only cross-Border route on which developments are being planned now is the link between the N14 and N15 and the A5, crossing the River Foy, which lies between Lifford and Strabane.  Donegal County Council, the NRA and the Northern Ireland Roads Service plan to build a new bridge at this location, which will tie into the proposed new A5.  The statutory processes concerning the planned A5 are subject to a judicial review, and until that is resolved neither we nor Donegal County Council are taking further action on the crossing.  However, it is our intention to have the new bridge ready to open at the same time as the section of the A5 at Strabane.  There will be a need to agree Border crossing details where the new A5 meets the N2 near Aughnacloy.  As that section of the A5 will not be built for some years, neither Monaghan County Council nor the NRA is actively engaged on the crossing now.  The authority is not currently engaged in any other cross-Border national road scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012111400004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1352885700,"counter":437,"content":"<p>We have full attendance and people are anxious to ask questions.

We are still doing the full surveys and getting all the data.  We will be affected by the likelihood of less money to spend on maintenance and maintenance capital next year and the year after than we had spent in earlier years.  It will be less than the amount we would like to spend.  In our assessment of where money should go, the investment and expenditure on the basic work of maintenance, maintenance capital and rehabilitation is getting priority.  The consequence is that, other than PPP schemes, we are unlikely to be starting major schemes over the next year or two.  The available money will be spent on maintaining the asset we best we can.<\/p><p>  That also applies to questions on funding streams.  Funding will be heavily cut, as it has already been.  It will be cut in the coming years.  We understand that and we are not making a case that it should be done differently.  That is a matter for the Government.  The implication is that, other than PPP schemes, we do not see major or minor schemes starting in the coming year unless they are already under way.<\/p><p>  With regard to access to roads and the standard of junctions, lower standard junctions exist where traffic levels are much lower than they might otherwise be.  Such junctions work but they are not as good as better junctions.  It would be nice to upgrade them to a higher standard but, given the other priorities, I cannot see it happening in the near future.<\/p><p>  Links to the north west are a priority.  Quite a few schemes have been taken to the point where they are ready to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la or are well developed.  As with other parts of the country, we will not be able to start construction until funding is available again.  That is not because they are not recognised as being needed.<\/p><p>  What is turning up in the surface surveys is the rutting and cracking problems one would expect.  All pavement has a natural life and it is inevitable it will deteriorate.  We do not have pyrite problems on the national roads, which is not to take away from the pyrite problems that exist elsewhere.  We occasionally have some issues with sub-surface works.  Repairs were undertaken on the M9, paid for entirely by the contractor whose responsibility they were, but they did not concern pyrite.<\/p><p>  We have an input on tolling.  The policy decisions on tolling, whether further tolling will take place and whether a change to tolling should be made, rests with the Government of the day.  Tolls were put in place on foot of policy decisions made earlier in the 2000s.  If there were to be changes to the tolls, it would be a policy decision by the Government and we would have the task of implementation, dealing with public hearings, tolling schemes and negotiating with PPP companies.  We do not initiate those activities off our own bat.<\/p><p>  On signage, we have no plans for dual signage showing kilometres and miles.

Again the pavement life of seven years or 20 years are general figures, the level of traffic has a good deal to do with it, in particular a severe winter can make a difference.  We plan for the future and are aware of work that will need to be done over the next four years in planned maintenance.

We were about to submit a call for tenders when the first of many funding cuts was announced and we were unable to proceed with the project on that basis.  We have since tendered the project as a public-private partnership.  This is the only means of having the work done as the NRA does not have sufficient funds to complete the project.  Public-private partnerships worked very well until a couple of years ago in the sense that it was possible to raise funding and bring the relevant projects to fruition.  However, as funding for the State became more difficult, so too did funding for public-private partnerships.  Many obstacles and difficulties have arisen and while I do not propose to discuss them in detail, we are in the last stages of the competition.  Most of the issues that arose in respect of the European Investment Bank and the availability of funding from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to underpin some payment streams have been resolved.  We are now in what is known as the financial close period on the public-private partnership.  The documents are being finalised and exchanged between the PPP company and its lenders and subcontractors.  This phase will probably run for another two or three months and we are highly optimistic at this stage that the contract will be signed during the first quarter of  next year.<\/p><p>  Of some relevance to this matter was the signing in the past week of a public-private partnership agreement for a schools bundle.  This is relevant to our arrangements for Newlands Cross because the same PPP company and lenders are involved.  In this case, however, it is the NRA rather than the Department of Education and Skills that is involved on the State side.

The work to date has been funded out of Exchequer money.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan asked about contact with local councils and their autonomy in terms of being able to respond.  The autonomy of local authorities in matters relating to national roads is fairly limited.  In the case of improvement projects on national roads the relevant local authority will often sponsor the projects by bringing them forward.  However, to advance such projects they must secure funding from the National Roads Authority, which we, in turn, receive from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Generally, projects are developed jointly between the NRA and local authorities and most are developed through the regional offices.  These offices are staffed by local authority personnel, although payment for staff and so forth is made by the NRA.  As I stated, the projects are jointly developed.  <\/p><p> Local authorities have autonomy on the minor spending involved on pure maintenance.  The levels of payment to the local authorities for maintenance is less than they believe to be necessary and I have some sympathy with the local authorities in that regard.  While they have some discretion in this regard, they are also stretched to find enough money to cover their needs. <\/p><p>  On the handover of roads and increasing the length of regional roads local authorities must manage on foot of the completion of new roads, the legal mechanism obtaining in this respect is fairly black and white.  When a new national road that bypasses an old road is opened the latter will, by law, automatically revert to being a regional road.  This is not a matter for discussion but the practice has been that at the time of handover the NRA will agree with the relevant local authority either a body of works or the allocation of a sum of money to the local authority in question to ensure the road being handed over is in good condition or the local authority has the wherewithal to bring it into good condition.  Beyond that, the responsibility for the funding and management of the regional road reverts to the local authority and the NRA no longer has any responsibility in that regard, except to the extent that we do administrative work for the Department. <\/p><p>  As to the winter, we have our fingers crossed in the hope that we will have a better winter than we had a few years ago.  We have taken a number of measures since the winters of two and three years ago.  During the most recent winter weather crisis, the National Roads Authority was asked to take over the purchase of salt from the local authorities.  We do this centrally and have a stockpile of 150,000 tonnes of salt available for the national roads.  We also, as part of a subsequent initiative, supported the Department in creating a stockpile for non-national roads.  While this stockpile of 60,000 tonnes is not under our management, it was procured by the National Roads Authority and we made it available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012111400007#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1352887500,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Where is it stored?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012111400007#F00900","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352887500,"counter":472,"content":"<p>It is stored at various locations.

A significant amount is held in County Louth.  This is salt we purchased from the salt mine in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  On the question on the proportion of the money allocated to health and safety, almost all of the expenditure made by the National Roads Authority has a health and safety component.  Each time we build or consider a new scheme, whether an upgrade to a section of national road or the removal of a bad bend, safety is always one of the key considerations.  If one considers the appraisals we do of the business cases and projects, the two big items that drive benefits are time savings through lack of congestion and safety.  There are safety aspects to everything we do.<\/p><p>  Aside from the major projects, we run a programme of small local safety schemes, on which we have spent approximately &euro;20 million per annum over the past decade or thereabouts.  It would be misleading, however, if we were to say expenditure on safety is limited to &euro;20 million because health and safety is an aspect of all of the schemes.

The thinking is that in the longer run it is cheaper to do it that way.  We are strong proponents of outsourcing work and using private sector contractors rather than having large in-house teams.  However, we need to strike a balance in order not to have a project completely out of our control.  I can state categorically that we have greatly reduced our staff numbers - as have local authorities - to reflect the changed situation.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony asked about the schedule for the Gort to Tuam project.  It had reached a very advanced tendering stage.  We have lined up a preferred tenderer who would like to build the scheme.  However, there is a funding problem.  The scheme was put on hold some time ago because the money was not available to fund the State's side of the obligations.  Last summer the Government's growth initiative announced that the Gort to Tuam project would be one of the projects to be funded.  However, the funding is not yet in place.  We understand that the funding is to come from the sale of State assets, although from our narrow perspective the source of the funding is immaterial.  Once the funding is committed to a project, we are good to go, so to speak.  Assuming the funding becomes available some time during next year, we expect to be able to commence construction within six months of the funding being in place.  The funding commitment must be committed over many years because the PPP payments run for many years.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about lands frozen.  I hope I covered that matter in the response to Deputy O'Donovan.  On the question of road signage, it is not our intention to send people astray.  We will examine that specific instance.  Other Deputies make representations to the NRA on signage.  These are always examined.  We are certainly not infallible and if possible we will improve on existing signage.<\/p><p>  On the point raised about kerbing on the Charlestown bypass, I am not aware of that problem so I am unable to respond to the Deputy as to the reason it was not dealt with immediately.  A question was asked about the responsibilities of the NRA and the local authorities.  This is a confusing issue which can be unclear at times.  We believe we know our responsibilities.  The local authorities which engage with us are aware of their responsibilities but not everyone in a local authority may understand the relationship.  The NRA has certain responsibilities under the Roads Act but more responsibilities are devolved to local authorities.  However, the Act does not cover every aspect of roads.  Other authorities and powers derive from traffic regulations and other legislation and these give certain powers to local authorities.  The local authorities are the roads authorities; the NRA has other responsibilities.  I will not go into the details of the legislation because the NRA did not write it.  I acknowledge it is confusing.<\/p><p>  Deputy Walsh asked about the Galway city outer bypass and the European Court of Justice judgment.  The planning application was submitted five years' ago.  It is disappointing that it has taken so long to come to a resolution.  We are expecting a decision from the European Court of Justice early in the new year.  The oral hearing has been held.  The Advocate-General will give his recommendation to the Court later this month.  <\/p><p>  At this stage we will not do much work on plan B.  We have had conversations with Galway and with the Minister.  We know what is involved if the Europa route is chosen.  However, we will not begin anything until the decision is announced in the next few months.  The delay in the Gort to Tuam route is because we are awaiting confirmation of funding.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Colreavy for his kind words.  The NRA is very aware that major investment in very large schemes some years' ago has meant that work was not carried out on some of the minor roads to any great degree.  As the funding became tighter, the NRA, in partnership with the local authorities, set out to identify the 50 worst bends in the country to see if these could be fixed.  Once these 50 are corrected, we hope to deal with the next 50 and so on.  We intend to continue to make the local improvements which are so very necessary.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about expenditure committed to road projects which cannot now proceed. I will describe the sequence of events for all road projects - including those already built and those to be built in the future.  The NRA submits the planned project to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval.  Once approval is granted the NRA or the local authority concerned must exercise the notice to treat which is the notice of the right to compulsory acquisition of the land within a limited period of that decision.  We will very often acquire the land well in advance of the building of the road.  If the NRA does not acquire the land, the power to do so lapses.  In some cases, the NRA has land for years before the road is built and in other cases we acquire the land and begin to build the road immediately, depending on the funding situation.  In the scheme of how roads are developed, I do not see any way that the NRA can avoid acquiring land well in advance of construction.<\/p><p>  The NRA does not have large land banks around the country to allow for schemes which have no prospect of being built.  Land has been acquired for schemes such as the New Ross bypass and the Enniscorthy bypass where progress stopped some time ago because of the funding situation.  However, we will be returning to those schemes.  Funding for those schemes may be available under the growth initiative.  I do not foresee the NRA holding land where there is no longer any prospect of construction of a scheme.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Deputy that there are gaps in route.  There have been gaps in many of the long routes such as the road from Dublin to Cork, Limerick or Sligo.  Sections of the road may be finished ahead of others.  The difference in the case of the N4 is that there was a continuous flow of funding for the construction of the interurban routes to Cork, Waterford and Galway but we do not have a continuous flow of funding for the N4.  The construction of the N4 would have followed the same pattern as the other routes if the funding situation had continued as it was.  We would have built sections in sequence.  I acknowledge the road needs fixing and some local improvements are currently underway at the very worst spots.  These improvements are badly needed.  I know this is not the ultimate answer but these improvements are designed to tide us over until such time as we have the money to do the full job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012111400010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1352889300,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Barry indicate whether the land for the 12 km length of very bad road has been purchased to facilitate the new build?

Service stations are limited in what they can charge for fuel and those limits are tied to the prevailing prices in particular areas.

The price of land had become so expensive - this is not the case anymore - that it was accounting for almost 25% of the cost of developing new motorways, which was extraordinary.  The cost of this land is also a factor.  It is not that the money might not be well spent.  If one had an endless supply of money, one could ask whether it would be better to spend more money on acquiring sufficient land to accommodate a wider central reservation or whether it should be used to carry out works - which might give rise to greater benefits - in other places.<\/p><p>  On wire rope tags and barrier standards generally, the performance standards we lay down are based on the European standards which apply.  Under design-build contracts, contractors can put in place steel, concrete or whatever type of barrier they desire provided it meets the required standards.  Wire barriers are still in use on two-plus-two roads, which are not motorway standard routes.  These are lower-speed central barriers.  I accept that barriers of this type are referred to as \"cheese cutters\" but there are no instances we can find, from anywhere in the world, of their actually operating as cheese cutters.  These barriers are not generally used on roads with speed limits of 120 km\/h.  They are, however, used on roads on which the speed limit is 100 km\/h.  Our problems with them are, perhaps, different to others.  We are concerned that the maintenance costs relating to these barriers are higher than those relating to other barriers.  We and others may be using these barriers less in the future.  However, those steel barriers are quite strong and they do perform their function of separating the traffic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012111400011#K01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1352889900,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I have seen what joyriders have done to such barriers in the area north of Dundalk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012111400011#K01400","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352889900,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I am not disagreeing with the Senator.

To date, PPP companies have invested a little over &euro;2.1 billion in the road system.  This is being repaid to them.  As the Senator will be aware, nothing is free.

The net figure we receive from tolls is in the region of &euro;60 million.  Most of our funding comes from the Exchequer and it is out of this that we pay money to the PPP companies.<\/p><p>  Standing water is probably more noticeable on the new motorways than it is on older roads.  More than anything, the speed at which a vehicle is travelling is what gives rise to the level of spray.  While there are speed restrictions in place on our better roads in respect of heavy goods vehicles, I am not sure that all such vehicles adhere to those limits.  I am quite sure that if they did adhere to them, there would perhaps be significantly less spray.  That is the main, but not the only, issue in respect of spray.  I accept that there may also be other factors involved.<\/p><p>  Traffic accidents must be investigated by the Garda.  I would certainly not suggest that responsibility in this regard be moved to our or any other organisation.  There are guidelines in respect of signage, lighting and preventative measures relating to road works.
