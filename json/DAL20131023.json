Later that evening the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, contradicted the Minister for Finance when he confirmed that the policy change would affect approximately 500,000 insurance holders.  In the hours after that the real and full story emerged, that the removal of the tax credits will impact on people with a basic level of health insurance.  Contrary to what Minister for Finance said, approximately 1.2 million people will be affected by this decision.  The VHI has confirmed that only 10 of its 93 policies will not be affected.  Insurance Ireland has said that the minimal additional cost will be &euro;100 to basic policyholders and up to &euro;360 per family.<\/p><p>  This will result in more families with children, and particularly older people, bearing a heavy burden for private health insurance.  It will lead to more people leaving private health insurance.  It is instructive that approximately 134,000 people under the age of 60 left private health insurance between 2011 and 2012, while approximately 23,000 over 60 have joined.  We need balance in the market and this is not sustainable.  &quot;The centre cannot hold&quot; in health insurance.  It is becoming unaffordable for many families and for many senior citizens.<\/p><p>  Will the Taoiseach accept that the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance was misleading and false because this measure will affect the majority of those who have health insurance?  Will he accept that it will be a particular burden on older people and on families with children, given the cost involved?

The position as outlined is that the design and focus of this budget is to get this country out of the bailout programme which it has been in for some time.  It is also designed to get our country back working through a range of measures.  The objective of the Minister for Health, as I have outlined on many occasions, is to reform the current health system, to bring about a single tier health service in which access to health care is based on need and not on ability to pay.

If over 100,000 young people leave, and if that continues, there is no way that the Government can sustain the older population who have health insurance and who depend on the packages that health insurance brings to them.  There will be more price hikes.  The decision, for example, to charge the full amount for private patients using public beds, even though the majority are PAYE workers, will add further price hikes in January, on top of the annual insurance company price hikes.  It is unaffordable now and it is becoming unaffordable month after month for thousands of families.  That is the point.  There is an incoherence at the heart of Government health policy.

It will consider the digital economy, innovation and services, social and economic issues and ongoing work on the economic and monetary union.  I have three equally important priorities at this summit: to contribute to a productive discussion on the digital economy, innovation and services as vital sources of future growth for Ireland and Europe; to push for action on developing digital skills in order to combat youth unemployment and to urge partners to reach agreement on the final elements of banking union, which is the outstanding political and economic priority which Heads of State and Government must address.  This will also be the final summit before Ireland's planned exit from the EU-IMF bailout programme in December.  I believe this will be an important achievement for Ireland and Europe, demonstrating that solidarity between European partners, allied to strong implementation, can actually be successful.<\/p><p>  It is essential that Ireland's return to the markets is sustained and durable.  As the House will be aware, the Minister for Finance is currently engaged in discussions with the troika partners on how best this can be achieved.  I have also written to each member of the European Council in advance of the summit and I look forward to the opportunity of updating my colleagues on this issue tomorrow.  I expect that Government will during the next few weeks weigh up all of the information received in regard to Ireland's exit from the bailout and its consequences prior to making its decision.  Overall, I am pleased that the focus on jobs and growth which was the defining feature of Ireland's Presidency is being continued.  Jobs and growth are priority issues for citizens in Ireland and across the continent.  I will work to ensure that Europe does not lose sight of this.  The Council must show that it can deliver where it matters.  <\/p><p>  It is fitting that the digital economy and innovation should be considered by Heads of State and Government on this occasion.  The digital economy is a huge source of growth and we must maximise its contribution.  Ireland is particularly well placed to contribute to this debate.  I am also convinced that the development of digital skills can make a tangible contribution to efforts to combat the dreadful blight of youth unemployment.  I will be pushing for action on this at the Council meeting.  Work on the stabilisation of the euro area is continuing.  As we know all too well in Ireland, the relative calm of recent months does not mean that the task is finished.  In Brussels, I will again push strongly for the completion of banking union.  Good progress has been made but now we need to get the job done.<\/p><p>  The Council agenda is extensive and in the course of our two day meeting we will also look at helping SMEs obtain financing - a further priority for my Government - and at the question of European regulatory fitness as well as the single market in services.  In addition, on Friday morning, the Council is expected to deal with foreign policy issues.  We will receive a briefing from the Lithuanian Presidency on preparations for the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius at the end of November.<\/p><p>We will also discuss the recent deeply sad events which saw hundreds of migrants drown near the Italian island of Lampedusa.  We were all shocked by the television pictures showing the extent of the tragedy.<\/p><p> Before getting into more detail on the different items, I would like to make a more general comment.  I am struck that the agenda for the European Council tomorrow is almost exactly the same as the provisional agenda announced by President von Rompuy some time ago.  This underlines the fact that while there is still much to be done, Europe has moved out of immediate crisis mode.  European Councils are no longer being completely overtaken by the events of the day.  We have the time now to consider seriously economic and social challenges and to take long-term decisions.  This is a positive development for all of us.  This is what the European Council should do.<\/p><p> Discussion tomorrow afternoon will open with a political debate on the digital economy, innovation and services.  I greatly welcome this as a contribution to ongoing work on the jobs and growth agenda.  The discussion also aligns with our own strengthening domestic policy focus on entrepreneurship and skills development, including through the Action Plan for Jobs and the Pathways to Work strategy.  Entrepreneurship will be fostered further by measures announced in last week's budget, namely, the start your own business scheme and capital gains tax relief for entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the disposal of assets into new investment in productive enterprise.<\/p><p> As a major centre for both home-grown and foreign digital sector companies, Ireland is perfectly positioned to contribute to this debate on the digital sector, as we did when we hosted the successful digital assembly in June.  The outcome from this summit, which I was very pleased to attend, has fed into the preparation of tomorrow's Council.  It is also noteworthy that the Council is meeting just ahead of the Dublin Web Summit next week.  The web summit has grown into a global gathering of more than 10,000 of the world's brightest minds in technology, representing not just technology companies and start ups, but all types of business being affected by new technologies.  That Dublin plays host to such a significant event underlines the extent to which Ireland has established itself as a digital hub.<\/p><p> With Europe facing unacceptably high levels of unemployment, the reality is that most new jobs are created by fast-growing young firms which is generally taken to mean firms that are less than five years old.  The key implication is that looking ahead five years, most of the new jobs created between now and then will be in firms that do not even exist today.  Europe must ensure that it is creating the right conditions to support new growth areas.  We need to recognise the role of coherent market rules in supporting trust and confidence in digital growth areas.  We must also be careful to avoid new administrative requirements that would impose disproportionate burdens of red tape on the job-creating engine of the economy.<\/p><p> A central prerequisite for growth will be to ensure that our education and training systems are in line with the needs of the digital sector.  The European Commission has estimated that by 2015 there could be up to 900,000 unfulfilled vacancies in the ICT sector.  This skills mismatch is not only detrimental to our economies, but at a time of mass youth unemployment it is frankly unacceptable.  I hope that the European Council will agree to concrete steps to address the skills shortage, including using part of the European Structural and investments funds for ICT education, support for retraining and vocational training in ICT.  This would build on the work being done under the Commission's grand coalition for digital jobs, launched during Ireland's EU Presidency.  Importantly, it would also be a concrete step towards combating unemployment and providing new prospects and new hope for young Europeans.<\/p><p> The European Commission estimates that the digital economy is growing at seven times the rate of the rest of the economy, but its potential is currently held back by a patchy pan-European policy framework.  This was why we placed such a strong emphasis on this area during our Presidency.  I am proud that we were able to make important progress on dossiers such as collective rights management, e-identification, data protection, cybersecurity and web accessibility, as well as on completing the European Network and Information Security Agency and public sector information legislation.  These were all important aspects of the Irish Presidency, and we are very happy to see them completed.<\/p><p> Discussions at this week's Council should be seen against the backdrop of the compact for growth and jobs.  Its goal is to achieve a well functioning digital single market by 2015.  There is much to be done to fulfil this objective, including in the copyright and data protection areas, which are very complex indeed.  A further focus here will be the connected Continent proposals for a single telecommunications market.  This was presented by the Commission last month as the most ambitious telecommunications market reform in 26 years.  Ireland has conveyed its broad support for this important and ambitious project, while also highlighting some particular sensitivities for smaller and peripheral member states, including in the spectrum management area.<\/p><p> Innovation will also be the focus of a political discussion at the Council.  The most recent competitiveness Council on 26 and 27 September highlighted a number of serious concerns. These include the fact that European business research and development continues to lag behind its main competitors and that the European Research Area is still too fragmented.  It is worrying that innovation and research performance across member states is not converging and that new European companies are growing more slowly than in US and failing to join the ranks of the world's largest firms.  These are matters of concern.  Against this background, the Commission has proposed a new innovation indicator that seeks to capture innovation outputs.  Discussions are still at a relatively early stage, but it is hoped that it will balance the existing emphasis on research and development intensity under the Europe 2020 strategy.<\/p><p>I expect this week's European Council meeting to provide political guidance for this work, which is of particular interest to Ireland.  We secured political agreement on the new Horizon 2020 package, which is now one of the world's largest public research programmes, under our Presidency in June.  Our shared challenge now is to maximise its impact.<\/p><p> There is an impressive level of research currently being carried out in Ireland.  I was reminded of this last week when I launched a &euro;52 million science and engineering initiative at the University of Limerick.  Known as the Bernal project and named after J.D. Bernal from Nenagh, this will make a significant contribution to our national research efforts in strategic areas such as pharmaceuticals, biomedical science and energy.  That is a great project and are five other world-class professors to be added to it, and I think it will lead to very significant results in the future.  While great strides have been made, there is absolutely no room for complacency at national or European level and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue with my European colleagues.<\/p><p> The European Council will also discuss the single market in services, particularly in terms of improving implementation of the services directive.  The Commission has recently completed the first phase of a peer review process that points to evidence of wide variations in professional regulation, legal form and shareholding practices across member states.  It also adopted a communication at the beginning of this month, announcing the start of an evaluation of national regulations on access to professions.  I support the work of the Commission here and will be pressing for a high level of ambition in our agreement on next steps.<\/p><p> Turning to social and economic issues, the European Council will review progress implementing the investment plan agreed in June and towards having the youth employment initiative fully operational from the beginning of 2014.  Significant progress was made in this area under the Irish Presidency.  As mentioned earlier, I will also be pushing for recognition of the concrete role which the development of digital skills can play in combating youth unemployment.<\/p><p> I am glad that the issue of SME financing is on the Council agenda again.  This is a key national issue for Ireland and indeed for all our economies.  There is an undeniable need for early and tangible progress and Ireland has taken a very proactive role in this discussion at European level.  It is clear that the European Investment Bank, EIB, has a crucial role to play, particularly in supporting recovery in economies hit hardest by the crisis.  Looking beyond the role of the EIB, it is clear that the whole area of non-bank financing for SMEs requires further attention.  Ireland is now actively involved in the work being taken forward by finance Ministers on foot of the Commission's Green Paper on long-term financing of the European economy.  I look forward to early, concrete proposals here.<\/p><p> There will also be initial political reactions to the Commission's regulatory fitness proposals, as presented at the beginning of this month.  I believe we should view our digital and smart regulation agendas as entirely interdependent.  The increasing complexity of the digital era places a new premium on making things as simple as possible, removing unnecessary barriers, and minimising transaction costs for the job-creating sectors.  We will press for clear objectives and timelines for specific measures on simplifying existing rules, withdrawing proposals that are not needed, and repealing legislation that is out of date.<\/p><p>This includes building on the Commission's earlier communication in March that has already identified the top-ten most burdensome pieces of EU legislation for SMEs.<\/p><p> The discussion on economic and monetary union is expected to take place tomorrow evening.  My clear priority in this discussion will be to press for the swift completion of banking union.  The issues involved are complex and sensitive but it is time now to move forward and finish the job.  We need to make good on the agreement to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.  As I have consistently said, it is vital to the Union's credibility that decisions taken by leaders are implemented in full.<\/p><p> Like other EU partners, Ireland relies on the stability of our Union, and of the euro area, to copperfasten our fragile recovery.  The recent stabilisation of sovereign borrowing rates in the Union is a product of hard-earned trust and confidence - trust that the banking union will be completed on time, and confidence that momentum will be maintained on our shared jobs and growth agenda.  These political commitments must be implemented.  No time can be lost in building on the decisions reached in 2012 and earlier this year on banking union legislation.  I hope this Council will point the way forward on this.<\/p><p> Turning to the foreign policy elements of the agenda, I expect briefing by the Lithuanian Presidency on the state of play of preparations for the Eastern Partnership Summit, to take place in Vilnius on 28 and 29 November.  The main business will be the initialling of association agreements with Moldova and Georgia and potentially the signing of the association agreement with Ukraine.  I am also expecting a discussion on the issues that arose following the tragedies near Lamepdusa. <\/p><p> I hope this provides an overview of the agenda to be discussed and I look forward to hearing Members' contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300008#F05200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382524800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>When these pre-summit debates were introduced in 2011, the Government stated that it intended to ensure the D&aacute;il had a real input into Ireland's policy at the most important level of the European Union.  This is the 19th session we have had since then and there has been more than enough time to draw conclusions about their effectiveness.  Unfortunately, this is yet another area where the Government has pretended to implement D&aacute;il reform but has done nothing of the sort.  There has been an increase in the amount of time given to European debate, but no one can credibly claim that the D&aacute;il has been allowed to make any input whatsoever into the positions taken by Government at these summits.<\/p><p>  The standard procedure, followed again today, is that the Taoiseach comes in and reads out a statement devoid of any real information.  Unless something has been agreed in advance, he never gives us any detail on what Ireland's specific negotiating objectives are - something which allows him always to return from summits and announce that he has achieved his objectives.<\/p><p>  These are supposed to be informed and constructive debates, but how can they be given that the Government has never circulated so much as a single piece of paper giving information about the summits and Ireland's proposals?  The D&aacute;il is informed of the general topics for discussion.  In order to be able to make any contribution to these debates, the Opposition has to seek even basic information directly from Europe.  When I have asked for details of material circulated by Ireland, or specific proposals put to Ireland, the Taoiseach has refused to provide the information in the House and has used a specific exemption from freedom of information legislation to block its release to me through that route.  The Taoiseach has come to these debates and praised himself for rejecting a proposal but has blocked us from seeing the content of the proposal he rejected.<\/p><p>  As we have seen yet again in the past week, this Government is more obsessed with public relations than any in our history.  On European policy, the Government works in the hope that journalists will not look beyond the briefings and is, therefore, even more prone to systematic self-congratulation and exaggeration.  The reality is that there is an unprecedented range of major issues currently under discussion in the European Council.  These touch on the fundamental architecture of the European Union as well as every major economic and social policy.  A number of member states have even initiated reviews of all existing Union competencies and are preparing proposals to roll back long-established actions.<\/p><p>  In spite of this the Government has yet to make a significant public statement setting out its position on any of these matters.  The President of the Council has held consultations on what formal changes to the European Union treaties should be sought to deal fully with the flaws in monetary union.  He consulted our Government, but we have no idea how it responded.  He published a proposal called &quot;Towards a Genuine Economic &amp;amp; Monetary Union&quot; in June of last year, but the Government has yet to outline its response.  Worst of all, our neighbouring state and largest trading partner, whose jurisdiction extends to an important part of this island, has announced that it will potentially leave the European Union in four years' time and yet the Government is silent beyond uttering banal generalities.<\/p><p>  It is long past time for the Government to start being open on what, if any, its objectives are in European matters, and to set out in specific terms exactly where it feels the best interests of Ireland and Europe lie.  Only then will we actually start having meaningful debates here.  The current approach, which is marginalising both the Oireachtas and the wider public, should stop.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, announced a new phase in the public relations strategy, when he announced that he was negotiating an exit from the bailout with the European Central Bank.  It is clearly intended that between now and December we will be treated to another round of breathless reports from &quot;Government insiders&quot; about their heroic efforts.  This brings to mind the very insightful media commentary last month about how the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has become a master of misdirection.<\/p><p>  The fact is that there is no exit to be negotiated.  The programme agreed in late 2010 will come to an end.  Even though it voted against 70% of the measures required to meet the targets in the programme, the Government has rolled out its strategy of praising itself as the saviour of the nation.  This is fooling no one who pays attention.<\/p><p>  What is more serious is that the Government is clearly putting self-promotion ahead of measures which Ireland needs and deserves.  Ireland has not yet received equal treatment with other countries.  Most importantly, the European Central Bank is keeping as profit interest it earns on its holdings of Irish bonds.  These profits are returned to Greece, but we will this year lose &euro;500 million in these payments.  As this has not been mentioned publicly by any member of Government and given its tendency to leak anything at all that might make it look good, we must assume that this issue has not been put on the agenda.<\/p><p>  As the Taoiseach will remember, it took him nearly a year and a half before he was willing to, albeit for a very brief period and only once in public, accept that Ireland required a bailout and was forced to carry an excessive debt.  It is worth repeating what he said then: &quot;Ireland was the first and only country which had a European position imposed upon it in the sense that there wasn't the opportunity, if the government so wished, to do it their way by burning bondholders.&quot;<\/p><p>  The larger the backstop and the more explicit for Irish borrowing, the more secure and affordable will be market access for us in the post-troika funding period.  What is Ireland seeking?  Are we asking for the security of a backstop or not?  What is our estimate for how much it might be worth in reduced interest?  Until the Government starts providing even basic answers to these questions, people will be justified in believing that all that is under way is another public relations campaign leading up to a lot of backslapping in December.  Of course this backslapping has a tendency to cover up how little was asked for or given.  There are many examples of this, including the Government announcement made by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in Washington, now long forgotten that burning of bondholders was on the way.<\/p><p>  The best, however, remains the press conference in June of last year when the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, were giddy in their outlining of how they had just achieved a breakthrough on financing banks.  The agreement of the European Council to potentially directly recapitalise banks with European Union funding - something Ireland had neither put on the agenda nor lobbied for - was, they claimed, a great victory for Ireland worth potentially up to &euro;60 billion.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, in his typical way of taking credit without actually delivering, replied when asked what he was looking for said, &quot;It's clear you've never been to the Fair of Glin or sold a calf.  Sure, if I told them the minimum, that's what they would give me.&quot;  So far it has been worth exactly nothing to Ireland and it appears unlikely to be worth anything in the future outside of another financial crisis.<\/p><p>  I have said many times that a core priority for Ireland should be to seek an amended mandate for the European Central Bank.<\/p><p>Adding employment and growth to the targeting of inflation is essential if we are to have a European Central Bank which is a foundation for security rather than uncertainty.  Mario Draghi has made a remarkably positive impact and it is almost frightening to imagine what would have happened last year if he had not faced down opponents to replace the failed orthodoxies and rigid policies of his predecessor.  There is a new problem in that the Bundesbank has begun blaming the low ECB interest rate this week for an emerging house price boom in larger German cities.  This is clearly a prelude to a push for higher rates.  Ireland should join other countries in demanding that rates be set only in the interests of the eurozone as a whole.  With crisis levels of unemployment, universal fiscal austerity and weak growth, the last thing Europe needs is rising interest rates.<\/p><p> This fifth summit of the year is yet another where the agenda is highly complacent.  It does not display either the urgency or ambition which Europe needs.  Important social and economic issues will be discussed but within the context of existing agreements and policies.  The opening topic relates to the digital economy and innovation.  Ireland should strongly support the proposals to strengthen the Single Market in this regard.  We have many dynamic companies and a wide skills base built up over a decade and a half and the country is well poised to benefit from a more successful Single Market.  In this respect, the Government should re-evaluate last week's budget and its potential impact on an area which is of growing economic and fiscal importance to us.  We successfully reoriented much of the enterprise work of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to this area.  An integrated policy has included everything from supporting frontier basic research through to targeted IDA Ireland activity.  It has been so successful that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, have decided to whitewash this history from their speeches and publications.  Given that so much has been deliberately covered up in the budget documentation, it is not clear where many of the cuts will fall, but it is known that &euro;15 million is to be cut from the enterprise agencies.  Since innovation is all that this money is spent on, it is a damaging decision which directly contradicts the Taoiseach's statement to be a supporter of expanded support for research and innovation.  I congratulate the officials of the Department on their successful clearing during the Presidency of the first hurdle for enacting the Horizon 2020 research programme.  The last-minute cut to the programme made by leaders was foolish, but the sooner it is up and running, the better.<\/p><p> Over dinner on Thursday night leaders are due to talk with Mario Draghi about a broad range of economic issues, including the balance sheet assessment of banks.  The time allocated does not suggest that any significant developments are likely.  Ireland should use this opportunity to speak up on the flawed banking union proposals which are progressing slowly and being watered down at every stage.  Without common regulation and, in particular, some sort of common pool for deposit insurance, the banking union will fail and threaten us with another financial meltdown.  More important, it will prevent a restoration of the confidence which is essential for the financial system to be able to return to proper levels of lending to small and medium enterprises and families.<\/p><p> The eastern partnership is on the agenda.  It is clearly necessary for the Union to assert again that we see respect for human rights as a core requirement for deepening our relationships.  The release of Yulia Tymoshenko is welcome but it in no way addresses the deeper issues which should give us all cause for concern with regard to Ukraine and the direction it is taking.<\/p><p> I call on the Government to break the habit it has developed during the 18 previous such sessions we have held and to start outlining some special details about what policies Ireland is promoting and supporting.  If the Government continues the policy of bland generalities mixed with regular self-praise, it will confirm again that when it comes to being open and accountable, it will talk but never deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300010#H00200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382525400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I intend to share time with Deputy Dessie Ellis.

I thank the Taoiseach for his remarks as well.<\/p><p>  As the Taoiseach pointed out, the agenda of the European Council meeting is intended to focus on competitiveness, the digital economy, innovation and services.  None the less, the revelation by the Government of the United States of spying on the governments of EU member states through its National Security Agency programme will undoubtedly be raised.  The Taoiseach never mentioned this and therefore we do not know the Government's view.  Does the Taoiseach share the French Government's concern at these revelations?  If it is raised, which it almost certainly will be, what will the Taoiseach say on behalf of the people?<\/p><p>  There is also a significant dispute surrounding the EU budget and the urgent request from the President of the European Commission for a &euro;2.7 billion supplementary budget.  Mr. Barroso has warned that without a deal on the matter the Commission will no longer be in a position to meet its financial obligations by mid-November.  He is looking for the governments to vote this through quickly and there are concerns despite indications this morning that the EU Presidency has brokered some sort of deal.  Concerns remain surrounding future EU spending.  MEPs are angry as well and are venting their anger because their request for a &euro;3.9 billion budget supplement has not yet been approved.  As a result of all this, the vote on the EU budget for 2014 to 2020 has been postponed.  Consequently, this Council meeting takes on even more significance.  I note the Taoiseach did not mention any of these matters in any detail in his remarks.<\/p><p>  The postponement of the multi-annual financial framework budget vote also means the postponement of the debate on a series of legislative packages that were dependent on MFF funding and which cannot operate without it.  We understand a special meeting of ministers with responsibility for EU affairs is scheduled for 30 October.  Where does all of this sit with the Government's boast in June that it had secured the EU budget, that the MFF was all wrapped up and that it was a done deal?  There is no evidence of that.  On the contrary, we have a high stakes battle between the Council and the Parliament and the question is who will give way first.<\/p><p>  The most important question is what the Government will propose because this is not the fair at Glin, this is the D&aacute;il, and we are entitled to know the Government's position and its proposals to solve the crisis.  What will the Government bring to the EU affairs ministers meeting at the end of the month?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the proposed MFF is an austerity laden budget that will attempt to lock the EU into austerity policies for the next seven years?  Those of us who live in the real world know that what is needed is more investment in the struggling economies of member states to get growth, quality job creation and citizens, especially young citizens, into work.  What is needed is an end to waste, especially in the over-inflated administration budget and a stop to the ludicrous and expensive moving between Brussels and Strasbourg.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach tells us we are almost at the end of the bailout programme.  A total of &euro;67 billion was borrowed from the troika, &euro;65 billion of which was put into the banks.  For six years ordinary and hard-working taxpayers were told that taxes needed to rise and public services and wages had to be cut to pay for the bailout.  We were told the bailout was needed to pay for the wages of our hard-working public servants and front-line workers.  Yet it is these same low and middle income civil servants who are being hardest hit by the Government's crippling austerity policies.<\/p><p>  The people want to see us leave the bailout, but what does that mean?  What effect will it have on average Irish citizens?  We continue to get spin.  The Government is spinning the yarn that the brutal austerity it decided to implement as a policy decision was all because the troika forced the Government to impose it, but that is not the case.  The Government had choices and it decided to opt for austerity.  That was a policy choice the Government made.  The troika, the big boys, did not make the Government do it.  It did not make the Government go beyond next year's targets with more austerity and it has never told the Government where the axe should fall.<\/p><p>It did not ask or tell the Government to go a further &euro;480 million beyond its target, with more cuts and taxes, in budget 2014.<\/p><p> There must be clarity from the Government on many of these issues because otherwise, the debate simply becomes a bland exchange of assertions from one side to the other.  To make matters worse, the stance taken by the Government in respect of its negotiating position and policy at European level ensured there was no debt write-off, no commitment on the bank debt and no easing up on austerity.  Members need to know what changes this exit will bring.  Will there be a lifting of the constraints on our sovereignty?  What is our sovereignty?  Members should consider the reality of how much control we have over our own affairs.  It is known that future Government decisions on the economy will go under German and European Union surveillance for a long time but with no <i>quid pro quo<\/i>.  Moreover, next year's budget, like the one for this year, will be passed in Brussels, Frankfurt and Berlin before the Government eventually introduces it in this Chamber.  In addition, the Government will not allow debates in this Chamber of the requisite length and depth.  While there have been many congratulations - fair play to the Government, which has been congratulating itself - the facts speak for themselves.  In 2008, the deficit was just over 7% and in 2013, the deficit remains just over 7%.  In the interim, the Government has taken &euro;28 billion out of the economy, crucified Irish families and decimated public services, while all the time protecting the banks.  This is hardly a cause for celebration.<\/p><p> At the beginning of this month, the Special EU Programmes Body announced it was withdrawing its offer of &pound;18 million in financial support to construct a peace and reconciliation centre on the site of the former Long Kesh prison camp.  This money was withdrawn on foot of the reneging by the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, on a programme for Government commitment to construct\u00a0the centre.  The DUP has broken a programme for Government commitment, has snubbed more than &euro;21 million of hard-won EU funding and has jeopardised an opportunity to build a centre which would have been a catalyst for other investment that could have created up to 5,000 jobs.  The Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, has publically stated his commitment and determination to retrieve this project and have the funding reinstated.  Will the Government also do all it can at a bilateral and EU level to ensure this funding is reinstated?  The idea of a peace centre that can examine the legacy of conflict and learn the lessons therefrom is vitally important.  The Taoiseach could learn lessons from it.  In response to my questions to him this morning, he made a totally inappropriate remark about a dreadful incident that happened in my constituency of West Belfast on this day 20 years ago.  If such matters are to be discussed, it should be done in a mature, reflective way that learns the lessons and not to make cheap political points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300011#J00200","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382526000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I did not intend it that way Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300012#K00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1382526000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och as labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  I am thankful to be speaking on this subject.  I also wish to express my gratitude to Edward Snowden for his courageous work in exposing the USA&rsquo;s secret spying programme.  During the summer, we learned that US agencies were secretly bugging the EU mission and member states in New York and its embassy in Washington, as well as the French Embassy in Washington and France's office at the United Nations in New York.  It has now been revealed that more than 70 million French telephone calls were recorded in one 30-day period by the National Security Agency, NSA, late last year.  It has been found that the interceptions were likely to have targeted people in business, politics and the French Administration, not those who it could be argued threaten America&rsquo;s national security.  The USA clearly is gathering inside knowledge of policy disagreements on global issues and other rifts between member states, particularly on the transatlantic trading and investment partnership, TTIP.  Does the Taoiseach intend to raise this issue at the European Council this week?  Will he advocate that the TTIP negotiations be stopped due to the USA&rsquo;s illegal spying?  It is ridiculous that this meeting will discuss EU-US co-operation on the digital industry and progress on new European data privacy laws and not face up to this huge elephant in the room.  There are a lot of negative consequences of a TTIP for agricultural sovereignty, and ideologically Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to what it seeks to create.  However, at a basic level, how can the EU push on with these discussions and negotiations if there is no protection of private data for EU governments or citizens?  The US Government has yet to even admit fault and apologise for its actions against so-called allies.<\/p><p>  The agenda for this European Council includes a discussion on the progress of the youth employment initiative and the aim to make it fully operational by January 2014.  The latest EUROSTAT figures show youth unemployment is at 23% across EU member states but the picture is even gloomier when looking at the jobless rate of under-25s in some crisis-hit countries.  For example, it is 55.6% in Spain and 63% in Greece, while this State&rsquo;s rate is more than 30%.  This does not take into account the mass emigration of Irish citizens.  It is estimated that over the last five years, 177,000 young people aged between 15 and 24 emigrated.  This exodus exceeds even the previous crisis of the 1980s.  This is not a lifestyle choice.  Families and communities across Ireland and those forced to leave know that for them, emigration is an economic necessity.  Although 89,000 people left last year, unemployment fell by just 23,000, which constitutes a 1% decrease in the unemployment rate.  It is clear that the policy of Fine Gael and the Labour Party is failing the people and the economy.  One way to reduce these trends would be a robust, funded youth guarantee scheme that would create quality full-time employment for those aged 25 or under.  Last week the Government announced it was cutting the jobseeker's benefit rate for the under-25s.  Those aged 21 to 24 will lose almost 33% of their weekly payment, while 25-year olds will lose 25% of their payment.  Basically, the Government is kicking the future of this country when it is down, while wrapping it up in negative spin and blame.  One is told that young people are lazy and this cut will shock them into work.  One Labour Party Deputy stooped to portraying young people as stuck to flat screen televisions and being uninterested in working.<\/p><p>  This illogical cut gives young people just one guarantee, namely, emigration.  The meagre &euro;14 million that has been announced for the youth guarantee scheme will do nothing to stop this.  The Government seeks to force young people into temporary or precarious employment.  Failing that, it will shame them into the JobBridge scam, thereby providing free labour for what would be full-time jobs with negative propaganda that they are lazy and unwilling to work.  Cuts in jobseeker's allowance will despatch the rest to another country, thereby passing the buck once again.  I take it that nothing else will change after this European Council meeting and discussion except an increase in the empty rhetoric over real investment in young people.  The Gathering has nearly finished and 2014 will be the scattering for the young people because of the inadequate responses from the Government at a state and EU level.<\/p><p>  Earlier this month, everyone was shocked by the Lampedusa boat disaster that killed more than 350 immigrants and many other similar disasters have occurred with much loss of life.  Shockingly, survivors of the disaster were excluded from the funeral ceremony, which also fell short of the full state funeral the Italian Government originally had promised.  This must be a massive wake-up for the European Union to increase the support it provides to prevent similar tragedies in the future.  A lack of action from EU member states is leading to an increase risk of maritime disaster in the Mediterranean Sea.  In fact, further inaction could lead it to become a graveyard for the vulnerable and impoverished.  The solution is not to create a fortress Europe or to shove vulnerable migrants into overcrowded, inhuman and prison-like camps.<\/p><p>We need to tackle the root causes of these migration trends and to ensure that the EU protects the dignity and human rights of all people within its territory.  Does the Taoiseach plan to raise this issue at the European Council meeting?  Does he have any plans to take action to prevent such tragedies in the future, including measures that address their root causes and that place the vulnerability and human rights of migrants at the centre of any response?<i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300012#K00300","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382526600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot will be shared by Deputies Ross, Boyd Barrett and Wallace who will each have five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300013#L00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1382526600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>If Angela Merkel was reading the Taoiseach's speech, or got of a copy of it early, she would be a pretty happy Chancellor.  The speech that was delivered here today is a confirmation that the Irish Government has been sucked into a swamp of complacency every time its representatives go to Europe.  It is a great pity the Taoiseach delivered a speech which, as the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party described it, was one of satisfaction and self-congratulation.  That speech is certainly acceptable in Europe and would please the powers that be in Europe.  That sort of self-congratulation in saying &quot;all is going well&quot; is fine but I would like to hear the Taoiseach say something else.  I would like him to go to Europe tomorrow and deliver a speech outlining what is happening in Ireland and what the effect of Mrs. Merkel's budget is in Ireland.  It is all very well to stand up and say we are going to deliver for Europe and for Ireland.  I want him to deliver for Ireland first and for Europe second and not in equal proportions.  I want him to tell Mrs. Merkel what happened on the streets outside this House yesterday and what was the effect of her budget and what she dictated to us here.<\/p><p>  The Irish people are not happy with the sort of message they are getting from Europe, that all is going well and that their budgets and diktats are acceptable.  They are not happy with Mr. Sch&auml;uble saying Ireland is okay, it does not need any more recapitalisation.  That is not acceptable.  We are not in the sort of situation that speech gives the impression we are in.  That is planet Europe but this is planet Dublin and planet Ireland.  Ours are an unhappy people, unhappy because of what is happening over there.  The least we can expect is for the Taoiseach to deliver that message when he goes over there and not a message of how successful we are and the successful Europeans that we are.<\/p><p>  There is a lesson for us in what is happening in Greece.  I am not suggesting we should have the same sort activity but there is a lesson for us in the fact that the Greeks have got a better deal than we have got because they are prepared, and it is beginning to happen here, to show some sort of resistance to the sort of austerity which is continually coming from Brussels and Berlin.<\/p><p>  I would like to have heard something else from the Taoiseach.  He will be aware of the very important and critical controversy which broke out two weeks ago in <i>The Wall Street Journal <\/i> and in the press throughout Europe, although it did not receive a huge amount of press coverage here but it is accepted and is absolutely authoritative, regarding the discussions that are going on between the CSU, Mrs. Merkel's party, and her putative coalition partners.  What is top of the agenda there?  Ireland is top of agenda in those discussions.  Ireland is being threatened by the putative partners of Mrs. Merkel with our corporate tax rate, recapitalisation and credit line being in the melting pot again.  What we want to hear is that we do not have to pay a price in corporate tax.  Regarding the recapitalisation that was supposedly promised, and I remind the Taoiseach I was the first person on 29 June 2012 to congratulate him on achieving it, I notice an ominous paragraph in his speech which states: &quot;As I have consistently said, it is vital to the Union's credibility that decisions taken by leaders are implemented in full&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300013#L00300","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1382526600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300013#L00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1382526600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I assume he was referring to the 29 June pledge that he brought back to this House.

There is no exit of it, there is only a technical exit of it.  We will go out of the frying pan of troika control into the fire of more troika control under a different guise.  Even if it is not set out in these arrangements that are now being discussed for some sort of funding line from the IMF or the troika, we have the fiscal treaty, which will also bind us in with all the same constraints.  I would like a straight answer from the Government on this issue which was raised during the fiscal treaty debate, namely, when does the conditionality and the requirements of the fiscal treaty start to kick in after we exit the bailout?  As I understand the treaty, we have to pay down our debt at 5% over a 20-year period.  That is a massive pay down of an enormous debt that has been loaded onto the backs of the people of this country.  As I recall the provisions of the treaty, there is a transition period of a few years before we have to stick strictly to that timeline but according to the treaty we have to start to move towards it immediately.  We have to begin to move in that direction.

The evidence that the Taoiseach is not succeeding in any meaningful sense of the word \"success\" was the mobilisation of our pensioners yesterday who finally spoke out about the truth of what the Taoiseach's Government is doing in imposing measures the impact of which are cruel and cause suffering and anxiety for some of the most vulnerable sectors of our society.<\/p><p>As Deputy Healy said during Leaders' Questions, in that process it is doing enormous damage to the legitimacy of the political institutions of this State as exposed in the quotes given in the House earlier, and I believe on television yesterday, by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, and the Taoiseach in opposition when they railed against even the suggestion that this would be done to pensioners but who are now doing exactly the measure they railed against.  Does the T&aacute;naiste not understand how damaging that is to the credibility of politics?<\/p><p> We should consider the frightening situation developing in places like Greece where such is the level of discrediting of political institutions that there is the rise of fascist and far-right organisations exploiting people's misery and despair and turning it in the most obnoxious directions.

It is good, given that we are an island community, that we had been happy to look beyond our shores, but the Irish people would never have guessed that so many decisions that affect their lives directly would be made by people who do not live here.  That is very disconcerting for them in our current situation.<\/p><p>  Ever since the referendum on the fiscal compact in 2012, carried by 30% of the electorate under dire threats of harsher budget cuts if the people delivered the wrong answer, we have effectively seen our sovereignty complete its migration to Frankfurt, Brussels and Berlin, and for what?  A pat on the head or, in the words of one German official, the accolade of being a model bailout student, and what a good student we have been.<\/p><p>  The Government has not erred from the terms of the troika's memorandum of understanding, and we are well on our way with its demands to amalgamate schools, the closure of public services like post offices and Garda stations, further erosion of democracy at local government level, chopping our health spending or cutting wages.  In the words of Susan Watkins, the editor of the <i>New Left Review<\/i>, &quot;Elected legislators in the target countries [of the European Financial Stability Facility] are reduced to clerks.&quot;  Watkins makes a special note in the case of Ireland when she writes that &quot;Irish TDs have so far internalized their subaltern status that a debate on designating June 16, Bloomsday, a public holiday, to celebrate the country's 'great literary tradition', was brought to a halt by a ministerial reminder that the Troika's permission would need to be sought first.&quot;<\/p><p>  Could the words of Angela Merkel in November 2012 have been any more to the point when she said that there is no such thing any more as domestic policy-making?  Instead of national sovereignty, or anything resembling a democracy, we have a collection of neoliberal clerks working on behalf of the markets, committed first and foremost to protecting investors, demanding austerity and deficit reduction, with scant regard for the dangers these policies pose to the economy, society and the environment.<\/p><p>  The party Whip system is used to keep everyone sitting on the Government benches firmly in line as it rams through Bill after Bill designed to reinforce our status as a model bailout student.  Any Deputy who loses the Whip or disobeys the order of the day is treated with a severity of punishment that would have any aspiring Mafia organisation taking detailed notes.<\/p><p>  How can the Government even pretend to be interested in investing local communities with the powers of democratic decision-making regarding their own affairs, a charade the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, is currently playing out, when nothing of the sort exists within its own ranks?  To paraphrase Nancy Fraser, one of the world's foremost political philosophers, in her analysis of the hollowing out of democracy, with the advent of globalisation, the international discussion that took place from the end of the Second World War until the 1970s over what should count as a just ordering of social relations within society has been distorted, and to a certain extent disregarded, as the goalposts have been moved.  The social processes shaping our lives now routinely overflow territorial borders.  Nations are faced with a new vulnerability to transnational forces and supranational and international organisations, both governmental and non-governmental.  Under this new way of thinking, people the world over find themselves struggling against despotic local and national authorities, transnational corporate greed and global neoliberalism, and the new governance structures of the global economy have vastly strengthened the ability of large corporations and investors to escape the regulatory and taxation powers of territorial states.<\/p><p>  This is a sorry state of affairs and one in which the Government is complicit.  It either lacks the capacity to think clearly about the implications of this movement or it does not have either the will or the integrity to do anything to counteract it.  In short, we desperately need to restore sovereignty and democracy to this country, and the T&aacute;naiste's Government manifestly has no intention of doing so.<\/p><p>  The market is corroding our communities, our infrastructure and our environment, and the members of this Government are its humble servants.  Only yesterday John Major, a former Conservative Minister, called on large excess profits of companies to be taxed in a windfall tax to help the millions of people in Britain who have to face a choice between eating or heating their homes this winter.

It will help to inform the Irish position at this week&rsquo;s European Council.<\/p><p>  When I spoke last week on the budget, I said it would copper-fasten the stability that has been so hard-won here in Ireland.  I also said that as a country, we had been through too much to put that stability and our ongoing recovery at risk.  It is precisely those same principles &ndash; securing stability and recovery &ndash; that will guide the Government&rsquo;s approach in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday.  It is in Ireland&rsquo;s interest and in all of Europe&rsquo;s interest that there is no momentum lost on the Union&rsquo;s jobs and growth agenda.<\/p><p>  Throughout the first half of this year, the Irish EU Presidency succeeded in moving the European Union from pure crisis management to focusing on real measures which make a real difference to people, backed by real resources.  When the last European Council took place in late June, the Taoiseach and I had at that stage just reached agreement with the European Parliament on an investment budget of almost &euro;1 trillion from 2014 to 2020.  We led a relentless drive for an EU-wide response to the scourge of youth unemployment, with real results in the form of a youth guarantee recommendation and an &euro;8 billion youth employment initiative focused on those most affected.  We delivered the results we aimed for on banking union, from the single supervisory mechanism to capital requirements rules, including limits on bankers&rsquo; bonuses.  We secured a mandate for an eventual EU-US trade agreement as a key driver for growth, and we put momentum behind Europe&rsquo;s digital agenda, including through hosting a major digital assembly in Dublin Castle towards the end of our Presidency.<\/p><p>  If anyone needed proof of the effect of these results and the momentum they created, they would just have to look at the agenda of this week&rsquo;s European Council meeting: the digital economy; innovation and services; combating youth unemployment; SME financing; better monitoring of social developments in economic policy co-ordination; and the next steps towards completing a banking union - an issue for this European Council and all European Councils.  In response to Deputy Ross, we will insist that every decision taken fully delivers on the euro area leaders' solemn commitment of June 2012 to break the vicious circle between sovereigns and banks.<\/p><p>  Stability, jobs and growth formed the lens through which we examined and advanced the Union&rsquo;s priorities in the first half of 2013, but it is no less relevant now as a test for our work at national and EU levels.  Economic, social and financial issues continue to be the ones most closely affecting our people, and so are the issues on which EU leaders must continue to focus.<\/p><p>  There are many important issues of national interest on the agenda for this week&rsquo;s European Council, but we particularly want tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting to give real impetus and real support to the digital sector.  At European level, the digital sector is an enormous source of growth and we must exploit its full potential.  Nationally, we have a substantial industrial presence in this sector - multinational and also indigenous - but most important of all is the potential of this sector to create the growth and employment we need and jobs in particular for young people.<\/p><p>  We know there are current and potential vacancies in ICT companies that are not being filled because of skills shortages.  ICT education, vocational training in ICT and retraining all have the potential to create new job prospects and new hope for this generation, a generation disproportionately affected by the economic and financial crisis.<\/p><p>  At EU level, we need to get the right regulatory framework in place to enable and encourage growth in the digital sector.<\/p><p>We were pleased the Irish Presidency was able to progress work on key digital and innovation files, including collective rights management, e-identification, data protection and cyber security.  However, work here must continue apace.  The European Council should underline our determination to complete the digital single market by 2015.  At the same time, we must ensure the impact of Horizon 2020 is maximised to provide research funding.<\/p><p> We will approach the entire European Council with considerable experience on each item, both from our Presidency and our national experience in recent years.  Above all, we will push for the momentum to be maintained and, indeed, ramped up so that the Union's fragile recovery can be fully stabilised and then grown, just as we are doing here at home.  Ireland needs the EU as a whole to achieve this, just as the Union has needed Ireland to emerge from its programme, which we will do in less than two months time. <\/p><p> I refer to the agenda items on eastern partnership, migration and some foreign policy issues likely to arise.  The inclusion of the eastern partnership item is an initiative of our successors as EU President, Lithuania.  They are perfectly positioned to drive this particular agenda and the Vilnius summit next month will mark an important step forward in the Union's relationship with its eastern neighbourhood.  I saw at first hand during Ireland's OSCE chairmanship in 2012 the great potential of this relationship and political backing from the European Council will be most welcome.<\/p><p> On migration and, in particular, the recent events in the Mediterranean, it is entirely correct that this tragic event is discussed at the European Council.  Work has begun already on this.  The Justice and Home Affairs Ministers held a detailed discussion on 3 October.  The events at Lampedusa were the latest in a series of similar tragic incidents in the Mediterranean in recent years and there was a consensus at the JHA Council on the need for a more focused and concerted Union effort to tackle the problem.  <\/p><p> To this end, the discussion concluded with an agreement to establish a joint task force for the Mediterranean, with the participation of the Commission, member states and relevant Union agencies.  The task force will be charged with developing an action plan aimed at providing a cohesive response to the problem by combining and, where possible, strengthening the various tools at the Union's disposal.  The task force will meet for the first time tomorrow as the European Council concludes and is to submit its first report to the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 5-6 December, ahead of the next European Council of 19-20 December.  <\/p><p> Again, I thank Deputies for contributions.  We will be back to report on the outcome of the Council in two weeks time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300014#M00500","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1382527800,"counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300015#N00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1382527800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Pat Deering - concerns regarding the location of pylons for EirGrid 25;  (2) Deputy Ann Phelan - concerns regarding the location of pylons for EirGrid 25;  (3) Deputies Paudie Coffey and Charles Flanagan - the need to adequately resource the senior alert scheme;  (4) Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy - the threat to manufacturing jobs at EJ (Cavanaghs) in Birr, County Offaly; (5) Deputy Jim Daly - the JobBridge scheme and job vacancies in the primary school sector;  (6) Deputy Catherine Murphy - proposals put forward to dispose of IBRC loan books in four segmented tranches;  (7) Deputy Kevin Humphreys - the transfer of information on flood protection works to insurance companies;  (8) Deputy Joan Collins - the need for a bilateral agreement with Egypt to return Faris Daniel Heeney to Ireland;  (9) Deputy Michael McGrath - the impact of changes to the one parent tax credit; (10) Deputy Billy Kelleher - the need to automatically issue a medical card to protect children receiving palliative care; (11) Deputy Eamonn Maloney - the need for further analysis of voluntary contributions in schools; (12) Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in - the need to discuss the ESRI report on school voluntary contributions; (13) Deputy Martin Ferris - an incident involving an infant in Bons Secours Hospital, Cork, last month;  (14) Deputy Mattie McGrath - the need to establish a formal agreement process whereby Irish and international auctioneers and valuers commit to not engage in selling repossessed family homes or businesses or homes or businesses in dispute along the lines of the model agreement recently secured by the Irish Mortgage Holders Association; (15) Deputy Clare Daly - the problems for subcontractors when the main contractor gets into financial difficulties; (16) Deputy Mick Wallace - the problems facing subcontractors when the main contractor runs into financial difficulty; (17) Deputy Robert Troy - the economic and social impact of introducing electronic payments for welfare payments; and (18) Deputy Dessie Ellis - the need to supply GPS enabled beacons for sufferers of dementia and similar disorders.<\/p><p>  The matters raised by Deputies Paudie Coffey and Charles Flanagan; Deputy Catherine Murphy; Deputy Kevin Humphreys; and Deputy Robert Troy have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300015#N00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Local Government Bill 2013: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1382527800,"counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300015#N00400"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382527800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382527800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>It is very disappointing the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is not present.  We have been waiting for this Bill for 12 months.  It was heralded as a major reform of local government but neither the Minister nor a Minister of State is present, which is disgraceful.  The Opposition is trying to put forward its views on the Bill but neither the Minister nor a Minister of State has come to the House to hear those views.  The document, Putting People First, was launched with much fanfare in Dublin Castle 12 months ago.  We finally get to see the Bill, which promised to be the most radical reform of local government in 100 years, but neither the Minister nor a Minister of State in the Department has turned up to discuss it with us.<\/p><p>  The Bill certainly contains some positives but to say it is radical or even reforming is a gross exaggeration.  Consecutive Governments have continued to undermine and under-fund local government in the name of reform.  With each passing decade, local government has lost powers and budgets.  There are some positives in the Bill and in the spirit of constructive opposition, I welcome those positives.  It gives a commitment to holding a plebiscite on a directly elected mayor for Dublin, for example.  However, the Bill goes on to state that the Minister, if the vote supports a directly elected mayor, will not act on the outcome for two years.  This is far too long.  The Minister should act within 12 months of the outcome of the plebiscite.  I must emphasise that Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see a mayoral office established with real powers.<\/p><p>  The proposal to establish economic development strategic policy groups in all local authorities is welcome.  It will allow local authorities provide practical support to local enterprises.  The reporting mechanism for councillors to provide information on a quarterly basis on their attendance at meetings, conferences and seminars will give the public a better insight into the work of the people they elect to local councils.  Sinn F&eacute;in also welcomes the introduction of a register of payments made to elected members in respect of attendance at conferences and seminars.  It is public money and the public has a right to know how these expenses are being spent.<\/p><p>  The Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the Local Authority Members Association have done good work over the years representing councillors' views and providing practical support.  I am glad to see a commitment from the Minister to meet them on an annual basis but we suggest the Minister meet those organisations, whether merged or not, twice yearly, in September in the lead-up to the budget and in the spring.  We also welcome the initiative to ensure local authorities' draft budgets are made available to the public by early October.  Will the Minister to take this a step further and ensure that councils have public events to engage the electorate in the process?<\/p><p>  The post of city and county manager will be replaced by a chief executive, which is a very welcome move.  It is something about which we have complained for years.  There will be a rebalancing of power between the executive and the elected councillors.  Hopefully, that will follow through in the various regulations flowing from the Bill.  That has been very much lacking in local government.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and the officials to relay that to the Minister.  <\/p><p>  The powers granted to the elected representatives are very limited.  Nowhere in Putting People First do the words &quot;power&quot; and &quot;councillor&quot; appear in the same sentence.  Having read the Bill, the explanatory memorandum and, in particular, appendix 3, it only serves to confirm there is a lot of hype but little substance.  No powers are devolved from any Department and no extra decision-making powers are given to councillors, although extra functions are given to local authorities.  A total of 27 reserved functions will be performed by municipal district members but this is a smokescreen because the municipal structure is a new one, so powers have to be moved over to it in the same way as an area committee would have made decisions.  That is happening by default.  <\/p><p>  Of the 105 functions outlined in the Bill, which may be performed by the local authorities, there is a very limited number of new ones.  These range from extending the period of permitted absence from attendance at local authority meetings to adopting a proposal for the alteration of the number of members of certain local authorities through to deciding on which days to hold special meetings.  That is already common practice and none of this is ground-breaking.  Allowing councils to adopt an annual report or to decide to hold or to cease to hold membership of an association of local authorities is not radical or historic.  All of this is already being done by local authorities. <\/p><p>  There are no proposals in the Bill to tackle the housing crisis or waste management issues, to provide education supports or to improve fire services.  The only reference to planning is to curtail councillors' powers through the removal of section 140 as it relates to planning.  No additional powers are being granted to councillors and no powers are being devolved by central government to local authorities.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see a more radical approach.  Having waited 12 months for the Local Government Bill 2013, I was hoping for a far more radical, progressive and reforming Bill.<\/p><p>I notice that the two speakers from the other Opposition party took contradictory positions on the town council issue yesterday evening.  The first Deputy to speak said he was in favour of the retention of town councils for towns with populations of more than 7,500.  The second speaker from that party, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, said he does not want any town councils.  We see towns and their hinterlands as the hub of local democracy.  We hope the new municipal districts will grow in a way that will result in them being seen as strong units of local government.  We have been let down so far, unfortunately.  What we have seen has fallen short of reform by any measure.  This Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, like its predecessor which was led by Fianna F&aacute;il, is taking powers away from councils in order to centralise them, mainly in the Custom House.  In contrast to what the Government has presented us with, Sinn F&eacute;in wants the maximum amount of power to be devolved from central government to local authority level.  We are in favour of a shift in powers from city and county managers to elected representatives.  As I said earlier, I welcome the indication in the Bill that this will happen.  We will certainly push for that to be followed through.<\/p><p> We are in favour of the transfer to local level of powers in areas like economic planning, waste management, water and sewerage and housing.  The stranglehold of various Departments, particularly the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, needs to be broken.  The current local government structures are not fit for purpose.  I am not sure this Bill will do enough to change that.  Our view is that any reform of local government must ensure local government services are delivered in an efficient and cost-effective manner, that local government structures are fit for purpose and that democratic accountability is at the core of the local government system.  This legislation does none of this.  Local government continues to be starved of funding as a consequence of the introduction of the regressive local property tax.  There will be huge pressure on local authorities to cut back on this double taxation, and the Minister should make no mistake about it.  People will continue to pay the same income tax while being hit with this extra tax, and without receiving the extra services they deserve.  This is happening at a time when householders are paying separately for an increasing number of services.  They pay separately for waste collection.  People in all counties are paying for the local fire service.  They will have to pay for water from the last quarter of 2014, when the local elections are out of the way.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in rejects the Government's reform proposal that involves cutting the number of councillors to 949.  This drastic decrease will leave the State with one of the lowest number of councillors per head of population of any European country or OECD member state.  If the officials check the figures, they will see I am correct in this assertion.  We propose that there should be a minimum of 1,165 councillors, or 216 more than the Government is proposing.  This would be in line with the reform of public administration in the Six Counties.  Councils are stifled by limited powers and a lack of funding.  The current local government structures should be maintained until real reform-based devolution of power from central government takes place.  In recent years, the powers of councillors have been eroded, particularly in areas like housing, transport, roads and waste management.  Unfortunately, responsibility for water services is about to be taken from local authorities as well.  This trend must be reversed.  Waste management, water, sewerage, planning and local transport must be among the reserved functions of local councils.<\/p><p> If local government is to be democratic and accountable and is to deliver, Sinn F&eacute;in believes significant and far-reaching reforms, rather than the window-dressing we see in this Bill, are needed.  The reforms we propose will lead to local authorities being fit for purpose.  The functions and powers of local authorities are central to their ability to plan, deliver, respond, provide good local services and, most important, be accountable to the public they serve.  These functions should not be undermined by departmental policies, especially cuts to funding or the privatisation of services.  The key services of local authorities should be housing, planning, environmental services, waste management, water and sanitary services, economic development, roads and policing.  We welcome the move towards giving local authorities a role in economic development.  Sinn F&eacute;in sees a number of other services as of central importance, such as recreation, youth services, arts and culture, community development and social services.  For the sake of time, I will focus on highlighting our priorities.<\/p><p> Our local authorities must once more have a central role in the provision of housing.  We have seen a shift to the voluntary and private sectors.  This was started by the previous Government when it allowed local authorities to lease private houses and enter into long-term liabilities.  Local authorities could build, preserve and provide an adequate supply of housing that is maintained and owned by councils at an affordable rent to the public.  Under our stimulus package, Sinn F&eacute;in proposes and is committed to building 9,000 homes in 18 months.  There are 112,000 people on housing lists across the 34 local authorities.  There are 33,000 empty homes in unfinished estates.  NAMA has identified 3,500 homes that are ready for allocation to social and voluntary housing.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has admitted that by the end of 2013, just 500 of those houses will be taken into social housing.  This is far too little and is unacceptable.  If this crisis is to be addressed, all 3,500 homes that have been identified must be taken into social housing and allocated as a matter of urgency.  As part of our economic stimulus programme, Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing that grants be made available from central government to local authorities to buy quality homes in unfinished estates at discount prices and rent them out as social houses.  The local authorities would receive rent and, at the end of a ten year, 20 year or 30 year period, they would have a valuable asset to sell to the tenant.  Most important, the tenant would have a permanent home.  That is the key point.  There is a precedent in this regard.  In past decades, the Land Commission took control of unused or under-used land and leased it to small farmers who were in desperate need of land.  The same principle could be applied in this case.<\/p><p> Local authorities must become priority creditors where developers have gone bankrupt and bonds have expired, which has happened in many counties.  This approach could be used by local authorities to acquire some housing units.  I appreciate that many thousands of units would not be acquired in this way.  I know of cases where there are no bonds and local authorities are left to finish off estates without any funding.  If the local authority was classed as a priority creditor, some of those units could be transferred to the authority in lieu of the cost of finishing the estate and the bonds that are not in place.  The rest of our housing needs can be met by implementing a public housing building programme.  We need to initiate a social housing building programme of at least 5,000 houses in the first year, with a further 4,000 houses in the first half of the second year.  We need to accelerate the regeneration programmes in Limerick and Dublin and complete them over a four year period.  Funding for a new building programme and the regeneration programme can be made available to local authorities by establishing housing trusts, which would be able to receive grants from the State and borrow from the European Investment Bank, for example.  The establishment of trusts is necessary because when local authorities borrow from the financial markets or institutions, it is added to the national debt.  This would not be the case with housing trusts.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that essential environmental and waste management services, including waste collection and management, should remain under local authority control.  Waste reduction and recycling programmes need to be vigorously implemented by local councils.  Councils should be the regulators of domestic waste collection services in their local areas.  Councils should draft, vote on and implement waste management plans.  They are not doing this at the moment.  When Noel Dempsey was Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the early part of the last decade, the power of local elected representatives to make waste management plans was taken from them.  The current situation, whereby city and county managers have the power to impose such plans, even if they provide for incinerators, is unacceptable and undemocratic.  The adoption of waste management plans must be the reserve function of council members.  Council policies need to be policy-proofed to ensure they are in line with the climate strategy.  We will be discussing the national climate change Bill soon.  Local authorities should draft and implement climate change action plans which are based on that Bill.  They should set specific local targets, based on national and international targets, for the reduction of emissions from energy use, transport, housing and waste management.  These targets will be developed following a consultation process with relevant experts and stakeholders.<\/p><p> Planning affects many aspects of our lives, including where we live, where we work and where our local schools are.<\/p><p>It affects everything, even where we socialise and how we travel.  We propose that local authorities have a stronger role in the planning process, with citizen participation, to plan for sustainable economic and social development that values the insights and knowledge of local communities and local community groups.  Years of planning scandals and corruption have allowed the planning process to be brought into disrepute.  Rather than reform the planning process and make it more accountable, consecutive governments have stripped away the powers of elected councillors.  Planning decisions are made by unaccountable bureaucrats and are more and more centralised.  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 takes power away from local councils, and local county development plans are swept to one side at the behest of multinational companies to clear the way for their needs.  <\/p><p> The planning process must be accountable, democratic and open.  We aim to create a more meaningful role for communities in planning and decision-making.  We want to ensure that there is real community involvement in drawing up the local development plans.  The Bill refers to local development plans but we want to see real civic participation at local level.  This can have a positive social, economic and environmental impact.<\/p><p> Water is a big topic at the moment.  It is a huge resource that we all need.  We have long called for a co-ordinated all-Ireland approach to water services.  We call for reformed local authorities to continue to own, maintain and develop the public water system to provide water to householders free at the point of delivery.  We feel very strongly that local authorities should continue to own it, to ensure democratic control of the resource.  We oppose the Government's plan to use public funds to install domestic water meters and to introduce water charges.  Local authorities need to keep water services.  The establishment of Irish Water will do nothing to improve the distribution of water.  As it moves to be a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, large parts of which the Government has said it will privatise, there is great concern that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will also be shifted to that category. <\/p><p> The Government has failed to develop a coherent island or State-wide spatial plan for economic development and failed to reach the targets of 50% of foreign direct investment, FDI, outside Cork and Dublin.  The FDI figures for the midland counties are paltry.  It is not happening.  Local representatives need to have a greater input into making areas more attractive for FDI.  We propose that local authorities plan for economic development that benefits the entire community.  We believe the key is to address economic recovery and growth at all levels.  Local councils should play a leading role, in conjunction with the Government, in promoting economic growth and jobs at a local level.<\/p><p> Local authorities should have local plans for this type of development.  We believe in economic development that is built on sustainability which fosters local native industry but also attracts IDA investment into an area.  Local authorities - some already do - should provide incubation units for start-ups.  That is having some success.  That too must be rolled out across the local authorities.  We need to develop an economic spatial plan in full consultation with local authorities, working alongside State agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland.<\/p><p> We need to return the power for roads and transport where it belongs, with democratically elected local councillors working in consultation with local engineers.  I was surprised as a councillor by the amount of micro-management of local roads by the Departments responsible for the environment and transport.  Local engineers told us they could not do this, that or the other for fear that when the inspector came down and drove around the roads of Trumra or Rosskelton or any other little townland, which they would find only by using Google maps, they might not be happy with what the engineers had done.  Local councillors working with the local area engineer should be given the discretion to use the money that is collected locally from car tax.  At the moment it is micro-managed in a fanatical way.  The way it works on the ground is ridiculous.  The local engineers and councillors must have more discretion. <\/p><p> Transport must focus on the movement of people and goods, rather than on the efficient movement of cars.  This can be done by increasing the availability of public transport, particularly rural transport.  Central to this must be local planning that makes it affordable and accessible.  In cities traffic congestion frustrates people and pollutes our environment.  Councillors and the public they represent know this only too well.  Local authorities are best placed to draft and implement the solutions to this problem.  For far too long local transport planning has been a central government function.  I have seen it become more centralised, which is very regrettable.  We must move away from the micro-management to which I referred earlier.  Roads and transport are an integral part of local, regional and national planning.  Roads and transport link people and their communities to where they work and to markets, schools and other facilities.<\/p><p> Policing is not mentioned in the Bill but many residents of urban and rural areas feel a sense of powerlessness when it comes to policing and crime prevention.  Anti-social behaviour and low level crime pose serious challenges in our communities.  These challenges are made more difficult by government cuts in garda&iacute; numbers and the public service employment embargo.  Local authorities must become central to accountable policing and crime prevention.  This includes combining traditional aspects of law enforcement with community-based prevention measures, problem-solving, community engagement and community partnerships.<\/p><p> Progress has been made with the introduction of the Garda Act 2004, which laid the foundation for the joint policing committees, JPCs, and local policing fora.  We supported that at the time.  There is more work to be done.  I attend those meetings but they have become a talking shop.  They are toothless and have little influence over policy or practice.  Compared with other jurisdictions, we could have much more effective JPCs.  These need to be reformed and to become more like the district policing partnerships in the North.  The Minister for Justice and Equality often refers me to the North.  I would refer him, if he were here, to the North on this point.  There are councillors and community representatives on the district policing partnerships in the North.  They have a direct input into local policing plans and strategies.  I say this in a very constructive way.  We must be able to hold the garda&iacute; to account at local level and to oversee the implementation of these local policing plans.  It would be good for the garda&iacute; and for communities.  The JPCs must also align with the new district municipal authorities, not the county structure.  They need to have the power to draft and implement policing and community safety strategies; to establish local neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes; and to introduce crime prevention measures, including restorative justice programmes.  These can be linked to community benefit.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister of State and his officials to take this proposal on board.  From a local authority point of view, the community would gain from restorative justice through which people would pay the community back.  We would like to see a link made between people taking responsibility and local ownership and long-term solutions put in place.  We need to do that to ensure that residents and councillors can influence policy at local level.  At central level we must also establish a central Garda board, the membership of which would include councillors, Deputies, the Garda Commissioner, representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach and of Education and Skills, Environment, Community and Local Government, the probation services and so on.  The board should have an independent chairperson.  It should be established on a statutory footing and have the power to draft and implement State-wide policing and community safety strategies and hold the local JPCs to account. <\/p><p>We want to see a fully integrated and standardised approach to policing and community safety.  There should be an assistant commissioner whose responsibility will be to work with local authorities and oversee agreed strategies.<\/p><p> We welcome reform of local government.  The Bill has some positive aspects which we will work to maximise.  We welcome any moves in a positive direction.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not contain the type of powers that need to be devolved to local level.  I do not see them in it.  The current structures are not fit for purpose.<\/p><p> The regional authorities will be turned into three regional assemblies.  The provision is for two representatives from each council who will attend on behalf of the council.  That means that there will be no Sinn F&eacute;in or independent representative.  In many county councils, the representatives will be from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Perhaps they will sign a pledge otherwise.  It will be Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael representatives who go to the regional assemblies and none from the other parties.  Labour, Sinn F&eacute;in and Independents might not get a look in and will depend on goodwill.  That should not happen.  We need to have a better system of divvying up those positions to ensure that all parties are represented on them  <\/p><p> The current structures are not fit for purpose.  We do not see the Bill as the solution because it does not go anywhere near far enough.  We will be seeking to maximise the positive aspects in it and to develop a better system of local government in the State.  We ask the Minister to revisit the Bill and bring forward strong amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300015#N00600","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382529600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is shared by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Richard Boyd Barrett.

The same was said about the reforms of the late 1990s which introduced county development boards, strategic policy committees and area committees.  The fact that we are now making the same claim shows the reform then was not radical enough.  There is no doubt that this is certainly a reform package, however, the question is whether it is the right package of reforms and whether it will be about returning power to the people, as it claims.  <\/p><p>  Like many Members of this House, I have some practical experience of serving at both town and county council level.  I served on both for over 20 years and my experience of both could not have been more different.  The Minister referred to the often negative context of engagement between the citizen and local government, referring to such matters as complaints, payments for a service or dependency-based roles.  That was what I experienced at county council level but not at town council level where there was a much more inclusive and positive engagement with citizens and where the experience was far more positive.  The town council on which I served, which was the most recent one established and one of only four established in the history of the State, had very limited powers but had a critical impact on the social development and physical appearance of the town.  The county council was a complex and complicated organ that citizens found very difficult to understand and navigate.  It also mainly delivered hard essential services like water and wastewater that did not require citizen engagement unless something went wrong.<\/p><p>  One of the central features of this legislation is the abolition of 80 town councils.  While I would not argue for the retention of all of them the abolition of many of the larger or more effective ones will make a huge difference and will be noticed almost immediately.   The Minister has established a working group chaired by Fr. Sean Healy that will consider a stronger role for the citizen.  The Minister could do worse than take one of the functioning town councils and use that as a case study.<\/p><p>  If political reform is to bear fruit we need to look at the whole set of political institutions rather than take a piecemeal approach.  In doing this, we must work to our strengths.  As a people, we have been capable of designing and building such great organisations and institutions such as the GAA, the credit union movement, the Tidy Towns associations and the Carers Association.  All of these associations were a response to a need and capture values such as solidarity, volunteerism and care.  Each association also functions within a defined geographic space with which people identify.  Imagine if we were to build such elements into a reformed local government system that is designed in such a way that allows the kind of flexibility to foster initiative that is obvious at local level rather than sterile institutions that often stifle that flexibility.  It is a system that works in harmony with its people rather than grates against them and is community rather than institution-focused.  If they are successful, such institutions will foster a culture that is outwardly focused rather than process-driven.  <\/p><p>  Some elements of the reform thinking in Putting People First are about achieving a town or municipal focus.  While there is universal cover achieved in the reforms proposed, what has not occurred is that these municipalities will exist as independent entities.  There seems to be a continuing resistance to cutting the umbilical cord  between the Department, the Minister and the county council.  While the county manager position will be changed to that of a CEO, the all-powerful County and City Managers Association will continue to exist and will continue to be the primary connection between the councils and the Customs House.   <\/p><p>  This Bill is littered with lines like &quot;The Minister specifies by order&quot;  or &quot;The Minister shall issue guidelines&quot;.  This highlights the unhealthy level of centralisation in evidence.  Without dealing with that, we will continue to clutter national politics with things that should more properly be done at local level.  I fully understand that cannot be achieved overnight and the stated intention is to make a start with some functions but to further devolve functions and powers over time.  Will there be an ongoing commitment to devolve more functions if the reform programmes are not seen to deliver anything additional, particularly given that the property tax will be in the funding mix.  Will local government or Departments bear new costs if further functions from other Departments are allocated to local government?<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for the establishment of the municipal tier, which looks like the renaming of area committees.  It is a fancy European name but I do not see much that is different in what is proposed.  Some of these municipal districts contain nothing but a collection of rural areas.  Identity is a key issue to the success of municipal district council.  While the county is identified with for Gaelic games, particularly in September of each year, I am not convinced it is a good administrative unit or  identifier.  Counties are not uniquely Irish.  They were established between the 12th and 17th centuries and were designed to be a means of control by the Crown.  That culture of control has, unfortunately, continued and is an impediment to unleashing the ability that is evident in every community across this country.  In terms of identity, I have referred in the past to the New Urban Living project carried by NUI Maynooth which identified four key elements to identity.  The study found that the attachment to place of local residents was influenced by four main factors: the built and natural environment; the cultural character and life of the area; the quality of informal associational life, which is really at town or community level; and elective belonging, which refers to the reasons why people had chosen to live in their place of residence.<\/p><p>  I am convinced we need to re-fashion our local government system in a way that allows people to govern themselves in a place they actually identify with and have elected to live in.  I also believe we need to decide what it is that local government should do and at what levels.  Sir Michael Lyons carried out a study in the UK and concluded that place shaping and the creative use of powers and influence to promote the general well-being of a community and its citizens should be the primary purpose of local government.  When we think of community, we tend to think of it at a much lower level than county level.  Indeed the organisations to which I referred earlier -  the GAA, the credit union movement and Tidy Towns - all have their foundation based well below county level.<\/p><p> As public representatives we have unique insights into how our citizens and communities function and we all have impressive stories to tell about the get up and go that is visible at a local level.  Unfortunately, we have a mediocre political system that lets down what happens at that level.  The paradox in Putting People First is that it acknowledges the role county government plays as an inherent part of Irish identity but, according to Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in's critique for the AMAI, \"[I]n one of the most radical proposals in regard to public service reform generally the focus of local government is towards the municipal level\".  My big concern is that while the focus is towards the municipal, the identity and resources are at the county level.  I hope I am proved wrong but it appears to be the opposite of what is required.<\/p><p> If you want to know where the real power lies its important to see how the budget will be handled.  Under Part 8 of the Bill, for example, the CEO of the county or city council shall consult the municipal district members.  The words &quot;shall consult&quot; could mean anything.  It certainly shows that the municipal districts will not be autonomous.  Another possible clue is the schedule of municipal district works provided for in section 103A(1), as follows: &ldquo;Following the adoption of the local authority budget, but before the start of each local financial year, a schedule of proposed works of maintenance and repair to be carried out during the financial year in each municipal district shall be prepared under the direction of the chief executive, having regard to the availability of resources.&quot;  This provision deals solely with hard services such as roads, footpaths and lighting.  Town councils do not appear to have a role in community building.<\/p><p> The Minister referred in his opening statement to new reserved functions for municipal districts but the sting in the tail was his comment that they will have a role in making charges on amenities, facilities or services provided by the local authorities within their districts.  These community charges were available throughout the Celtic tiger years but they were never imposed.  Given that they would be additional to the property tax, they simply are not going to happen.<\/p><p> The Bill proposes one local community development committee per county except where the Minister allows more.  This provision mistakenly assumes that &quot;local&quot; means &quot;county&quot;.  Community building does not generally occur at county level but I do not see where it is provided for at municipal level.  The county enterprise boards worked well but it is far from certain that their amalgamation into the business support units will work.  As the micro-enterprise sector is critical to creating new jobs in the small enterprise sector, this amalgamation gives rise to risks.<\/p><p> I object strongly to the provision in section 44(c) whereby the leader of each registered political party is automatically included in the corporate policy group.  Subsections (c)(i) and (ii) should be deleted.  The d&rsquo;Hondt system provides for a mathematical allocation based on what the citizens decide in an election.  The sections providing greater transparency on conferences and expenses and the move to training at a more local level are welcome developments.<\/p><p> Schedule 7 Sets out the number of councillors per authority.  Where there is a low population base a seat bonus is provided to make it possible to cover large areas with small populations.  The Minister stated that the revised council membership numbers will ensure more equitable representation and better proportionality, and outlined the figures in this regard.  Clearly, the equality is not perfect but, while it need not be perfect, it will have an impact on Seanad elections in that the in-built rural bias is retained.  In the absence of universal suffrage that needs to be addressed in any reform of how the Seanad is elected.  <\/p><p> The Bill provides for a number of amalgamations at county and city level and between county and town councils that were also rating authorities.  Section 29 allows for the harmonisation of commercial rates between towns and counties, with a maximum of ten years to comply.  The Minister argued this will allow elected members the discretion to link adjustments where possible to savings as they arise.  Is it intended to adjust rates upwards or downwards and will two or more rates bills issue for the same area?  How will this work in practice and will it lead to conflict where one part of a county or city feels it is subsidising another?<\/p><p> Section 31 Is a very significant change in regard to vacant properties.  While rates refunds for vacant properties outside of Dublin, Cork and Limerick cities are currently allowed at 100%, the Bill provides for the 50% refund applicable in these cities to be extended elsewhere.  This provision will cause serious hardship in areas that have lost a significant portion of their population or where spending power has decreased significantly.  The Minister indicated that he may revisit this matter as the Bill makes it way through the Houses.  It most certainly will be revisited and I will be putting down an amendment to seek a change to the matter.<\/p><p> Schedule 4 provides that all assets of the dissolved authorities will be transferred to the successor authority.  Town councils that had been prudent in putting funds towards projects in the future will see the funds transfer to the county council or the municipality - it is not clear which body will receive them.  In the case of Leixlip, for example, this would involve in excess of &euro;300,000, the loss of which could create real resentment among residents even before the new municipal council is established.  As other town councils will have liabilities, it is not clear whether the municipal district the county will be required to absorb them.<\/p><p> The changes to section 140 in respect of planning are welcome and were recommended by the Mahon tribunal.  However, I question the wording in section 40 which places an obligation on an SPC to have regard to the spatial and economic strategy to regional assembly.  The phrase &quot;have regard&quot; should be replaced with &ldquo;to be consistent with&rdquo; because the former phrase has long since been discredited.  The repeal of the legal provision to surcharge either officials or councillors is also welcome.  I have seen councillors threatened with surcharges if they did not adopt policies presented by officials.  <\/p><p> Part 9 provides for the creation of three regional assemblies to replace the regional authorities.  The regional and district council tiers should be more powerful because bigger regions would eliminate duplication of service across counties by amalgamating and centralising functions such as licensing and human resources.  They would also have greater purchasing powers.  Regional assemblies should be directly elected and made responsible for everything from transport to policing.<\/p><p> In practice, however, funding and human resources will determine what can be done, particularly in respect of discretionary funding.  Costs for salaries and council properties will, of course, absorb much of a council's income.  If funds are to be transferred from the council to the municipality, the key to enabling the work to proceed is to give councillors discretion over them.  The general purpose fund, which is largely made up from motor tax receipts, is collected locally before being centralised and redistributed based on the needs and resources model.  There are many flaws in that model and it particularly discriminates against growing areas.  In this regard, 2008 was the year the general purposes grant stood at almost &euro;1 billion but by 2013 it had decreased to &euro;640 million.  Since 2007 the other local authority income streams have also substantially declined.<\/p><p> When the property tax legislation was rammed through, one area that was not highlighted was that the money that was taken this year was entirely absorbed into the Central Fund.  We were told that it was a necessary measure aimed at the reduction of the national debt.  The Minister has stated that the local property tax is essential to renewing the relationship between local authorities and the citizens they serve.  I challenge his assertion at a time when local government is being stripped of the ability to deliver any additional services.  He also suggested that the changes would produce a stronger funding base.<\/p><p>Will he outline how he can justify that claim, given how much has been removed from the local government fund?  There is a high level of compliance with the property tax, primarily because the Revenue Commissioners can dip into people's pockets.  The increases in motor taxation have been wholly absorbed, affecting the general purpose grant.<\/p><p> Staffing resources vary widely across the country.  We are all aware that an embargo is, and is likely to remain, in place.  In Meath, there are 620 staff for a population of 184,135, yet Kerry has 1,166 staff, 546 more, for 40,000 fewer people.  Kildare has 835 staff for 210,000 people while Mayo has more than 1,000 staff for 90,000 fewer people.  It is clear the areas that will cope better with the changes are the ones with greater resources.  This will lead to difficulties at municipal level.  Housing administration, planning control, finance and human resources will absorb staff, rendering counties unable to deliver services.<\/p><p> Undoubtedly, Putting People First provides for discretion to decide what happens at municipal level.  Without dealing with the issue of resources, however, there will be a serious problem.  I echo Deputy Stanley's point about nominations to regional authorities, in that they will be significant negatives.<\/p><p> Municipal councils will be nothing more than area committees.  They are nothing more than a box-ticking exercise in the abolition of town councils and relate to the Government's claim that it has dumped a load of local politicians.  This development will be badly exposed.  I am not confident it will deliver the kind of local government reform we need and deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300018#Q00500","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382530800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Following on from that last sentiment, I equally have little confidence that the Bill will deal with this matter.  People from all sides of the political spectrum repeatedly state they want improvements in local government.  Undoubtedly, this sentiment is shared by the majority of citizens.  Sometimes, people spit the word \"council\" in the same way they spit the word \"politician\" because of their frustration and anger with the failure of councils, much like the failure of the Government, to deliver what people want and expect from them.<\/p><p>  When one seeks to address people's appetite for better local government, one must start with the basic question of what local government is for.  If one does not set out to develop legislation and policy based on an accurate assessment of what local government is for and what people expect from it, one will not get far.<\/p><p>  One needs to start with the brass tacks.  What people want from local government is apparent to me on a weekly basis, namely, the availability of affordable housing, the maintenance of roads and parks, support for the local economy, the local community, youth projects and sporting activities, the provision of playgrounds, decent local public transport and amenities, and the protection of the environment.  They want proper planning and development that is transparent, in which they have a say and is rational as opposed to the irrational, anarchic and developer-driven economic and planning development we saw during the Celtic tiger period and that played such a critical role in crashing this economy.<\/p><p>  If these are the service priorities that people believe local government should have - I should add basic elements such as decent water infrastructure and proper waste, recycling and environmental policies and services - they also want some say in setting those priorities.  They want real influence, not pretend influence or fake consultation, on a weekly and monthly basis.  This seems to be what the starting point should be.<\/p><p>  The way for a Bill to address this matter - generally, Bills do not do this - is to provide resources.  Without resources, activities cannot be undertaken.  It is evident that the Bill will fail, as we are doing the opposite of providing resources.  We are slashing the funding and the number of front-line staff needed to deliver these services.  This slashing has been intensified and accelerated by the financial crash, the economic crisis and the austerity imposed by the previous and current Governments, but it is worth saying that there has been a long-term process of robbing local authorities of the resources they need to provide the services that people expect.  Year on year, people in my locality and I have watched the steady decline in the number of individuals employed by the council to perform basic functions, for example, cleaning streets, maintaining houses, and so forth.  Councils used to perform these functions, but they no longer do because they have no one to do them.  People are driven around the twist by seeing council houses boarded up for months or years.  Does the Minister of State know how angry that makes people who have been on a housing list for ten or 12 years?  Not a week goes by in which people do not say this to me.  They are driven demented by it.  In many cases, they are the very tradespeople who could fix those houses.  They wonder why they cannot be employed to do the work.  Thousands of unemployed tradespeople in the area are just sitting around and would love to do that work.  They would also love to provide local services and to maintain, protect and develop the local environment and its amenities.  They do not understand why this is not being done.<\/p><p>  We are moving in the opposite direction.  This Government imposed a 9% cut in the local government fund in 2011 and another 9% cut in 2012.  In 2013, the figure will be 2% against the laughable background of the introduction of a property tax and the big lie that it would improve the level of resourcing to local government when it was really just going to be absorbed by paying off bankers' debts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300020#S00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1382530800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to adjourn the debate.

I have prioritised the Local and Community Development Programme.  The 2014 provision of &euro;47.7 million, just &euro;1 million less than this year&rsquo;s allocation, will allow some 14,000 people who are distanced from the labour market to receive direct one-to-one labour market training and supports.<\/p><p>  There are unavoidable reductions to a number of specific budget lines within the community Vote, and these reflect a range of considerations, including the scale of spending in previous years, the maturity of particular programmes and the balance required to meet EU co-funding needs.

However, when we went through the process of setting up the remediation scheme, the legal opinion from the Attorney General stated explicitly that providing for the levies led to a substantial risk of a successful challenge by the quarry owners.  I could have challenged that legally but it would have meant that the homeowners - those we are trying to help - might have to wait three or four more years while that legal process was going through the courts, in order to wait for a solution.  Rather than do that, I got the approval of the Government to set up the pyrite resolution board on a statutory basis - the legislation will be published shortly - and to give an Exchequer contribution to kick-start the process.  Further moneys will be made available as necessary, in light of the independent panel's report, in 2014 with the capital stimulus.<\/p><p>While I agree with the Deputy that I would much prefer to have imposed levies on the quarrying industry and on the insurance industry, I must take legal advice.

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p>  The financial parameters within which we continue to operate rule out a return to large capital-funded construction programmes at least in the immediate future.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. <\/p><p>  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver 800 new units of voluntary and local authority-owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department's housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  In addition to the &euro;525.8 million in housing-programme expenditure provided for in my Department's Abridged Estimate for 2014, budget 2014 provides a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house-building programme, &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease, and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  Approved housing bodies will also play a key role in 2014 in the delivery of social housing and in particular in its capacity to attract external financial investment.<\/p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>  In spite of the current challenging circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2014.<\/p><p>  Statutory responsibility for the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities.  Work continues between central and local government and the voluntary sector to ensure the considerable moneys spent on services for the homeless are effectively and appropriately targeted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300024#X00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1382533200,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Boyd Barrett.

The scheme is administered by the local authorities and repayments of principal and interest charges to the HFA are made at six-monthly intervals by the local authorities, provided the relevant housing body complies with the terms and conditions of the funding scheme.  Local authorities are recouped the full amount of the loan charges by my Department.  The CLSS was terminated in 2009 and no new voluntary housing projects can be approved at this time.  Given that most CLSS loans are for a period of 30 years, loan charges will continue to apply for many years to come.<\/p><p>  Under the terms of the CLSS, loan charges are payable by local authorities in two tranches each year on foot of invoices issued by the HFA for the periods January to June and July to December.  Charges for the January to June period are payable by 31 July each year and charges for the July to December period must be paid by 31 January.  In accordance with custom and practice over many years, details of the loan charges due issue in December, starting with those local authorities with the greatest level of borrowings.  These generally are the Dublin authorities and some large rural authorities.  On receipt of claims from these authorities, my Department processes and recoups the loan charges, subject to the availability of funding and, in turn, those authorities pay the charges to the HFA.<\/p><p>  CLSS loan charges for 2014 are estimated to be approximately &euro;64 million and the loan charges for the July to December period must be paid by 31 January.  By synchronising\u00a0the recoupment of loan charges and putting each local authority on the same footing, with each local authority recouping loan charges in early January, there will be a once-off saving of approximately &euro;15 million in 2014.  This is a straightforward accounting exercise with no implications for local authority finances.  All local authorities are put into funds in the same calendar year and repayment of loan charges can be made in accordance with the HFA requirements.  There is the advantage of a once-off easing of recoupments in a given year.  Given the pressing need to maintain public services and support employment generation at this time, I believe it is opportune to streamline loan repayments in 2014 to support these objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300026#Z00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1382534400,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

To achieve this, it is essential to tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.  The financial parameters within which the Government will continue to operate rule out a return to large-scale capital-funded construction programmes in the immediate future.  Nonetheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In July 2012, I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver approximately 800 new units of voluntary and local authority-owned social housing.  In addition, budget 2014 provides for the allocation of a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing is also facilitated significantly through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme and leasing but the Government continues to be committed to other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  The Department and the Housing Agency also are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  In spite of the current challenging circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be approximately 5,000 new housing units and it is provisionally estimated that approximately 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300026#Z02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1382534400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Yesterday, I spoke to the Focus Ireland Coffee Shop, with which I am sure the Minister of State is familiar.

Post-budget there was much controversy and discussion, which one would expect, but there was also a good deal of misinformation and scare-mongering, for whatever reasons.  Part of it surrounds the removal of the telephone allowance.  I have come into the House to raise my genuine concerns about the senior alert scheme because it is a very successful scheme funded by the Minister's Department.  I note the funding increased last year, which means that many proactive community and voluntary groups throughout the country are utilising this scheme to help the elderly and the vulnerable people in our society who may be isolated.  It offers grant aid towards monitored alarms and the security pendants elderly people wear.<\/p><p>  I refer to the information regarding the removal of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month.  I do not welcome the removal of the allowance but I welcome that a number of companies have since dropped their prices for the use of the telephone line to take account of that allowance being taken from older people.<\/p><p>  Two weeks ago I was in the house of an elderly man who lives alone in County Waterford who had a telephone bill of over &euro;100 per month, which I could not believe.  When I examined the bill I could see that he was still paying his bills using the old direct billing method, which is for every call he made.  Public representatives and voluntary and community groups would do a better job if we informed elderly people throughout the country that telephone companies now offer packages which allow the person to have unlimited phone calls for &euro;30 to &euro;40 per month.  The telephone companies are in direct competition with each other and all of these packages are readily available to the public on the callcosts website.  Elderly people should take advantage of that because it will reduce the cost of their calls.<\/p><p>  I raise this issue because I want the Minister to allay any fears about it.  I note his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, gave a public commitment on the evening of the budget that he would find additional resources to ensure the senior alert scheme will continue.  We must reassure people, and the voluntary and community groups which operate this scheme, that it will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#BB02700","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I merely want to impress upon the Minister the importance of the scheme, which provides great comfort and reassurance to people over the age of 65.

As it stands, there are 19 active groups in County Laois while there are 18 in County Offaly.  It is important more towns, villages, townlands and rural areas become involved and establish their own community alert scheme because it is incumbent on us, as public representatives, to ensure our senior citizens are allowed to feel comfortable, safe and secure in their homes.

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups, community alert, active retirement groups and so on, and it is open to people aged 65 years and over, living alone or living with another eligible person and who have a genuine need for assistance.  Any community-based, voluntary, not-for-profit organisation which has a track record of working with or providing services to older people within its community can apply to be registered with my Department and to draw down grant support.  The maximum grant per beneficiary for the equipment is &euro;250 for monitored personal alarms with pendant, and &euro;50 for an additional pendant or re-installation.  Annual monitoring costs are borne by the beneficiaries.<\/p><p>  From 2004 to date, 80,000 people have benefited from the scheme at a cost of &euro;25.4 million.  All of the grant approved personal monitored alarms up to now are connected to a landline.  The Department is examining the possibility of providing grants for systems using mobile technology.  It would be a matter for a community group to assure itself that a mobile technology based system provided full coverage in its area.<\/p><p>  Preliminary inquiries indicate that the cost of monitoring a mobile solution is lower than the overall cost of monitoring a landline system when the landline rental is factored in.  The mobile device costs around &euro;160 per year to monitor while the cost of the landline solution can be around &euro;280 per year when line rental costs are included.  It should be noted that the mobile device is not normally supplied for use as a mobile telephone because additional costs are involved with such use, even though a limited number of telephone numbers can be programmed into the device for outgoing calls.<\/p><p>  I have some good news for Deputies Coffey and Charles Flanagan in that I have been able to maintain the &euro;2.35 million allocation for the 2014 senior alert scheme.  That level of funding is sufficient to meet current demand levels for this important scheme.  It would not, however, provide for grants to individuals wishing to replace existing alarms with the mobile version where a landline is being discontinued.

This comes after the special liquidator sought advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers.  It is clear that only bids from big operators will be entertained.  Of course, it was PricewaterhouseCoopers which was asked to assess the balance sheet of Anglo Irish Bank and the other core banks after the bank guarantee.  The information it provided about the solvency and capital ratio of Anglo Irish Bank was critical to the decision to nationalise the bank in 2009.

This has the effect of enabling large corporate debtors to buy out their loans at a discount.  There is an inherent moral hazard on a number of levels to what is happening.  It seems moral hazard is a concept invented for the small guy.  Who is benefiting here?  Will we see people who gambled as bondholders, perhaps foreign investors, and who were bailed out by this country coming back in to buy these loan books at a discount?<\/p><p>  There is absolute fury among some of the people, in particular those directly affected by this, that this is again being done at the taxpayers' expense.  Some people are being rewarded and being given a bargain opportunity.  The only conclusion one can draw is that these people are getting an opportunity.  They may well be the very people who had the benefit of us paying them in full, and now they are coming back to take more out of the pot at a discount.  There is little or no risk to them because many of these loans are performing.<\/p><p>To be perfectly honest, the only people who seem to be rewarded in all of this are those in the big corporate sector.  People who have mortgages that are performing are being bounced around the place and will be moved on under this plan.  I have been contacted by several people who are absolutely furious about what is happening.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#CC00600","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I am standing in for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who is overseas on official business.  I am sorry he is not able to be here to answer the question with more knowledge and detail.  I will give the Deputy the benefit of the information with which I have been furnished.<\/p><p>  The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013 was introduced to enable the liquidation of the IBRC to proceed in an orderly manner consistent with financial stability and in the interests of its creditors.  Special liquidators were appointed to oversee the liquidation of the IBRC for the benefit of all creditors of the institution, including taxpayers.  This process involves the valuation and sales process for all the assets of the IBRC, including the residential mortgage portfolio.  The special liquidators have engaged professional independent valuers to provide a confidential valuation of the loan books of the IBRC.  As the valuation of the loan book was being progressed, the special liquidators wrote to all IBRC borrowers, including the residential mortgage customers, to give them an update on the special liquidation and on the sale of their loans.  Borrowers were invited to make representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for their assets.<\/p><p>  The special liquidators have given significant consideration to how this portfolio should be sold.  In light of the independent sales advice received and the responses received from the borrowers, the special liquidators arrived at the decision that the residential mortgage book should be split into four segments - performing, non-performing, owner-occupier and buy-to-let mortgages - and brought to the market.  I am advised that the independent advice received recommended that this sales approach would be the most beneficial with regard to maximising sales and the return to creditors, including taxpayers.  The decision to sell the mortgage portfolio in this manner was arrived at having regard to the scale of the sale process and the size of the loan book.  At the end of May, there were 17,411 residential loans in the IBRC outstanding to more than 13,000 individual customers.  The special liquidators independently decided that the most efficient method of disposal and the one most likely to maximise sales was to sell the loans as part of a larger portfolio.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the special liquidators are obligated by the conditions set out under the 2013 Act to ensure the assets are sold at a price which maximises the overall return for its creditors, including the State.  I understand that many mortgage owners might be interested in buying their loans, but the time, cost and practicalities involved would make this option more costly.  Taxpayers have already incurred far too high a price from this bank to impose further costs on them.  The special liquidators are obliged to ensure the assets of the IBRC are sold at a price that is equal to or in excess of the independent valuation obtained from the independent valuers.  If a bid is not received which is either at or above the valuation price, the loan asset will be transferred to NAMA at the independent valuation price.  In the event that the portfolio is transferred to NAMA, the board of NAMA will determine its strategy at that stage.  In doing so, NAMA will be mindful of its legal obligations and the general market norms under the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears and mortgage arrears resolution strategies.<\/p><p>  Although I understand the anxiety of individual customers in relation to the sale of their mortgage loans, they can be assured that the contractual terms and conditions of customer mortgages and other borrowings have not changed as a result of the appointment of the special liquidators, nor will they change as a result of the ultimate sale of these obligations to a third party.  All debts owing to the IBRC will remain due and enforceable.  In order to avoid breaches of their obligations, it is important for customers to continue to make payments on their loans and otherwise honour the contractual obligations of their borrowings.  The special liquidators are under the instruction of the Minister for Finance to ensure the valuation of all assets is completed by 30 November.  The sale of all IBRC assets should be agreed or completed by no later than 31 December 2013, or as soon as practicable thereafter.  The decision on how the mortgage portfolio is to be sold must take account of the time constraints faced by the special liquidators.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the decision concerning how the loans are packaged for sale and what bidders constitute qualifying bidders for the purposes of the sales process is to be made by the special liquidators. The Minister for Finance is not in a position to interfere with these decisions, as to do so would leave him open to challenge from other IBRC creditors.  The special liquidators are confident that the decision to sell the residential mortgage book as part of a large portfolio is the most efficient method of disposal and the one which is most likely to maximise sales.  This is in the best interest of the creditors of the IBRC and, by extension, the State and the Irish taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#DD00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":566,"content":"<p>The Minister has said he understands \"the anxiety of individual customers\".  Those who have non-performing loans might be anxious, but those who have performing loans are absolutely furious that large corporate entities will be able to come in and buy those loans at a discount.  The loans that are being valued relate to properties that have already been discounted because of negative equity.  I do not know how these discounts will work.  It is clear that large corporations will be able to cherry-pick, whereas individuals will be unable to bid to buy their mortgages, obviously, because the banks are not making enough loans available to allow that to happen in a timely way.  These people are being cut out by the speed with which this process is being pursued.  The Minister said that borrowers received letters asking them to outline how they would prefer to proceed.  It was a one-way communication in relation to the individual mortgage holders.  Essentially, it will be decided for them.  They will not be able to make an input into how the decision will be made.  There is real anger because people who have been paid in full for bonds, some of which were not even secured, will be able to use that money to buy performing loans at a discount.  It just seems absolutely unconscionable.

I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise this Topical Issue.  I recognise the work that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has done on this issue over some time.  While I intend to focus on a local example from Dublin South-East, I emphasise that this is a national issue.  In 2007, some &euro;13 million was spent on flood defences along the River Dodder to protect an area stretching as far as Lansdowne Road against a flood event that was likely to occur once every 200 years.  Following the heavy flooding that was caused by rain in October 2011, a further &euro;2 million was spent on emergency works and new flood defences along the river as far as Ballsbridge.  Work has now started on flood defence works costing approximately &euro;10 million to protect an area extending as far as Donnybrook and Clonskeagh.  This means that over &euro;25 million will have been spent to protect homes, communities and businesses along the River Dodder.<\/p><p>  Taxpayers and the Government need to see a dividend from the money that has been spent on the protection of these communities.  When I surveyed 1,000 homes in an area covering Ringsend, Sandymount and Bath Avenue, I found they cannot get flood cover or, if they can, their policies have been doubled.<\/p><p>For the most part they have not been able to get flood insurance.  This is replicated in Carlow, Cork, Donegal and across the country.  Every week members of my community contact me about the problems of getting flood insurance.  They are people who want to sell, to downsize, or who have outgrown their family home and want to move to another property.  They are locked in because the person who wishes to buy their home cannot get a mortgage as they have failed to get flood insurance.  Nobody can buy because nobody can get flood insurance. <\/p><p> I have organised meetings between Dublin City Council and Insurance Ireland, formerly the Irish Insurance Federation, to ensure the transfer of information from the council and the OPW, to enable insurers to see the quality and quantity of work done.  We urgently need to bring forward a clear protocol.  If the taxpayer spends this much money there has to be a dividend.  The insurance companies need to co-operate but if they fail to do so, and if this cannot be achieved by agreement or protocol, I call for legislation.<\/p><p> Earlier this year Insurance Ireland indicated that it would come forward with a protocol in September saying to the effect that it had a mechanism to recommend to its members to give flooding cover where the OPW has invested such large moneys in flood protection.  It has failed to do that.  Families are living in overcrowded conditions and want to move on.  Older people want to downsize and move to something more suitable but they are locked in.  The OPW has spent over &euro;40 million on this one small area and that is not recognised.  At this stage we need to move on urgently.  We need to say to the insurance industry that it should introduce a protocol or agreement or this House will bring forward legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#DD01000","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":575,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, I thank the Deputy for providing the opportunity to update him and the House on developments on this matter.<\/p><p>  I am fully aware that the issue of obtaining flood insurance cover is a matter of some concern to some people in certain locations around the country, whether in terms of the higher premia they are being asked to pay or where their existing insurance company indicates it will no longer provide such flood cover specifically.  Insurance Ireland, formerly the Irish Insurance Federation, has indicated that the incidence of such difficulties remains at a low level and that only of the order of 2% of insurance policies nationally are involved.  Nonetheless 2% of households represents a significant number of affected people and for this reason the Government is anxious that the problem is addressed.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes and his officials in the OPW have been actively engaged with the insurance industry for some time in regard to the transfer of information on completed flood defence schemes.  In January 2013 a working group was established with representatives from the OPW, Insurance Ireland and the main household insurance companies operating in the Irish market to consider and address this issue.  This group has a specific aim and purpose and it is important that this and the role of the OPW in the process are clearly understood.<\/p><p>  It must be emphasised that the OPW has no role or function in regard to the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry or of insurance matters generally.  The discussions between the OPW, Insurance Ireland and the insurance companies have a specific focus and are concerned solely with agreeing a basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on flood relief schemes completed by the OPW and the standard of protection offered by those schemes.<\/p><p>  The discussions have been complex and quite technical in nature and it is important that all matters are addressed in a comprehensive way that will ensure that the system of data exchange is robust, reliable and sustainable.  I am happy to report that the working group has made very good progress and agreement has been reached on a data-sharing platform which will facilitate the transfer of detailed information on completed OPW flood relief schemes.  This will allow the insurance industry to properly take into account the levels of capital investment in flood protection measures over several decades by the OPW when assessing flood risk in localities where such flood measures have been completed.<\/p><p>  The information being provided is in a readily accessible format which will show in digital map files the areas benefiting from completed flood defence works.  The initial focus of the group's work is the provision of information on schemes which provide protection for the one in 100 year flood.  The OPW has provided an initial batch of information to the insurance companies and the latter are currently working on integrating this information into their own individual operating systems.  It is expected that this work will be completed shortly.<\/p><p>  It is intended that the OPW and Insurance Ireland will agree a memorandum of understanding to guide present and future interaction between the insurance industry and the OPW in regard to communications around completed flood defence works.  The OPW is satisfied that the insurance industry is engaging constructively and positively in this process and that there is a strong willingness to co-operate on implementing a sustainable system of information exchange.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the insurance companies themselves to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence works.  As part of the process they are committing to take the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is to be hoped that this will facilitate the provision of flood cover in all areas that are protected by completed schemes.<\/p><p>  Finally, I remind the Deputy of the avenues available to those having difficulty, complaints or queries in seeking insurance cover through Insurance Ireland's free insurance information service.  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#EE00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I know that this is not his area.  What I hear in the response is that the insurance industry is talking the talk but delivering very little.  There is nothing really new in the reply from the industry.  Insurance Ireland came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment Community and Local Government where it cited the figure of \"only 2%\".  Our evidence shows that this affects far more than 2% of householders.  The industry has put a 500 metre extension on either side of every river in the country.  The houses at the top of the hill in Lucan Village cannot get household insurance.  In Cork, the houses at the top of Patrick's Hill - we all know how steep that is - cannot get flood insurance.<\/p><p>  What I hear again today is the insurance industry saying it will co-operate while nothing happens on the ground yet we spend large sums of taxpayers' money to ensure that flood protection is provided.  In my own area flood protection is at the level of a one in 200 year event.  That is far above what the insurance industry talks about in any other area.  It is double the standard it seeks.  I facilitated the transfer of information from Dublin City Council and the OPW to Insurance Ireland, which made pledges that it would respond within a week and said that the information seemed to be correct.<\/p><p>  The OPW is one of the best groups to work on flood relief.  In my constituency, and many other constituencies, it has done excellent work.  I ask the Minister of State to tell his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes that we have listened carefully to the insurance industry but we have seen very little action.  I believe that it is now time for action from this House to tell the insurance industry to get its act together and let the taxpayer see a real dividend from the excellent work carried out by the OPW.  While this is an important constituency matter for me, it is equally so in many areas across the country where there is such a large investment.  The OPW spends approximately &euro;40 million a year on flood protection.  We need to see a dividend from money that we spend on behalf of taxpayers.  I am telling the insurance industry to get its act together or we will bring in legislation to ensure that this insurance cover is provided.  I have been dealing with this matter for 10 years and the insurance companies are great at talking the talk but not very good at walking the walk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#EE00300","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Humphreys.  His point is very well made.<\/p><p>He wants action and results.  The catchment flood risk assessment and management plan is well under way.  I will provide some background information.  Studies carried out under the programme will provide the most comprehensive survey of the flood risk associated with Ireland's waterways.  In total, more than 3,500 km of major water courses are being subjected to these detailed surveys.  A scale of measurement will allow for the development of sophisticated hydraulic models.<\/p><p> Regarding the issue of whether the Government will consider alternative ways of addressing the problem such as a State indemnification scheme or an insurance pool type of solution, a State indemnification scheme for those unable to obtain flood insurance has been considered before.  While it is difficult to quantify the cost in any particular year over a period of time, it is possible to say that the cost would be significant on the basis that there have been eight major flood events costing the insurance industry approximately &euro;700 million in flood claims from 2000 to 2012.  These costs would be in addition to the normal infrastructural costs arising from flooding such as repair of roads and bridges.<\/p><p> If a scheme of this type were established, there exists a very real possibility that the industry would have a strong incentive to discontinue the provision of flood cover in medium to high-risk areas thus increasing the potential cost of the scheme over time.  Therefore, such an arrangement has the potential to undermine the nature of existing private insurance, making it difficult to withdraw even if it were introduced on a short-term basis.<\/p><p> In respect of the point made by Deputy Humphreys, I will speak to the Minister of State.  Perhaps there could be a round table discussion in the committee rooms with the Minister of State.  Deputy Humphreys has ten years of experience on this and has a deep knowledge of what he is talking about.  It is unreal that if people live at the top of a hill, they cannot get insurance.  People want action.  The OPW does outstanding work but what Deputy Humphreys wants is collective action on behalf of the insurance companies to deal decisively with this problem.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will take note of the concerns raised by the Deputy and I ask him to arrange a meeting with the Minister of State to see about convening a round table discussion with the insurance industry in Leinster House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#EE00400","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","time":1382535000,"counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#FF00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I wish to put on the record of the House that I have a personal interest.  I am a postmaster of eight years in my constituency.  I am the fourth generation to do so and I am fortunate to serve the community.  I also wish to put on record, and with no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, that I am disappointed the Minister with direct responsibility for this area is not present.  The moving of Topical Issues to this time of the day was to facilitate the relevant line Minister to be present to hear the concerns, especially of Opposition Deputies because Government Deputies have the opportunity to speak to relevant Ministers at parliamentary party meetings about concerns they may have.  I am very disappointed in this regard.  I hope and expect the Minister of State to bring back to the Minister the concerns I raise, and I expect a direct reply from the relevant Minister.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State knows about the great anxiety among members of the public who use their local post offices, the future of which is far from certain given the Department of Social Protection's desire to move social welfare payments to electronic payments.  If An Post loses this contract, in the region of 50% of its network will be unviable.  I am unashamedly supportive of An Post and the pivotal role and service it provides to the community it serves, be it rural or urban Ireland.  The An Post network brand inspires possibly the greatest degree of confidence in the country.<\/p><p>  Rural Ireland has seen a severe reduction in services in recent years.  We have seen the closure of Garda stations and the forced amalgamation of small schools.  Community welfare officers no longer go out to rural communities and rural pubs are closing.  All of this is happening as a direct result of Government policy or the lack of support from Government.  We have also witnessed the closure of sub-branches of banks.  The blame for that cannot be laid at the door of Government because it is a commercial decision.<\/p><p>  On 16 July 2013, this House heard statements on the future of the post office network.  Deputies from all sides of the House spoke glowingly of the service provided to communities by An Post, but we do not need platitudes, niceties or words of encouragement.  We need action.  The Department of Social Protection has a crucial play in the sustainability of our post office network.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Social Protection has deferred the sending out of the tender until the first quarter of 2014.  In the intervening period, she needs to conduct a cost-benefit analysis to see how this would benefit the Exchequer, both economically and socially.  A cross-departmental working group needs to be set up involving the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Justice and Equality, the Environment, Community and Local Government, and Public Expenditure and Reform because An Post, which is a State-owned agency, is under-utilised.<\/p><p>  The Irish Postmasters' Union commissioned a report by Grant Thornton which looked at ways in which post offices could better serve the community and enhance the services they provide.  They could be given a banking licence to ensure they operate as banks.  The post office network could be utilised as a citizens' information bureau.  Garda&iacute; could use the post office network as a one-stop-shop in locations where Garda stations have closed.  We see a reduction in staff in the various councils.  People could pay their motor tax and fines and renew their driving licences through the post office network.  There is an opportunity to ensure An Post's network is viable while reducing costs for the State.  I hope the Minister of State will bring this issue back to the Minister for Social Protection.  At very short notice, I collected 3,000 signatures in part of my constituency from people who were afraid of losing their post office and who are calling on this Government to take direct action to support the future of our post office network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#FF00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy for raising this very important issue.  I am taking it on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection who regrets she cannot be present.  Deputy Troy should be assured she is aware of the issues he raises.  The concerns raised by the Deputy have been raised by other colleagues in the House and I am pleased to allay some of their concerns by setting out the Department's plan to modernise the payment of welfare on a progressive basis over the coming years.  The Department is a key player in the payment services sector in Ireland, being the largest issuer of electronic funds transfer, EFT, payments in the country and given the scale of cash payments disbursed weekly.  The decisions made by the Department about how payments are made to customers impact on the State, most notably in respect of costs.<\/p><p>  The Department undertook a root and branch examination of its payment processes, methods and approaches.  This resulted in the preparation of a payment strategy which was approved recently by the Government.  The strategy has the goal of reducing significantly the level at which welfare payments are made in cash.  At present, 50% of all social welfare payments are disbursed in cash.  This amounted to approximately &euro;9.5 billion distributed over 43.7 million transactions last year.  The analysis undertaken for the payment strategy indicates the very significant variation in the cost of different payment methods.  The movement of cash imposes security risks on customers and staff alike who handle, distribute and receive these moneys.  Cash limits the options for customers to make onward transactions, limits the scope for customers to avail of cheaper prices online and curtails financial inclusion of customers.<\/p><p>  The move to digital transactions is in line with wider Government policies and objectives on better public services and more effective electronic payments as set out in the public service reform plan and the eGovernment strategy 2012-2015.  The goal is also shared by the national payments plan and the roll-out of the standard bank account.  These initiatives have made the case quite strongly for a move to electronic payments which will contribute to improved national competitiveness.<\/p><p>Cost containment and efficiencies must be sought by all public bodies and the Department is required to examine the means through which all welfare services are delivered, including payment processes.  The payment strategy is a multi-phase strategy that will be implemented over a number of years.  The first phase has commenced and contract negotiations are currently under way with An Post for the provision of over the counter cash services to ensure that customers can continue to receive their payments in cash at local post offices for the foreseeable future and provide an assurance on the continuity of cash payments to customers for up to six years while other aspects of the strategy are progressing.<\/p><p> The next phase of the strategy will be the progressive migration of customers to electronic funds transfer, EFT, payments.  The move to electronic payments for social welfare transactions is a trend that has been apparent for some time and most new social welfare customers, aside from jobseekers, are choosing EFT as their preferred method of payment.  The Department does not intend to migrate higher risk customers to an electronic payment until appropriate and robust measures are defined and fully implemented to mitigate the potential for increased risk of fraud within an electronic payments environment.<\/p><p> Undeniably, a loss in the current revenue stream from social welfare payments would impact An Post.  I understand that in anticipation of the increasing use of EFT generally, An Post has prepared and implemented a strategy which aims to address the reality of increased use of electronic payment methods within the economy.  On the revenue side, An Post has made significant progress in developing new commercial opportunities with other financial and payments institutions and insurance services bodies, notably AIB, Danske Bank and Aviva.  New lines of business have been generated, such as foreign exchange where An Post now holds 30% of the domestic foreign exchange business.

People chose to collect their payments in cash from rural post offices for a variety of reasons, such as fear of the banks or convenience.  This cash supports other businesses in a local community, from the grocer and butcher to the petrol station.  The cash inflow is very welcome to the local community.  However, the Government's strategy aims at reducing significantly the proportion of welfare payments made in cash by progressively migrating customers to electronic fund transfers.  If that happens the future of 50% of our post office network is finished, along with all the other services that have been eroded in rural Ireland over the past several years.<\/p><p>  This Government can make policy decisions that will support the post office network.  We have seen what happened in parts of England where the post office network was eroded.  This is more than simple economics; it is a social service to a community.  I urge the Government to consider the recommendations in the Grant Thornton report commissioned by the Irish Postmasters' Union in regard to enhancing the services provided, such as providing a banking licence to An Post so that people can have their money paid into a bank account and withdrawn from local post offices.  An Post is working on an e-payments card to facilitate electronic payments but it needs the Government's support.  It is a State owned agency and it is under utilised at present.  I hope the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Social Protection can put aside the difficulties they appear to have with each other in order to work alongside the other relevant Departments to develop a robust strategy that maintains one of the pillar services for our communities.

However, we must move towards a certain level of technology.  I have no doubt that the strategy will allow post offices to develop their own concepts for allowing payments in cash and other methods.  Approximately &euro;9.5 billion was distributed over 43.7 million transactions last year and that is assured for the next six years.  That shows the modernisation approach the Government is taking with the post office network.  It will not diminish the role of post offices in any sense.  It will only expand the services provided, which are already multiple and varied.

Local authorities need resources and front-line staff to provide the services required from them.  Everything else is shifting the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic<\/i>.  In recent years, as funding and staffing have been axed, we have seen the creeping manifestation of outsourced or privatised services and, as a result, more charges being loaded on local communities and residents to pay for the services they used to receive in return for the taxes they paid to central government.  Local authorities are being forced to ramp up parking charges and they cannot give small businesses a break on rates.

Before I begin, I wish to convey my sympathies on the sudden death yesterday of a councillor, Mr. Gary Wyse, of Fianna F&aacute;il in Waterford city.  Gary was a deeply committed and passionate public representative and will be a loss to the local authority and the public.<\/p><p>  We must ask the question of whether local authorities are fit for purpose, are sustainable under current funding models and serve the communities in the best way possible.  If we were all honest, the answer would be &quot;No&quot;.  The last serious attempt at reform was Better Local Government in 1999 under a previous Government.  I was a councillor for almost eight years.  In that time, I witnessed the duplication of management in unnecessary layers.  Deputy Boyd Barrett might be right in a sense, in that the system was top heavy.  There was also a lack of connectivity with communities.  The remaining link to communities is the democratically elected councillor.  We need to give credit where it is due.  Councillors stand before their communities every five years and are elected to do a job.<\/p><p>  The problem with Better Local Government was the limiting or removal of councillors' powers.  It remains the fundamental problem with the development of local government.  Continuing with the present regime is not an option.  Local authorities are unsustainable and do not deliver the services that our communities need.  Either we reform or local authorities will perish.  For this reason, I welcome the Bill.<\/p><p>  We inherited our system from British rule.  Some councils represent towns with small populations.  While I acknowledge the good work that town councils have done down the years, there is no equality between them.  Lismore in County Waterford is a relatively small town, yet the county has two or three larger towns that have no councils.  Where is the equality in this?  The Bill goes a long way towards addressing that inequality by setting up new municipal districts and, in larger urban centres, metropolitan areas.<\/p><p>  Challenges remain.  In my area, there will be an amalgamation between the Waterford city and county authorities.  There are genuine concerns about this proposal.  I hope that, as the Bill is debated, the Minister will reassure people and show them that this reform will enhance Waterford city and not undermine it, as some people claim.  A critical mass will be created through the inclusion of the adjacent towns of Tramore and Dunmore East.  The metropolitan area's population will increase to more than 65,000, the generally recognised population for a city.  As the gateway city for the south east, Waterford and its new mayor should lead the way for development in the region.<\/p><p>  We can address the challenges facing us and reform in a positive and significant way that will deliver services for our communities.  However, responsibility comes with reform.  I remember my time on the council.  To be straight, most of the decisions that we made were on adopting county development plans and annual budgets.  For the rest of the year, one was simply deciding on increasing the cost of a recycling bag.  This is not real power for democratically elected local government members.<\/p><p>  Under this legislation, local authority members will have the power to increase or decrease revenue from the local property tax by 15%, allowing them to decide investment priorities in their districts.  They will also have additional powers of oversight and audit, in that a special committee will be set up under this Bill to ensure that spending is better managed within local authorities.  The Bill will create efficiencies and allow local community groups to give their views in a more democratically accountable way.<\/p><p>  Many agencies have been operating at arm's length from citizens for many years, including the county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, and Leader partnership boards.  Some of these have been operating well, but they are not as accountable to local citizens as they should be.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise a specific issue with the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#HH00700","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I am afraid that the Deputy has run out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#HH00800","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I will conclude on the rates issue.

When the structures of local government were established in the closing years of the 19th century, few would have envisaged the change that would be wrought in the next century.  The Bill establishes a local government model that is fit for purpose in 21st century Ireland.  Large leaps forward in terms of travel and transport, communications and community must be reflected in local government structures.  This Bill tackles the changes necessary in territorial structures and in the institutions of local government.<\/p><p>  Good government is lean government.  The Bill seeks to create a much leaner and more streamlined system.  Creating a much leaner local government structure cannot be done without causing a significant measure of difficulty for those enmeshed in the current structure, but this legislation will reap financial rewards in the years to come in terms of a reduced cost to local government and an increased focus on where local government spend is most needed.<\/p><p>  However, I would sound a note of caution about the difference between streamlining the system, which I welcome, and reducing representation, about which I would have concerns.  A substantial part of the savings arising from the Bill come from the abolition of urban district councils and town councils but it must be remembered that they have provided a valuable local voice across the country for many years.  They have initiated many valuable measures and provided a voice for urban residents that simply would not have been heard otherwise.  The fact that these urban councils provided a forum for the voicing of local grievances was also reflected in the remit of county councils and the issues raised therein, which were often of a more regional nature.<\/p><p>  Prior to the boom years of the Celtic tiger, urban and town councils were operated on a shoestring budget.  It was the increased running costs amassed during the boom years that eventually led to their downfall, as the cost could no longer be justified in the current economic climate.  Cuts needed to be made to every conceivable area of expenditure, including to the cost of politicians at local and national level.  However, had the very low pre-boom costs been maintained, a much better case would have been made for the retention of such councils.  The same applies to county councils and the reduction in the number of councillors resulting from this Bill from 1,627 to 949, which reflects the abolition of the urban and town council regimes.<\/p><p>  The Bill contains other welcome provisions, including the bringing together under one umbrella of both Tipperary county councils.  Undoubtedly, this will save on the expense of duplicated offices such as human resources.<\/p><p>  The change in the role of the county manager will hopefully result in a reduction of the tension that has bedevilled many county councils across the country for many years in terms of clashes between the unelected executives and the elected local representatives.  I also welcome the introduction of the national oversight and audit commission, which is a commonsensical measure aimed at ensuring that money is spent wisely, but I hope that the bureaucratic burden placed on county councils will not be too great, as it would otherwise be counter-productive.<\/p><p>  By improving the equality of representation throughout the country, the Bill will play an important part in creating a more effective and representative local government.  However, there is no point in having a vibrant and robust local government system if power is not devolved to local level.<\/p><p> Much work remains to be done in devolving power to local level in Ireland.  We have much to learn from our counterparts in continental Europe in this respect.  On that point, I would like to take up something that Deputy Coffey mentioned concerning rates.  We must do an awful lot more on rates from the perspective of small businesses.  As a county councillor, for too long I saw businesses going to the wall due to the rates issue.  The current valuation system does not work.  When one hears that a town may be evaluated again, it is almost a poisoned chalice because rates may rise or fall.  It does not take into account the business one is doing.  Given that we are trying to get more businesses into smaller towns, and these will always be small or medium-sized enterprises, we must take into account the level of business they are doing and their turnover rather than the size of the building they are using.  That is an unfair and archaic system which needs to be re-examined.<\/p><p> This Bill is an important step towards putting structures in place which will allow us to plan towards devolving further powers to local government in the years to come.  This will result in a streamlined service which will be suitable for the delivery of the necessary services in 21st century Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#HH01200","speaker":"1041","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I am fascinated that some speakers are totally opposed to the Bill.

I was in office when Better Local Government was brought in.  It was not about councillors but about local officials, which created a layer of bureaucracy.  It suited the Fianna F&aacute;il Government at the time to centralise power in the hands of a few.  I am thoroughly delighted that something as radical as this Bill has been introduced.<\/p><p>  I refer to page 73 of the Bill which deals with the financial procedures and audit.  When I joined the county council, we used to spend three days on the budget.  Nowadays, because councillors do not have as much power as they used to, they spend half a day rushing through the budget.  When I started off in 1997 and 1998 it was a big event.  We scrutinised the budget for three days to ensure that whatever money was being made available and collected on behalf of ratepayers was being spent properly.<\/p><p>  The Minister said that regulations will show the amount necessary for the functional programmes of the authority, but will this be done annually?  If so, does the Minister need to make regulations to cover that properly?  This is one of the key parts of the legislation.  Municipal district authorities will operate as in the North of Ireland, but members of such authorities must be given more power than at present.  As part of their function, I would like to see them discussing municipal budgets beforehand.  When does the Minister expect council budgets to take place?  Nowadays, most council budgets occur in December.  Based on this Bill, however, I would see them taking place in October like the national budget.  Some regulation needs to be put in place to that effect in order that the members who are contributing to the debate on local authority budgets can have adequate time to consider the matter and make a decision.  Such local authority budgets should therefore coincide with the national budget in October or, at least, be concluded before the end of the month.<\/p><p>  One of the most important terms used in the Bill is &quot;reserve function&quot;.  Local authority members should recognise how powerful that term is.  The making of amendments by municipal district council members is a reserve function.  The fact that we are giving more powers to members is the key to this legislation.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State might have a view on the membership of audit committees.  Most county councils now have internal value for money committees.  It is vital that new local authority members should be included as part of such committees.  In that way, they will be able to give a fair assessment of the audit.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to training courses.  The Minister has said that local authorities will have to establish audit committees.  Members of such committees should have some sort of relevant knowledge, so some training should be provided to them in that regard.  Audit committees will form a very important part of the whole structure.  I have no faith in auditors because they are part of the reason the country was brought to ruin.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board some of these points.  I have been quite specific in what I am seeking, and I hope he will comment on them later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#JJ00400","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":604,"content":"<p>When I entered local government in 1974, the system was already 75 years old.  It is only now, in 2013, that any government has had the courage to propose a fundamental review and reform of our local government structure.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for his courage and conviction in bringing forward this Bill.  Many previous Ministers spoke of reform, including John Gormley, Dick Roche and Noel Dempsey but it was the current Minister, Deputy Hogan, who brought about these fundamental changes.<\/p><p>  The Bill's provisions deal with every area from the abolition of local town councils to the restructuring of local authorities as the centrepiece of local enterprise.  I would like to dwell on some key proposals.  The Minister has signalled that the main focus for local authorities in future will be as the drivers of economic activity within their county or other jurisdiction.  I welcome this proposal.  Like many others, I have heard the frustrations of people who want to start a business.  They complain they must go in several directions before they meet the relevant agency or group to get the necessary assistance or advice.<\/p><p>  This Bill will address these anomalies in many ways.  The local enterprise offices, or LEOs, will centrally address the lack of joined-up thinking between our local enterprise support agencies.  This will see the abolition of the county enterprise boards and their alignment with local councils.<\/p><p>  I am a little disappointed that the Minister has excluded local authority members from the LEOs' oversight or boards.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, who is anxious to see elected members at the coalface, should discuss this matter with his ministerial colleague, Deputy Bruton, who is the lead Minister on the LEO set-up.<\/p><p>  In the 2001 Local Government Bill, the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, introduced the concept of strategic policy committees, SPCs, in local government.  There is much debate within local government and within the Executive on whether these SPCs work well.  As a former member and chair of an SPC, I believe they have value but in many ways they require extensive reform of their structures.  In addition, they require the provision of set targets or benchmarks in terms of a five-year plan and a shorter plan for the duration of a local authority term.<\/p><p>  Section 40 provides that an SPC is established in each of the 31 councils to deal with economic development.  This is to enable the elected council to set strategic policy for the local authority&rsquo;s enhanced role in social and economic development.  It provides that the SPC may request the attendance of a public authority at a meeting.  Such a public body must provide an explanation to the full local authority if it refuses to attend.  This is certainly a worthwhile proposal.<\/p><p>  Since 2001, county development boards have been ineffectual in delivering what they should do, which is simply to develop the county or local authority area.  Part 6 inserts a new section 49A into the 2001 Act.  This new section provides for the dissolution of city and county development boards, and the establishment of local community development committees which are within, rather than outside, the local authority.<\/p><p>It provides that such committees prepare five-year local and community plans for local and community development in their areas and requires that plans be consistent with the core strategy and objectives of development as set out in the planning and development Acts.<\/p><p> I am a supporter of the local development companies.  In my constituency, delivery by Leader and the Leitrim development companies has been second to none.  Led from the bottom-up, with boards selected from the local authorities, communities and agencies their financial performance, leadership and decision-making has made a great impact on the communities in both counties.  In my view, this delivery was provided with minimal administration costs and compares well with that provided by the local authorities.<\/p><p> Section 128D of New Section 49A in the 2001 Act provides that membership of the new committee must include elected members of the local authorities, a chief executive or someone appointed by the chief executive, representatives of public authorities which provide services locally, representatives of local community interests and of publicly-funded or supported local development bodies, private individuals representing the local community and other persons as the Minister may appoint.  Concerns have been expressed by community activists and the companies that this realignment will lead to a politicisation of funding.  However, I do not agree with that view.  Projects are assessed by a committee under strict criteria and recommendations are then forwarded to a board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#JJ00500","speaker":"1082","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":606,"content":"<p>The Deputy must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#KK00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Concern has been also expressed about a possible loss of expertise and the ability of the local authorities to deliver maximum funding at minimum cost.<\/p><p>  Under the Bill the powers of the audit committees will be enhanced to allow for a review of financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures in the local authority and to foster best practice in this regard.  This is one of the most important committees considering the difficulties being experienced by Sligo County Council.

This legislation seeks the abolition of town councils throughout Ireland which up to now have served a useful purpose at local level.  I acknowledge that they are not perfect and should be reformed.  The Bill also proposes a reduction in the number of elected councillors countrywide.  At a time when people are saying there is a democratic deficit in the country, the Government's response is to reduce the number of elected members thereby increasing that deficit and removing from people access to local representatives.<\/p><p>  Of concern is the proposal to abolish the regional authorities.  Under this Bill, town councils and regional authorities will be abolished and the number of county councillors is to be reduced.  It is possible for Government to do this because it has a majority in this House.  The Government tried to abolish the Seanad but the people of Ireland stopped it in its tracks.  I believe that if the people were asked to vote on this legislation they would respond similarly.  Essentially, the people do not trust this Government when it comes to political reform.<\/p><p>  Also of concern is Part 9, which provides the Minister with the power to dissolve existing regional authorities.  The power to establish regional assemblies is being given not to the Government, the D&aacute;il or the people of Ireland but to the Minister.  It is proposed to establish three regional assemblies, one in the eastern midlands area and two others in Connaught-Ulster and the southern region.  There are currently eight regional authorities in existence.  It is proposed all will be abolished.  The cumulative effect of abolishing local direct democracy and regional authorities, to which local councillors are elected, is a further erosion of the link between people and their elected representatives.  This legislation was drafted by bureaucrats and officials and is an official's dream.  The Bill also proposes that county managers will be renamed chief executive officers, who will be less accountable in the future.  <\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the establishment of the municipal districts, which will have only minor powers such as the ability to rename the Cathaoirleach and so on.  They will have no real power, no budget and no fund-raising authority.  It is clear from the briefing we received that under this Bill that while municipal districts will also have the reserve function of establishing a community fund, their financial authority will be less than that currently held by a rating town council.  As stated, some town councils are small.  The proposed new municipal districts will be substantially larger but will have less financial autonomy.  The Minister has stated this will bring democracy down to a local level.  However, it will also remove the financial autonomy in this area.  <\/p><p>  I believe this legislation is a manger's dream because the municipal districts will be like beefed up area committees.  There will be more meetings on a monthly basis and, as time goes on, fewer full meetings of the local county councils and local county managers will be less answerable to the local county council elected members.  I can foresee a situation whereby meetings will be held only quarterly with a decision being taken to conduct all business at municipal district meetings.  Municipal district meetings will be akin to area committee meetings.  Democracy only works if there is transparency and the people know what is happening.  We all know that local media is stretched in terms of even attending council meetings once a month.  They do not have the resources to do any more because they are dependent on advertising and sales revenue.  This will result in less reporting on what is happening at meetings on the radio and in print media and less reporting on local authority activities.  I can foresee a situation whereby less will be discussed at monthly council meetings because everything will be up for discussion at the municipal district meeting.  This means the public will not know what is going on.  <\/p><p>  I am seeking clarification on a number of issues, including where the local development plans will fit into these new sub-county structures.  Will they be a reserved function of municipal districts or will local area committees have an input into them?  While some local area committees cross several towns, Kilkenny city is split down the middle and it would make no sense for the municipal district to have a say in such a situation.  Another issue of concern is that of policing committees.  Up to now town councils included policing committees.  As some town councils are to be abolished, will this result in a further erosion of the liaison between the policing committees and local communities?  I take it counties that had two or three policing committees will in future have only one.  I do not believe it will be practical for the Garda&iacute; to service the municipal districts.  There are not sufficient numbers of superintendents in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do so and someone below the rank of superintendent would not have the authority to speak on behalf of the superintendent at those meetings.  This will result in difficult situations in this area also.<\/p><p>  I would like now to speak about financial accountability.  Schedule 3 deals with the power of local authorities to vary the rate of the local property tax.  That one local authority can decide to increase its rate at the same time as another decides to reduce the rate in its area will lead to difficulties and an unfair situation for many people.  People are being told this will Bill provide additional powers for local government.<\/p><p>In fact, it will be used in some cases to the disadvantage of local government.  Central government will eventually tell local government politicians and officials that if they want more money, they can increase the rate of their property tax.  That will put an unfair burden on certain parts of the country which do not have the same base as other counties.<\/p><p> The funding issue is wrong.  There was an opportunity for the role of the local government auditor to be amalgamated with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is wrong in every respect to enhance that role in this Bill, especially in a situation where the Government spends about &euro;50 billion per annum yet uses a completely separate structure to deal with the local government fund that funds local authorities, which is only in the order of &euro;1 billion per annum, or perhaps &euro;2 billion if we include funding for roads as well.  Why should we have a Comptroller and Auditor General auditing all Government expenditure, while 2% to 5% of that is set aside for a local government auditor?  There should be one auditor to set the standards.  I know people have complaints about the role of auditors, but there is less transparency with the local government audit than with the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the latter's office would have greater standing.<\/p><p> A new committee is being set up which will lead to more bureaucracy for more officials in the Department.  Who is the local government auditor at the moment?  I do not wish to know the name of the person, but I presume it is an official in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  They are not independent of local government.  They are not independent of the Minister.  They are officials of the Department and work under the Secretary General.  The auditing of local authorities should be removed from persons below the rank of Secretary General in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This is another example of where officialdom in the Custom House won the day.  This is more power, more procedures and more committees.  The Minister has spoken about setting up some national audit committee to deal with all these issues, which I believe will be called the national oversight and audit commission.  We do not need such a commission to deal with 5% of Government expenditure.  The local government auditor should be subsumed and I have made my point clearly about that.<\/p><p> There is nothing in this Bill about the real functions of local authorities.  On 1 January, all powers in respect of water, sewerage and waste water services will be transferring to Irish Water.  We have seen a diminution in the authority of local authorities.  We have seen the increasing role of the National Roads Authority, not just in respect of the motorways, but also regional roads and even national secondary roads, in determining maintenance programmes.  A local authority cannot even move a bend off a regional road nowadays without an inspector from the NRA coming down to state whether it is right or not.  We have systematically reduced the power of local authorities and their ability to respond at local level.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Deputy Calleary.  This is well dressed up as a reform of local government, but it is no more than an attack on local democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#KK00500","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I cannot rise to speak about local government without paying tribute to Councillor Gary Wyse, a party colleague of ours who died very suddenly yesterday.  He was an outstanding public servant, an outstanding councillor and a very proud Waterford man.  I extend my sympathies and those of Deputy Fleming and our party to his family, his friends and his colleagues in Waterford.<\/p><p>  I support everything Deputy Fleming has said.  There are good elements to this Bill which can be welcomed and which have potential, but for me the glaring part of this Bill is an assault on local democracy.  Rather than putting people first, it seems people are being left behind by this Bill.  For me, that is represented in the abolition of town councils and the absolute ignorance of those in the Department and those who drafted the legislation of the invaluable role that a good, performing town council can play as an economic development unit and as a unit for citizen participation.  It is represented in the fact that this will be lost in these new bizarre structures, particularly in rural constituencies.<\/p><p>  There is a complete inconsistency and incoherence in the Bill which allows the people of Dublin, rightfully so, to have a plebiscite about the kind of mayor they want, and yet those of us who live in a town or borough council area will lose our mayor and our councillors without any consultation, but with the weight of the Government majority.  One would have hoped that the lessons of a campaign run by Fine Gael a few weeks ago to reduce the number of politicians would have been learned, and that cognisance would have been taken of the fact that people will not be bought by that populist nonsense.  Unfortunately, we have that campaign encapsulated in Government legislation on the abolition of town councils, as well as in other provisions that will undermine local participation and local democracy.<\/p><p>  I never served on a local authority.  I did not have the privilege of serving on either a town council or a county council, but I have seen very good town councils and very poor town councils in action over the years in my previous job, and as a citizen.  Unfortunately, this Bill throws the whole lot out due to the underperformance of a minority of councils.  When the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1999 was brought in to define a town council and upgrade urban district councils, it was ridiculous not to give them any extra power at the time.  I know it was done by a party colleague, but the issue should have been grasped then.  In my county, we have three town councils in Castlebar, Westport and my own town of Ballina.  In the past 15 years, Ballina Town Council has been responsible for pioneering many fine developments, both physically and within the spirit of the town.  It has acted as a foundation upon which many groups have built and have used council funds to support their own initiative.  The councillors, who generally leave their party jerseys outside the door, and the very good officials have a shared ambition for the town.  They implemented that ambition and we now have a very different town than we had.  It is noteworthy that in a time of very high attrition among local government politicians, all the outgoing members of Ballina Town Council who put themselves forward for re-election in 2004 and 2009 were re-elected.  That shows the regard and the respect the people of Ballina have for them and for what they have done.  They challenged them, but at least they saw fit to challenge them.  Under these new proposals, we will be luckier to see a dodo than a councillor in some parts of the country.<\/p><p>  The other big example of a successful town council is Westport, and this example is used right around the country.  Westport did not just happen.  Westport today is a town we all admire as a tourism centre, a centre for world class industry and a model of community participation through things like Tidy Towns-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#LL00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":612,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Ring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#LL00300","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>-----and so on.  That happened because of the actions of the town council back in the 1970s.  Deputy Ring was a member of that council and he was on occasion able to leave the party jersey outside the door.  He himself would admit that he got his grounding in politics on the town council.  What he has brought to the party in the last two years is built on the initiative of a town council that worked together, but now that is gone.<\/p><p>  What will this be replaced by?  It will be replaced by a municipal district.  There are currently nine town councillors in Westport, but there will be seven councillors in the municipal district, extending from Leenane in the west to Belderrig in the north, which is a distance of 150 km.  These people will be drawn from all different areas, with a broad range of focus and no sense of direction or commitment to the town.  Their time will be spread over a very large area and we will lose that really important link to local authority, local government and democracy in general.  Apparently, this is putting people first.<\/p><p>  People do not get a sense of this at the moment, but in two years when they find that rates bills are increasing, when local organisations find out that the community fund, as defined in the legislation, is spread over hundreds of miles rather than in the town, and they cannot get the small bit of funding for festivals or local competitions and so on, they will then know the difference.  It is not a case of getting rid of politicians; it is a case of taking away a layer of government that we will eventually put back in.  Some Minister will come before this House in ten years or so to put the town council structure back into the system, because this is not going to work.<\/p><p>  If it is good enough for the people of Dublin to have a direct say in what their future local government will look like, then I think we should have the same say.  The Minister of State should have that say in Sligo, Deputy Deasy should have that say in Dungarvan, and so on, about what they want in their towns and counties.  There is a specific part of the Bill which provides for a plebiscite for Dublin and if the Minister believes that this Bill is putting people first and he still wants to take away the introductory layer of government from people, then he should put it to a plebiscite in the towns that are affected so he can test his case.  I know the Government is probably referendum shy at the moment, but he should have a go at this one.<\/p><p> Section 6 deals with the community and local development companies.  Just over 20 years ago they were set up to fill a gap that local authorities were not filling at the time.  It was ground-up development involving small projects and using the Leader money that was identified at the time in a visionary move by the then Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry - it was typical of him to see that.  Those companies have flourished.  While I accept there have been difficulties with some of them, just because a few have difficulties we should not throw out the whole lot.<\/p><p> The Bill provides for a local government and central government takeover over of the local development sector.  The employees and CEOs who do great work will now become local authority employees responsible to the local authority.  There is a sense that because there is the usual provision that certain individuals from various groups will be appointed to the boards it will be fine.  It is claimed that that is local government but it is not.  That is local development being hijacked by central government through the guise of local government and local democracy.  That will do considerable damage and we will again need to return to put that structure back in.  It was set up in that way because there was a need for a bottom-up approach to local development, whereas what we have here is a top-down approach.<\/p><p> Not even Sir Humphrey could have come up with the wording for the process for rate equalisation in the Bill.  It is a ten-year period but the authority can decide differently if it wants.  That is not how business works.  Over the years many town councils have managed to keep the rate base low while the county councils have a higher base.  Many businesses in towns are already being hammered by this bizarre revaluation process.  I met a businessperson today who must pay 40% more in rates next year because of this revaluation process.  That business will need to get a 3% increase in turnover to pay the rates alone.  Yet this legislation provides for an increase in rates, which is what will happen in most town council areas.  Even though there is some deliberately woolly phrasing in the Bill about it being over ten years, I envisage it happening much quicker than that and that needs to be amended on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> It is not possible to put people first by taking away the tier of government closest to them.  It is not possible to put people first by taking away the direct interaction that an elected body has with its community and community organisations.  At a time when there is such low regard for elected politicians, town councils allow elected politicians to be a fulcrum of development and something positive.  This is destroying that development and destroying that spirit.  We cannot support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#LL00400","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Deasy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#MM00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I was a member of Cork County Council from 1999 to 2011.  I served as a member of the Southern Health Board until its dissolution.  I served on the South West Regional Authority and also chaired that body.  While I accept much of what Deputy Calleary has said, it is predicated on the idea that local government existed.  We never had local government - whether it was a town council, an urban council, a county council, a regional assembly or a regional authority.  We had local administration, rubberstamped by elected members in too many chambers throughout the country.  The only real power any local elected representative had was at budget time and at the discussion and deliberation on county and local development plans.  Apart from that there was nothing and we were entirely dependent on information and resolutions coming from the executive and the county managers, as well as circulars and policies from central government.  It just did not exist.<\/p><p>  Every argument that has been made about keeping government at the lowest level and closest to the people through the town and local authorities is ridiculous and always has been.  Regrettably there have been many missed opportunities for reform.  The greatest change that significantly impacted local government was the abolition of rates in 1977 and the decapitation of what was a quasi-local government resulting in the inability thereafter to fund themselves adequately.<\/p><p>  While the Bill might not go far enough, it contains some welcome provisions.  The merger of the six councils in Waterford, Tipperary and Limerick is seen as a positive move by citizens in those areas.  While it is not provided for in the Bill, I would go further in making a proposal that deserves consideration.  We should consider merging Cork City Council and Cork County Council in future.  This would offer a real counterbalance to the east coast as a single economic and political unit to serve the citizens of Cork city and county more effectively.  I say that perhaps in the teeth of opposition from local politicians in the area.  It might be given consideration when we see how the mergers in Waterford, Tipperary and Limerick fare out.<\/p><p>  In west County Cork we will lose the five town councils in Bantry, Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Bandon and Kinsale, comprising 45 councillors.  We will also losing four county councillors in the area.  The number of local public representatives in west County Cork will go from 57 to eight.  While that is extraordinary, they will have to live with it.  Those county councillors need real power.  More power needs to be vested in the elected representatives than in the executive.  Then perhaps we might see more effective local government.  I would prefer to see eight elected members in a region who have some say and power over decisions that affect the citizens rather than 57 who do not.<\/p><p>  The European funding is very much focused on regions.  The Irish experience in regions through the regional authorities has by and large been positive.  However, those regional authorities also come under the excessive influence of county and city managers, engineers and staff.  They do not have adequate reserved functions to serve those regional structures to match the European commitment that provides for them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Calleary spoke of the huge difficulty with community development programmes, addressed in section 6.  Why did the funding for such rural development need to be vested in companies limited by guarantee?  Some of them work well.  I served on one, Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, which served the western offshore islands.  It came up with curious anomalies where for different reasons a project half a mile away on an island can be approved by one company and the exact same project on the mainland cannot be approved by a different company.  It throws up some anomalies with respect to governance, transparency and information being provided to the public.  There are reservations over how that funding would be managed when they are incorporated back into the local authority structure.  However, if we are serious about giving political accountability and responsibility to the people nearest the ground, it makes sense for that to be within the local authority structure.  They are not being wiped out; they report to an elected body, which is a welcome provision.<\/p><p> There are opaque references to the audit functions of local authorities.  There is an issue of understanding among local councillors now because they believe they are powerless and they simply accept audits.  This has been my experience in Cork County Council.  A councillor will examine reports from the local government auditor and the comptrollers and accept them, but he cannot do much about them.  If the auditor draw attention to something, the councillor can discuss it at council and ask questions and get some answers.  It is in the public domain and the media but there are rarely any resolutions.  That is a major issue and I hope future councillors and elected members of local authorities in local chambers will take it up far more vigorously.<\/p><p> We hear references to saving money.  I hope there will be a far more efficient whistleblowing system within local authorities, whereby staff members who know that there are inefficiencies or wasted resources can report them through the management, councils or through the chamber without fear of recrimination.  I strongly urge that this should be considered.<\/p><p> There is reference in the legislation to amending section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001, which replaced section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act.  I have always held the view that these were particularly difficult sections within the local government system and I am pleased to note that in the 12 years I was a member of Cork County Council I do not recall a single incident when a section 140 provision was proposed, never mind passed.  I gather there was one case in 1997 or 1988 relating to extending power lines over Cork Harbour and that became a major issue but that was the only time.  Other local authorities use section 140 provisions as if they are questions to the manager and hold up a vast amounts of resources on proposals that are, frankly, sinister or part of a sinister agenda.<\/p><p> This is a welcome step in the reform of local government but it is only a step.  Anyone serious about reform would be the first to recognise that when one introduces an item of reform it does not stop there.  It cannot because the nature of reform is ongoing.  I am keen to see a situation whereby the local government system moves on from being a public administration rubber-stamp chamber to a system that effectively and really deals with issues such as local education, health, policing, child care and welfare.  It should provide for services as near to the people as possible and should integrate those services in terms of local planning and development.  Why is it, for example, that one can plan for a school locally but one must provide for it nationally?  These issues are relevant and I am keen to see them addressed in future.  I imagine there will be further legislation anon and all of these issues will be addressed to give real power back to local authorities and chambers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#MM00400","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I wish to deal with Part 5, a large portion of which is concerned with commercial rates.  During the past three or four months we have been dealing with this matter at the Committee of Public Accounts, along with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance, the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Valuation Office.  As a result, myself and Deputy Robert Dowds intend to jointly table amendments to the section dealing with commercial rates.  We held a series of public meetings and private meetings with officials.  We hope to explain, beginning today, what changes we believe need to be made in the commercial rates section of the Bill.<\/p><p>  In May this year I raised the issue of commercial rates under a Topical Issues debate with the Minister.  At the time, the Minister referred to the harmonisation of annual rates and valuation between different local authorities.  He said that his approach to harmonisation would ensure that it would not lead to any increase in commercial rates in any local authority.  He stated: &quot;There should be no increase in commercial rates in Dungarvan arising from the merger of both local authorities. If it is the will of the councillors to do otherwise, that will run contrary to my policy&quot;.  Some confusion has arisen from that statement.  Section 29 provides that in order to ease the transition for ratepayers to a standardised rate while avoiding a negative impact on overall local authority revenue, the harmonisation of rates will take place over a maximum of ten years.  I and local authority officials and councillors realise this is a provision to spread out the negative effect of an increase in rates to avoid excessive damage to businesses.  It is an explicit acknowledgement that there will be increases in the annual rate on valuation, ARV, charge between local authorities.  Therefore, there is a contradiction between what has been said on the floor and what is in the legislation and that needs to be explained.  Beyond clarifying that situation, the question is how the Minister intends to ensure that councillors do not act contrary to his policy, and, if they do, what steps will he take to ensure that no increases occur.<\/p><p>  The second issue has to do with revaluations.  New valuations are being placed on commercial premises through the country.  In many cases businesses will be unable to absorb the increases.  This has been raised again and again in the past four or five months.  One of the amendments Deputy Dowds and myself intend to table would allow a local authority to spread out any increase in commercial rates over several years.  My understanding is that such a provision is in place in the United Kingdom and we believe it should be given consideration in this legislation.  It is clearly germane to the legislation.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned earlier, someone in the Department had the foresight to spread out the impact of harmonisation by allowing for a ten-year period of harmonisation between local authorities.  However, no one has considered the impact of the new valuations, that is, one payment with one cheque in one year.  It seems like an obvious step to allow local authorities to determine this themselves and, as the Minister said yesterday, to avoid any shocks to businesses.  Clearly, when spreading out the increases in commercial rates to avoid a shortfall in revenue to a local authority, it would necessarily mean a spreading out of the reductions on the other side, but I reckon that would be understood by those businesses in receipt of those reductions.  Put simply, this legislation cannot, on the one hand, provide a specific solution to ease the burden on a business because of a rates increase resulting from amalgamations of local authorities, while, on the other, ignoring completely the impact revaluations would have on the same businesses.  Someone in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government thought this through when it came to the first circumstance but the second circumstance must be dealt with in this Bill.  Not to do so would not make any sense.  We hope the Minister can accept our wording when we table our amendments.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, when the Minister introduced Part 5, he made extensive reference to section 31 which would standardise vacancy refunds throughout the country.  The Minister finished by stating:<blockquote>I am considering further how this provision will work in practice to ensure consequences other than those I intend are not realised. I will revert to this matter again as the Bill makes its way through the Houses.<\/blockquote>That is fair enough.  I am keen to know what is intended because, as it is written, it makes absolutely no sense.  I and others are grappling with the rationale behind this.<\/p><p>  At the moment in Cork, Dublin and Galway a company gets a 50% reduction in rates if the property is vacant.  However, for the rest of the country it is a 100% reduction; effectively the rates are entirely written off.  If this provision was written into law, it would be unworkable.  I offer one example.  The former Waterford Crystal factory in Dungarvan has been lying idle for approximately six years.  The rates on the premises would be approximately &euro;150,000 per year.  Who exactly would be expected to pay the &euro;75,000 rates Bill under this legislation?  Is it the receiver?  I doubt it, and I do not believe the local authority would get the payment in any case.  If the rationale behind this is to force landlords to find tenants, then the logic is faulty.  Most of the premises that are vacant in my constituency are vacant for the one reason that tenants cannot be found at any rental price since consumer spending has slumped.  To be honest, it is a bizarre time to introduce something like this.  It smacks of something that an official from Dublin thought up without any understanding that there is a two-tier economy in existence in the country.  The wording of the provision should be deleted or changed radically to reflect reality.  To reinforce my point, last week Waterford City Council announced a scheme to incentivise new tenants to occupy premises by giving them a rates holiday for several years.  That approach is completely at odds with what the Department has come up with on the same issue.  It is something one would expect to see in a boom period not something one would expect to see during an economic crisis.<\/p><p>The highest vacancy rate of 28.2% occurs in Ballybofey, County Donegal, while the lowest vacancy rate of 3.5% can be found in Greystones, County Wicklow.  This is a huge difference.<\/p><p> I wish to make a general point above the Government's approach to commercial rates over the past six months as having dealt with it for a lengthy period, disappointingly there is a lack of appreciation of what businesses are going through, particularly in respect of all these measures and how they might affect the retail sector on high streets nationwide.  I will provide an example.  I have spoken repeatedly to retailers who have shut down or who are under the threat of shutting down because they are competing with online businesses.  Last year, 57% of Irish Internet users made a web purchase.  Recent studies indicate that online shopping has become a substantive threat to store profitability.  In 2012, online shoppers in Ireland spent &euro;3.7 billion across a range of product and service categories and this trend is growing.  According to EUROSTAT, 26% of Irish Internet users have bought clothes and shoes online in the past 12 months, compared with 11% in 2008.  Moreover, 43% bought travel and holiday accommodation in 2012, which was an increase from the comparable figure of 32% in 2008.  The percentage of people purchasing books, magazines and e-learning materials online has increased by one third between 2000 and 2012.  The percentage of people buying food and groceries online during this period has doubled.  Do online businesses pay commercial rates?  No, they do not.  How does one expect a local betting shop, for example, to survive when it is paying increased commercial rates to the local authority while its online competitors pay nothing?<\/p><p> I am afraid this Bill does not take these trends into consideration and it is a case of diminishing returns because these businesses will not survive unless a different approach is taken by the Government as a whole when it comes to commercial rates.  Unfortunately, the commercial rate section, as written, is inconsistent with the realities of what is happening on high streets nationwide and notwithstanding the ten-year adjustment mechanism for harmonisation that shows appreciation for the potential impact of rate increases, the commercial rates section must be completely rewritten.  Although Deputy Calleary mentioned one increase, potentially there are three increases, as well as one added element, in this regard.  Potentially, it is a quadruple whammy.  First, there are changes to the rates refund scheme.  Second, there is harmonisation of annual rates on valuation, ARVs, in some cases upward.  Third, there are new upward valuations with no spreading out of the payment period and fourth, there are trends towards online shopping increasing each year.  Businesses will not survive unless the Government takes all these factors into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#NN00200","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I understand the next speaker, Deputy McLellan, who has 20 minutes, intends to share time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#OO00200","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":622,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#OO00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that Deputy McLellan shall have ten minutes and her two colleagues each shall have five minutes?

I also regret that so many of the political figures and opinion formers who spoke at such length about the need for a Seanad have not now or any time recently seen fit to speak on the urgent need for reform of local government and its protection.  While it seems as though it is not the most fashionable of causes, it still is no less worthy for all that.  No area of Irish democracy has taken such a hammering as has local government over the past ten to 15 years.  Our system of local democracy is hopelessly underdeveloped and weak.  The present Minister had a tremendous opportunity to do something about that, to give local authorities a proper role and to bring power back down to the local level.  However, that opportunity has been well and truly squandered.  More than that, the Minister has gone further and has taken the axe to local government in this State.<\/p><p>  The Government appears to have a warped sense of what political reform means.  Political reform is necessary and important.  The people wanted political reform because after the economic collapse in 2010 and 2011, there was a sense that the entire system had failed.  The political process was at once seen to be asleep at the wheel and too close to the interests of big business and the banks, which have caused so much difficulty and brought ruin to the economy.  As a result, there was of course a demand for change in order that the people would feel the political system was better fit for purpose and more accountable to them.  However, the Minister&rsquo;s changes do not make the system more accountable and nor do they make it more fit for purpose.  If anything, they bring the system further away from the people.  It follows in the same vein as most of the rest of the Government&rsquo;s supposed commitment to political reform such as the reduction in the number of Deputies or the cosmetic moving around of Standing Orders, which in effect are window-dressing.  For the Government, political reform is not about better politics but is just about less politics and fewer politicians.  Such a cynical approach is reprehensible and is not what the people want.<\/p><p>  Certainly, they did not vote for an entire tier of local government to be wiped away, as will happen next summer.  I spent several years on local authorities, namely, on Youghal Town Council since 2004 and on Cork County Council from 2009.  I was very proud to have served as Mayor of Youghal from 2009 to 2010, which was a great honour and privilege for me.  I always have thought the role carried out by town councils is worthwhile even in spite of their reduced responsibilities in recent times.  People feel a great sense of ownership of the town councils.  They are represented by people they know personally, to whom they have access and who, regardless of whether they agree with them personally, they believe can be trusted because they have the best interests of the town at heart.  This is what local democracy is about, namely, local people doing their best to represent their local community.<\/p><p>  The Minister produced his Putting People First document on local government, in which one of the local electoral areas in County Cork has a population of 71,000 people.  There is nothing even remotely local about an electoral area that size and in Britain, there are areas with that population that form parliamentary constituencies.  It is absurd and clearly the reduction in representation will have repercussions for people&rsquo;s sense of ownership of, and access to, the system.  My constituency of Cork East will take a huge hit in respect of local representation and will lose five town councils from the larger towns in east Cork, that is, Fermoy, Youghal, Mallow, Cobh and Midleton.  This will amount to 45 fewer local representatives in my constituency.  As people have become used to dealing with their town councillors and town councils, the change will be serious and frankly, the burden will fall on too few local representatives.  Large parts of the county probably will not have anyone they truly can call local and there may be no elected person from their community representing them.<\/p><p>  Town councils were not perfect, far from it, as I knew well from my own service as a councillor.  While there are many things I would like to have seen done differently, abolition certainly is not the answer.  The Government insists on saying that Ireland has too many councillors and is greatly out of kilter with European norms.  However, this clearly is not the case as aside from Britain, there are very few places in Europe where there is a higher proportion of electors to councillors or local representatives.  Ratios in other countries vary from 1:120 in France to 1:1,200 in Denmark.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, wishes to introduce a ratio of councillors to people of 1:4,830.  This is not truly local and I believe that people, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalised in communities, will suffer from such lack of access to their local representatives.  The ratio is far out of kilter and Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed the ratio should be set at 1:3,936.  This would both allow for better representation and would fit in with an all-Ireland approach, as this is the ratio that has been adopted for the review of public administration in the North.  Clearly, in this time of cross-Border co-operation and alignment, there is a need for this to be taken in to account.<\/p><p>  This Bill is a missed opportunity as there was potential for real reform in this regard.  I take this opportunity to make the point that a significant job performed by local representatives relates to joint policing committees.  The joint policing committees often are closely aligned with town council areas, as is the case in my constituency.<\/p><p>This is a way in which local representatives can have a real input into how garda&iacute; respond to the needs of their local communities.  However, there is no basis in primary legislation for the committees.  Has the Minister ever considered putting in place such a legislative basis?  I ask him to ensure that all committees are properly answerable to the public.  <\/p><p> In addition, there are numerous ways in which the system of local government needs to be improved.  In the first instance, far too many powers have gradually been taken from councils and transferred to central government, in particular, those related to functions planning, housing, transport, roads, waste management and now water services.  The Minister&rsquo;s Bill, for all his talk, does not even remotely reverse that agenda.  His Putting People First document was a masterclass in bluff and bluster.  It is elegantly worded and well presented but totally lacking in any substance, and I believe this was noted by the Council of Europe which recognised the lack of substance.<\/p><p> Real reform would mean more powers being decentralised from national Government to local level.  Real reform would mean that local communities would be properly represented.  Real reform would mean that the powers which reside with the councils are in the hands of the elected representatives, rather than the officials.  This is an important point with which anyone who has served on local authorities would be familiar.<\/p><p> We have seen a significant deal of centralising of power in the hands of the county manager and his or her officials.  Our councillors are under-resourced and face a tough battle in taking on county and city managers with the resources and staff that a manager has at his or her disposal.  This point is not considered often enough.  The county manager very often gets his or her way because information can often be power.  That needs to be tackled.  <\/p><p> The Minister has failed entirely to tackle that and instead of doing so and giving local government a meaningful role in our political system, he has decided to simply go for the short-sighted approach of cutting numbers.  The Government has recently recognised that this approach does not work in the public sector, as it has belatedly decided to take on new teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; which were badly needed.  It will soon learn that it will not work with local government either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#OO00500","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":626,"content":"<p>Like most of the so-called reform produced by this Government, the Bill is a missed opportunity to bring about real change to how local authorities operate in order to improve their ability to respond to the needs of their areas.  My main focus in this regard is housing.  I am tired of reiterating the stark figures around housing demand and the shortfall of supply in this State but it must be said again and again until people are willing to really listen and to start to address the issue.  There are 112,000 or so people on the housing waiting lists across this State.  A large percentage of those people are centred around the major urban bases of population such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other cities but there is strong demand for social housing across the State in every local authority.  It is likely that every Member of this House is inundated with issues relating to housing need.<\/p><p>  There are nearly 100,000 people in receipt of rent supplement and roughly 30,000 participate in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, in this State.  This costs the State more than &euro;0.5 billion euro a year.  That money is given to private landlords, some of whom provide substandard accommodation at exorbitant prices and with little or no management.  The Government's solution to this issue is not to fund or encourage local authorities to provide this basic need of people but to throw money at the private market in the hope it will solve the problem or at least that people will forget that housing was ever a responsibility of the State at local or national level.<\/p><p>  The reality is that for local authorities housing can and should be an integral part of the services they provide.  It is also possible that with proper application of an ethos of public housing this could be made to pay for itself by a mixture of people renting from low, middle and higher income brackets as is seen in other countries.  Differential rents provide the potential for affordable rates at all levels, while still meeting costs.<\/p><p>  One proposal that Sinn F&eacute;in puts forward, along with noted academics in the field of housing, is the idea of allowing local authorities to set up housing trusts to commence a State\u00adwide building programme. This would ensure power is devolved to local level and homes would be built to meet the needs of the 112,000 on the housing waiting lists.  It would also tackle many problems that have been pointed out in terms of sourcing funds to build social housing.  Money borrowed by these trusts would not be added to the national debt.  Housing can be shown to be a worthwhile investment outside of the damaging public private partnership, PPP, model which prioritises profit over real social value.  There has never been a better time to make this investment.<\/p><p>  The real problem in terms of housing though is political will.  This Government does not want powerful, democratic local authorities any more than it wants to take on any responsibility for housing people.  If it had massive funds at its disposal it would not be inclined towards social housing investment.  Local authorities know the needs of the people in their areas and are less ideologically driven against public housing provision than are the Government and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>  Reform is needed to improve local authorities in terms of providing housing for people.  To ensure councils are fully held to account, Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that local authorities should be held to account by the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Adequate resources should be provided for inspections to include local authority housing.<\/p><p>  Those on the housing lists should be able to access all relevant information on their application on the Internet using a personalised code.  Local authorities who fail to draw down appropriate funds such as in the case recently of Traveller accommodation funding should be sanctioned for this.  Those measures would enhance the potential for local authorities to be first-rate providers of housing.  It is already the case that local authorities are accountable to the public in a way that voluntary housing associations are not.  Councils meet on a monthly basis.  It is open to  members of the public to attend those meetings and to have issues raised though their councillors.  This is not the case for the voluntary housing sector.  <\/p><p>  The voluntary sector does excellent and crucial work but it cannot solve the crisis in social housing in the way that local authorities can.  Despite a cut of &euro;620 million from social housing since 2010 and a cut of &euro;15 million from local authority housing in this budget, local authorities still provide the bulk of social housing.  With a funding allocation of &euro;70 million in 2014, they will provide housing and services for many thousands of people across the State.  This cannot be ignored and the potential for local authorities to house people well and in larger numbers is clear from the work they do every day.<\/p><p>  It is a shame local authorities will not continue to deliver water services and that this change has resulted in the removal of the resources and the manpower by the Minister with the setting up of Irish Water.  This is a diminution of the role of local authorities.  The transfer of responsibility to local authorities for dealing with rental supplement in the near future is welcome but what resources will be provided?  The Minister needs to make that clear.  It always made sense for the local authorities to deal with the bulk of housing issues and enhancing that position.  I served for 12 years on the Dublin City Council and the managers had far too much power and could override the decisions of councillors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#PP00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":627,"content":"<p>This Bill is not about local government reform, it is a culling of councils and of councillors and a window-dressing exercise to pretend that more powers are being given to the councils, which is not the case.  At the turn of the century the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government held a referendum to recognise local government in the Constitution for the first time while at the same time taking more powers away from democratically elected councils.  This Bill carries out a similar exercise dressed up as a reform.  It is the same old centralisation of power in the Custom House.  No one is arguing that current structures of local government should be left untouched - far from it.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have long argued for local government restructuring and for real reform through the empowerment of local democracy but this Bill is not about democratic empowerment, it is about numbers.  The Minister's approach is both crude and simplistic, reducing the number of councils and the number of councillors and claiming that local government will be reformed.  That is never the case.  We reject the proposal to cull the number of councillors to 949.  This is a very significant decrease and leaves this State with one of the lowest number of councillors per head of population of any of the OECD countries.  We propose that there should be a minimum, and I emphasise a minimum of 1,165 councillors.  This is in line with the reform of public administration in the Six Counties.<\/p><p>Clearly, there needs to be a realignment in terms of the size and composition of councils.  For example, there are large towns with no councils while far smaller towns for historic reasons, and I emphasise to their credit, do have councils.  This also needs to be addressed, but the approach of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is not realignment and better representation; it is to wield the axe and abolish town councils.<\/p><p> In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan we will see a significant loss of local elected voices.  Across the constituency we will see the demise of a total of eight town councils that are made up of nine members each.  That is a phenomenal impact.  Eight multiplied by nine is 72 and when the further cull of nine county councillors across the two county council constituency of Cavan and Monaghan is added, we are losing a total of 81, and a Deputy to boot come the next general election.  That is a loss of 82 elected voices across that constituency.  The consequence of all of that is that access to elected representatives will suffer.  Accountability of local authorities, State agencies and Government itself will suffer, and the democratic process will suffer with fewer people directly involved.  The Minister should make no mistake about it.  The loss of those 81 council seats is the loss of 81 people directly involved in political life in her party, in Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and Independent voices together representing the various strands of opinion within our respective communities.  The by-product of all of that is not only the loss of their likely direct involvement in political life but all of those who would and have come with them in terms of family support, friends' support and others attracted because of their friendship, knowledge and involvement with that individual councillor or candidate - a much greater number again.  Political life and the democratic process will undoubtedly suffer significantly as a result.  <\/p><p> That said, far more important than the number of councils and councillors is the empowerment of local democracy.  We have the least empowered local government and the most centralised State in Europe.  Power after power has been taken away from democratically elected councillors and we in Sinn F&eacute;in want to see maximum power devolved from central Government to local authorities.  These powers include economic planning, waste management, water and sewage and housing.  Any reform of local government must ensure the efficient and cost-effective delivery of services, of structures fit for purpose and of democratic accountability at its core.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Hogan's so-called reforms come side by side with more cuts to local government funding imposed in budget 2014.  The cuts to the local authority housing budget, surely of great concern to the Minister of State present, are especially regressive given the dire shortage of social and affordable housing and the growing levels of homelessness.  This is the real substance of local government service delivery and it is being savagely cut by this Minister and by his Cabinet colleagues.  <\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in would establish local district councils.  We would put in place local authority housing trusts to commence a State-wide building programme and develop economic spatial plans.  This would ensure power is devolved to the local level, that homes would be built to meet the needs of the 112,000 on the housing waiting lists, and that councils could plan for economic development that would benefit the entire community.<\/p><p> I believe that while there will be sympathy for the Minister's approach among some in the media and indeed some in wider society, there has been a huge demand for less and less in terms of people involved in political life.  The overwhelming number of these who will go have given that service for no personal return.  They have given it out of a sense of wanting to contribute to the betterment of where they live.  That has not been tested fully and properly and we will all be losers as a consequence.  It will certainly occur after a short time to those who have clamoured for it because they will realise very soon after the error of their choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#PP00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":629,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Kevin Humphreys who I believe is sharing time with Deputy Tom Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#QQ00200","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I am, ten minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#QQ00300","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It is long overdue.  I would have gone much further but it is a start.  The reorganisation that is taking place and the streamlining into municipal districts will prove to be a success.  There is some fear of that but when we see the way local area committees work in urban areas, I believe these municipal districts in local town areas will work very well.<\/p><p>  I welcome that the Bill devolves responsibility for the preparation of the municipal budgets.  That is very important because the true power is controlling the budget.  I am a little concerned about the manner in which the county or city budgets will be formed and the influence the new chief executive will have.  The budget must be prepared at the direction of the elected councils, and I ask the Minister to look at that aspect of the legislation.<\/p><p>  I am disappointed that these structures will not be delivered in Dublin for at least seven years.  I welcome the setting up of a working group chaired by Fr. Sean Healy to work on how we can connect citizens into the decision making process at local government.  That announcement by the Minister last night is very worthwhile and I believe it will prove to be a success.<\/p><p>  The most important powers councillors will gain is the way they can vary the local property tax up or down.  That is a real power because they have to make monetary decisions and it will be up to local politicians to take on that power.  Those against the property tax have never outlined fully how they would fund local government while giving councillors fiscal powers.<\/p><p>  There is one area, however, about which I am very disappointed, namely, the decision not to introduce in 2014 the retention of the 80% of property tax revenue in local authorities where it is sourced.  That was a key promise made to people when it was brought in last year.  The Minister announced in his Budget Statement on Wednesday, 16 October that the 80% will not be retained at source until 2015.  However, as late as 19 September it was Department policy as indicated in a response to a parliamentary question which stated that 80% retention would come into force in 2014; I can supply that parliamentary question to the Minister.  The Minister needs to review that.  <\/p><p>  Many changes have taken place in local authorities in terms of mergers but it would be a down payment on the commitment to reform.  I would point out that those type of changes are not happening within the greater Dublin area, and the vast majority of property tax is being collected in the greater Dublin area.  That is crucial if the local property tax is to have any credibility.<\/p><p>  The Dublin local authorities are not changing and therefore there is no administrative reason the people of Dublin should not receive into their councils the 80% of the property tax collected in their areas in 2014.  There is no logical reason the local authorities in the greater Dublin area, or in Galway, cannot receive the local property tax take next year.  The Minister said there is a number of reasons for that, including Tipperary councils coming together or the other reforms that are happening outside urban areas, but this is not happening in Dublin.  The property tax take is enormous in Dublin.  A commitment was given that it would be paid to the local authorities in 2014 but from what we heard in the Budget Statement and from the Minister, Deputy Hogan, that will not happen.  I ask for that to be reviewed and rectified.<\/p><p>  Another interesting aspect of the Bill is the amount of power the Minister will retain or exercise over the way local government functions.  I will deal with a number of sections.  Under section 35, councillors would have a very strong role in the appointment of community development boards and the power of approval.  That power should not be with the manager or CEO, as he or she is called.  I ask the Minister to amend section 35 and enhance the powers of the councillors in that area.<\/p><p>  On the appointment of a chief executive manager in Part 7, I welcome the power of veto by local councillors over the appointment of the manager.  It will take brave councillors to exercise it.<\/p><p>It is important councillors have a veto in appointing new managers as it will pay dividends in the long run.  However, we will need strong and brave councillors to do that.  I would like to see the powers of councillors to hold the chief executive officer to account strengthened, with specific powers of enforcement over policy decisions.  Something more than a report, which the legislation states, is needed.  I also welcome the changes to the planning powers under section 140 as a result of what came out of the tribunals.<\/p><p> I am a Dublin Deputy and, like Deputy Ellis, I spent many years on Dublin City Council.  This legislation says that Dublin can wait.  We will not get a plebiscite until the local elections and if the people decide to have an elected mayor, we have been promised legislation two years later but we will not have a directly elected mayor for the greater Dublin area until the following local elections.  We will not see real change in our capital city for seven years, which is too long.  It is not only too long for Dublin but for the country.  <\/p><p> Dublin is not in competition with the rest of Ireland but is in competition with cities like Paris, London, Birmingham and Madrid for foreign direct investment.  We need a strong champion to champion the needs of Dublin people and to deliver jobs to the Dublin area.  If we get that leadership, or that figurehead, we can attract foreign direct investment to the Dublin region, which will increase the taxation take and will help many parts of Ireland.<\/p><p> We need to move away from this anti-Dublin attitude, which arises in this House at times but which is certainly prevalent around the country.  Like it or not, the greater Dublin area stretches from Arklow to Drogheda and out to Mullingar and Portlaoise.  It is the only large city on this island.  When major foreign companies decide where to locate their corporate headquarters, they look at our large urban areas.  <\/p><p> We need reform in Dublin and a mayor of the greater Dublin area.  We need him or her to champion Dublin and to attract investment, which would benefit the whole country.  As this legislation is framed, one is asking Dublin to wait for seven years.  It is always said Labour must wait but Dublin and Ireland cannot wait.  Dublin is our only major city and this is an opportunity to sell our capital city for foreign direct investment, more jobs, more income and more taxation, which will take us out of this recession.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to talk to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, about accelerating the speed of change for Dublin.  This needs to be done now and not in seven years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#QQ00500","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is not before time and puts a structure on local governance.  Like many others in this House, I spent a period of time on a local council and it was quite enlightening.  The amalgamation of the city and county councils of Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford should be extended possibly to my own county of Cork.  There are so many connections between the city and county council, it does not seem practical to have two separate authorities.<\/p><p>  I welcome the establishment of the economic development special policy committees to support business.  This really is a change because much of the criticism of local authorities was that they had no business acumen at all.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, are to be established and they will draw and build on the success of the county enterprise board model which supports up to 33,000 throughout the country, 900 projects per annum and approximately 25,000 training participants.  For the first time, the LEOs will bring together, in a structured and coherent manner, the skills expertise and resources of Enterprise Ireland, the county and city enterprise boards and the local authorities for micro and small business.  This is a real challenge and I hope it will work.  Small business people like myself require local help rather than hindrance.  <\/p><p>  Many of us have reservations about the abolition of town councils.  There is a challenge here because there are towns, such as Mitchelstown in my constituency, which never had a town council.  One could argue that Mitchelstown should have had one, that it was at a disadvantage by not having one and that population changes occurred along the way.  However, this is a challenge not only for the local representatives but also for communities.  When selecting and voting for candidates, people will have to figure out whether they will get representation in their areas.  <\/p><p>  Something about which I feel strongly and which is a little controversial is that we should pay councillors a proper wage, especially as we will have a lower number.  The situation is haphazard currently.  Most councillors must hold down a day job if they want to survive because they are currently paid approximately &euro;17,00 per year.  If this is the principal and only income coming into the household, it would seem the councillor would qualify for family income supplement.  If one has two children, the FIS threshold is &euro;602 per week but the councillor's income is only &euro;326 per week.   This is not good enough.  I know everybody gives out about the pay of politicians but we need to recognise these people will be doing a very important job.  As much as people want to serve their country, they must survive as well.  <\/p><p>  I remember from my time on the council that one was snowed under by meetings and one went from one meeting to another.  Sometimes there is so much going on that it is very hard to get around to the office, or the executive, side of the work.  If these councillors have a huge workload, they should get office assistance.  I am not sure how much is available.  It is fine to go to meetings but one must follow up on them and that takes the time and the skills of a secretarial assistant.  If most Deputies lost their personal assistants and secretaries, one can imagine the conundrum they would face.  Perhaps there should be a sharing of resources between councillors and Deputies and possibly the specialisation of councillors.  We need to balance the resources given to the executive with those being given to councillors.  <\/p><p>  When committees are being formed, account should be given to one's skills and not how long one has been a councillor.  There is no point leaving new councillors off committees for which they are imminently qualified and putting people who have been councillors longer on them.  Time does not always educate.  Another issue is training for committees.  If people get on to committees, they should be trained.  A few years ago, there was a big skit about councillors getting training on how to use Facebook.  That was not such a bad idea because the social media is becoming incredibly powerful and we need to know about these things.  <\/p><p>  We need to educate councillors but, more importantly, we need to educate councillors in the areas in which they will make decisions.  I sat for a while on an audit committee.  I heard one of the Opposition parties give out about how local government will not function but I was the only council member on that audit committee for a year and a half because the other member decided not turn up at all.  One cannot have it both ways.  One cannot complain and then not have councillors sit on an audit committee which is engaged in oversight.  Section 54(3)(a) refers to membership.  If somebody cannot turn up, he or she should nominate a substitute in his or her place so that there is proper oversight in the audit sections.<\/p><p>It has also been provided for that one will cease to be a member of the national oversight and audit committee if one does not attend six meetings.  The audit situation, which is important, can be overlooked at times.  Now is an important time to look at it.<\/p><p> We need to look more closely at the reserved and executive functions of councils.  There may have been a tendency for the executive to railroad certain items.  There was a breakdown when this happened.  Councillors were sometimes, perhaps wrongly, seen to be getting in the way.  I must admit I was particularly annoyed at times when certain items were railroaded through under the guise of health and safety.  It was not good enough.  When we put people in charge of the new councils, it is important for the new members to receive sufficient recognition.  In an ideal world, there would be mutual respect between the two groups.  This needs to be monitored really closely.<\/p><p> I accept that until now, the only time councillors had much of a say was when budgets and development plans were being agreed.  I remember getting a budget document late in the day.  I read through it as best I could.  I found it difficult to get through all of it.  The members of the council did not receive the assistance of an on-site accountant.  We were unlucky at the time because none of the members was an accountant.  This played into the hands of the executive that was pushing the budget through.  We had to take the budget on trust.  We need to empower our councillors properly by giving them the correct information and making sure they have the staff they need at their fingertips.  This is necessary to ensure the decisions made on behalf of the public are in the public interest.  It is a basic requirement.<\/p><p> While I accept that these changes present a challenge, I welcome the emphasis on the reform of local government.  I am glad the need to help local business has finally been recognised.  The local enterprise offices will have great potential if they are managed properly.  I am sure there will be problems and failings along the way.  If we get this right, small businesses will be able to create an enormous number of jobs throughout the country.  Many schemes, such as the internship programme and the JobsPlus scheme, have resulted from the jobs initiative.  One of our biggest issues is that we are not communicating all the new incentives that are out there.  Many people involved in small business have told me they did not avail of certain schemes because they did not realise they were available.<\/p><p> It is incumbent on us to try to make local councils welcoming places for those who want to start or expand businesses and are looking for help.  Proper assistance needs to be available.  Up to now, many people involved in business have felt they will be fine as long as the council stays away from them.  That is not the way forward.  I welcome this Bill.  I look forward to seeing it in action after it has been passed.  It is a major step in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#RR00200","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath and John Halligan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#SS00200","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":637,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Everybody knows we have one of the most centralised systems of governance in Europe, if not the world.  We will not be much better off in that respect after this much-discussed Bill has been passed.  It will not reverse the trend of stripping assets and decision-making from local authorities.  It will probably accelerate that process by abolishing town and borough councils.  I imagine that the idea of axing councils and reducing the number of councillors, thereby striking a better balance between the population of this country and the number of councillors nationally, would be viewed as a popular vote-getting measure.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, seems to have peddled it in that way.  I think it would appeal to most people because they believe councillors are useless and do nothing.  Having spent 13 years as a councillor, I do not believe councillors do nothing, although a few of them might be useless.  We do not have time for that aspect of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#SS00400","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":639,"content":"<p>What about Damien O'Farrell?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#SS00500","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":640,"content":"<p>The problem is not that they do nothing - it is what they do and what they are allowed to do.  It was ludicrous for the Deputy who spoke before me to argue that councillors should be paid a full-time wage, while at the same time making the case for a system that has stripped away the decision-making powers of councillors.  In my experience, many councillors spend their time annoying council officials by looking for information that is in the public domain anyway.  Rather than participating in governance and decision-making, they look for letters to promote themselves.  The nub of this issue is that local councillors are not empowered to make decisions on small or large items, which means that the public is similarly disenfranchised.<\/p><p>  I will mention a simple example of the problem I am talking about.  When the county manager and the officials in Fingal County Council were grappling with a large number of retiring librarians in the context of the recruitment embargo and the opening of a new library, they decided to axe library hours at lunchtime and in the evenings at a number of libraries.  The councillors and the public were up in arms - motions were passed unanimously at council meetings - but the cuts went ahead nonetheless.  That example has been repeated in every county regarding many other issues.  Powers were removed from councillors to disenfranchise the public.<\/p><p>  When I listened to the debates that took place in advance of the recent Seanad referendum, I found it ironic to hear Michael McDowell casting himself as a great liberator and defender of democracy as part of the campaign to maintain the elitist Seanad.  He was a member of the Cabinet that ensured decision-making powers were removed from councillors, one after the other.  He showed some neck, given that his Government removed from councillors the power to set or levy council rents, water charges or bin charges or to locate landfills or sewerage plants in certain areas.  The only power that councillors still have is the power to make decisions on development plans and zoning matters.  Even then, their hands are tied in many instances by the regulations and guidelines set by the Government at national level.  If the Government was really serious about local authority reform, Deputies would be asked to consider more than a simple mathematical sum that will reduce the number of councillors.  We would be asked to consider the delegation of power and to examine how councils are funded.  The Bill does not do those things.<\/p><p>  I have a serious problem with town councils as they stand.  I do not mean any disrespect to any town council members when I say there is no question about the fact that they are an absolute joke.  They are talking shops because they have no powers.  There are based in certain areas but not in others without there being rhyme or reason to it.  There are many town councils in areas outside Dublin, but there is just one town council in the Fingal County Council area.  The area controlled by the town council in question is confined to the old part of Balbriggan, based on historic boundaries, which means all of the new population could not vote in town council elections.  I would certainly be surprised if anybody tried to defend town councils are they currently constituted.<\/p><p>  People at local level must be empowered through the empowerment of local councils.  The best decisions are those made locally by those who live in the relevant area and who know what is best for it.  If one takes a trip to any part of Europe, one will see that such an approach is being implemented and is working incredibly effectively.  We are taking the opposite approach by moving in the direction of outsourcing, privatisation and the removal of powers and assets from local authorities lock, stock and barrel.  We are stripping funding from councils at national level and replacing it with the proceeds of the hated home tax, the implementation of which they are having to grapple with.  The money that is coming from this source will not undo the damage caused by the funding cuts.<\/p><p>  I remind the House that the programme for Government states:<blockquote>We will abolish the position of County Manager and replace it with that of Chief Executive, with a limited range of executive functions.  The primary function of the Chief Executive will be to facilitate the implementation of democratically decided policy.<\/blockquote>That sounds good.  It would be great to strip power from county managers, but that will not happen under the Bill.<\/p><p>Under section 49, amendment to chapter 2 of part 14 (4) of the principal Act, &quot;Any function which immediately before the date of the commencement of <i>section 49<\/i>of the <i>Local Government Act 2013<\/i> ... shall, on and from that date, continue to ... be a function of the chief executive.&quot;.  In other words, no change.  We change the name of the county manager to chief executive but all of the decision-making rests with central government with the county and city managers and unelected quangos.  That is not reform that is the continuation and acceleration of an undemocratic process.  This is not even window-dressing, it is an insult and a serious lost opportunity.  I am completely opposed to it as being nothing positive whatsoever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#SS00600","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the Local Government Bill 2013.  At the last election all candidates whether independents or from political parties promised reform and change.  We need to stick to that agenda if we are ever to change anything this country.  I fully agree with aspects of this legislation and I will deal with these later.<\/p><p>  I also have concerns about democracy and our people's respect for democratic values in this country.  Our people are calling for quality and efficient local government.  Reform involves accountability, transparency and good quality local government.  It should not, however, use this as a front to bash or damage the integrity of democratic politics.  It is trendy in some quarters to slag off politicians and politics in general and lately, even local councillors.  The recent referendum on the Seanad was a case in point.  The so-called &quot;Yes&quot; campaign left a lot to be desired.  The argument for fewer politicians and the misleading figure of &euro;20 million saved in the cost of the Seanad, have damaged politics and democracy.  We can all whinge about Deputies, Senators and councillors but if there is a fairer and better way, call me and let me know about it.<\/p><p>  I was a councillor in Dublin City Council and enjoyed my stint in City Hall, working at local and community level.  I commend and thank the majority of councillors for their dedication, commitment and duty to public service.  Most try to do their best for their local communities.  Any corrupt councillors should be driven out of politics or be locked up.  This legislation should attend to and support the silent majority.  That is why I want to make sure that their voices are heard in this debate.  Abolishing them or telling them to get lost is not good for local democracy, it distances people further from local politicians.  This worries me because already, 30% to 40% of people are disconnected or are not engaged with politicians and democratic politics.  In my area, Dublin Bay North, there is usually a good turnout, in the region of 65%.  That was the case even in the recent referendum.  While many think that 65% is a good turnout, I have major concerns that 30% to 35% in my constituency either stay at home or do not vote.  I worry about this from a democratic point of view, particularly for those in the poorest and most disadvantaged areas.<\/p><p>  Overall, the legislation deals with reform.  I welcome that aspect of the Bill.  The Bill provides the necessary legislative basis to give effect to many of the reform measures set out by the Government.  It contains 65 sections in 10 Parts and five Shedules.  Its detail includes reorganisation of the structure of local government at county, sub county and regional levels, involving the merger of six city and county councils into three and the dissolution of all 80 town councils.  It also puts in place a comprehensive modern system of municipal governance with an integrated county and sub-county organisation and appropriate reserved functions and powers assigned to elected members at county and district levels, and appropriate financial arrangements.  The revised council membership is in line with the local areas drawn up in May 2013.  There is wider provision for devolution of functions from central to local government.  These are all positive steps and I welcome them.  It is very easy to be critical when you are in opposition but when change is happening we must look at the serious options on the table and say &quot;Yes&quot;.<\/p><p>  I warmly welcome the provision for community and local development, including the establishment of local community development committees within the local government system and dissolution of the county development boards.  This has huge potential for the future.  I also welcome the provision for a plebiscite on the possible establishment of the office of the directly elected mayor for the Dublin metropolitan area and related governance options because it gives the people of Dublin city and Dublin county the opportunity to consider different options.  Having considered the detail I am going for option one, the directly elected Lord Mayor with a cabinet.  Let him or her serve five or six years, do the business and then be accountable to the people of Dublin.  That section involves accountability, transparency and efficiency.  Above all, it means that if the candidate does not deliver after five years he or she can be booted out by the people.  That is what democracy is all about.<\/p><p>  The legislation contains amendments, repeals and recommendations arising from the reorganisation of local government structures.  The post of manager will be replaced by that of chief executive, providing a statutory expression of the duty of the chief executive to assist in the formation of policy by the elected council to comply with the council's policy.  That is another positive aspect of the Bill.<\/p><p>  I have concerns about section 23, which provides for the dissolution of town councils.  I have a problem with this because I believe it is important to listen to town councillors.  I have many friends who have served on local town councils and have done excellent work.  Many members of this House served on town councils.<\/p><p>  Part 6 deals with the alignment of the local community development sector with local governance.  Section 128B in the new chapter 2, amending the principal Act, provides for the function of the local government development bodies.  That is a positive statement.  Section 128F(1) in the same chapter, provides that the Minister can make regulations for the purpose of the chapter generally, in respect of local development committees and may issue general policy guidelines with which the committees must comply.  That is a strong section.<\/p><p>  I have concerns about aspects of this legislation, particularly town councils but overall I welcome it because we were elected on a platform of reform and change.  Damage was done over the past six or seven years.  Now those of us who have the honour to have been elected and have another chance must come forward in support of reform.  The positive elements of this legislation should be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#TT00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I have argued from the outset that the sweeping reduction in the number of elected representatives as set out in the Bill has the potential to create a damaging distance between voters and local government.  Having served as a councillor for many years I know all too well the importance people place on knowing an elected representative in their community and on having personal contact with that representative.  At a time when it should be promoting and developing active citizenship the Government is instead putting in place a policy that will further detach many citizens from the elected representatives.  I have read the Bill carefully and I agree with some of its aspects.  It would be naive of me, having been a councillor for 14 years, to say that significant reform is not needed.  I am not saying that every village or main street in the country requires a town council but the fact that large towns, such as Tramore in my own constituency, of Waterford, which has a population of 10,000 are to be left without political representation is a step too far.  The closure of area offices in well-populated rural areas such as Kilmacthomas in County Waterford will undoubtedly cause difficulties particularly for older people.  I am disappointed that as with the campaign to abolish the Seanad, the Government has no interest in proposing reform.<\/p><p>Slash and burn appears to be the order of the day.   <\/p><p> It is incomprehensible that legislation to provide for the election of mayors is not already in place given that the mayor is an important figure in any city and is still elected by a pact system.  I must admit that I was elected through this system.  That is wrong.  The vast majority of people do not accept that and want to be able to vote for their mayors, yet we have not even put in place proper legislation as to when we will elect a mayor in Dublin.  Perhaps I am wrong on this.  Anybody who served on a council will know that the committees were always divvied out depending on the party that had most seats on the council.  That was wrong.  Very competent councillors were excluded because they were not members of the main parties.  I suppose all parties were affected by this depending on whether Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or Labour had the power on the council.  That was fundamentally wrong.  I always found that the committees that were money-spinners inevitably went to people on the pact who were in Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or Labour.  That was wrong.  Even the budgets were entirely economically controlled.  One would say they were not but they were controlled apart from car parking charges and small issues.  They were almost entirely controlled by the central government.  I am disappointed that there is no reform along those lines.<\/p><p> It is being claimed that the changes proposed in this Bill will allow for savings of between &euro;40 million and &euro;45 million.  That is overly simplistic.  It is an assumption that larger local authorities serving larger populations will automatically be cost-effective.  That has not been the case across Europe.  If one studies Europe and even town councils in the US and Canada, one can see that this is not the case.  A large body of research suggests that there is a weak link between size and efficiency in local authority mergers with little or no effect on savings in most services.  One can get these statistics anywhere one likes.  Extensive international research on local authority amalgamations suggests that one-off transitional costs can hugely limit the potential savings that may arise from mergers.  Again, these are all studies that have been carried out in central Europe.  In particular, we should look at the system in France.  I accept that there are certain areas where economics of scale may exist such as sharing IT and back office services but surely a shared service arrangement would have been a more practical solution.  <\/p><p> I would have liked far more time in which to speak but I would like the Minister to clarify why these costs are still not available.  We are told that the Waterford city manager has estimated that it will be an up-front cost of about &euro;2 million excluding the cost to the State of staff members who are made redundant as a result of the merger.  The question of whether the savings will outweigh the costs has not been answered adequately.  This question needs to be answered.  We certainly have not been told what improvements to services will come about as a result of mergers.

This has the effect of reducing the overall number of councillors in the State from 1,627 to 949 while increasing the number of county councillors from 883 to 949.  Section 15 sets out the number of seats for local electoral areas in each local authority.  It provides that the Minister may, by order, disband regional authorities and replace them with regional assemblies composed of existing councillors.  The immediate impact of the structural changes are that 31 city and county councils will replace 34 county councils and 80 town councils and that there will be a district level tier to cover the full territory of the State bar Dublin.  There is a significant reduction in representation for the 14% of the population who live in areas with town councils.  On the other hand, in places which had no town councils, the effect of creating municipal districts whose councils together act on behalf of the district would seem to improve the quality of representation.  The effect of the changes on the quality of representation depends very much on how the municipal districts function and on the extent of their autonomy and power.  The Bill sets aside specific functions which are to be performed at the district level, including that the district members contribute to the drafting of the district budget and the annual schedule of works for the municipal district and may amend the chief executive's final draft of both.  The county council may, by resolution, delegate other tasks to the district level.  However, the county council is legally responsible for decisions taken at the municipal level.  The municipal district is not a separate legal entity but a formation of the council.<\/p><p>  As part of a policy to enhance the role of elected councillors in local government, the position of county manager is replaced by that of chief executive who has more statutory obligations toward elected members.  The chief executive remains a central Government appointee appointed by the Public Appointments Service and subsequently by a formal resolution of the council.  The Bill gives the local council the power to veto such an appointment after which the recruitment process begins again.  The Bill restricts the power of local councils to use section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 in respect of planning.  It provides that each of the 31 councils will establish a strategic policy committee on social and economic development to function as other strategic policy committees as per the Local Government Act 2001.  It dissolves county and city development boards and provides that all councils will have local community development committees.  The policy objective is to align local community and economic development with local government.  <\/p><p>  On 16 October 2012, the Government published an action programme for effective local government entitled Putting People First as part of its commitment in the programme for Government to reform local government.  The action programme outlined a range of possible reforms to local government before presenting the reforms which the Government is to implement under four categories: reform of structure; reforms of funding, accountability and government arrangement, including balance of power between the Executive and elected council; local government involvement in economic development and job creation; and reforms to ensure efficiency in service delivery.  An independent boundary committee established by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in November 2012 in accordance with the 2001 Act made recommendations for the division of each county council area into local electoral areas and on the number of councils seats to be assigned to each local electoral area.  The committee was asked to make its recommendations in the policy context set out in the action programme and to be cognisant that as far as possible, the local electoral areas were to coincide with the new municipal districts.  Its terms of reference also required that it improve balance and consistency in representational status throughout the county and take into account the location of towns and their hinterland in the creation of new local electoral areas and that each municipal district will constitute a single electoral area with a membership of between six and ten councillors except in exceptional circumstances.  <\/p><p>  There are four local authorities in Louth - Louth County Council, Dundalk Town Council, Drogheda Borough Council and Ardee Town Council.  There are 47 elected councillors representing the four elected councils in 11 electoral areas.  That will change to 29 elected councillors covering four electoral areas - two six-seaters, one seven-seater and one ten-seater.  The reforms introduced by the Bill will result in gratuity payments for town, city and county councillors for losing their seats.  Under current rules, following the replacement of town councils with a system of municipal districts, members who do not go to be re-elected to city or county councils will be entitled to pay-outs for losing their positions.  According to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, amounts are expected to average almost &euro;4,000 for town councillors but exact compensation payments will depend on number of years served and position.  The limit is &euro;16,000 for 20 years' service.  The overall cost of the payout has been estimated at &euro;45 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#UU00500","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Local Government Bill 2013, which introduces some of the biggest reforms we will see during the term of this Government.  The abolition of town councils is a positive development.  Rather than being a diminution of local government, as some would suggest, it will empower local government and make it more efficient.  Whereas the number of councillors will be reduced by 600 overall, my county, Kildare, will get a significant increase from 25 to 40 councillors due to the increase in our population.<\/p><p>  I will draw on my experience of being a member of Kildare County Council and, in particular, a member of the Athy area committee from 2009 until the general election in 2011 because I saw at first hand how inefficient the system was.  I was elected to the council with 1,980 votes but, even though the last seat on Athy Town Council was taken with 67 first preference votes, as a member of the area committee I was not allowed to ask any questions regarding planning or housing matters in the Athy Town Council area.  Those in Athy who voted for me were not getting good value because power was not divided equally across the councils.  It has been suggested that towns like Athy and Newbridge will lose representation but it is clear that the municipal areas of these towns are being expanded into parts of the hinterland that were not previously part of the town council.  Residents in Athgarvan and Milltown should be treated no differently to those of Newbridge and the people of Kilkee and Castlemitchell should be treated the same as the residents of Athy.  That is what the municipal areas will do.  The two urban district councils in the county, Naas and Athy, existed for historic reasons but in moving towards a one county authority we should be mindful of the potential for disparities in the rates that businesses pay in these councils.  I understand the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is aware of this issue.<\/p><p>  I was a member of the finance committee of Kildare County Council.  We held interesting meetings in advance of the annual budgets to discuss the issues arising.  I went into my first meeting with excitement at the prospect of influencing the budget only to find out that more than 80% of the budget was non-discretionary.  When I asked what areas of expenditure were discretionary, areas like the fire service, which we obviously were not going to cut, were mentioned.  This meant we ended up with little influence over the budget.  The variation on the local property tax from 2015 onwards, as announced in this Bill, changes that somewhat because we know from the mistakes made in abolishing rates in 1977 that there is an inextricable link between power and money.  If a local authority cannot collect rates it does not have the same amount of power.  Councillors will be more responsible in exercising that power because if, for example, they decide to reduce the property tax rate they will have to defend the reduction in services, whereas if they increase it they will have to be able to point to greater service provision.  That, in turn, will impact on accountability among officials because the local councillor will not be able to blame central government or anybody else for inefficiency.  <\/p><p>  The strengthening of SPCs is welcome and the local enterprise offices will ensure that resources go directly to local businesses.  I commend this Bill to the House as a reforming piece of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#VV00100","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Local Government Bill 2013.

County and city councils, enterprise boards and local development companies must use funds from central government in a co-ordinated manner to ensure the best delivery of services.  To this end, the Bill sets out major structural reforms.  The number of local authorities will be reduce from 114 to 31 and the number of elected members will decrease from 1,627 to 949.  Each councillor will represent his or constituents and community at municipal district and county council level.  The dual mandate of membership of town council and county council will end.<\/p><p>  The reforms provide for the alignment of the local community development sectors with local government.  Local community development committees will be established to bring strategic co-ordination to the millions of euro spent annually on local and community development initiatives.  Each county will be required to establish an economic development SPC.  The SPC in County Cork has been in operation for a number of years and has engaged business organisations, third level institutions, local development companies and enterprise boards in a co-operative effort to establish new business ventures.  The new economic development SPCs will also provide direct planning oversight and accountability for the new local enterprise offices.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, has emphasised the importance he attaches to local democracy.  Services must be delivered through the democratic structures that are closest to the people and their communities.  To this end, the Bill provides that in future no separate structures for delivering public services will be established outside of local government.  This Bill will strengthen the role of councils and provide platform for their further expansion.  Provision is made in the Bill for the devolution of functions to include those of State bodies generally.  However, with increased power comes increased responsibility.  From 2015, councillors will be able to vary the rate of the local property tax by 15% upwards or downwards.  They will also have control over many other charges and fees.  Citizens will have better engagement with local councillors in regard to how their money is spent and, therefore, will be able to judge how well their council performs compared to other councils.<\/p><p>  The Bill will introduce a new era for local governance.  Many challenges lie ahead of us but I am confident the Bill lays the basis for a new, exciting and effective future for local government and community development and I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#VV00200","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Like many Deputies, I am a former member of a local authority, having served on Galway County Council for seven years.  As a representative of the Connemara local electoral area, I felt the system worked quite well.  Local government is currently overseen by the Local Government Act 2001, which consolidated previous legislation on local government.  The Putting People First document, which was published in October 2012, sets out a well-drafted action plan for effective local government.  It represents a culmination of time, energy and effort invested in designing a more effective system of local government.  It outlines a range of possible reforms in the following four broad strands: reforming structures; reforming funding, accountability and governance; involving local government in economic development and job creation; and maximising the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery.<\/p><p>  The Local Government Bill 2013 builds on these strands to introduce the necessary changes to enhance functions, performance and structures of local authorities, with the overarching aim of providing the highest level of public service.  The localism of our politics and national Parliament is the subject about much debate.  In many ways, this has detracted from our system of local government.  The differing experiences of councillors across the country should be added to this.  It is fair to say that councillors in urban areas can get more attention than their rural counterparts, particular in respect of media attention.  The recent RTE documentary focusing on the constituency work of Deputies demonstrated the close interaction between local citizens and the national Parliament.  It is interesting to note the range of commentary regarding the hands-on approach that Deputies take to politics.  Some commentators have decried the system and argued that the role of Deputies' should be confined to the national stage.  The question arises, however, of how we reconcile the apparently low representation per voter in respect of the number of constituents required to elect an individual to a local authority.  The ratio is much lower in many other countries than in Ireland.  That is not the public perception.<\/p><p> The disparity is compounded by the uneven spread of town councils across the country.  These are historical in nature and reflect a long since changed Ireland.  The electoral area of Connemara in which I was elected in 2004 has a voting population of approximately 30,000, yet it has no town councils.  There was no town council at all in the Galway West constituency, which stretches from Annaghdown to Athenry and Clarinbridge.  Galway city has its own city council.<\/p><p> A further 80 locations have town councils of various sizes and with various powers.  Some have revenue raising powers, in that they can set local rates, but day-to-day functions are by and large enacted by their county-based authorities.<\/p><p> Of particular note is the new chief executive role in the new municipal district category.  The relationship between county managers and elected council members can often provide media outlets with much material.  That county and city managers are appointed by central government and are, in effect, responsible to the Minister are undoubtedly factors.  This can disempower the elected public representatives to a certain degree and sometimes create an unhelpful tension and adversarial atmosphere.  The Bill contains a number of provisions to address these issues, not least by enhancing the policy making role of councillors.  It is appropriate to increase the accountability and obligations of the chief executive and the heads of services to elected councillors.<\/p><p> As the Putting People First document states, municipal districts will be the first level of governance and democratic representation.  The independent boundary committee has declared that each municipal district will constitute a single electoral area with a membership of six to ten councillors and that each county will have three to four such districts.  Section 21 of the Bill inserts a new section in the Local Government Act 2001, outlining the new functions of councillors at municipal district level, including issues pertaining to property, dwellings, monuments, business, trading, the environment, litter, roads, parking, local improvement works and a fund for community works.<\/p><p> I referred to my position as a councillor in the Connemara electoral area.  That system worked well and is the model for the roll-out of municipal areas to the rest of the country.  A municipal area is a confined area, as we were at the time, with seven councillors - increasing to nine - who elect a chairman and run the affairs of that area as best they can.  The councillors with whom I worked and who are still there have been able to perform these functions well.  I am sure they will continue to do so.  I am delighted that this local area model of governance is being enhanced and extended via municipal districts, as the people are the ultimate beneficiaries of such an approach.<\/p><p> The re-alignment of the community sector has raised some concerns, although those have settled down somewhat.  Connemara has bodies such as FORUM in Letterfrack that provide valuable services for their local communities.  These communities believe that any re-alignment or provision of power to local authorities will disempower them because they are more than one hour away from County Buildings in Galway city.  This is a genuine concern, as those bodies provide a good service and people are able to approach them and their workers on the ground with proposals for job creation and various other initiatives.  It is important that this bottom-up approach continue.  The Minister has advocated that it will not change.<\/p><p> I wish to address an issue that has arisen and that will be a focus in terms of councillors' increased powers.  Deputy Heydon also mentioned it.  It is difficult to believe that there are seven fire stations in east Galway whereas there is only one in Clifden, Connemara.  South Connemara's large population has no fire service.  This issue was raised in the council chamber last week, when all councillors were in agreement on the need for such a service.  I can see from the Minister's gestures that he is fully in support of this proposal.  Local councillors must debate this issue.  Within the constraints on the country and their local electorates, councillors must make difficult decisions on what to do with the property tax so as to ensure that necessary and deserved services like a fire station in south Connemara are provided.<\/p><p> I commend the Minister on this reforming Bill.  I am sure the roll-out of the municipal districts will work well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#VV00300","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Next are Deputies Timmins, Terence Flanagan, Keaveney, Broughan and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, with four minutes per Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#WW00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":654,"content":"<p>The Minister will hear many contributions on Second Stage.  Most, mine included, will be tailored to our own areas and experiences.  Probably more than any other Deputy, the Minister has experience of local authorities and councillors.  I do not say this lightly.  I commend him on introducing this Bill.  Notwithstanding broad-ranging Second Stage speeches, he knows that how the Bill is handled on Committee Stage will define whether the reform of local government works.  The Bill has many good aspects and there are aspects with which I do not agree for personal and policy reasons.  The Minister will ensure that Committee Stage gets the time it deserves, as this is the first time in 100 years that real reform is being introduced.<\/p><p>  It is good that the Minister does not court publicity or popularity.  In this regard, he is unique in politics.  He does what he believes is right.  I am not patronising him or seeking an amendment to the Bill.  As a political entity, we have continuously handed power to other bodies in recent years because we could not trust ourselves.  What I am about to ask the Minister for will be difficult for him to do.  It is called the postman concept.  At one time, the curate, the public health nurse and the postman knew where everyone in a community was.  Given how often the register has gone wrong, I am an advocate of letting the postman work on the boundary commission.  Notwithstanding the fact that, by and large, the broad sweep is correct, some communities have been divided by electoral boundaries.  I do not know the Kilkenny situation, but two boxes in Thomastown might be in the north Kilkenny district while two might be in the south.  This does not make sense.  The overemphasis on getting the population factor right has divided communities.  I do not know whether the Minister has the remit to revise the boundaries.  It would be unpopular and we could be accused of interfering, but it does not matter to me whether people are placed in this or that district.  Dividing a local electoral district, LED, does not make sense.<\/p><p>  I have mixed views on the membership of the local community development committee.  It is important that councillors are the driving force behind everything, as they are responsible to their local electoral areas.  I am a great advocate of people each having one, two, three or however many jobs, but two people having one job can create difficulties.<\/p><p>  Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy is in charge of the working group on citizen engagement with local government.  The legislation has a shortcoming from the LED down.  As with countries such as France, there can be an unpaid system of forums.  Blessington is a classic example of a non-statutory forum elected by the people.  I will send the details to the Minister's Department.  This forum works.  The town experienced considerable difficulties when new people moved there, with conflicts over developments etc. but the forum was set up and defused everything.  It is working in an harmonious manner.  Currently, it is following up on the issue of the Glending estate, which the Minister knows needs a radical overhaul.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister ensure that area councils where there have been no town councils heretofore will set up offices that are staffed from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., five days per week or whatever?  It should not be the case that a county manager would try to run a north Kilkenny or Castlecomer district from the town hall in Kilkenny.  There should be an office in Castlecomer, Tullaroan etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#WW00300","speaker":"1184"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>As a member of the reform alliance, I welcome the Bill.  All steps towards reform are welcome.  The local government system is clearly in urgent need of reform.  The Minister's description of the proposed reforms as the most radical reform of local government in more than a century is true.  He is to be commended in that regard.<\/p><p>I am concerned that we did not move towards a system with more local authorities, such as in France which has a local authority for every 1,500 inhabitants.  In addition, a local mayor is elected in every French town and village.  People there feel that they are part of a community with shared values.  That system has worked very well in France as many Irish people will have seen during visits there over the years.<\/p><p> The Minister will be judged on what differences this Bill will make to customers and consumers.  Will a quality service be provided for all citizens?  Under the new measures councils will have a greater say in local enterprise, jobs and economic development.  <\/p><p> There are many provisions in the Bill but I wish to focus on two areas in particular.  One concerns directly elected city mayors and I welcome that plan for Dublin.  As previous speakers have said, they wish to see someone elected who will have a strong voice and be seen as a figurehead with real power and responsibility.  That is long overdue.  It is a good move, but when does the Minister see this being rolled out?  A previous speaker expressed concern that it may take up to seven years for directly elected mayors to become a practical reality.  Dublin's citizens want to see the city run as efficiently and effectively as possible.  We have seen the great success of directly elected mayors in London who have full executive powers to deal with housing, culture, transport, economic development, regeneration, planning and environmental issues.  <\/p><p> The Bill also gives councils power to increase or decrease property tax by 15%.  It is crucial that citizens should perceive changes within their communities before any property tax increases are introduced.  The Minister is aware of how people feel on the issue, particularly with regard to seeing benefits in their local areas as a consequence of paying such a tax.  People are concerned that local authorities should not see this as a method to grab cash through increasing property tax by 15%.  Residents are also concerned by the length of time it takes to repair roads and footpaths, in addition to other local authority works.<\/p><p> How much will it cost to abolish town councils?  The Bill does not provide for measures to devolve more power to local government from central government.  Perhaps the Minister could address those points in his reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#WW00400","speaker":"1182","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I wish to acknowledge the work of all local authority staff and thank them for their dedication and commitment to delivering public services in our communities.  Local government reform is one of those topics that can often secure broad agreement across the Chamber, but I have some reservations about the Bill.  Nevertheless, I welcome the fact the Minister has introduced the legislation which, I agree, represents a substantial overhaul of our local government system.<\/p><p>  The Bill encompasses many facets and I will focus on a few specific areas.  Properly functioning local government should represent the first comprehensive link between citizens and the State, but that has not been the citizens' experience since the inception of the State.  I would argue that has been the case, in particular, since the abolition of rates in 1977 by the government of former Taoiseach Jack Lynch.  That move is now understood to have been a policy mistake.  <\/p><p>  While I would quibble about the form in which the recently imposed property tax has been presented to the public, it represents the forging of a powerful link between the people and local government.  Local taxes to fund local government services will only be accepted if they are seen as just.  In addition, such scarce resources must be spent transparently.  <\/p><p>  I will not expand on my objections to the format of delivering the local property tax.  However, I call on the Minister to examine how we can secure accountability.  The Bill's provisions should ensure that every citizen will be given a clear annual statement on how their property tax is spent in that municipal area.  When I canvass in my local community, many people say they are prepared to co-operate but they want to know where that property tax is being spent in their area.<\/p><p>  Municipal councils must have an appropriate spending power so that councillors can work in close co-operation with executives, communities and citizens to determine how those resources are spent.  Such expenditure can only be supported where it is transparent.  When money is spent on behalf of citizens it is important for them to have an annual statement on how such an investment has been made.<\/p><p>  One of the key points of grievance in my county - as I suspect the Minister is well aware - concerns the property charge on people who live in unfinished estates.  The Minister has taken a special interest in that regard.  Many people are rightly unhappy at having to pay a charge while living in such estates and waiting for a developer and the council to sort out legal issues, including outstanding bonds.  I have been working with several residents' groups across east Galway in an effort to resolve this issue.  We need to see far greater activity from central government encouraging our county managers to take up this issue.  To the Galway county manager's credit, this process has been kept well in train to date.  It is, however, essential for all local authorities to address this matter specifically.<\/p><p>  Some previous speakers spoke about the customer's relationship with the local authority.  There is a unique opportunity to underpin the property tax policy by giving a relationship to citizens allowing them to demand customer services from their local authority. <\/p><p>  I will support the Bill and its proposed reforms.  Large tranches of this legislation need to be introduced as soon as possible.  Our citizens expect this type of reform.  This is a unique opportunity and I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought these significant changes before the House in the form of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#XX00200","speaker":"1179"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I join with my colleague Deputy Keaveney in commending the work of all our local government officials around the country.

First, decisions and the decision-makers should be as close as possible to the citizens they affect.  The closer they are, the better the decision.  This is because people are offered an opportunity to become the decision-makers and also ensures decision-makers are accessible to citizens.  This close proximity allows for far better oversight by the citizens.  Conversely, if one distances the decisions from citizens, this has the affect of making the decisions unrepresentative and lacks necessary oversight.  We see this happening all the time when citizens become frustrated and disengage from the political process.<\/p><p>  The second rule is that the deeper the democracy, the better for the quality of the decision.  When one reduces the number of representatives in a democracy, this makes the democracy shallower and reduces the voice of the citizen.  The EU as currently constituted is the great dysfunctional example of this.  This Bill breaks both rules.  It creates a distance between the citizen and the decision and reduces the voice of the decision-maker.<\/p><p>  The wholesale destruction of the town council model is a mistake.  Critical to large cities and towns in the context of spatial development are specific resources and a political centre of gravity.  They need a council.  The absence of a city council in certain areas and town councils in larger towns will create a significant challenge for those areas in competing against larger resource-rich and strategy-rich cities.  The difference is clear in my county.  While there is a town council in Navan, there is none in Ashbourne, which is the second largest town in the county.  Strategic development, resources and funds have historically gone to Navan, with none going to towns such as Ashbourne.<\/p><p>  That money needs to be saved is not contested.

It is important to note that decisions without resources are a nonsense.  Without the resources to implement decisions, councils will be only talking shops.  Local authorities are cash starved.  Funding for the repair of roads in my county has been radically reduced over recent years.  There are currently 3,300 people on the local authority housing list in my area.  Last year, the council there made only three acquisitions in the whole year.  The recently introduced budget identified 500 new local authority housing builds.  This equates to three additional houses in each of the six local electoral areas, LEAs, in Meath.  In the context of a housing waiting list of 3,300, an additional three houses for each of the six LEAs is ridiculous.  On a human level, the local authority crisis in County Meath and other counties is a disaster.<\/p><p>  This type of reform is a sham if the Government continues to reduce necessary budgets.  There is much confusion around the proposed new municipal districts.  Some councillors to whom I have spoken, including from the Fine Gael and Labour parties, believe that the municipal districts will have power, autonomy, headquarters and budgets.  As I understand it, they will not.  Rather, municipal districts, which often will have replaced a town council, will be able to make decisions with a cost implication independent of the remainder of the council and, most importantly, without a budget.  In that scenario, who will make the decision?

The fall-out from the tribunals in regard to planning corruption dominated that period and continued up to recent years.  The drip-drip effect of these tribunals since then has rightly angered the voting and tax-paying public.  It was this anger, coupled with a desire for change and a better way of doing things, that, along with a great deal of persuasion from a local teacher and others, encouraged me in 1999, at 21 years of age, to include my name on the ballot paper for election to Meath County Council and Navan Town Council.  Much of what frustrated me as a young councillor is addressed in this Bill and the overall reforms introduced by the Minister, Deputy Hogan.<\/p><p>  Local government now has its own tax which it can alter as the need arises.  While more should be done in the area of commercial rates, that is an issue for another day.  I know the Minister has plans to tackle that issue.  The establishment of local community development committees will make local government a one-stop-shop for all aspects of community, EU and other funding sources.  This is to be welcomed as it will lead to a much more joined-up and strategic approach to investment in our communities.  The enhancement of the role of local government in enterprise is also to be welcomed.  I hope it will lead to a renewed push for home grown jobs in SMEs, which will be the key to our nation's continued recovery.  I am aware that some business organisations are concerned about how all of this will pan out.  I think this measure is a real positive and an opportunity for local government and local business to work well together.  Up to now, the perception in local government has been that businesses can afford to carry all the costs.  They cannot.  There is a need for a much greater understanding between the two, which can only be good.  This will be the effect of the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  I look forward to seeing how this develops.  It is a positive move that should be welcomed and encouraged, including through the policies of Enterprise Ireland.  The Bill also provides for a greater role for strategic policy committees, SPCs, in the auditing of spending throughout the year.  This is another welcome change that will enhance local government and the role of the local councillor.<\/p><p>  Returning to 1999, while I was elected to Meath County Council, despite needing fewer votes, I was unsuccessful in getting elected to Navan Town Council.  I did not feel at a huge loss in not being elected as a member of that body, in part because a good friend, colleague and mentor, Councillor Jim Holloway, had been elected to both bodies at that time.  We have worked well together since then.  There are many elected representatives in Navan, Kells and Trim, of all parties and none, who have committed their time to represent the people of their respective towns on town councils.  Each must be recognised and thanked for their work and efforts on behalf of their constituents and communities.  I acknowledge the staff and former staff of the three town councils in Meath and their families who supported them in their work.  They have rendered great civic and public service to the people of Kells, Trim and Navan.  Many aspects of life in these times are much better because of their presence and work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#YY00700","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382535000,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Older Citizens: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1382535000,"counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#ZZ00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382535000,"counter":675,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Billy Kelleher on Tuesday, 22 October 2013:&quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:agrees that Irish society should protect the rights of older citizens and solidarity between the generations;\r\n\r\naccepts that services for older people should be protected to allow them to live independently and with dignity;\r\n\r\nagrees that older people are more anxious now about services being removed from them which will lead to isolation and illness;\r\n\r\nconcurs that older people do not want to be pressurised about means tests and application forms for health care services;\r\n\r\nagrees that the elderly should not be used as just economic statistics; andcalls for:-- all public services to be maintained for older citizens in a fair and progressive manner; and\r\n\r\n-- the Government to reaffirm Ireland's agreement to the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing while working towards a new UN Convention on the Rights of Older People.&#8221;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Deputies Flanagan, Boyd Barrett, Daly, Wallace and Pringle are sharing time and have two minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#ZZ00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I never thought I would come in here and say that I was going to sound like the Taoiseach, or Deputy Enda Kenny as he was known before the last election.

If the Taoiseach thinks it is no big deal to take the telephone allowance off the elderly, he obviously does not know exactly what they use the telephone for.  I have had several people contact me about losing this allowance, because it means their pendant alarm will not work anymore.  It was a big enough struggle for people even with those pendant alarms, given that the Government closed down their local Garda station and they do not feel that secure as it is, but it is a real low blow to take away their telephone.  Some people will say that they can use mobile phones or some other form of technology, but the reality is that many elderly people find it very daunting to use a mobile phone.  This means that the Government has cut them off.  As far as I can remember, that is not what Deputy Enda Kenny was promising.<\/p><p>  I notice that Vincent Browne played the clip twice last night of the Taoiseach making that wonderful promise.

It is appalling in the extreme to take away their telephone allowance.  Symbolically as well as practically it is disgusting to take away the bereavement grant, and to remove the subsidies for those who feel forced to take out private health insurance, which will now make it unaffordable and throw those people back into the public health system, from which the Government intends to take &euro;1 billion and which will not be able to cope with the pressures it will face in the coming year.  These cuts mean misery, suffering, cruelty, anxiety and, in some cases, may even lead to unnecessary deaths of people.  That is the reality and it is all the more appalling that it could be done by a Minister and several members of his Government who railed against precisely these measures when they were attempted by the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  How can the Minister look people straight in the face after saying the things he said in 2008?  How can the T&aacute;naiste or the Taoiseach do so, and then do what they are now doing to our pensioners and vulnerable citizens?<\/p><p>  This is appalling and I ask the Minister to pull back from the brink.

However, none of it rings true to people outside, because everybody knows that those moving the motion tonight were the same people who did exactly the same as this Government when they were the Government.  When the Government Members were in the Opposition, they did the same thing.  For many Members in here, it is all a big joke and a charade.  They get up here and they huff and puff, and then life goes on.  The real message is that life does not go on for the people who are suffering from the consequences of the decisions that are being made here.<\/p><p>  Let us park all the waffle and the rhetoric and look at the actions that have been taken.  In presenting this budget, the Government has made a choice to put on the shoulders of the elderly direct cuts equating to about &euro;100 million.  That amount of money is nothing.  The Government has exceeded the budget that the troika asked it to cut.  If the Government had levied a paltry 1% wealth tax on incomes of over &euro;1 million, it would have had five times that amount of money.  If the Government had insisted on the actual rate of corporation tax - one of the lowest in Europe - being the effective rate, it could have raised an extra &euro;2.5 billion.  The Government could have presented a budget that would have given elderly citizens a decent retirement and medical and health security, but it has chosen not to do so, even though the figures are there to back up such a budget.<\/p><p>  Not only will the cuts be devastating, but a number of them are sneaky.  Telephone lines will be cut at a time when people need to ring their grandchildren who have been exiled to Australia.  Under any normal situation, a couple is dealt with as two single people for the purposes of measuring medical card income limits, but they can no longer do that so the Government hits even more people.  The bottom line is that the Government has alternatives and we are here to say it is about time the Government took these alternatives and that we support the grey army in its crusade to secure them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#ZZ00700","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":680,"content":"<p>Social Justice Ireland lists the cuts over the last six years that have adversely affected older people.  These include cuts to public services, such as home help and community nursing units, reductions in the fuel allowance, abolition of the Christmas bonus, increases in prescription charges, and reductions in the household benefit package.  Budget 2014 has now abolished the telephone allowance, has increased prescription charges and has abolished the bereavement grant.  Mairead Hayes of the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament said that the people who need care and need to be enabled and assisted to care for themselves and others were on the receiving end of the toughest measures in budget 2014.  Here is one women's story:<blockquote>My name is Ellen.  I was born in a tenement room in Summerhill in Dublin, in 1939.  I went to school and grew up and I got a job.  I paid all my rates and taxes and I put a few bob by for the future.  All of a sudden, the future is here.  I am 74 years old.  I am on the State pension, but the prices have gone through the roof.  I cannot afford to live on them.  My savings are almost gone.  I am slowly being driven into poverty.<\/blockquote>There is something seriously wrong with a society that does not value and respect the people who have lived out the majority of their lives.

Unfortunately, this Government will be immune to their voices but it is important that they were here to have their say.<\/p><p>  The motion tonight quotes from the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, to which Ireland signed up in 2002.  Article 14 of that plan states the following:<blockquote>We recognize the need to achieve progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.  We reaffirm that the attainment of the highest possible level of health is a most important worldwide social goal, the realization of which requires action of many other social and economic sectors in addition to the health sector.  We commit ourselves to providing older persons with universal and equal access to health care and services, including physical and mental health services, and we recognize that the growing needs of an ageing population require additional policies, in particular care and treatment, the promotion of healthy lifestyles and supportive environments.  We shall promote independence, accessibility and the empowerment of older persons to participate fully in all aspects of society.<\/blockquote>The previous Government ignored the Madrid plan and this Government is ignoring it as well.

We want a health service that is patient-centred, whether that patient is young or old.  We want a health service that delivers care as close to home as possible in order that older people will be able to live in their homes where they feel safe and comfortable for as long as possible, rather than going into long-stay nursing homes, regardless of how nice they might be.  There is a no substitute for the autonomy people feel in their house.<\/p><p>  We want a safe health service, focused on clinical effectiveness, whereby everyone, including older people, receives safe, timely and efficient care and treatment.  These reforms have delivered.  The numbers of patients waiting on trolleys have been greatly reduced, which benefits everyone, especially older people.  Under the previous Government's reign, patients often spent up to four days on a trolley.  There are still too many people who have to spend time on trolleys and we are working hard to address that.  I thank all the people who work in our health service for the fantastic job they are doing despite dwindling budgets and dwindling staff numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#AAA04100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":723,"content":"<p>The ones who are left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#AAA04200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I am delivering on hospital groups which will enable care to be delivered closer to home in local communities, which will benefit everyone, especially older people.  With the introduction of clinical programmes and the piloting of the model of money following the patient, we are ensuring high quality and safe care in our hospitals for everyone, including older people.<\/p><p>  The ongoing reforms in health and social care will ensure older people receive safe, timely and efficient care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely and efficient as close to home as possible.  As a result, there will be fewer hospital admissions with care closer to home provided in local communities.  This will result in less travelling for older people.  More older people will be able to live in their homes for as long as possible rather than going into long-stay nursing home care.<\/p><p>  We also have the frail elderly clinical programme which allows older people, once their medical problem is resolved, to start on a course of rehabilitation immediately resulting in fewer people having to go into long-term care before their time.  Older people will not be treated differently in the health service just because they are classified as older people.<\/p><p>  Despite the extremely difficult financial situation the country is facing, the Government has worked hard to ensure more than 90% of people aged over 70 continue to have access to free GP care, whether through a medical card or a GP-visit card.  Every person over 70 who relies solely on the State pension continues to qualify for a medical card.  Indeed many pensioners of this age who also have private income will continue to qualify.  Those who do not qualify on means alone but who face significant health costs can still qualify for a medical card under the discretionary arrangements operated by the HSE.<\/p><p>  I emphasise that no one who is entitled to medical card coverage will lose their card as a result of the probity measures announced in the budget.  Older people have nothing to fear in that regard.  I remain committed to ensuring resources are directed to those who need them most.  The Government remains committed to providing free GP care to the entire population because this will ensure patients are diagnosed early and treated more effectively in their communities.  This is a vital step to dismantling the obscene inequity of a two-tier system though the implementation of the universal insurance scheme.  Those over 70 who are no longer entitled to a medical card will still have access to free GP care and the safety net of the drugs payment scheme, meaning they will have to pay no more than &euro;144 per month per household for medicines.<\/p><p>  This year, the nursing homes support scheme will support more than 22,000 people, the majority of whom are older people, in meeting the cost of long-term residential care, at a cost of &euro;970 million.  I know the great majority of older people want to remain in their homes for as long as possible and to be supported in doing that.<\/p><p>To honour their wishes in 2013 funding of over &euro;390 million was provided for community services for older people.  In addition, this year we will provide 10.3 million hours of home help to over 50,000 people.  Almost 11,000 home care packages are in place and a further 20,000 people have day care places.  However, we always seek to do better for older people and to this end a review of the nursing homes support scheme is currently under way.  A key question for the review is how to achieve a better balance between residential care and care in the community in line with the desires of most older people.<\/p><p> As a doctor I know only too well that the onset of Alzheimer's disease or dementia can be a devastating blow to a family.  However, it is important to recognise that many people live well and happily for a long time after dementia enters the picture and there is much that can be done to make each personal journey better.  To this end I have convened an expert working group to consider how we can provide a better response to people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia and the group will publish its work early next year.<\/p><p> Age should be no barrier to active participation in all dimensions of Irish society.  Our positive ageing strategy calls for a shift in how, as a society, we think about growing older.  We all have much to learn from the skills and experiences of older people and our strategy is geared to ensuring that older people can continue to make a strong and positive contribution in our society.  I daresay no one in the Chamber does not wish to grow old in comfort.<\/p><p> I reiterate my personal commitment to the welfare of older people.  It is a commitment that applies throughout the members of my Cabinet and their Departments.  We will never regard or treat older people as anything other than people, full and valued members of our society whose efforts and sacrifices have built this nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#AAA04300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Sadly and wrongly, since the budget we have had a sequence involving scaremongering, alarmism and placing unreasonable fears on our older persons.

The income threshold for the general practitioner visit card, which is very valuable to people, remains unchanged.  That is a fact.  The long-term illness card, available to sufferers of diabetes and a range of costly illnesses remains in place.  That is a fact too.  A total of 35,000 people will be affected, but 93% of over 70s will retain their medical card.<\/p><p>  We need to communicate the message properly, but the validation of medical cards is in the public interest, in taxpayers' interests and in the interests of a better service.  It is the right thing to do as well.  Anyone who for populist reasons seeks to posit the opposite view to the House is sadly lacking as a public representative.<\/p><p>  Let us put in context what has not altered for our older people.  The core rate of the State pensions remains in place as does free travel, the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance, the free television licence, the electricity and gas allowance and the over 80 years allowance.  The carers rate is preserved and the half-rate carers rate is preserved.  The extra payment for caring is in place as well.  In 2014 an investment of &euro;25 million will create 12,500 warmer homes under the better energy scheme.  When I referred to 93% just now I was explaining that 93% of over 70s will retain either a GP visit card or a medical card.<\/p><p>  The telephone issue has been raised but the Government is set to examine the senior alert scheme.  It is important that this happens and I commend the announcement.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that many of the telephone companies are now vying to get into this market.  The reality is that services will be available to many people.  For example, Eircom has a vulnerable users scheme.  This is all many of them use in any event.  Under the scheme the first &euro;8 is allowed for an older person to telephone family members if their telephone bill is less than &euro;17.21 in a month.  That will apply in many cases.  The senior alert scheme will be addressed.  Some &euro;200 million is in place for housing adaptation and dealing with housing grants, a real service.  The DIRT tax measures do not affect married couples aged 65 years and over with &euro;36,000 of income or individuals with &euro;18,000 of income.  The nursing homes support scheme remains in place, as the Minister noted, and there is an aggressive, active and satisfactory primary care development programme in the country.  Happily, several primary care centres were opened in my constituency recently by the Minister.  These will allow people access to services nearer to home.<\/p><p>  Let us consider this holistically and consider all the facts.  We were in a situation involving the troika and a bailout.  At the moment &euro;1 billion per month more is being spent than taken in.  In this context what we have achieved for our older persons should be lauded by the House.  Any objective commentary would hold that we deliberating on a minute telephone allowance which will be addressed as far as possible.  The fact remains that someone over 70 years with up to &euro;500 in income per week or a couple with &euro;900 per week will still have a medical card, although there are few of these in my constituency.  If that is all we are discussing then there is no issue.<\/p><p>  Thanks be to God, the Government and the Minister sitting in front of me have every reason to be proud of our extraordinary record for old people.  We have got people off the trolleys or the solution is virtually achieved and the emergency ward situation is being addressed.  We have achieved for older persons holistically and comprehensively.  The motion does not stand up; it is based on a fallacy.  The honest and intellectually straight thing to do would be to withdraw it or certainly not put it to a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#BBB00400","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that we need to protect the most vulnerable in society and I am proud to say Ireland has a good record on this.  The record stands up internationally.<\/p><p>  That aside, the quality of Private Members' business that we are getting in the House should be questioned.  This debate seems to be almost a rerun of the debate that we had last week.  As Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan will remember, I prefaced my comments last week by saying that just because a person sits on that side of the House does not mean that he has a monopoly on sympathy, empathy or any of the emotions that they like to portray.  What we have on this side of the House is a responsibility and if it had existed on this side of the House when it should have, we might not be in the situation we are in.  We need to remind the public about that constantly.  It was the fault of Fianna F&aacute;il and this is the reason we are debating these issues tonight and the public should be reminded of that at every turn.  I realise those in Fianna F&aacute;il do not like to be reminded of it but we should remind them and it should never be forgotten that this is the reason we are here.  There is a collective amnesia among those in Fianna F&aacute;il and they would like to be able to forget that they had any hand, act or part in this episode, but they did.<\/p><p>  I wish to address some of the issues raised in the Private Members' motion.  I am sure older people do not want to be pressurised about means testing or application forms.  This is something no one likes no matter what their age.  I have spoken on this issue on more than one occasion.  Equally, I have outlined that much of the documentation being sent to constituents is far too complex in format and, as I have said previously, this has a natural tendency to put the fear of God into older people, especially those of advanced years.<\/p><p>Despite this, the fact remains that means testing is the most efficient and effective solution in determining who is eligible.  In advance of such testing, I ask that documentation being sent out by the Department should reflect this sentiment and allow for a less formal tone and format to be used.<\/p><p> It must be pointed out that the Government has retained the core rate of State pensions.  It has maintained free travel for the elderly, the free television allowance, the living alone allowance and the electricity and gas allowances for those aged over 80, as well as the carer's allowance and half-rate carer's allowance.  The medical cards issue is something about which everyone is very passionate, as highlighted by the protests outside Leinster House.  I will conclude by noting the elderly must be protected, which is the reason the Labour Party in government has maintained the core rate of State pensions and, as I stated, has protected free travel and fuel and television allowances, as well as electrical and gas allowances.  In the straitened circumstances in which the Government finds itself, it is greatly to be commended on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#BBB00500","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":731,"content":"<p>I welcome the Private Members' motion because no one in this House disagrees on the protection of senior citizens.  In common with many other Members present, I work with various groups in my constituency to ensure senior citizens get every opportunity to enjoy life, to participate in their communities and in all aspects of it, and in which many opportunities are available to them.  One can see, through various organisations, the amount of time, effort and dedication volunteers give to senior citizens.  What I like most about this is that senior citizens in many places are beginning to realise their potential to give back to the community.  In many cases, it is their ability to run all aspects of their associations.  Bowls has become a major activity in my home area and there are so many clubs that the county board must run events six nights a week to ensure everyone is able to partake.  This is because the senior citizens themselves wish to participate.  They wish to give back, to be responsible and in that way to enjoy themselves.  Those who may be unable to partake are brought along for the enjoyment and participation.  This works across all aspects of the community, be it sport, drama, community activities and so on.<\/p><p>  The misinformation in respect of the medical card appears to be the central focus of many of the problems.  Even given that focus, however, it is important there should be a review of the medical card system.  There have been efforts in this regard, comprising both a targeted and a random review, within the past two years.  The targeted review was carried out in 2012 in respect of 40,000 medical card holders who had not accessed medical services for a period of 12 months or more, and approximately 39% of those medical card holders did not respond to the effect that they were resident in the country.  Consequently, one can discern immediately that a review is needed.  The random review of 2,628 medical and GP-visit cards was carried out in early 2013.  Eligibility was confirmed for 73% of the cards while it has not been finalised for another 2%.  A total of 4% of the cards were not renewed because of eligibility criteria and 21% of the card holders did not respond to renew their cards.  Again, one can discern immediately that there is a need to bring these data up to date, to ascertain our direction on this issue and to assess the costs that must be determined in these times and, in so doing, to ensure the Health Service Executive will be able to evaluate and give value for money in the medical card system.<\/p><p>  Medical cards also have been awarded on discretionary grounds and I have a concern in this regard, having encountered particular cases in which cards have been withdrawn.  I hope these issues can be surmounted through the application of common sense.  One point about a person having a discretionary card is the comfort of having it.  In many instances, the card is not simply something the person has for the sake of having it.  The person in question uses it because of the circumstances in which he or she finds him or herself.  Will the Minister for Health ensure the HSE uses an available mechanism to get all the information, to get it correctly and to process it as quickly as possible?  There have been too many instances in which an appeal has been made or a review instigated that has necessitated the sending of the file from Dublin to Cork or to Donegal.  This lengthens the process, which is not good work and it should not happen like this because it places the family concerned under pressure.  In respect of the appeal mechanism, the card should remain valid while the appeal is being heard.  I ask the Minister to review this situation and when a card is being reviewed, it should be allowed to remain in place.  This would give comfort to the people who were subject to the review because they would know that were they to make a mistake and fail to submit the information the first time, they would be given this chance and would not be obliged to have the entire card reassessed.  I will conclude by asking the Minister to do these two things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#CCC00200","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I read the Private Members' motion tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il and was quite struck by the language used.  The motion \"agrees that older people are more anxious now ... concurs that older people do not want to be pressurised about ... application forms\" and so on.  While I have no doubt these sentiments apply to some older people, the language in the motion is so generic, empty and lacking in depth that it verges on stereotyping.  What is worse, it implies that older people, contrary to what I and most Members know to be true, are only concerned about themselves.  I consider this to be a shallow and foolish approach by Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  If Members truly are to discuss issues of concern to older people, the language one must use must refer to them as citizens and members of the wider community of which they are proud stakeholders.  It may surprise Fianna F&aacute;il but older people have children about whose livelihoods they care.  Older people have grandchildren about whose education they care.  Older people have husbands, wives and partners about whose health services they care.  Older people have friends and neighbours who lack a job and about whom they worry.  Moreover, older people have a real and genuine concern for their country, for which they worked so hard and about which they care so much.  While it is true it has not been possible to exclude any single group from the economic disaster Fianna F&aacute;il brought on this country, older people appreciate, and to a greater extent than Fianna F&aacute;il give them credit for, the difficulties and challenges the current Government faces.  They understand that as we move through these fiscal adjustments and economic corrections, neither they nor anyone else is immune from the consequences they bring with them, and yet many acknowledge the hard work done to protect the pension, free travel, free television licence, gas and electricity allowances, living alone allowance, carer's allowance and so on.  Moreover, they do not take this for granted.<\/p><p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il motion implies that older people are a selfish uncomprehending group of people who do not understand the economic reality they, their children and grandchildren are in and that society as a whole faces.  Let us desist from the artificial nonsense of carving older people out of the community and segregating them into a disconnected group that is separate from everyone else.  It is such thinking that is seriously dangerous to older people's well-being and participation in society.<\/p><p>  If there is one issue I had thought ought to have been included in the motion, because it seriously affects older people in particular, it is loneliness.  I have taken a particular interest in the issues of loneliness and social isolation among older people and the reason they should have been included is because they affect older people to a greater extent than any other section of society.  This is because as they leave work and social isolation occurs, as family members and friends pass away and as mobility issues kick in, loneliness can be a serious problem.  In its 2011 report entitled Older People - Experiences and Issues, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul quoted one elderly person as saying there was nothing worse than loneliness.  It is the worst form of poverty.<\/p><p>That is the reason it is particularly important to frame our attitude to older people, and older people who are isolated in that sense, by focusing on participation in society.  As we consider the supports we offer to older people in the community, is it best that we give them cash or, more importantly in terms of the impact on their health and well-being, should we put in place services that will ensure they can interact with society and be a part of their communities and neighbourhoods?  That is the question we should consider as we examine our attitude to older people.<\/p><p> We have a role in Government in this respect but citizens across the country can also participate.  It costs nothing to visit an older person.  It costs nothing to check in on one's neighbour on one's way home.  If we were to get anything out of this economic crisis where it is very difficult to get access to money, we should make a call to action for citizens across this country, be they politicians, ordinary members of the public or family members, to interact and take account of our society, community and our older people who are suffering in certain instances from isolation and a lack of social contact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#CCC00300","speaker":"1045","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":734,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Kitt who has five minutes and is sharing time with Deputy Niall Collins who has six minutes, Deputy McGuinness who has four minutes, Deputy Finian McGrath who has two minutes, Deputy Calleary who has eight minutes and Deputy Smith who has five minutes<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#DDD00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Kelleher on tabling this motion.  It presents a welcome opportunity to discuss a very important issue.  The motion is about protecting the rights of older citizens and solidarity between the generations.  I do not see any sign of solidarity when the Minister is removing a large number of medical cards, estimated to be 35,000, from people who are over the age of 70 years.  They are being removed not only from the elderly, but from people who are sick, people on the breadline and people with disabilities as a result of this budget.<\/p><p>  The abolition of the telephone allowance in particular is a mean-spirited cut.  This cutback will have serious consequences because, as was said, many older people have their personal security alarms and house alarms linked to their landline.  If people are forced to give up their landlines, they will be hit in other ways.  I raised the issue of alarm systems last year when the telephone allowance was reduced.  Some families told me that their elderly relatives were going into nursing homes and when they went to remove the landline, they learned that the alarm was linked to it.  A constituent told me recently, following the recent announcement, that it would cost &euro;111 to disconnect a landline because the telephone company claims it is within the contract period even though there was never a written contract, only a verbal agreement.  Irrespective of whether a person keeps the landline or gets rid of it, it will involve a cost and the loss of benefit will hurt an elderly person who had that allowance. <\/p><p>  I was interested in what Deputy Joe O'Reilly said, namely, that some people were able to get a better telephone package for their landline.  I think that is correct but why did the Government did not refer to this or did it know what could be purchased as regards these packages?  If we are going to help older people to live independently and with dignity, I hope the full telephone allowance will be restored.  Isolation in rural Ireland, to which Deputy Nolan referred, is a particular issue in this context as is illness.  Medical cards are important when one is coping with an illness.  Having a telephone is important when people live in an isolated area.  The provision of rural transport is also very important.  When I hear talk of a review of the rural transport scheme, I get very worried.  I hope that services will be maintained for older citizens in a fair and progressive manner.  I hear that point being raised all the time and it was even raised today by the Tuam Active Retirement Association who meet every Wednesday.  They met today-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#DDD00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":736,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#DDD00400","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":737,"content":"<p>-----and raised the issues of the increase in prescription charges, the loss of medical cards for the over 70s and the abolition of the telephone allowance.  These active retirement groups have been having meetings, their members protested outside the House yesterday and they talked about the difficult situations they find themselves in having worked hard all their lives and made great contributions to society.<\/p><p>  Energy costs are also an important factor.  Increasing energy costs are putting a good deal of pressure on families and on elderly people who live alone.  It is ironic that meetings are currently being held in Galway about increasing restrictions being imposed on turf-cutting.  The humble sod of turf is now to the forefront of many people's minds.  Turf is the main fuel in many houses, whether it is used for heating or cooking.  More areas of bog are being put out of bounds for turf-cutting.  The restriction used to apply to special areas of conservation and now it applies to natural heritage areas.  <\/p><p>  I hope that all these issues, including in particular the budget measures that will impact on health insurance costs, will be examined.  Those measures are likely to worsen the position for elderly people.  It is estimated that more than 1 million will face a tax hike with this charge.  It will not only affect the gold-plated polices.  More and more people over 60 years of age are taking up private health insurance.  I understand the number of people over the age of 60 with private health insurance rose by 22,000 between 2011 and 2012.  I hope that these measures will be resisted and the Government will reverse them and do so as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#DDD00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":738,"content":"<p>We discussed the medical card issue in the House a little over two weeks ago and the Minister was present for that debate.  On that occasion I gave him the details of a constituent of mine from Caherguillamore in Bruff, County Limerick, and I regret to say that I have not heard from him in that respect in the intervening two weeks.  I did not even get an acknowledgment from him that he would look into the case.  That lady is suffering from cancer.  She is very sick.  She is going through three parallel treatments at the moment to try to overcome the challenges that cancer has presented to her.  I spoke to her as late as last Saturday in her hospital bed.  She was quite sick and she still has not had a determination or an outcome regarding her medical card.  That should not happen.  I regret that I have to raise her case again tonight on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As I said to the Minister two weeks ago, it is not good enough that any particular case should have to be raised in isolation in this House.  I feel strongly about this case.

I ask the Minister again to make this a matter of priority through his good offices.<\/p><p>  We spoke about the ongoing medical card issue a number of weeks ago.  There has been a de facto change in policy.  I listened to some speakers on the Government side who talked about communications, scaremongering and misinformation.  The facts are out there and we are bringing them into the Chamber.  Nobody is making this stuff up.  We need a dose of realism and a dose of honesty regarding the medical card issue.  There is no point in saying to the people that there is a communications problem and that the Government is fixing it.  When I hear that coming from Government, fixing a communications problem means that it is going to spin some other version of events.  The fact of the matter is that the Government has determined an amount of savings that it wants to accrue from the medical card budget and it is working back from that.  It is making the criteria fit as it works backwards from the bottom line savings figure that it is trying to reach.  The Government has not decided what the new criteria will be but working forward from that it is a case of however many fall out of the system fall out of it.  It is working backwards from the figure to try to arrive at a starting point, but that is not a good way to do it.  <\/p><p>  The people deserve a little bit of honesty.  I  compliment RTE's &quot;Prime Time&quot; on sticking with this public debate.

Many of these cuts have been hidden in the fine print of this budget.  Whether it is a change of regulation or a change of qualification rule, there have been cuts.  Deputy Nolan made a suggestion, and I support him in it, that we should visit older people and that people outside of this House should be encouraged to do so also within communities.<\/p><p>  I visit older people.  To take away from some of the statements that have been made by Ministers and some backbenchers and apply some reality, I will tell the House what I find in their homes.  When they apply for grants to the county council to do something minor to make their house reasonably accessible, they cannot get it because there is no money.  When the older person in hospital is being discharged, there is no money to refurbish the house.  They are stuck in a hospital and they cannot come home to their families.  I came across a case where a woman and her disabled daughter have not been able to get accommodation with their other sister simply because there is no money to carry out the refurbishment works.<\/p><p>  There is then the case of the medical cards.  We have had all the changes with the budget.  People are suffering and medical cards are being withdrawn from older people but what happened before the budget?  We had what they call a random check.  Every Member on the opposite side of the House must know from their clinics that there was nothing random about it.  It was a cull of medical cards from the elderly, an attempt to take those cards and not give them back for one reason or another.<\/p><p>  The son of a 90 year old woman in my constituency went to the chemist and it was only then that he was told that the medical card had been taken from his mother.  Only yesterday, a couple went to the chemist and without any notification their medical card had been taken.  That is not a lack of communication.  That is complete chaos within the Health Service Executive, HSE.  It is a misunderstanding of the problem at the political level because the HSE has a political leadership within the Department of Health, and that political leadership should be showing the way.<\/p><p>  I point the Minister to the hospital waiting list.  I listened here the other day to a Minister telling us that there were no trolleys in the corridors.  The Government must have its head stuck in the sand because there are trolleys in corridors.  Again, in my region, all of the cases for senior citizens looking for hip and knee replacements or cataract operations were sent to Cappagh hospital.  They were told they would be fast-tracked and prioritised but do the Members opposite know what happened after a few months?  All of the files were sent back down to Waterford, and the people were told to rejoin the waiting list but they have been on the waiting list for six years.<\/p><p>  Members make the accusation that this was all Fianna F&aacute;il's fault.  They are in power since 2011.  They got a mandate from the Irish people and they have totally ignored that mandate.  The message they are sending out about the past is now being rubbished not by us on this side of the House, but by the general public who are getting fed up listening to that message.<\/p><p>  All of the issues that have been addressed by my colleagues here are real issues that the Government will have problems with in terms of the care of the elderly.

Any society and any Government that does not stand by these people does not deserve any support.<\/p><p>  I urge the Government and D&aacute;il to support this motion.

Services for older people should be protected to allow them to live independently and with dignity.  Older people are now more anxious about services being removed from them, which will lead to isolation and illness.  Older people do not want to be pressurised about means tests and application forms for health services.<\/p><p>  I call for public services to be maintained for older citizens in a fair, progressive way and I call on the Government to reaffirm Ireland's agreement to the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#EEE02600","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":771,"content":"<p>On many occasions in this House I have railed against what I call the notion of silo government where Departments take decisions without any co-ordination or consultation with other Departments and one sector or community invariably gets overly impacted.  The evidence is there that this is what has happened on this occasion.  The Department of Health decided to go after medical cards.  The Department of Finance decided to cut the tax relief on health insurance.  The Department of Social Protection decided that the telephone allowance and the bereavement grant were within its sights but it seems that nobody in the three Departments spoke to each other to try to assess if this would impact on one particular group in society or the other.  That is what has happened.<\/p><p>  If we are to look at the reports on the lead-in to the budget, which I notice have not been denied, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, was the last man to go into the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to present and seek support for his budget.  Other Ministers had done it.  He was the last man to do so and he presented an unachievable budget to the Minister, Deputy Howlin.<\/p><p>That then forced the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to take control of the Minister for Health's Department and its expenditure.  What we now have is a collection of departmental initiatives which are impacting in a very severe way on older people, in particular.<\/p><p> I heard phrases such as &quot;scare-mongering&quot; and &quot;communications problems&quot; used tonight.  If there is scare-mongering and if there are communications problems, I invite anyone to come to my office to see the real cases with review letters from the Department of Health which I have dealt with, and not only since the budget.  This has been going on all year, that is, the reduction in the number of medical cards and the changing conditions.  Even the Minister admitted he was not aware that the qualifying provisions for medical cards had changed, so it is no wonder we are slightly wary about his ability to perform in his own Department.  Those on the Government side cannot accuse the Opposition of communications problems and stoking fear when the figure of &euro;133 million is put beside a very vague issue of medical card probity.  That is not communications in terms of how one presents a measure.  The Government keeps saying many people have gone away and have died but that is not correct.  It states 35,000 medical cards will be taken from the over 70s or will be switched to GP cards.  That is the figure when one calculates the saving in the budget documents.  Either the figure put down as savings is wrong or it is right.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy White, will clarify that.<\/p><p> On budget day the Minister for Finance said the change to tax relief for health insurance policies would only affect gold plated policies, which the Taoiseach repeated on Leaders' Questions this morning.  The difficulty is that as people get older or as they develop a medical conditions - many young people are in that situation - their health insurance gets more expensive.  It is not gold plated to have basic cancer treatment covered by Vhi or Aviva.  If one suffers from chronic pain syndrome and must travel to Dublin every six weeks to have one's pain pump filled, which gives one relief and allows one to live one's life, it is not gold plated to have a Vhi policy costing &euro;3,000 per year minimum.  The Department has not come up with an alternative figure to that suggested by the insurance companies that 70% of policies will be affected.  Older people will bear the brunt of that change to tax relief for health insurance.<\/p><p> The big problem with medical cards is the number of people whose cards have been reviewed unbeknown to them.  They have medical cards with expiry dates next year but when they go to the doctor, he or she informs them the card has been changed.  The doctor can no longer treat them because he or she has been told by the Department the medical card has been discontinued, or will not be renewed, before the patient has been told.  It is not the fault of the people in Finglas, who are doing a very good job in difficult circumstances.  It is due to a complete lack of centralised policy at the top of the Department and seeing medical cards as an easy fix when it is panicking to get a budget figure.  That seems to be what is happening, if we are to believe all the stories from Fine Gael about the Minister's activities in the days before the budget.  Unfortunately, the people paying the price are medical card holders and people over 70 who are losing the right to medical cards, bereavement grants and telephone allowances.<\/p><p> I refer to the bereavement grant.  The Minister said the exceptional needs payment was still available in the community welfare office but there has been a cut in the overall heading for that payment.  The bereavement grant has been abolished but the budget available for exceptional needs has been cut.  People are being crucified twice here.  <\/p><p> The provision regarding the telephone allowance has not been included in the Social Welfare Bill.  Not only is the Government taking it away but the Minister dismissed it as being only a payment for line rental to various telephone companies.  It does more than that; it gives people a landline in their homes and in rural areas, in particular, it allows them to have the emergency pendant, which they use for crime and health security.  They face losing that because they must pay the full amount to Eircom due to a very measly cut.  Since it is not included in the Social Welfare Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy White, might outline the Government's plans in regard to that cut.<\/p><p> Many departmental decisions have come down on the heads of one sector.  Older people are paying the price for a way of government which has been practised by every government, so I am not personalising it to any Minister.  It is time Departments started to co-ordinate approaches.  Given the way this budget was devised, with last minute meetings and last minute rows, it was inevitable somebody would pay the price and it seems to be our older people.  As the Government prepares for next year's budget, let us hope there will be more co-ordination so that one sector of society does not bear the brunt of budgetary decisions in the manner older people are in this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#EEE02700","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on what is an important debate.  I am one of the Members representing counties Cavan and Monaghan, an area commonly referred to as drumlin country.  I have a particular concern in regard to the poor or, indeed, non-existent mobile telephone coverage in parts of the two counties.  When one travels through that area, calls constantly drop.  We have the additional problem in that some of the British telecommunications companies dominate the coverage along the Border.<\/p><p>  It is in the context of the removal of the telephone allowance that I raise the following point.  The panic buttons and home security alarms are an extremely important support, in particular for elderly persons living on their own.  We all know people need a landline to use those facilities.  The abolition of the telephone allowance is a deplorable decision which will affect almost 395,000 people, including the old, the disabled and carers.  Over the years, practically every home had a landline installed.  Older people relied on such a communication link to keep in touch with family and neighbours and with personnel delivering social services, whether from the statutory agencies or voluntary organisations.  <\/p><p>  This decision means a reduction of &euro;9.50 per month in the Government support for those 395,000 people.  That is a reduction in the person's income and means.  The additional anxiety that will be caused by the abolition of the telephone allowance will impact most on those persons living in the most isolated communities where, by and large, the poorest mobile telephone coverage exists.  <\/p><p>  Over the past decade, many people worked hard in local communities to ensure that the vast majority of older persons or persons with a disability obtained the panic buttons and security alarms.  Those communities were supported through small, but significant, grant schemes.  Recently, I heard one of the advocacy groups ask where now stands the promises in the Government's National Positive Ageing Strategy.<\/p><p>  All of us doing constituency work must be very conscious of the considerable and, indeed, justified concern of people in regard to medical cards.  We are all aware of individual cases of huge hardship in households where medical cards have not been renewed or where first-time applications have been inexplicably refused.  This has been happening for months and the recent budgetary decisions will lead to further hardship for the elderly, the ill and vulnerable people.<\/p><p>  Recently, I dealt with the case of a woman aged 96 who, unfortunately, has totally lost her sight.  That family had to re-apply for her medical card.  It is a very literate family but it created that extra pressure.  To its credit, that family has cared for that woman at home and she has never spent a day in a nursing home.  Why should a family face that additional unnecessary pressure to get a medical card renewed for a lady of 96 years of age?  <\/p><p>  The elderly people who contacted me are very concerned and worried about the change in eligibility for these necessary supports, whether medical cards or supports from the Department of Social Protection.  Pensioners who worked hard for decades, often in the most difficult circumstances, paid their dues to this State and made a huge contribution to our society.  The least they should expect now is to have the necessary support that they can live securely and free from worry about day-to-day living costs.<\/p><p>All of us support and understand their wish and desire to live independently with dignity and without anxiety at this stage of their lives.  At no time is a family more vulnerable than at the time when a bereavement occurs.  As Deputy Calleary said, the bereavement grant was based on the insurance contribution of the deceased during his or her working life.  In many instances, it was extremely important for families in difficult financial circumstances.  I was amazed to hear the Minister, Deputy Quinn, make a comment on the radio to the effect that the grant was eaten up by the undertaker.  The people I mix with through my work and the people I meet as I go about my daily business can ill afford the loss of &euro;850 in the event of a bereavement in their families.  All of us are familiar with the particular pressures being faced by families.<\/p><p> I welcome the comments made by Deputy Wall, who appealed for common sense to be shown in the administration of the medical card scheme.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy White, is a practical man.  I hope he can ensure that practical ideas are pursued to ensure people do not continue to have these worries.  I remind Deputy Nolan, who mentioned that the word &quot;loneliness&quot; is not mentioned in our motion, that the word &quot;isolation&quot; is included in it.  It is particularly important for those of us who represent rural constituencies because we know many people who will feel isolated if these harsh measures are implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#FFF00200","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":775,"content":"<p>The tone of the amendments proposed to this motion, if perhaps not the motion itself, suggests that the Government has been disproportionately unfair to older people.  This charge does not stand up to any objective scrutiny.  Of course it is possible for speakers to select particular reductions or cutbacks for special criticism.  Given the scale of the fiscal correction that has been required in recent years, no group could be entirely insulated from the impact of adjustments.  I accept that no group has been so insulated.<\/p><p>  This Government recognises that Irish people have made huge sacrifices.  However, we are now coming within sight of the point at which we can reclaim our economic sovereignty.  This will be critical if we are to put control of Ireland's affairs back into Irish hands and again have the capacity to decide ourselves how our society is shaped.  Having said this, we have prioritised the protection of older people as much as possible.  I suggest that our record bears that out.  In the short time available to me, I would like to mention a few areas in which this protection has applied.<\/p><p>  The nursing home support scheme continues to be an extremely generous support for those who need long-term residential care.  Even after the changes that were announced last year, the State is continuing to meet by far the greater part of the cost of care in the majority of cases, with nursing home residents making a much smaller contribution.  The average weekly contribution by an individual under the scheme is less than &euro;285, while the total weekly cost of care is approximately &euro;1,500 in some nursing homes.  In 2013, some 10.3 million hours of home help will be delivered to over 50,000 people, with an additional 10,870 people receiving home care packages.  A review of the balance between residential and community care is taking place as we consider how more people might be better supported at home for longer, in line with the wishes expressed by older people themselves.<\/p><p>  Even after the changes that were announced recently, well over 90% of those over the age of 70 will continue to hold medical card or GP visit cards.  Any single person with an income of up to &euro;26,000, or couple with an income of up to &euro;47,000, will continue to hold a medical card and will therefore be unaffected by the recent change.  I wish to confirm a figure in response to Deputy Calleary, who asked for clarification in this respect.  Some 35,000 people will move from full medical cards to GP-only cards as a result of the eligibility changes for over 70s that were announced in last week's budget.  People over the age of 70 who now qualify for GP visit cards rather than medical cards will continue to be entitled to make use of the drugs payment scheme.  People in that age group who have weekly incomes of between &euro;500 and &euro;700 - between &euro;900 and &euro;1,400 in the case of a couple - will pay a maximum of &euro;33.23 on medication each week.<\/p><p>  The State pension, free travel, fuel allowance and free television licence schemes have all been protected.  The tax treatment of the elderly remains unaltered, with no change in the net income of pensioners as a result of the budget.  From a policy perspective, the national carer's strategy, which was published in 2012; the national positive aging strategy, which was published earlier this year; and the forthcoming national dementia strategy, which is currently being drafted, demonstrate our commitment to giving unprecedented priority, and rightly so, to older people in our communities.  These commitments will have far-reaching effects into the future.<\/p><p>  I would like to respond to one or two issues that have been raised since I joined the debate.  Deputy Niall Collins mentioned an individual case that he raised the last time we had a debate of this nature in the Chamber.  I do not propose to engage in any discussion on any individual case.  During the course of the debate in question, after I gave an account of the manner in which the administration of the system is being affected, I invited colleagues to let me know about any cases that draw into question what I was saying about how the system is operating.  The Deputy raised such an issue with me.  I regret that I have not come back to him so far in relation to it.  I will certainly follow it up after this debate and revert to him.<\/p><p>  Decisions in relation to applications for medical cards are not matters for the Minister for Health.  I am sure Deputy Niall Collins was not suggesting in his contribution that they were.  Such matters are dealt with by the HSE in accordance with the relevant legislation.  That is how it will continue.  I reject outright the Deputy's suggestion that an effort is being made to make the criteria fit in some way to ensure a certain number of cards are withdrawn.  People are either entitled to a card or they are not.  There is absolutely no question of the Government or the HSE acting in a way that would ensure a certain target number of cards is taken out of the system every year.  If we were to do so, we would be contravening what is provided for in the legislation, which is that people have an entitlement or do not have an entitlement.<\/p><p>  Deputy Smith made a reasonable point about the need to be practical and sensible.  I am open to anything colleagues might have to say in that respect.  I would like to put a rhetorical question to the Deputy in response to what he said about the letters that are sent to people when reviews are taking place.  Is he suggesting that cards should be open-ended in terms of their duration?  It seems to me that if they were open-ended, that would represent a change in our system.  We must have a means of ensuring people continue to be entitled.  I do not know of a better way of doing this than writing to them at any given time to check on their circumstances.  I am open to suggestions about how that might better be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#GGG00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for allowing me to contribute to this debate.  At a time of budgetary cuts, I would like to know why the Government is giving &euro;700 million of borrowed money to people who are not Irish citizens and who are living abroad.  If this figure could be halved to &euro;350 million, there would be no need for the proposed &euro;113 million cut that will directly affect 100,000 medical card holders.  The telephone rental allowance, which enables people to get telephones that are vitally needed for security purposes, would not need to be abolished and neither would the bereavement grant.  This could be done at the stroke of a pen.<\/p><p>  The Government has decided to discriminate against Irish people who live in poverty, some of whom voted to elect it.  It is deliberately throwing &euro;700 million around the world even though it has no electoral mandate to do so.  It must be unduly influenced by the extraordinarily highly paid leaders of the organisations through which much of this money is being pushed.  We do not have a properly audited system.  Some of the moneys in question are not subject to proper accounting.  Charity begins at home.  I suggest that a question on this matter should be put to the people when the Government proposes to hold a referendum next year.  The Government should ask the electorate to give it a mandate to continue with policies that discriminate against the poor Irish people who elected it.<\/p><p>  Economics is about the allocation of scarce resources.  Economists are supposed to be trained and have an understanding of the sociological needs of the communities they analyse.  I am afraid there must be some very dumb economists advising the Government at present.  To be honest, their wisdom is very questionable.  The Government's parish pump in Ireland has been bled dry.  According to an article in today's <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, &quot;Greeks are on average almost 40pc poorer than they were in 2008 ... laying bare the impact of a brutal recession and austerity measures the Government may be forced to extend into next year&quot;.  The plight in this country in the comparable years mirrors what happened in Greece.  Our unfortunate citizens who are at the lower rungs of the ladder are suffering.  I plead with the Government to review immediately and reverse the draconian decisions that were taken in last week's budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#GGG00300","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy Kelleher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#GGG00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":778,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I compliment my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, for putting this motion before the House.  Like other speakers, I am somewhat bemused by the continuous spin from the Government to the effect that the Irish people's misunderstanding of the effects of these cuts is based on some kind of deficit in its communications strategy.<\/p><p>It is a sign of desperation if the Government has to say that its inability to communicate has confused the people.<\/p><p> In my experience the people are very adept at understanding how they are affected by measures brought forward in this House and through various budgets.  They are well able to read between the lines.  On this occasion they have found out the Government.  I am not talking about the Minister of State personally.  He is one of the few who talks straight when dealing with good or bad news.  Others around him unfortunately do not.  His colleagues, particularly those in Cabinet, have told too many porkies and the people have rightly recognised that the Government has sold them a pup, based on the promises that it made prior to the election and that it continues to inflict pain and unnecessary cuts notwithstanding its continuing to say that it is not doing that.  It is shameful.  No matter how the Government tries to communicate the removal of the bereavement grant, of the telephone allowance, of discretionary medical cards at the rate of 1,000 a month, of medical cards from elderly, sick people, it will not be able to fool people by somehow suggesting that it will not hurt, affect or disenfranchise them in a way that is disproportionate to others in society whom the Government has not touched because the Minister of State's friends in Fine Gael want to protect particular sectors.<\/p><p> If the Government is concerned about communications it might be worthwhile having a chat with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  She is quite adept at communicating.  She communicates very well.  She is still the darling of the media.  One almost gets unnecessary information if one brushes past her in the corridor.  She is so adept at protecting her own image she suggests that all these things are being foisted upon her, she is doing her best and she is not really reducing any of the rates, while all the while inflicting significant cuts on certain sectors within the social welfare budget.  She continues to peddle what I believe to be an untruth, that there have been no cuts to social welfare rates.  The word &quot;rates&quot; is added on.  Yet there have been very serious cuts in social welfare that impact heavily on certain sectors.  Swingeing cuts affect some of the most vulnerable people.<\/p><p> I read through some material last night in preparation for today's debate.  On 22 November 2005, when the Minister for Social Protection was an opposition spokesperson she said of the then Government's Book of Estimates that it was as worthy of credibility as an Al Capone declaration of innocence.  I would say that her declaration that social welfare rates have not been cut is just as worthy of credibility as an Al Capone declaration of innocence.  She might reflect on that when she spins her next story against whomever she chooses.  Needless to say, the Minister of State's party leader was adept at criticising and spinning in a particular way when he was in opposition.  On 20 January 2009 at the commemoration of the ninetieth anniversary of the first D&aacute;il, he said:<blockquote>[C]an we say that we have lived up to the objective that &quot;the first duty of the Government of the Republic is to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children&quot;? Can the elderly patient lying on a hospital trolley, or the pensioners defending their medical cards and their pension rights feel that &quot;the nation's aged and infirm shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the nation's gratitude and consideration&quot;?<\/blockquote>I wonder do the aged and infirm tonight believe that they are entitled to the nation's gratitude and consideration as a result of the Government's budget or do they feel that they are a burden on society?  Those with whom I have conversed over the past week believe that they are a burden on society.  The continual betrayal of that important sector of our society is shameful and not worthy of the comments coming from the Government side.<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste could not help himself when he was then the leader of the Labour Party in opposition.  On 15 October 2008 he had another rush of blood to the head when he said that &quot;If the economy were the <i>Titanic<\/i>, it would be women and children last while the bankers got the first and most comfortable lifeboat&quot;.  Over that period he threatened to lock up bankers, as did the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, and others.  The T&aacute;naiste was going to do it his way rather than Frankfurt's way.  All of that was going to happen.  It seems to me on this occasion that following his input into the budget young mothers, young unemployed people, senior citizens, the sick and now those with life-threatening illnesses are left to last and the lifeboats are reserved for those whom Fine Gael believes it must protect, the wealthy and those in a position to pay.  This budget continues to inflict a regressive approach, based on our taxation system, to benefit those who have most and disenfranchise to the greatest extent those who have least.<\/p><p> I was surprised yesterday when I received an information card from the Department of Finance that describes the consolidated effect of the eight or nine budgets that have taken place over the period of correction since 2008, which set out to suggest that whatever number of billions of euro had been taken out of the economy, it was most progressive in its impact.  The Minister of State will be aware that the actions taken by his Government in the last two budgets were adjudged by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, to have been the most regressive in comparison with the measures taken heretofore.  This budget will be seen to continue that trend.<\/p><p> I take on board what we must accept about our period in office but at least when cuts and adjustments had to be made, those who could pay the most were hit the hardest.  That is not just my point it is also that of the ESRI.  The Government continues to take a regressive approach.  It surprises me that Labour Party backbenchers and Ministers continue to come in here and defend that in a naked way, as if to suggest that decisions are difficult.  We know that tough decisions have to be taken but they must be taken in a fair and equitable way and the actions of the Labour Party have been well shy of that.<\/p><p> Age Action Ireland and the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament are vehemently opposed to these proposals and I do not understand why we cannot show solidarity with them.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly could not understand why Age Action Ireland and the Senior Citizens Parliament could not be addressed in such a way as to resolve the issues.  He has shown blatant disregard for the promises that he made to them prior to the election. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#GGG00600","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I welcome the contributions from Deputies on all sides of the House.  We do not claim to have a monopoly on empathy on this side of the House nor do we claim to have a monopoly on understanding but this was an important motion to put down to give people the opportunity to express genuine views.  There is an underlying narrative from Deputies on all sides.  We are more direct on this side but among the Minister of State's colleagues on the Government side there is a major problem with the budget and the targeting of this cohort of elderly people.  There is no point in dressing it up in any way.  The figures and statistics are there.  More important is that the budget's impact on people's lives is there for everybody to see.  Now we have the vista of these cuts having a major impact on older people who want to live independently, without fear and not in isolation.<\/p><p>  On a couple of occasions, the Minister of State has pointed out that 35,000 people will move from a full medical card to a GP only card.  What I find fascinating about the debate is that in 2008 when universality was changed again and a guideline of &euro;700 per week was introduced it was regarded as bad, terrible, but now he tries to tell us that &euro;500 per week is good.  We have to live in the real world.  There has been a consistent undermining of eligibility for medical cards.  We see case after case of people in their eighties - Deputy Smith gave the example of a person of 90 years of age - who are randomly selected for a review.  We are dealing with public money so of course we must live within guidelines but the idea that a person's income and health is going to change dramatically when they are 93 or 94 years of age simply beggars belief.  If the Government does target them for a review it should at least do so in a systematic way that does not put the fear of God in older people when they get letters asking for further information.<\/p><p>We asked this at committee.  It is randomly selected by a computer.  Perhaps the Minister of State should turn off the computer, have a look at the files and ask why on earth one would send out a letter to a person aged 88 who is blind and incontinent and depends on support from family to live.  The person is asked whether their circumstances have changed and is told the authorities want further information.  This also involved a constituent of Deputy Smith aged 96.  This is what is happening.<\/p><p> We tabled these motions not just to highlight some of the hypocrisy of what was said and what is being done in the context of budgets but also to highlight genuine concerns of many citizens who are feeling the impact not only of the cuts but also of the weight of the State in intimidating them with unnecessary letters.  When a person is 96 years of age, is it not time for the State to leave that person alone?  When the Minister of State is talking about understanding and communications, I urge him at least to put a bit of heart and understanding into the fact these people have given this country great service and are entitled to live with dignity and without any further oppression in the context of forms or, as the Taoiseach said, the Government man calling.  The Government man is calling.  He is calling every day but not only is he calling to the house, he is taking money directly out of their pockets in the context of this budget. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#HHH00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":783,"content":"<p>What about my question to Deputy Smith?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#JJJ00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":784,"content":"<p>We are short of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#JJJ00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":785,"content":"<p>That is the issue at stake here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#JJJ00400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":786,"content":"<p>Should it be open-ended?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300027#JJJ00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":787,"content":"<p>When a person is 96 years of age, I would say that the Government should put a full stop after that file and let that person live with dignity.

Those with higher incomes have not made the contribution they could make, yet we are taking the telephone allowance and the bereavement grant from people.

Post-budget there was much controversy and discussion, which one would expect, but there was also a good deal of misinformation and scare-mongering, for whatever reasons.  Part of it surrounds the removal of the telephone allowance.  I have come into the House to raise my genuine concerns about the senior alert scheme because it is a very successful scheme funded by the Minister's Department.  I note the funding increased last year, which means that many proactive community and voluntary groups throughout the country are utilising this scheme to help the elderly and the vulnerable people in our society who may be isolated.  It offers grant aid towards monitored alarms and the security pendants elderly people wear.<\/p><p>  I refer to the information regarding the removal of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month.  I do not welcome the removal of the allowance but I welcome that a number of companies have since dropped their prices for the use of the telephone line to take account of that allowance being taken from older people.<\/p><p>  Two weeks ago I was in the house of an elderly man who lives alone in County Waterford who had a telephone bill of over &euro;100 per month, which I could not believe.  When I examined the bill I could see that he was still paying his bills using the old direct billing method, which is for every call he made.  Public representatives and voluntary and community groups would do a better job if we informed elderly people throughout the country that telephone companies now offer packages which allow the person to have unlimited phone calls for &euro;30 to &euro;40 per month.  The telephone companies are in direct competition with each other and all of these packages are readily available to the public on the callcosts website.  Elderly people should take advantage of that because it will reduce the cost of their calls.<\/p><p>  I raise this issue because I want the Minister to allay any fears about it.  I note his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, gave a public commitment on the evening of the budget that he would find additional resources to ensure the senior alert scheme will continue.  We must reassure people, and the voluntary and community groups which operate this scheme, that it will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300028#BB02700","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535600,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I merely want to impress upon the Minister the importance of the scheme, which provides great comfort and reassurance to people over the age of 65.

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups, community alert, active retirement groups and so on, and it is open to people aged 65 years and over, living alone or living with another eligible person and who have a genuine need for assistance.  Any community-based, voluntary, not-for-profit organisation which has a track record of working with or providing services to older people within its community can apply to be registered with my Department and to draw down grant support.  The maximum grant per beneficiary for the equipment is &euro;250 for monitored personal alarms with pendant, and &euro;50 for an additional pendant or re-installation.  Annual monitoring costs are borne by the beneficiaries.<\/p><p>  From 2004 to date, 80,000 people have benefited from the scheme at a cost of &euro;25.4 million.  All of the grant approved personal monitored alarms up to now are connected to a landline.  The Department is examining the possibility of providing grants for systems using mobile technology.  It would be a matter for a community group to assure itself that a mobile technology based system provided full coverage in its area.<\/p><p>  Preliminary inquiries indicate that the cost of monitoring a mobile solution is lower than the overall cost of monitoring a landline system when the landline rental is factored in.  The mobile device costs around &euro;160 per year to monitor while the cost of the landline solution can be around &euro;280 per year when line rental costs are included.  It should be noted that the mobile device is not normally supplied for use as a mobile telephone because additional costs are involved with such use, even though a limited number of telephone numbers can be programmed into the device for outgoing calls.<\/p><p>  I have some good news for Deputies Coffey and Charles Flanagan in that I have been able to maintain the &euro;2.35 million allocation for the 2014 senior alert scheme.  That level of funding is sufficient to meet current demand levels for this important scheme.  It would not, however, provide for grants to individuals wishing to replace existing alarms with the mobile version where a landline is being discontinued.

Just over 11,000 IBRC mortgage holders are owner-occupiers while just over 2,000 are in the buy-to-let category.  I have been hearing from some of them who feel they are affected by this and whose loans are performing.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance confirmed to me in a reply to a parliamentary question last week that it was intended to split the loan books into four distinct segments, namely, performing, non-performing, owner-occupier and buy-to-let, to maximise market interest.  This comes after the special liquidator sought advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers.  It is clear that only bids from big operators will be entertained.  Of course, it was PricewaterhouseCoopers which was asked to assess the balance sheet of Anglo Irish Bank and the other core banks after the bank guarantee.  The information it provided about the solvency and capital ratio of Anglo Irish Bank was critical to the decision to nationalise the bank in 2009.  There is an issue of confidence in terms of where the information is being obtained.<\/p><p>  The decision has been taken to dispose of the legacy of IBRC as quickly as possible.  The Minister for Finance told us on budget day that there was no Anglo Irish Bank any more, but that is not quite the case.  We must ensure there are protections for citizens against the excesses of the market.<\/p><p>  The special liquidators have decided to dispose of the loan portfolio in blocks of 30 and 40, and I relied on an article in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>for that information.  This has the effect of enabling large corporate debtors to buy out their loans at a discount.  There is an inherent moral hazard on a number of levels to what is happening.  It seems moral hazard is a concept invented for the small guy.  Who is benefiting here?  Will we see people who gambled as bondholders, perhaps foreign investors, and who were bailed out by this country coming back in to buy these loan books at a discount?<\/p><p>  There is absolute fury among some of the people, in particular those directly affected by this, that this is again being done at the taxpayers' expense.  Some people are being rewarded and being given a bargain opportunity.  The only conclusion one can draw is that these people are getting an opportunity.  They may well be the very people who had the benefit of us paying them in full, and now they are coming back to take more out of the pot at a discount.  There is little or no risk to them because many of these loans are performing.<\/p><p>To be perfectly honest, the only people who seem to be rewarded in all of this are those in the big corporate sector.

I am sorry he is not able to be here to answer the question with more knowledge and detail.  I will give the Deputy the benefit of the information with which I have been furnished.<\/p><p>  The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013 was introduced to enable the liquidation of the IBRC to proceed in an orderly manner consistent with financial stability and in the interests of its creditors.  Special liquidators were appointed to oversee the liquidation of the IBRC for the benefit of all creditors of the institution, including taxpayers.  This process involves the valuation and sales process for all the assets of the IBRC, including the residential mortgage portfolio.  The special liquidators have engaged professional independent valuers to provide a confidential valuation of the loan books of the IBRC.  As the valuation of the loan book was being progressed, the special liquidators wrote to all IBRC borrowers, including the residential mortgage customers, to give them an update on the special liquidation and on the sale of their loans.  Borrowers were invited to make representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for their assets.<\/p><p>  The special liquidators have given significant consideration to how this portfolio should be sold.  In light of the independent sales advice received and the responses received from the borrowers, the special liquidators arrived at the decision that the residential mortgage book should be split into four segments - performing, non-performing, owner-occupier and buy-to-let mortgages - and brought to the market.  I am advised that the independent advice received recommended that this sales approach would be the most beneficial with regard to maximising sales and the return to creditors, including taxpayers.  The decision to sell the mortgage portfolio in this manner was arrived at having regard to the scale of the sale process and the size of the loan book.  At the end of May, there were 17,411 residential loans in the IBRC outstanding to more than 13,000 individual customers.  The special liquidators independently decided that the most efficient method of disposal and the one most likely to maximise sales was to sell the loans as part of a larger portfolio.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the special liquidators are obligated by the conditions set out under the 2013 Act to ensure the assets are sold at a price which maximises the overall return for its creditors, including the State.  I understand that many mortgage owners might be interested in buying their loans, but the time, cost and practicalities involved would make this option more costly.  Taxpayers have already incurred far too high a price from this bank to impose further costs on them.  The special liquidators are obliged to ensure the assets of the IBRC are sold at a price that is equal to or in excess of the independent valuation obtained from the independent valuers.  If a bid is not received which is either at or above the valuation price, the loan asset will be transferred to NAMA at the independent valuation price.  In the event that the portfolio is transferred to NAMA, the board of NAMA will determine its strategy at that stage.  In doing so, NAMA will be mindful of its legal obligations and the general market norms under the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears and mortgage arrears resolution strategies.<\/p><p>  Although I understand the anxiety of individual customers in relation to the sale of their mortgage loans, they can be assured that the contractual terms and conditions of customer mortgages and other borrowings have not changed as a result of the appointment of the special liquidators, nor will they change as a result of the ultimate sale of these obligations to a third party.  All debts owing to the IBRC will remain due and enforceable.  In order to avoid breaches of their obligations, it is important for customers to continue to make payments on their loans and otherwise honour the contractual obligations of their borrowings.  The special liquidators are under the instruction of the Minister for Finance to ensure the valuation of all assets is completed by 30 November.  The sale of all IBRC assets should be agreed or completed by no later than 31 December 2013, or as soon as practicable thereafter.  The decision on how the mortgage portfolio is to be sold must take account of the time constraints faced by the special liquidators.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the decision concerning how the loans are packaged for sale and what bidders constitute qualifying bidders for the purposes of the sales process is to be made by the special liquidators. The Minister for Finance is not in a position to interfere with these decisions, as to do so would leave him open to challenge from other IBRC creditors.  The special liquidators are confident that the decision to sell the residential mortgage book as part of a large portfolio is the most efficient method of disposal and the one which is most likely to maximise sales.  This is in the best interest of the creditors of the IBRC and, by extension, the State and the Irish taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300030#DD00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1382536800,"counter":829,"content":"<p>The Minister has said he understands \"the anxiety of individual customers\".

It is clear that large corporations will be able to cherry-pick, whereas individuals will be unable to bid to buy their mortgages, obviously, because the banks are not making enough loans available to allow that to happen in a timely way.

I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise this Topical Issue.  I recognise the work that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has done on this issue over some time.  While I intend to focus on a local example from Dublin South-East, I emphasise that this is a national issue.  In 2007, some &euro;13 million was spent on flood defences along the River Dodder to protect an area stretching as far as Lansdowne Road against a flood event that was likely to occur once every 200 years.  Following the heavy flooding that was caused by rain in October 2011, a further &euro;2 million was spent on emergency works and new flood defences along the river as far as Ballsbridge.  Work has now started on flood defence works costing approximately &euro;10 million to protect an area extending as far as Donnybrook and Clonskeagh.  This means that over &euro;25 million will have been spent to protect homes, communities and businesses along the River Dodder.<\/p><p>  Taxpayers and the Government need to see a dividend from the money that has been spent on the protection of these communities.  When I surveyed 1,000 homes in an area covering Ringsend, Sandymount and Bath Avenue, I found they cannot get flood cover or, if they can, their policies have been doubled.<\/p><p>For the most part they have not been able to get flood insurance.  This is replicated in Carlow, Cork, Donegal and across the country.  Every week members of my community contact me about the problems of getting flood insurance.  They are people who want to sell, to downsize, or who have outgrown their family home and want to move to another property.  They are locked in because the person who wishes to buy their home cannot get a mortgage as they have failed to get flood insurance.  Nobody can buy because nobody can get flood insurance. <\/p><p> I have organised meetings between Dublin City Council and Insurance Ireland, formerly the Irish Insurance Federation, to ensure the transfer of information from the council and the OPW, to enable insurers to see the quality and quantity of work done.  We urgently need to bring forward a clear protocol.  If the taxpayer spends this much money there has to be a dividend.  The insurance companies need to co-operate but if they fail to do so, and if this cannot be achieved by agreement or protocol, I call for legislation.<\/p><p> Earlier this year Insurance Ireland indicated that it would come forward with a protocol in September saying to the effect that it had a mechanism to recommend to its members to give flooding cover where the OPW has invested such large moneys in flood protection.  It has failed to do that.  Families are living in overcrowded conditions and want to move on.  Older people want to downsize and move to something more suitable but they are locked in.  The OPW has spent over &euro;40 million on this one small area and that is not recognised.  At this stage we need to move on urgently.  We need to say to the insurance industry that it should introduce a protocol or agreement or this House will bring forward legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300030#DD01000","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382537400,"counter":838,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, I thank the Deputy for providing the opportunity to update him and the House on developments on this matter.<\/p><p>  I am fully aware that the issue of obtaining flood insurance cover is a matter of some concern to some people in certain locations around the country, whether in terms of the higher premia they are being asked to pay or where their existing insurance company indicates it will no longer provide such flood cover specifically.  Insurance Ireland, formerly the Irish Insurance Federation, has indicated that the incidence of such difficulties remains at a low level and that only of the order of 2% of insurance policies nationally are involved.  Nonetheless 2% of households represents a significant number of affected people and for this reason the Government is anxious that the problem is addressed.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes and his officials in the OPW have been actively engaged with the insurance industry for some time in regard to the transfer of information on completed flood defence schemes.  In January 2013 a working group was established with representatives from the OPW, Insurance Ireland and the main household insurance companies operating in the Irish market to consider and address this issue.  This group has a specific aim and purpose and it is important that this and the role of the OPW in the process are clearly understood.<\/p><p>  It must be emphasised that the OPW has no role or function in regard to the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry or of insurance matters generally.  The discussions between the OPW, Insurance Ireland and the insurance companies have a specific focus and are concerned solely with agreeing a basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on flood relief schemes completed by the OPW and the standard of protection offered by those schemes.<\/p><p>  The discussions have been complex and quite technical in nature and it is important that all matters are addressed in a comprehensive way that will ensure that the system of data exchange is robust, reliable and sustainable.  I am happy to report that the working group has made very good progress and agreement has been reached on a data-sharing platform which will facilitate the transfer of detailed information on completed OPW flood relief schemes.  This will allow the insurance industry to properly take into account the levels of capital investment in flood protection measures over several decades by the OPW when assessing flood risk in localities where such flood measures have been completed.<\/p><p>  The information being provided is in a readily accessible format which will show in digital map files the areas benefiting from completed flood defence works.  The initial focus of the group's work is the provision of information on schemes which provide protection for the one in 100 year flood.  The OPW has provided an initial batch of information to the insurance companies and the latter are currently working on integrating this information into their own individual operating systems.  It is expected that this work will be completed shortly.<\/p><p>  It is intended that the OPW and Insurance Ireland will agree a memorandum of understanding to guide present and future interaction between the insurance industry and the OPW in regard to communications around completed flood defence works.  The OPW is satisfied that the insurance industry is engaging constructively and positively in this process and that there is a strong willingness to co-operate on implementing a sustainable system of information exchange.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the insurance companies themselves to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence works.  As part of the process they are committing to take the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is to be hoped that this will facilitate the provision of flood cover in all areas that are protected by completed schemes.<\/p><p>  Finally, I remind the Deputy of the avenues available to those having difficulty, complaints or queries in seeking insurance cover through Insurance Ireland's free insurance information service.  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300031#EE00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1382537400,"counter":839,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I know that this is not his area.  What I hear in the response is that the insurance industry is talking the talk but delivering very little.  There is nothing really new in the reply from the industry.  Insurance Ireland came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment Community and Local Government where it cited the figure of \"only 2%\".  Our evidence shows that this affects far more than 2% of householders.  The industry has put a 500 metre extension on either side of every river in the country.  The houses at the top of the hill in Lucan Village cannot get household insurance.  In Cork, the houses at the top of Patrick's Hill - we all know how steep that is - cannot get flood insurance.<\/p><p>  What I hear again today is the insurance industry saying it will co-operate while nothing happens on the ground yet we spend large sums of taxpayers' money to ensure that flood protection is provided.  In my own area flood protection is at the level of a one in 200 year event.  That is far above what the insurance industry talks about in any other area.  It is double the standard it seeks.  I facilitated the transfer of information from Dublin City Council and the OPW to Insurance Ireland, which made pledges that it would respond within a week and said that the information seemed to be correct.<\/p><p>  The OPW is one of the best groups to work on flood relief.  In my constituency, and many other constituencies, it has done excellent work.  I ask the Minister of State to tell his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes that we have listened carefully to the insurance industry but we have seen very little action.  I believe that it is now time for action from this House to tell the insurance industry to get its act together and let the taxpayer see a real dividend from the excellent work carried out by the OPW.  While this is an important constituency matter for me, it is equally so in many areas across the country where there is such a large investment.  The OPW spends approximately &euro;40 million a year on flood protection.  We need to see a dividend from money that we spend on behalf of taxpayers.  I am telling the insurance industry to get its act together or we will bring in legislation to ensure that this insurance cover is provided.  I have been dealing with this matter for 10 years and the insurance companies are great at talking the talk but not very good at walking the walk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300031#EE00300","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1382537400,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Humphreys.  His point is very well made.<\/p><p>He wants action and results.  The catchment flood risk assessment and management plan is well under way.  I will provide some background information.  Studies carried out under the programme will provide the most comprehensive survey of the flood risk associated with Ireland's waterways.  In total, more than 3,500 km of major water courses are being subjected to these detailed surveys.  A scale of measurement will allow for the development of sophisticated hydraulic models.<\/p><p> Regarding the issue of whether the Government will consider alternative ways of addressing the problem such as a State indemnification scheme or an insurance pool type of solution, a State indemnification scheme for those unable to obtain flood insurance has been considered before.  While it is difficult to quantify the cost in any particular year over a period of time, it is possible to say that the cost would be significant on the basis that there have been eight major flood events costing the insurance industry approximately &euro;700 million in flood claims from 2000 to 2012.  These costs would be in addition to the normal infrastructural costs arising from flooding such as repair of roads and bridges.<\/p><p> If a scheme of this type were established, there exists a very real possibility that the industry would have a strong incentive to discontinue the provision of flood cover in medium to high-risk areas thus increasing the potential cost of the scheme over time.  Therefore, such an arrangement has the potential to undermine the nature of existing private insurance, making it difficult to withdraw even if it were introduced on a short-term basis.<\/p><p> In respect of the point made by Deputy Humphreys, I will speak to the Minister of State.  Perhaps there could be a round table discussion in the committee rooms with the Minister of State.  Deputy Humphreys has ten years of experience on this and has a deep knowledge of what he is talking about.  It is unreal that if people live at the top of a hill, they cannot get insurance.  People want action.  The OPW does outstanding work but what Deputy Humphreys wants is collective action on behalf of the insurance companies to deal decisively with this problem.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will take note of the concerns raised by the Deputy and I ask him to arrange a meeting with the Minister of State to see about convening a round table discussion with the insurance industry in Leinster House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300031#EE00400","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","time":1382538000,"counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300032#FF00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1382538000,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I wish to put on the record of the House that I have a personal interest.  I am a postmaster of eight years in my constituency.  I am the fourth generation to do so and I am fortunate to serve the community.  I also wish to put on record, and with no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, that I am disappointed the Minister with direct responsibility for this area is not present.  The moving of Topical Issues to this time of the day was to facilitate the relevant line Minister to be present to hear the concerns, especially of Opposition Deputies because Government Deputies have the opportunity to speak to relevant Ministers at parliamentary party meetings about concerns they may have.  I am very disappointed in this regard.  I hope and expect the Minister of State to bring back to the Minister the concerns I raise, and I expect a direct reply from the relevant Minister.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State knows about the great anxiety among members of the public who use their local post offices, the future of which is far from certain given the Department of Social Protection's desire to move social welfare payments to electronic payments.  If An Post loses this contract, in the region of 50% of its network will be unviable.  I am unashamedly supportive of An Post and the pivotal role and service it provides to the community it serves, be it rural or urban Ireland.  The An Post network brand inspires possibly the greatest degree of confidence in the country.<\/p><p>  Rural Ireland has seen a severe reduction in services in recent years.  We have seen the closure of Garda stations and the forced amalgamation of small schools.  Community welfare officers no longer go out to rural communities and rural pubs are closing.  All of this is happening as a direct result of Government policy or the lack of support from Government.  We have also witnessed the closure of sub-branches of banks.  The blame for that cannot be laid at the door of Government because it is a commercial decision.<\/p><p>  On 16 July 2013, this House heard statements on the future of the post office network.  Deputies from all sides of the House spoke glowingly of the service provided to communities by An Post, but we do not need platitudes, niceties or words of encouragement.  We need action.  The Department of Social Protection has a crucial play in the sustainability of our post office network.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Social Protection has deferred the sending out of the tender until the first quarter of 2014.  In the intervening period, she needs to conduct a cost-benefit analysis to see how this would benefit the Exchequer, both economically and socially.  A cross-departmental working group needs to be set up involving the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Justice and Equality, the Environment, Community and Local Government, and Public Expenditure and Reform because An Post, which is a State-owned agency, is under-utilised.<\/p><p>  The Irish Postmasters' Union commissioned a report by Grant Thornton which looked at ways in which post offices could better serve the community and enhance the services they provide.  They could be given a banking licence to ensure they operate as banks.  The post office network could be utilised as a citizens' information bureau.  Garda&iacute; could use the post office network as a one-stop-shop in locations where Garda stations have closed.  We see a reduction in staff in the various councils.  People could pay their motor tax and fines and renew their driving licences through the post office network.  There is an opportunity to ensure An Post's network is viable while reducing costs for the State.  I hope the Minister of State will bring this issue back to the Minister for Social Protection.  At very short notice, I collected 3,000 signatures in part of my constituency from people who were afraid of losing their post office and who are calling on this Government to take direct action to support the future of our post office network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300032#FF00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1382538000,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy for raising this very important issue.  I am taking it on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection who regrets she cannot be present.  Deputy Troy should be assured she is aware of the issues he raises.  The concerns raised by the Deputy have been raised by other colleagues in the House and I am pleased to allay some of their concerns by setting out the Department's plan to modernise the payment of welfare on a progressive basis over the coming years.  The Department is a key player in the payment services sector in Ireland, being the largest issuer of electronic funds transfer, EFT, payments in the country and given the scale of cash payments disbursed weekly.  The decisions made by the Department about how payments are made to customers impact on the State, most notably in respect of costs.<\/p><p>  The Department undertook a root and branch examination of its payment processes, methods and approaches.  This resulted in the preparation of a payment strategy which was approved recently by the Government.  The strategy has the goal of reducing significantly the level at which welfare payments are made in cash.  At present, 50% of all social welfare payments are disbursed in cash.  This amounted to approximately &euro;9.5 billion distributed over 43.7 million transactions last year.  The analysis undertaken for the payment strategy indicates the very significant variation in the cost of different payment methods.  The movement of cash imposes security risks on customers and staff alike who handle, distribute and receive these moneys.  Cash limits the options for customers to make onward transactions, limits the scope for customers to avail of cheaper prices online and curtails financial inclusion of customers.<\/p><p>  The move to digital transactions is in line with wider Government policies and objectives on better public services and more effective electronic payments as set out in the public service reform plan and the eGovernment strategy 2012-2015.  The goal is also shared by the national payments plan and the roll-out of the standard bank account.  These initiatives have made the case quite strongly for a move to electronic payments which will contribute to improved national competitiveness.<\/p><p>Cost containment and efficiencies must be sought by all public bodies and the Department is required to examine the means through which all welfare services are delivered, including payment processes.  The payment strategy is a multi-phase strategy that will be implemented over a number of years.  The first phase has commenced and contract negotiations are currently under way with An Post for the provision of over the counter cash services to ensure that customers can continue to receive their payments in cash at local post offices for the foreseeable future and provide an assurance on the continuity of cash payments to customers for up to six years while other aspects of the strategy are progressing.<\/p><p> The next phase of the strategy will be the progressive migration of customers to electronic funds transfer, EFT, payments.  The move to electronic payments for social welfare transactions is a trend that has been apparent for some time and most new social welfare customers, aside from jobseekers, are choosing EFT as their preferred method of payment.  The Department does not intend to migrate higher risk customers to an electronic payment until appropriate and robust measures are defined and fully implemented to mitigate the potential for increased risk of fraud within an electronic payments environment.<\/p><p> Undeniably, a loss in the current revenue stream from social welfare payments would impact An Post.  I understand that in anticipation of the increasing use of EFT generally, An Post has prepared and implemented a strategy which aims to address the reality of increased use of electronic payment methods within the economy.  On the revenue side, An Post has made significant progress in developing new commercial opportunities with other financial and payments institutions and insurance services bodies, notably AIB, Danske Bank and Aviva.  New lines of business have been generated, such as foreign exchange where An Post now holds 30% of the domestic foreign exchange business.  Post offices were also used as a payment channel for the property tax.<\/p><p> My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, envisages a strong future for the post office network in which it remains a key player as a front office provider of Government services.  The Department of Social Protection is happy to continue to work with the post office network, which delivers excellent and trustworthy services to customers.  I assure the House that the phased move to electronic payments and the fact An Post is the preferred bidder for the cash services tender, subject to contract, will provide the board of An Post with the time necessary to ensure its network and services can continue to meet the needs of a changing society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300032#FF00400","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382538600,"counter":846,"content":"<p>The Minister of State noted that 50% of the payments made through post offices are in the form of cash.  People chose to collect their payments in cash from rural post offices for a variety of reasons, such as fear of the banks or convenience.  This cash supports other businesses in a local community, from the grocer and butcher to the petrol station.  The cash inflow is very welcome to the local community.  However, the Government's strategy aims at reducing significantly the proportion of welfare payments made in cash by progressively migrating customers to electronic fund transfers.  If that happens the future of 50% of our post office network is finished, along with all the other services that have been eroded in rural Ireland over the past several years.<\/p><p>  This Government can make policy decisions that will support the post office network.  We have seen what happened in parts of England where the post office network was eroded.  This is more than simple economics; it is a social service to a community.  I urge the Government to consider the recommendations in the Grant Thornton report commissioned by the Irish Postmasters' Union in regard to enhancing the services provided, such as providing a banking licence to An Post so that people can have their money paid into a bank account and withdrawn from local post offices.  An Post is working on an e-payments card to facilitate electronic payments but it needs the Government's support.  It is a State owned agency and it is under utilised at present.

However, we must move towards a certain level of technology.  I have no doubt that the strategy will allow post offices to develop their own concepts for allowing payments in cash and other methods.  Approximately &euro;9.5 billion was distributed over 43.7 million transactions last year and that is assured for the next six years.

Local authorities need resources and front-line staff to provide the services required from them.  Everything else is shifting the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic<\/i>.  In recent years, as funding and staffing have been axed, we have seen the creeping manifestation of outsourced or privatised services and, as a result, more charges being loaded on local communities and residents to pay for the services they used to receive in return for the taxes they paid to central government.  Local authorities are being forced to ramp up parking charges and they cannot give small businesses a break on rates.  They are required to find ways of making money at every hand's turn, whether from local communities, amenities or other areas, and in the process many people are effectively excluded from services for which charges are imposed.<\/p><p>  The attempt to deal with the controversial position of county managers, who - let us be honest - are not the most popular people in the world as they stand because they so unaccountable by describing them as CEOs is indicative of the corporatisation of local government.  That is the last thing we need.  Local government needs to be brought back to the people.  We need real civic involvement by the community in policy making and real accountability from public representatives and, particularly, powerful senior officials such as county managers.

Before I begin, I wish to convey my sympathies on the sudden death yesterday of a councillor, Mr. Gary Wyse, of Fianna F&aacute;il in Waterford city.  Gary was a deeply committed and passionate public representative and will be a loss to the local authority and the public.<\/p><p>  We must ask the question of whether local authorities are fit for purpose, are sustainable under current funding models and serve the communities in the best way possible.  If we were all honest, the answer would be &quot;No&quot;.  The last serious attempt at reform was Better Local Government in 1999 under a previous Government.  I was a councillor for almost eight years.  In that time, I witnessed the duplication of management in unnecessary layers.  Deputy Boyd Barrett might be right in a sense, in that the system was top heavy.  There was also a lack of connectivity with communities.  The remaining link to communities is the democratically elected councillor.  We need to give credit where it is due.  Councillors stand before their communities every five years and are elected to do a job.<\/p><p>  The problem with Better Local Government was the limiting or removal of councillors' powers.  It remains the fundamental problem with the development of local government.  Continuing with the present regime is not an option.  Local authorities are unsustainable and do not deliver the services that our communities need.  Either we reform or local authorities will perish.  For this reason, I welcome the Bill.<\/p><p>  We inherited our system from British rule.  Some councils represent towns with small populations.  While I acknowledge the good work that town councils have done down the years, there is no equality between them.  Lismore in County Waterford is a relatively small town, yet the county has two or three larger towns that have no councils.  Where is the equality in this?  The Bill goes a long way towards addressing that inequality by setting up new municipal districts and, in larger urban centres, metropolitan areas.<\/p><p>  Challenges remain.  In my area, there will be an amalgamation between the Waterford city and county authorities.  There are genuine concerns about this proposal.  I hope that, as the Bill is debated, the Minister will reassure people and show them that this reform will enhance Waterford city and not undermine it, as some people claim.  A critical mass will be created through the inclusion of the adjacent towns of Tramore and Dunmore East.  The metropolitan area's population will increase to more than 65,000, the generally recognised population for a city.  As the gateway city for the south east, Waterford and its new mayor should lead the way for development in the region.<\/p><p>  We can address the challenges facing us and reform in a positive and significant way that will deliver services for our communities.  However, responsibility comes with reform.  I remember my time on the council.  To be straight, most of the decisions that we made were on adopting county development plans and annual budgets.  For the rest of the year, one was simply deciding on increasing the cost of a recycling bag.  This is not real power for democratically elected local government members.<\/p><p>  Under this legislation, local authority members will have the power to increase or decrease revenue from the local property tax by 15%, allowing them to decide investment priorities in their districts.  They will also have additional powers of oversight and audit, in that a special committee will be set up under this Bill to ensure that spending is better managed within local authorities.  The Bill will create efficiencies and allow local community groups to give their views in a more democratically accountable way.<\/p><p>  Many agencies have been operating at arm's length from citizens for many years, including the county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, and Leader partnership boards.  Some of these have been operating well, but they are not as accountable to local citizens as they should be.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise a specific issue with the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300034#HH00700","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1382539200,"counter":858,"content":"<p>I am afraid that the Deputy has run out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300034#HH00800","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1382539200,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I will conclude on the rates issue.

When the structures of local government were established in the closing years of the 19th century, few would have envisaged the change that would be wrought in the next century.  The Bill establishes a local government model that is fit for purpose in 21st century Ireland.  Large leaps forward in terms of travel and transport, communications and community must be reflected in local government structures.  This Bill tackles the changes necessary in territorial structures and in the institutions of local government.<\/p><p>  Good government is lean government.  The Bill seeks to create a much leaner and more streamlined system.  Creating a much leaner local government structure cannot be done without causing a significant measure of difficulty for those enmeshed in the current structure, but this legislation will reap financial rewards in the years to come in terms of a reduced cost to local government and an increased focus on where local government spend is most needed.<\/p><p>  However, I would sound a note of caution about the difference between streamlining the system, which I welcome, and reducing representation, about which I would have concerns.  A substantial part of the savings arising from the Bill come from the abolition of urban district councils and town councils but it must be remembered that they have provided a valuable local voice across the country for many years.  They have initiated many valuable measures and provided a voice for urban residents that simply would not have been heard otherwise.  The fact that these urban councils provided a forum for the voicing of local grievances was also reflected in the remit of county councils and the issues raised therein, which were often of a more regional nature.<\/p><p>  Prior to the boom years of the Celtic tiger, urban and town councils were operated on a shoestring budget.  It was the increased running costs amassed during the boom years that eventually led to their downfall, as the cost could no longer be justified in the current economic climate.  Cuts needed to be made to every conceivable area of expenditure, including to the cost of politicians at local and national level.  However, had the very low pre-boom costs been maintained, a much better case would have been made for the retention of such councils.  The same applies to county councils and the reduction in the number of councillors resulting from this Bill from 1,627 to 949, which reflects the abolition of the urban and town council regimes.<\/p><p>  The Bill contains other welcome provisions, including the bringing together under one umbrella of both Tipperary county councils.  Undoubtedly, this will save on the expense of duplicated offices such as human resources.<\/p><p>  The change in the role of the county manager will hopefully result in a reduction of the tension that has bedevilled many county councils across the country for many years in terms of clashes between the unelected executives and the elected local representatives.  I also welcome the introduction of the national oversight and audit commission, which is a commonsensical measure aimed at ensuring that money is spent wisely, but I hope that the bureaucratic burden placed on county councils will not be too great, as it would otherwise be counter-productive.<\/p><p>  By improving the equality of representation throughout the country, the Bill will play an important part in creating a more effective and representative local government.  However, there is no point in having a vibrant and robust local government system if power is not devolved to local level.<\/p><p> Much work remains to be done in devolving power to local level in Ireland.  We have much to learn from our counterparts in continental Europe in this respect.  On that point, I would like to take up something that Deputy Coffey mentioned concerning rates.  We must do an awful lot more on rates from the perspective of small businesses.  As a county councillor, for too long I saw businesses going to the wall due to the rates issue.  The current valuation system does not work.  When one hears that a town may be evaluated again, it is almost a poisoned chalice because rates may rise or fall.  It does not take into account the business one is doing.  Given that we are trying to get more businesses into smaller towns, and these will always be small or medium-sized enterprises, we must take into account the level of business they are doing and their turnover rather than the size of the building they are using.  That is an unfair and archaic system which needs to be re-examined.<\/p><p> This Bill is an important step towards putting structures in place which will allow us to plan towards devolving further powers to local government in the years to come.  This will result in a streamlined service which will be suitable for the delivery of the necessary services in 21st century Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300034#HH01200","speaker":"1041","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382539800,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I am fascinated that some speakers are totally opposed to the Bill.

I was in office when Better Local Government was brought in.  It was not about councillors but about local officials, which created a layer of bureaucracy.  It suited the Fianna F&aacute;il Government at the time to centralise power in the hands of a few.  I am thoroughly delighted that something as radical as this Bill has been introduced.<\/p><p>  I refer to page 73 of the Bill which deals with the financial procedures and audit.  When I joined the county council, we used to spend three days on the budget.  Nowadays, because councillors do not have as much power as they used to, they spend half a day rushing through the budget.  When I started off in 1997 and 1998 it was a big event.  We scrutinised the budget for three days to ensure that whatever money was being made available and collected on behalf of ratepayers was being spent properly.<\/p><p>  The Minister said that regulations will show the amount necessary for the functional programmes of the authority, but will this be done annually?  If so, does the Minister need to make regulations to cover that properly?  This is one of the key parts of the legislation.  Municipal district authorities will operate as in the North of Ireland, but members of such authorities must be given more power than at present.  As part of their function, I would like to see them discussing municipal budgets beforehand.  When does the Minister expect council budgets to take place?  Nowadays, most council budgets occur in December.  Based on this Bill, however, I would see them taking place in October like the national budget.  Some regulation needs to be put in place to that effect in order that the members who are contributing to the debate on local authority budgets can have adequate time to consider the matter and make a decision.  Such local authority budgets should therefore coincide with the national budget in October or, at least, be concluded before the end of the month.<\/p><p>  One of the most important terms used in the Bill is &quot;reserve function&quot;.  Local authority members should recognise how powerful that term is.  The making of amendments by municipal district council members is a reserve function.  The fact that we are giving more powers to members is the key to this legislation.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State might have a view on the membership of audit committees.  Most county councils now have internal value for money committees.  It is vital that new local authority members should be included as part of such committees.  In that way, they will be able to give a fair assessment of the audit.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to training courses.  The Minister has said that local authorities will have to establish audit committees.  Members of such committees should have some sort of relevant knowledge, so some training should be provided to them in that regard.  Audit committees will form a very important part of the whole structure.  I have no faith in auditors because they are part of the reason the country was brought to ruin.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board some of these points.  I have been quite specific in what I am seeking, and I hope he will comment on them later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300035#JJ00400","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1382539800,"counter":867,"content":"<p>When I entered local government in 1974, the system was already 75 years old.  It is only now, in 2013, that any government has had the courage to propose a fundamental review and reform of our local government structure.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for his courage and conviction in bringing forward this Bill.  Many previous Ministers spoke of reform, including John Gormley, Dick Roche and Noel Dempsey but it was the current Minister, Deputy Hogan, who brought about these fundamental changes.<\/p><p>  The Bill's provisions deal with every area from the abolition of local town councils to the restructuring of local authorities as the centrepiece of local enterprise.  I would like to dwell on some key proposals.  The Minister has signalled that the main focus for local authorities in future will be as the drivers of economic activity within their county or other jurisdiction.  I welcome this proposal.  Like many others, I have heard the frustrations of people who want to start a business.  They complain they must go in several directions before they meet the relevant agency or group to get the necessary assistance or advice.<\/p><p>  This Bill will address these anomalies in many ways.  The local enterprise offices, or LEOs, will centrally address the lack of joined-up thinking between our local enterprise support agencies.  This will see the abolition of the county enterprise boards and their alignment with local councils.<\/p><p>  I am a little disappointed that the Minister has excluded local authority members from the LEOs' oversight or boards.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, who is anxious to see elected members at the coalface, should discuss this matter with his ministerial colleague, Deputy Bruton, who is the lead Minister on the LEO set-up.<\/p><p>  In the 2001 Local Government Bill, the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, introduced the concept of strategic policy committees, SPCs, in local government.  There is much debate within local government and within the Executive on whether these SPCs work well.  As a former member and chair of an SPC, I believe they have value but in many ways they require extensive reform of their structures.  In addition, they require the provision of set targets or benchmarks in terms of a five-year plan and a shorter plan for the duration of a local authority term.<\/p><p>  Section 40 provides that an SPC is established in each of the 31 councils to deal with economic development.  This is to enable the elected council to set strategic policy for the local authority&rsquo;s enhanced role in social and economic development.  It provides that the SPC may request the attendance of a public authority at a meeting.  Such a public body must provide an explanation to the full local authority if it refuses to attend.  This is certainly a worthwhile proposal.<\/p><p>  Since 2001, county development boards have been ineffectual in delivering what they should do, which is simply to develop the county or local authority area.  Part 6 inserts a new section 49A into the 2001 Act.  This new section provides for the dissolution of city and county development boards, and the establishment of local community development committees which are within, rather than outside, the local authority.<\/p><p>It provides that such committees prepare five-year local and community plans for local and community development in their areas and requires that plans be consistent with the core strategy and objectives of development as set out in the planning and development Acts.<\/p><p> I am a supporter of the local development companies.  In my constituency, delivery by Leader and the Leitrim development companies has been second to none.  Led from the bottom-up, with boards selected from the local authorities, communities and agencies their financial performance, leadership and decision-making has made a great impact on the communities in both counties.  In my view, this delivery was provided with minimal administration costs and compares well with that provided by the local authorities.<\/p><p> Section 128D of New Section 49A in the 2001 Act provides that membership of the new committee must include elected members of the local authorities, a chief executive or someone appointed by the chief executive, representatives of public authorities which provide services locally, representatives of local community interests and of publicly-funded or supported local development bodies, private individuals representing the local community and other persons as the Minister may appoint.  Concerns have been expressed by community activists and the companies that this realignment will lead to a politicisation of funding.  However, I do not agree with that view.  Projects are assessed by a committee under strict criteria and recommendations are then forwarded to a board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300035#JJ00500","speaker":"1082","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382540400,"counter":869,"content":"<p>The Deputy must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300036#KK00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1382540400,"counter":870,"content":"<p>Concern has been also expressed about a possible loss of expertise and the ability of the local authorities to deliver maximum funding at minimum cost.<\/p><p>  Under the Bill the powers of the audit committees will be enhanced to allow for a review of financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures in the local authority and to foster best practice in this regard.  This is one of the most important committees considering the difficulties being experienced by Sligo County Council.  According to the annual financial statement for Sligo County Council, its debt increased by almost &euro;2.5 million in 2012.  Councillors were asked to authorise over-expenditure at their annual budget meeting.  This debt from 2012 brings the revenue deficit to &euro;7.9 million and leaves the county council with a total revenue-capital debt of in excess of &euro;80 million.

While some Members will say the Bill includes several provisions which provide benefits, people will see it for what it is, namely, an attack on local democracy.  This legislation seeks the abolition of town councils throughout Ireland which up to now have served a useful purpose at local level.  I acknowledge that they are not perfect and should be reformed.  The Bill also proposes a reduction in the number of elected councillors countrywide.  At a time when people are saying there is a democratic deficit in the country, the Government's response is to reduce the number of elected members thereby increasing that deficit and removing from people access to local representatives.<\/p><p>  Of concern is the proposal to abolish the regional authorities.  Under this Bill, town councils and regional authorities will be abolished and the number of county councillors is to be reduced.  It is possible for Government to do this because it has a majority in this House.  The Government tried to abolish the Seanad but the people of Ireland stopped it in its tracks.  I believe that if the people were asked to vote on this legislation they would respond similarly.  Essentially, the people do not trust this Government when it comes to political reform.<\/p><p>  Also of concern is Part 9, which provides the Minister with the power to dissolve existing regional authorities.  The power to establish regional assemblies is being given not to the Government, the D&aacute;il or the people of Ireland but to the Minister.  It is proposed to establish three regional assemblies, one in the eastern midlands area and two others in Connaught-Ulster and the southern region.  There are currently eight regional authorities in existence.  It is proposed all will be abolished.  The cumulative effect of abolishing local direct democracy and regional authorities, to which local councillors are elected, is a further erosion of the link between people and their elected representatives.  This legislation was drafted by bureaucrats and officials and is an official's dream.  The Bill also proposes that county managers will be renamed chief executive officers, who will be less accountable in the future.  <\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the establishment of the municipal districts, which will have only minor powers such as the ability to rename the Cathaoirleach and so on.  They will have no real power, no budget and no fund-raising authority.  It is clear from the briefing we received that under this Bill that while municipal districts will also have the reserve function of establishing a community fund, their financial authority will be less than that currently held by a rating town council.  As stated, some town councils are small.  The proposed new municipal districts will be substantially larger but will have less financial autonomy.  The Minister has stated this will bring democracy down to a local level.  However, it will also remove the financial autonomy in this area.  <\/p><p>  I believe this legislation is a manger's dream because the municipal districts will be like beefed up area committees.  There will be more meetings on a monthly basis and, as time goes on, fewer full meetings of the local county councils and local county managers will be less answerable to the local county council elected members.  I can foresee a situation whereby meetings will be held only quarterly with a decision being taken to conduct all business at municipal district meetings.  Municipal district meetings will be akin to area committee meetings.  Democracy only works if there is transparency and the people know what is happening.  We all know that local media is stretched in terms of even attending council meetings once a month.  They do not have the resources to do any more because they are dependent on advertising and sales revenue.  This will result in less reporting on what is happening at meetings on the radio and in print media and less reporting on local authority activities.  I can foresee a situation whereby less will be discussed at monthly council meetings because everything will be up for discussion at the municipal district meeting.  This means the public will not know what is going on.  <\/p><p>  I am seeking clarification on a number of issues, including where the local development plans will fit into these new sub-county structures.  Will they be a reserved function of municipal districts or will local area committees have an input into them?  While some local area committees cross several towns, Kilkenny city is split down the middle and it would make no sense for the municipal district to have a say in such a situation.  Another issue of concern is that of policing committees.  Up to now town councils included policing committees.  As some town councils are to be abolished, will this result in a further erosion of the liaison between the policing committees and local communities?  I take it counties that had two or three policing committees will in future have only one.  I do not believe it will be practical for the Garda&iacute; to service the municipal districts.  There are not sufficient numbers of superintendents in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do so and someone below the rank of superintendent would not have the authority to speak on behalf of the superintendent at those meetings.  This will result in difficult situations in this area also.<\/p><p>  I would like now to speak about financial accountability.  Schedule 3 deals with the power of local authorities to vary the rate of the local property tax.  That one local authority can decide to increase its rate at the same time as another decides to reduce the rate in its area will lead to difficulties and an unfair situation for many people.  People are being told this will Bill provide additional powers for local government.<\/p><p>In fact, it will be used in some cases to the disadvantage of local government.  Central government will eventually tell local government politicians and officials that if they want more money, they can increase the rate of their property tax.  That will put an unfair burden on certain parts of the country which do not have the same base as other counties.<\/p><p> The funding issue is wrong.  There was an opportunity for the role of the local government auditor to be amalgamated with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is wrong in every respect to enhance that role in this Bill, especially in a situation where the Government spends about &euro;50 billion per annum yet uses a completely separate structure to deal with the local government fund that funds local authorities, which is only in the order of &euro;1 billion per annum, or perhaps &euro;2 billion if we include funding for roads as well.  Why should we have a Comptroller and Auditor General auditing all Government expenditure, while 2% to 5% of that is set aside for a local government auditor?  There should be one auditor to set the standards.  I know people have complaints about the role of auditors, but there is less transparency with the local government audit than with the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the latter's office would have greater standing.<\/p><p> A new committee is being set up which will lead to more bureaucracy for more officials in the Department.  Who is the local government auditor at the moment?  I do not wish to know the name of the person, but I presume it is an official in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  They are not independent of local government.  They are not independent of the Minister.  They are officials of the Department and work under the Secretary General.  The auditing of local authorities should be removed from persons below the rank of Secretary General in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This is another example of where officialdom in the Custom House won the day.  This is more power, more procedures and more committees.  The Minister has spoken about setting up some national audit committee to deal with all these issues, which I believe will be called the national oversight and audit commission.  We do not need such a commission to deal with 5% of Government expenditure.  The local government auditor should be subsumed and I have made my point clearly about that.<\/p><p> There is nothing in this Bill about the real functions of local authorities.  On 1 January, all powers in respect of water, sewerage and waste water services will be transferring to Irish Water.  We have seen a diminution in the authority of local authorities.  We have seen the increasing role of the National Roads Authority, not just in respect of the motorways, but also regional roads and even national secondary roads, in determining maintenance programmes.  A local authority cannot even move a bend off a regional road nowadays without an inspector from the NRA coming down to state whether it is right or not.  We have systematically reduced the power of local authorities and their ability to respond at local level.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Deputy Calleary.  This is well dressed up as a reform of local government, but it is no more than an attack on local democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300036#KK00500","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382541000,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I cannot rise to speak about local government without paying tribute to Councillor Gary Wyse, a party colleague of ours who died very suddenly yesterday.  He was an outstanding public servant, an outstanding councillor and a very proud Waterford man.  I extend my sympathies and those of Deputy Fleming and our party to his family, his friends and his colleagues in Waterford.<\/p><p>  I support everything Deputy Fleming has said.  There are good elements to this Bill which can be welcomed and which have potential, but for me the glaring part of this Bill is an assault on local democracy.  Rather than putting people first, it seems people are being left behind by this Bill.  For me, that is represented in the abolition of town councils and the absolute ignorance of those in the Department and those who drafted the legislation of the invaluable role that a good, performing town council can play as an economic development unit and as a unit for citizen participation.  It is represented in the fact that this will be lost in these new bizarre structures, particularly in rural constituencies.<\/p><p>  There is a complete inconsistency and incoherence in the Bill which allows the people of Dublin, rightfully so, to have a plebiscite about the kind of mayor they want, and yet those of us who live in a town or borough council area will lose our mayor and our councillors without any consultation, but with the weight of the Government majority.  One would have hoped that the lessons of a campaign run by Fine Gael a few weeks ago to reduce the number of politicians would have been learned, and that cognisance would have been taken of the fact that people will not be bought by that populist nonsense.  Unfortunately, we have that campaign encapsulated in Government legislation on the abolition of town councils, as well as in other provisions that will undermine local participation and local democracy.<\/p><p>  I never served on a local authority.  I did not have the privilege of serving on either a town council or a county council, but I have seen very good town councils and very poor town councils in action over the years in my previous job, and as a citizen.  Unfortunately, this Bill throws the whole lot out due to the underperformance of a minority of councils.  When the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1999 was brought in to define a town council and upgrade urban district councils, it was ridiculous not to give them any extra power at the time.  I know it was done by a party colleague, but the issue should have been grasped then.  In my county, we have three town councils in Castlebar, Westport and my own town of Ballina.  In the past 15 years, Ballina Town Council has been responsible for pioneering many fine developments, both physically and within the spirit of the town.  It has acted as a foundation upon which many groups have built and have used council funds to support their own initiative.  The councillors, who generally leave their party jerseys outside the door, and the very good officials have a shared ambition for the town.  They implemented that ambition and we now have a very different town than we had.  It is noteworthy that in a time of very high attrition among local government politicians, all the outgoing members of Ballina Town Council who put themselves forward for re-election in 2004 and 2009 were re-elected.  That shows the regard and the respect the people of Ballina have for them and for what they have done.  They challenged them, but at least they saw fit to challenge them.  Under these new proposals, we will be luckier to see a dodo than a councillor in some parts of the country.<\/p><p>  The other big example of a successful town council is Westport, and this example is used right around the country.  Westport did not just happen.  Westport today is a town we all admire as a tourism centre, a centre for world class industry and a model of community participation through things like Tidy Towns-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300037#LL00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1382541000,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Ring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300037#LL00300","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1382541000,"counter":876,"content":"<p>-----and so on.  That happened because of the actions of the town council back in the 1970s.  Deputy Ring was a member of that council and he was on occasion able to leave the party jersey outside the door.  He himself would admit that he got his grounding in politics on the town council.  What he has brought to the party in the last two years is built on the initiative of a town council that worked together, but now that is gone.<\/p><p>  What will this be replaced by?  It will be replaced by a municipal district.  There are currently nine town councillors in Westport, but there will be seven councillors in the municipal district, extending from Leenane in the west to Belderrig in the north, which is a distance of 150 km.  These people will be drawn from all different areas, with a broad range of focus and no sense of direction or commitment to the town.  Their time will be spread over a very large area and we will lose that really important link to local authority, local government and democracy in general.  Apparently, this is putting people first.<\/p><p>  People do not get a sense of this at the moment, but in two years when they find that rates bills are increasing, when local organisations find out that the community fund, as defined in the legislation, is spread over hundreds of miles rather than in the town, and they cannot get the small bit of funding for festivals or local competitions and so on, they will then know the difference.  It is not a case of getting rid of politicians; it is a case of taking away a layer of government that we will eventually put back in.  Some Minister will come before this House in ten years or so to put the town council structure back into the system, because this is not going to work.<\/p><p>  If it is good enough for the people of Dublin to have a direct say in what their future local government will look like, then I think we should have the same say.  The Minister of State should have that say in Sligo, Deputy Deasy should have that say in Dungarvan, and so on, about what they want in their towns and counties.  There is a specific part of the Bill which provides for a plebiscite for Dublin and if the Minister believes that this Bill is putting people first and he still wants to take away the introductory layer of government from people, then he should put it to a plebiscite in the towns that are affected so he can test his case.  I know the Government is probably referendum shy at the moment, but he should have a go at this one.<\/p><p> Section 6 deals with the community and local development companies.  Just over 20 years ago they were set up to fill a gap that local authorities were not filling at the time.  It was ground-up development involving small projects and using the Leader money that was identified at the time in a visionary move by the then Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry - it was typical of him to see that.  Those companies have flourished.  While I accept there have been difficulties with some of them, just because a few have difficulties we should not throw out the whole lot.<\/p><p> The Bill provides for a local government and central government takeover over of the local development sector.  The employees and CEOs who do great work will now become local authority employees responsible to the local authority.  There is a sense that because there is the usual provision that certain individuals from various groups will be appointed to the boards it will be fine.  It is claimed that that is local government but it is not.  That is local development being hijacked by central government through the guise of local government and local democracy.  That will do considerable damage and we will again need to return to put that structure back in.  It was set up in that way because there was a need for a bottom-up approach to local development, whereas what we have here is a top-down approach.<\/p><p> Not even Sir Humphrey could have come up with the wording for the process for rate equalisation in the Bill.  It is a ten-year period but the authority can decide differently if it wants.  That is not how business works.  Over the years many town councils have managed to keep the rate base low while the county councils have a higher base.  Many businesses in towns are already being hammered by this bizarre revaluation process.  I met a businessperson today who must pay 40% more in rates next year because of this revaluation process.  That business will need to get a 3% increase in turnover to pay the rates alone.  Yet this legislation provides for an increase in rates, which is what will happen in most town council areas.  Even though there is some deliberately woolly phrasing in the Bill about it being over ten years, I envisage it happening much quicker than that and that needs to be amended on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> It is not possible to put people first by taking away the tier of government closest to them.  It is not possible to put people first by taking away the direct interaction that an elected body has with its community and community organisations.  At a time when there is such low regard for elected politicians, town councils allow elected politicians to be a fulcrum of development and something positive.  This is destroying that development and destroying that spirit.  We cannot support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300037#LL00400","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382541600,"counter":878,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Deasy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300038#MM00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1382541600,"counter":879,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I was a member of Cork County Council from 1999 to 2011.  I served as a member of the Southern Health Board until its dissolution.  I served on the South West Regional Authority and also chaired that body.  While I accept much of what Deputy Calleary has said, it is predicated on the idea that local government existed.  We never had local government - whether it was a town council, an urban council, a county council, a regional assembly or a regional authority.  We had local administration, rubberstamped by elected members in too many chambers throughout the country.  The only real power any local elected representative had was at budget time and at the discussion and deliberation on county and local development plans.  Apart from that there was nothing and we were entirely dependent on information and resolutions coming from the executive and the county managers, as well as circulars and policies from central government.  It just did not exist.<\/p><p>  Every argument that has been made about keeping government at the lowest level and closest to the people through the town and local authorities is ridiculous and always has been.  Regrettably there have been many missed opportunities for reform.  The greatest change that significantly impacted local government was the abolition of rates in 1977 and the decapitation of what was a quasi-local government resulting in the inability thereafter to fund themselves adequately.<\/p><p>  While the Bill might not go far enough, it contains some welcome provisions.  The merger of the six councils in Waterford, Tipperary and Limerick is seen as a positive move by citizens in those areas.  While it is not provided for in the Bill, I would go further in making a proposal that deserves consideration.  We should consider merging Cork City Council and Cork County Council in future.  This would offer a real counterbalance to the east coast as a single economic and political unit to serve the citizens of Cork city and county more effectively.  I say that perhaps in the teeth of opposition from local politicians in the area.  It might be given consideration when we see how the mergers in Waterford, Tipperary and Limerick fare out.<\/p><p>  In west County Cork we will lose the five town councils in Bantry, Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Bandon and Kinsale, comprising 45 councillors.  We will also losing four county councillors in the area.  The number of local public representatives in west County Cork will go from 57 to eight.  While that is extraordinary, they will have to live with it.  Those county councillors need real power.  More power needs to be vested in the elected representatives than in the executive.  Then perhaps we might see more effective local government.  I would prefer to see eight elected members in a region who have some say and power over decisions that affect the citizens rather than 57 who do not.<\/p><p>  The European funding is very much focused on regions.  The Irish experience in regions through the regional authorities has by and large been positive.  However, those regional authorities also come under the excessive influence of county and city managers, engineers and staff.  They do not have adequate reserved functions to serve those regional structures to match the European commitment that provides for them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Calleary spoke of the huge difficulty with community development programmes, addressed in section 6.  Why did the funding for such rural development need to be vested in companies limited by guarantee?  Some of them work well.  I served on one, Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, which served the western offshore islands.  It came up with curious anomalies where for different reasons a project half a mile away on an island can be approved by one company and the exact same project on the mainland cannot be approved by a different company.  It throws up some anomalies with respect to governance, transparency and information being provided to the public.  There are reservations over how that funding would be managed when they are incorporated back into the local authority structure.  However, if we are serious about giving political accountability and responsibility to the people nearest the ground, it makes sense for that to be within the local authority structure.  They are not being wiped out; they report to an elected body, which is a welcome provision.<\/p><p> There are opaque references to the audit functions of local authorities.  There is an issue of understanding among local councillors now because they believe they are powerless and they simply accept audits.  This has been my experience in Cork County Council.  A councillor will examine reports from the local government auditor and the comptrollers and accept them, but he cannot do much about them.  If the auditor draw attention to something, the councillor can discuss it at council and ask questions and get some answers.  It is in the public domain and the media but there are rarely any resolutions.  That is a major issue and I hope future councillors and elected members of local authorities in local chambers will take it up far more vigorously.<\/p><p> We hear references to saving money.  I hope there will be a far more efficient whistleblowing system within local authorities, whereby staff members who know that there are inefficiencies or wasted resources can report them through the management, councils or through the chamber without fear of recrimination.  I strongly urge that this should be considered.<\/p><p> There is reference in the legislation to amending section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001, which replaced section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act.  I have always held the view that these were particularly difficult sections within the local government system and I am pleased to note that in the 12 years I was a member of Cork County Council I do not recall a single incident when a section 140 provision was proposed, never mind passed.  I gather there was one case in 1997 or 1988 relating to extending power lines over Cork Harbour and that became a major issue but that was the only time.  Other local authorities use section 140 provisions as if they are questions to the manager and hold up a vast amounts of resources on proposals that are, frankly, sinister or part of a sinister agenda.<\/p><p> This is a welcome step in the reform of local government but it is only a step.  Anyone serious about reform would be the first to recognise that when one introduces an item of reform it does not stop there.  It cannot because the nature of reform is ongoing.  I am keen to see a situation whereby the local government system moves on from being a public administration rubber-stamp chamber to a system that effectively and really deals with issues such as local education, health, policing, child care and welfare.  It should provide for services as near to the people as possible and should integrate those services in terms of local planning and development.  Why is it, for example, that one can plan for a school locally but one must provide for it nationally?  These issues are relevant and I am keen to see them addressed in future.  I imagine there will be further legislation anon and all of these issues will be addressed to give real power back to local authorities and chambers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300038#MM00400","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382542200,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I wish to deal with Part 5, a large portion of which is concerned with commercial rates.  During the past three or four months we have been dealing with this matter at the Committee of Public Accounts, along with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance, the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Valuation Office.  As a result, myself and Deputy Robert Dowds intend to jointly table amendments to the section dealing with commercial rates.  We held a series of public meetings and private meetings with officials.  We hope to explain, beginning today, what changes we believe need to be made in the commercial rates section of the Bill.<\/p><p>  In May this year I raised the issue of commercial rates under a Topical Issues debate with the Minister.  At the time, the Minister referred to the harmonisation of annual rates and valuation between different local authorities.  He said that his approach to harmonisation would ensure that it would not lead to any increase in commercial rates in any local authority.  He stated: &quot;There should be no increase in commercial rates in Dungarvan arising from the merger of both local authorities. If it is the will of the councillors to do otherwise, that will run contrary to my policy&quot;.  Some confusion has arisen from that statement.  Section 29 provides that in order to ease the transition for ratepayers to a standardised rate while avoiding a negative impact on overall local authority revenue, the harmonisation of rates will take place over a maximum of ten years.  I and local authority officials and councillors realise this is a provision to spread out the negative effect of an increase in rates to avoid excessive damage to businesses.  It is an explicit acknowledgement that there will be increases in the annual rate on valuation, ARV, charge between local authorities.  Therefore, there is a contradiction between what has been said on the floor and what is in the legislation and that needs to be explained.  Beyond clarifying that situation, the question is how the Minister intends to ensure that councillors do not act contrary to his policy, and, if they do, what steps will he take to ensure that no increases occur.<\/p><p>  The second issue has to do with revaluations.  New valuations are being placed on commercial premises through the country.  In many cases businesses will be unable to absorb the increases.  This has been raised again and again in the past four or five months.  One of the amendments Deputy Dowds and myself intend to table would allow a local authority to spread out any increase in commercial rates over several years.  My understanding is that such a provision is in place in the United Kingdom and we believe it should be given consideration in this legislation.  It is clearly germane to the legislation.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned earlier, someone in the Department had the foresight to spread out the impact of harmonisation by allowing for a ten-year period of harmonisation between local authorities.  However, no one has considered the impact of the new valuations, that is, one payment with one cheque in one year.  It seems like an obvious step to allow local authorities to determine this themselves and, as the Minister said yesterday, to avoid any shocks to businesses.  Clearly, when spreading out the increases in commercial rates to avoid a shortfall in revenue to a local authority, it would necessarily mean a spreading out of the reductions on the other side, but I reckon that would be understood by those businesses in receipt of those reductions.  Put simply, this legislation cannot, on the one hand, provide a specific solution to ease the burden on a business because of a rates increase resulting from amalgamations of local authorities, while, on the other, ignoring completely the impact revaluations would have on the same businesses.  Someone in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government thought this through when it came to the first circumstance but the second circumstance must be dealt with in this Bill.  Not to do so would not make any sense.  We hope the Minister can accept our wording when we table our amendments.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, when the Minister introduced Part 5, he made extensive reference to section 31 which would standardise vacancy refunds throughout the country.  The Minister finished by stating:<blockquote>I am considering further how this provision will work in practice to ensure consequences other than those I intend are not realised. I will revert to this matter again as the Bill makes its way through the Houses.<\/blockquote>That is fair enough.  I am keen to know what is intended because, as it is written, it makes absolutely no sense.  I and others are grappling with the rationale behind this.<\/p><p>  At the moment in Cork, Dublin and Galway a company gets a 50% reduction in rates if the property is vacant.  However, for the rest of the country it is a 100% reduction; effectively the rates are entirely written off.  If this provision was written into law, it would be unworkable.  I offer one example.  The former Waterford Crystal factory in Dungarvan has been lying idle for approximately six years.  The rates on the premises would be approximately &euro;150,000 per year.  Who exactly would be expected to pay the &euro;75,000 rates Bill under this legislation?  Is it the receiver?  I doubt it, and I do not believe the local authority would get the payment in any case.  If the rationale behind this is to force landlords to find tenants, then the logic is faulty.  Most of the premises that are vacant in my constituency are vacant for the one reason that tenants cannot be found at any rental price since consumer spending has slumped.  To be honest, it is a bizarre time to introduce something like this.  It smacks of something that an official from Dublin thought up without any understanding that there is a two-tier economy in existence in the country.  The wording of the provision should be deleted or changed radically to reflect reality.  To reinforce my point, last week Waterford City Council announced a scheme to incentivise new tenants to occupy premises by giving them a rates holiday for several years.  That approach is completely at odds with what the Department has come up with on the same issue.  It is something one would expect to see in a boom period not something one would expect to see during an economic crisis.<\/p><p>The highest vacancy rate of 28.2% occurs in Ballybofey, County Donegal, while the lowest vacancy rate of 3.5% can be found in Greystones, County Wicklow.  This is a huge difference.<\/p><p> I wish to make a general point above the Government's approach to commercial rates over the past six months as having dealt with it for a lengthy period, disappointingly there is a lack of appreciation of what businesses are going through, particularly in respect of all these measures and how they might affect the retail sector on high streets nationwide.  I will provide an example.  I have spoken repeatedly to retailers who have shut down or who are under the threat of shutting down because they are competing with online businesses.  Last year, 57% of Irish Internet users made a web purchase.  Recent studies indicate that online shopping has become a substantive threat to store profitability.  In 2012, online shoppers in Ireland spent &euro;3.7 billion across a range of product and service categories and this trend is growing.  According to EUROSTAT, 26% of Irish Internet users have bought clothes and shoes online in the past 12 months, compared with 11% in 2008.  Moreover, 43% bought travel and holiday accommodation in 2012, which was an increase from the comparable figure of 32% in 2008.  The percentage of people purchasing books, magazines and e-learning materials online has increased by one third between 2000 and 2012.  The percentage of people buying food and groceries online during this period has doubled.  Do online businesses pay commercial rates?  No, they do not.  How does one expect a local betting shop, for example, to survive when it is paying increased commercial rates to the local authority while its online competitors pay nothing?<\/p><p> I am afraid this Bill does not take these trends into consideration and it is a case of diminishing returns because these businesses will not survive unless a different approach is taken by the Government as a whole when it comes to commercial rates.  Unfortunately, the commercial rate section, as written, is inconsistent with the realities of what is happening on high streets nationwide and notwithstanding the ten-year adjustment mechanism for harmonisation that shows appreciation for the potential impact of rate increases, the commercial rates section must be completely rewritten.  Although Deputy Calleary mentioned one increase, potentially there are three increases, as well as one added element, in this regard.  Potentially, it is a quadruple whammy.  First, there are changes to the rates refund scheme.  Second, there is harmonisation of annual rates on valuation, ARVs, in some cases upward.  Third, there are new upward valuations with no spreading out of the payment period and fourth, there are trends towards online shopping increasing each year.  Businesses will not survive unless the Government takes all these factors into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300039#NN00200","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382542800,"counter":884,"content":"<p>I understand the next speaker, Deputy McLellan, who has 20 minutes, intends to share time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300040#OO00200","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speech","time":1382542800,"counter":885,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300040#OO00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1382542800,"counter":886,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that Deputy McLellan shall have ten minutes and her two colleagues each shall have five minutes?

I also regret that so many of the political figures and opinion formers who spoke at such length about the need for a Seanad have not now or any time recently seen fit to speak on the urgent need for reform of local government and its protection.  While it seems as though it is not the most fashionable of causes, it still is no less worthy for all that.  No area of Irish democracy has taken such a hammering as has local government over the past ten to 15 years.  Our system of local democracy is hopelessly underdeveloped and weak.  The present Minister had a tremendous opportunity to do something about that, to give local authorities a proper role and to bring power back down to the local level.  However, that opportunity has been well and truly squandered.  More than that, the Minister has gone further and has taken the axe to local government in this State.<\/p><p>  The Government appears to have a warped sense of what political reform means.  Political reform is necessary and important.  The people wanted political reform because after the economic collapse in 2010 and 2011, there was a sense that the entire system had failed.  The political process was at once seen to be asleep at the wheel and too close to the interests of big business and the banks, which have caused so much difficulty and brought ruin to the economy.  As a result, there was of course a demand for change in order that the people would feel the political system was better fit for purpose and more accountable to them.  However, the Minister&rsquo;s changes do not make the system more accountable and nor do they make it more fit for purpose.  If anything, they bring the system further away from the people.  It follows in the same vein as most of the rest of the Government&rsquo;s supposed commitment to political reform such as the reduction in the number of Deputies or the cosmetic moving around of Standing Orders, which in effect are window-dressing.  For the Government, political reform is not about better politics but is just about less politics and fewer politicians.  Such a cynical approach is reprehensible and is not what the people want.<\/p><p>  Certainly, they did not vote for an entire tier of local government to be wiped away, as will happen next summer.  I spent several years on local authorities, namely, on Youghal Town Council since 2004 and on Cork County Council from 2009.  I was very proud to have served as Mayor of Youghal from 2009 to 2010, which was a great honour and privilege for me.  I always have thought the role carried out by town councils is worthwhile even in spite of their reduced responsibilities in recent times.  People feel a great sense of ownership of the town councils.  They are represented by people they know personally, to whom they have access and who, regardless of whether they agree with them personally, they believe can be trusted because they have the best interests of the town at heart.  This is what local democracy is about, namely, local people doing their best to represent their local community.<\/p><p>  The Minister produced his Putting People First document on local government, in which one of the local electoral areas in County Cork has a population of 71,000 people.  There is nothing even remotely local about an electoral area that size and in Britain, there are areas with that population that form parliamentary constituencies.  It is absurd and clearly the reduction in representation will have repercussions for people&rsquo;s sense of ownership of, and access to, the system.  My constituency of Cork East will take a huge hit in respect of local representation and will lose five town councils from the larger towns in east Cork, that is, Fermoy, Youghal, Mallow, Cobh and Midleton.  This will amount to 45 fewer local representatives in my constituency.  As people have become used to dealing with their town councillors and town councils, the change will be serious and frankly, the burden will fall on too few local representatives.  Large parts of the county probably will not have anyone they truly can call local and there may be no elected person from their community representing them.<\/p><p>  Town councils were not perfect, far from it, as I knew well from my own service as a councillor.  While there are many things I would like to have seen done differently, abolition certainly is not the answer.  The Government insists on saying that Ireland has too many councillors and is greatly out of kilter with European norms.  However, this clearly is not the case as aside from Britain, there are very few places in Europe where there is a higher proportion of electors to councillors or local representatives.  Ratios in other countries vary from 1:120 in France to 1:1,200 in Denmark.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, wishes to introduce a ratio of councillors to people of 1:4,830.  This is not truly local and I believe that people, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalised in communities, will suffer from such lack of access to their local representatives.  The ratio is far out of kilter and Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed the ratio should be set at 1:3,936.  This would both allow for better representation and would fit in with an all-Ireland approach, as this is the ratio that has been adopted for the review of public administration in the North.  Clearly, in this time of cross-Border co-operation and alignment, there is a need for this to be taken in to account.<\/p><p>  This Bill is a missed opportunity as there was potential for real reform in this regard.  I take this opportunity to make the point that a significant job performed by local representatives relates to joint policing committees.  The joint policing committees often are closely aligned with town council areas, as is the case in my constituency.<\/p><p>This is a way in which local representatives can have a real input into how garda&iacute; respond to the needs of their local communities.  However, there is no basis in primary legislation for the committees.  Has the Minister ever considered putting in place such a legislative basis?  I ask him to ensure that all committees are properly answerable to the public.  <\/p><p> In addition, there are numerous ways in which the system of local government needs to be improved.  In the first instance, far too many powers have gradually been taken from councils and transferred to central government, in particular, those related to functions planning, housing, transport, roads, waste management and now water services.  The Minister&rsquo;s Bill, for all his talk, does not even remotely reverse that agenda.  His Putting People First document was a masterclass in bluff and bluster.  It is elegantly worded and well presented but totally lacking in any substance, and I believe this was noted by the Council of Europe which recognised the lack of substance.<\/p><p> Real reform would mean more powers being decentralised from national Government to local level.  Real reform would mean that local communities would be properly represented.  Real reform would mean that the powers which reside with the councils are in the hands of the elected representatives, rather than the officials.  This is an important point with which anyone who has served on local authorities would be familiar.<\/p><p> We have seen a significant deal of centralising of power in the hands of the county manager and his or her officials.  Our councillors are under-resourced and face a tough battle in taking on county and city managers with the resources and staff that a manager has at his or her disposal.  This point is not considered often enough.  The county manager very often gets his or her way because information can often be power.  That needs to be tackled.  <\/p><p> The Minister has failed entirely to tackle that and instead of doing so and giving local government a meaningful role in our political system, he has decided to simply go for the short-sighted approach of cutting numbers.  The Government has recently recognised that this approach does not work in the public sector, as it has belatedly decided to take on new teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; which were badly needed.  It will soon learn that it will not work with local government either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300040#OO00500","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382543400,"counter":889,"content":"<p>Like most of the so-called reform produced by this Government, the Bill is a missed opportunity to bring about real change to how local authorities operate in order to improve their ability to respond to the needs of their areas.  My main focus in this regard is housing.  I am tired of reiterating the stark figures around housing demand and the shortfall of supply in this State but it must be said again and again until people are willing to really listen and to start to address the issue.  There are 112,000 or so people on the housing waiting lists across this State.  A large percentage of those people are centred around the major urban bases of population such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other cities but there is strong demand for social housing across the State in every local authority.  It is likely that every Member of this House is inundated with issues relating to housing need.<\/p><p>  There are nearly 100,000 people in receipt of rent supplement and roughly 30,000 participate in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, in this State.  This costs the State more than &euro;0.5 billion euro a year.  That money is given to private landlords, some of whom provide substandard accommodation at exorbitant prices and with little or no management.  The Government's solution to this issue is not to fund or encourage local authorities to provide this basic need of people but to throw money at the private market in the hope it will solve the problem or at least that people will forget that housing was ever a responsibility of the State at local or national level.<\/p><p>  The reality is that for local authorities housing can and should be an integral part of the services they provide.  It is also possible that with proper application of an ethos of public housing this could be made to pay for itself by a mixture of people renting from low, middle and higher income brackets as is seen in other countries.  Differential rents provide the potential for affordable rates at all levels, while still meeting costs.<\/p><p>  One proposal that Sinn F&eacute;in puts forward, along with noted academics in the field of housing, is the idea of allowing local authorities to set up housing trusts to commence a State\u00adwide building programme. This would ensure power is devolved to local level and homes would be built to meet the needs of the 112,000 on the housing waiting lists.  It would also tackle many problems that have been pointed out in terms of sourcing funds to build social housing.  Money borrowed by these trusts would not be added to the national debt.  Housing can be shown to be a worthwhile investment outside of the damaging public private partnership, PPP, model which prioritises profit over real social value.  There has never been a better time to make this investment.<\/p><p>  The real problem in terms of housing though is political will.  This Government does not want powerful, democratic local authorities any more than it wants to take on any responsibility for housing people.  If it had massive funds at its disposal it would not be inclined towards social housing investment.  Local authorities know the needs of the people in their areas and are less ideologically driven against public housing provision than are the Government and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>  Reform is needed to improve local authorities in terms of providing housing for people.  To ensure councils are fully held to account, Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that local authorities should be held to account by the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Adequate resources should be provided for inspections to include local authority housing.<\/p><p>  Those on the housing lists should be able to access all relevant information on their application on the Internet using a personalised code.  Local authorities who fail to draw down appropriate funds such as in the case recently of Traveller accommodation funding should be sanctioned for this.  Those measures would enhance the potential for local authorities to be first-rate providers of housing.  It is already the case that local authorities are accountable to the public in a way that voluntary housing associations are not.  Councils meet on a monthly basis.  It is open to  members of the public to attend those meetings and to have issues raised though their councillors.  This is not the case for the voluntary housing sector.  <\/p><p>  The voluntary sector does excellent and crucial work but it cannot solve the crisis in social housing in the way that local authorities can.  Despite a cut of &euro;620 million from social housing since 2010 and a cut of &euro;15 million from local authority housing in this budget, local authorities still provide the bulk of social housing.  With a funding allocation of &euro;70 million in 2014, they will provide housing and services for many thousands of people across the State.  This cannot be ignored and the potential for local authorities to house people well and in larger numbers is clear from the work they do every day.<\/p><p>  It is a shame local authorities will not continue to deliver water services and that this change has resulted in the removal of the resources and the manpower by the Minister with the setting up of Irish Water.  This is a diminution of the role of local authorities.  The transfer of responsibility to local authorities for dealing with rental supplement in the near future is welcome but what resources will be provided?  The Minister needs to make that clear.  It always made sense for the local authorities to deal with the bulk of housing issues and enhancing that position.  I served for 12 years on the Dublin City Council and the managers had far too much power and could override the decisions of councillors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300041#PP00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1382543400,"counter":890,"content":"<p>This Bill is not about local government reform, it is a culling of councils and of councillors and a window-dressing exercise to pretend that more powers are being given to the councils, which is not the case.  At the turn of the century the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government held a referendum to recognise local government in the Constitution for the first time while at the same time taking more powers away from democratically elected councils.  This Bill carries out a similar exercise dressed up as a reform.  It is the same old centralisation of power in the Custom House.  No one is arguing that current structures of local government should be left untouched - far from it.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have long argued for local government restructuring and for real reform through the empowerment of local democracy but this Bill is not about democratic empowerment, it is about numbers.  The Minister's approach is both crude and simplistic, reducing the number of councils and the number of councillors and claiming that local government will be reformed.  That is never the case.  We reject the proposal to cull the number of councillors to 949.  This is a very significant decrease and leaves this State with one of the lowest number of councillors per head of population of any of the OECD countries.  We propose that there should be a minimum, and I emphasise a minimum of 1,165 councillors.  This is in line with the reform of public administration in the Six Counties.<\/p><p>Clearly, there needs to be a realignment in terms of the size and composition of councils.  For example, there are large towns with no councils while far smaller towns for historic reasons, and I emphasise to their credit, do have councils.  This also needs to be addressed, but the approach of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is not realignment and better representation; it is to wield the axe and abolish town councils.<\/p><p> In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan we will see a significant loss of local elected voices.  Across the constituency we will see the demise of a total of eight town councils that are made up of nine members each.  That is a phenomenal impact.  Eight multiplied by nine is 72 and when the further cull of nine county councillors across the two county council constituency of Cavan and Monaghan is added, we are losing a total of 81, and a Deputy to boot come the next general election.  That is a loss of 82 elected voices across that constituency.  The consequence of all of that is that access to elected representatives will suffer.  Accountability of local authorities, State agencies and Government itself will suffer, and the democratic process will suffer with fewer people directly involved.  The Minister should make no mistake about it.  The loss of those 81 council seats is the loss of 81 people directly involved in political life in her party, in Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and Independent voices together representing the various strands of opinion within our respective communities.  The by-product of all of that is not only the loss of their likely direct involvement in political life but all of those who would and have come with them in terms of family support, friends' support and others attracted because of their friendship, knowledge and involvement with that individual councillor or candidate - a much greater number again.  Political life and the democratic process will undoubtedly suffer significantly as a result.  <\/p><p> That said, far more important than the number of councils and councillors is the empowerment of local democracy.  We have the least empowered local government and the most centralised State in Europe.  Power after power has been taken away from democratically elected councillors and we in Sinn F&eacute;in want to see maximum power devolved from central Government to local authorities.  These powers include economic planning, waste management, water and sewage and housing.  Any reform of local government must ensure the efficient and cost-effective delivery of services, of structures fit for purpose and of democratic accountability at its core.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Hogan's so-called reforms come side by side with more cuts to local government funding imposed in budget 2014.  The cuts to the local authority housing budget, surely of great concern to the Minister of State present, are especially regressive given the dire shortage of social and affordable housing and the growing levels of homelessness.  This is the real substance of local government service delivery and it is being savagely cut by this Minister and by his Cabinet colleagues.  <\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in would establish local district councils.  We would put in place local authority housing trusts to commence a State-wide building programme and develop economic spatial plans.  This would ensure power is devolved to the local level, that homes would be built to meet the needs of the 112,000 on the housing waiting lists, and that councils could plan for economic development that would benefit the entire community.<\/p><p> I believe that while there will be sympathy for the Minister's approach among some in the media and indeed some in wider society, there has been a huge demand for less and less in terms of people involved in political life.  The overwhelming number of these who will go have given that service for no personal return.  They have given it out of a sense of wanting to contribute to the betterment of where they live.  That has not been tested fully and properly and we will all be losers as a consequence.  It will certainly occur after a short time to those who have clamoured for it because they will realise very soon after the error of their choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300041#PP00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382544000,"counter":892,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Kevin Humphreys who I believe is sharing time with Deputy Tom Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300042#QQ00200","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speech","time":1382544000,"counter":893,"content":"<p>I am, ten minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300042#QQ00300","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1382544000,"counter":894,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It is long overdue.  I would have gone much further but it is a start.  The reorganisation that is taking place and the streamlining into municipal districts will prove to be a success.  There is some fear of that but when we see the way local area committees work in urban areas, I believe these municipal districts in local town areas will work very well.<\/p><p>  I welcome that the Bill devolves responsibility for the preparation of the municipal budgets.  That is very important because the true power is controlling the budget.  I am a little concerned about the manner in which the county or city budgets will be formed and the influence the new chief executive will have.  The budget must be prepared at the direction of the elected councils, and I ask the Minister to look at that aspect of the legislation.<\/p><p>  I am disappointed that these structures will not be delivered in Dublin for at least seven years.  I welcome the setting up of a working group chaired by Fr. Sean Healy to work on how we can connect citizens into the decision making process at local government.  That announcement by the Minister last night is very worthwhile and I believe it will prove to be a success.<\/p><p>  The most important powers councillors will gain is the way they can vary the local property tax up or down.  That is a real power because they have to make monetary decisions and it will be up to local politicians to take on that power.  Those against the property tax have never outlined fully how they would fund local government while giving councillors fiscal powers.<\/p><p>  There is one area, however, about which I am very disappointed, namely, the decision not to introduce in 2014 the retention of the 80% of property tax revenue in local authorities where it is sourced.  That was a key promise made to people when it was brought in last year.  The Minister announced in his Budget Statement on Wednesday, 16 October that the 80% will not be retained at source until 2015.  However, as late as 19 September it was Department policy as indicated in a response to a parliamentary question which stated that 80% retention would come into force in 2014; I can supply that parliamentary question to the Minister.  The Minister needs to review that.  <\/p><p>  Many changes have taken place in local authorities in terms of mergers but it would be a down payment on the commitment to reform.  I would point out that those type of changes are not happening within the greater Dublin area, and the vast majority of property tax is being collected in the greater Dublin area.  That is crucial if the local property tax is to have any credibility.<\/p><p>  The Dublin local authorities are not changing and therefore there is no administrative reason the people of Dublin should not receive into their councils the 80% of the property tax collected in their areas in 2014.  There is no logical reason the local authorities in the greater Dublin area, or in Galway, cannot receive the local property tax take next year.  The Minister said there is a number of reasons for that, including Tipperary councils coming together or the other reforms that are happening outside urban areas, but this is not happening in Dublin.  The property tax take is enormous in Dublin.  A commitment was given that it would be paid to the local authorities in 2014 but from what we heard in the Budget Statement and from the Minister, Deputy Hogan, that will not happen.  I ask for that to be reviewed and rectified.<\/p><p>  Another interesting aspect of the Bill is the amount of power the Minister will retain or exercise over the way local government functions.  I will deal with a number of sections.  Under section 35, councillors would have a very strong role in the appointment of community development boards and the power of approval.  That power should not be with the manager or CEO, as he or she is called.  I ask the Minister to amend section 35 and enhance the powers of the councillors in that area.<\/p><p>  On the appointment of a chief executive manager in Part 7, I welcome the power of veto by local councillors over the appointment of the manager.  It will take brave councillors to exercise it.<\/p><p>It is important councillors have a veto in appointing new managers as it will pay dividends in the long run.  However, we will need strong and brave councillors to do that.  I would like to see the powers of councillors to hold the chief executive officer to account strengthened, with specific powers of enforcement over policy decisions.  Something more than a report, which the legislation states, is needed.  I also welcome the changes to the planning powers under section 140 as a result of what came out of the tribunals.<\/p><p> I am a Dublin Deputy and, like Deputy Ellis, I spent many years on Dublin City Council.  This legislation says that Dublin can wait.  We will not get a plebiscite until the local elections and if the people decide to have an elected mayor, we have been promised legislation two years later but we will not have a directly elected mayor for the greater Dublin area until the following local elections.  We will not see real change in our capital city for seven years, which is too long.  It is not only too long for Dublin but for the country.  <\/p><p> Dublin is not in competition with the rest of Ireland but is in competition with cities like Paris, London, Birmingham and Madrid for foreign direct investment.  We need a strong champion to champion the needs of Dublin people and to deliver jobs to the Dublin area.  If we get that leadership, or that figurehead, we can attract foreign direct investment to the Dublin region, which will increase the taxation take and will help many parts of Ireland.<\/p><p> We need to move away from this anti-Dublin attitude, which arises in this House at times but which is certainly prevalent around the country.  Like it or not, the greater Dublin area stretches from Arklow to Drogheda and out to Mullingar and Portlaoise.  It is the only large city on this island.  When major foreign companies decide where to locate their corporate headquarters, they look at our large urban areas.  <\/p><p> We need reform in Dublin and a mayor of the greater Dublin area.  We need him or her to champion Dublin and to attract investment, which would benefit the whole country.  As this legislation is framed, one is asking Dublin to wait for seven years.  It is always said Labour must wait but Dublin and Ireland cannot wait.  Dublin is our only major city and this is an opportunity to sell our capital city for foreign direct investment, more jobs, more income and more taxation, which will take us out of this recession.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to talk to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, about accelerating the speed of change for Dublin.  This needs to be done now and not in seven years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300042#QQ00500","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382544600,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is not before time and puts a structure on local governance.  Like many others in this House, I spent a period of time on a local council and it was quite enlightening.  The amalgamation of the city and county councils of Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford should be extended possibly to my own county of Cork.  There are so many connections between the city and county council, it does not seem practical to have two separate authorities.<\/p><p>  I welcome the establishment of the economic development special policy committees to support business.  This really is a change because much of the criticism of local authorities was that they had no business acumen at all.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, are to be established and they will draw and build on the success of the county enterprise board model which supports up to 33,000 throughout the country, 900 projects per annum and approximately 25,000 training participants.  For the first time, the LEOs will bring together, in a structured and coherent manner, the skills expertise and resources of Enterprise Ireland, the county and city enterprise boards and the local authorities for micro and small business.  This is a real challenge and I hope it will work.  Small business people like myself require local help rather than hindrance.  <\/p><p>  Many of us have reservations about the abolition of town councils.  There is a challenge here because there are towns, such as Mitchelstown in my constituency, which never had a town council.  One could argue that Mitchelstown should have had one, that it was at a disadvantage by not having one and that population changes occurred along the way.  However, this is a challenge not only for the local representatives but also for communities.  When selecting and voting for candidates, people will have to figure out whether they will get representation in their areas.  <\/p><p>  Something about which I feel strongly and which is a little controversial is that we should pay councillors a proper wage, especially as we will have a lower number.  The situation is haphazard currently.  Most councillors must hold down a day job if they want to survive because they are currently paid approximately &euro;17,00 per year.  If this is the principal and only income coming into the household, it would seem the councillor would qualify for family income supplement.  If one has two children, the FIS threshold is &euro;602 per week but the councillor's income is only &euro;326 per week.   This is not good enough.  I know everybody gives out about the pay of politicians but we need to recognise these people will be doing a very important job.  As much as people want to serve their country, they must survive as well.  <\/p><p>  I remember from my time on the council that one was snowed under by meetings and one went from one meeting to another.  Sometimes there is so much going on that it is very hard to get around to the office, or the executive, side of the work.  If these councillors have a huge workload, they should get office assistance.  I am not sure how much is available.  It is fine to go to meetings but one must follow up on them and that takes the time and the skills of a secretarial assistant.  If most Deputies lost their personal assistants and secretaries, one can imagine the conundrum they would face.  Perhaps there should be a sharing of resources between councillors and Deputies and possibly the specialisation of councillors.  We need to balance the resources given to the executive with those being given to councillors.  <\/p><p>  When committees are being formed, account should be given to one's skills and not how long one has been a councillor.  There is no point leaving new councillors off committees for which they are imminently qualified and putting people who have been councillors longer on them.  Time does not always educate.  Another issue is training for committees.  If people get on to committees, they should be trained.  A few years ago, there was a big skit about councillors getting training on how to use Facebook.  That was not such a bad idea because the social media is becoming incredibly powerful and we need to know about these things.  <\/p><p>  We need to educate councillors but, more importantly, we need to educate councillors in the areas in which they will make decisions.  I sat for a while on an audit committee.  I heard one of the Opposition parties give out about how local government will not function but I was the only council member on that audit committee for a year and a half because the other member decided not turn up at all.  One cannot have it both ways.  One cannot complain and then not have councillors sit on an audit committee which is engaged in oversight.  Section 54(3)(a) refers to membership.  If somebody cannot turn up, he or she should nominate a substitute in his or her place so that there is proper oversight in the audit sections.<\/p><p>It has also been provided for that one will cease to be a member of the national oversight and audit committee if one does not attend six meetings.  The audit situation, which is important, can be overlooked at times.  Now is an important time to look at it.<\/p><p> We need to look more closely at the reserved and executive functions of councils.  There may have been a tendency for the executive to railroad certain items.  There was a breakdown when this happened.  Councillors were sometimes, perhaps wrongly, seen to be getting in the way.  I must admit I was particularly annoyed at times when certain items were railroaded through under the guise of health and safety.  It was not good enough.  When we put people in charge of the new councils, it is important for the new members to receive sufficient recognition.  In an ideal world, there would be mutual respect between the two groups.  This needs to be monitored really closely.<\/p><p> I accept that until now, the only time councillors had much of a say was when budgets and development plans were being agreed.  I remember getting a budget document late in the day.  I read through it as best I could.  I found it difficult to get through all of it.  The members of the council did not receive the assistance of an on-site accountant.  We were unlucky at the time because none of the members was an accountant.  This played into the hands of the executive that was pushing the budget through.  We had to take the budget on trust.  We need to empower our councillors properly by giving them the correct information and making sure they have the staff they need at their fingertips.  This is necessary to ensure the decisions made on behalf of the public are in the public interest.  It is a basic requirement.<\/p><p> While I accept that these changes present a challenge, I welcome the emphasis on the reform of local government.  I am glad the need to help local business has finally been recognised.  The local enterprise offices will have great potential if they are managed properly.  I am sure there will be problems and failings along the way.  If we get this right, small businesses will be able to create an enormous number of jobs throughout the country.  Many schemes, such as the internship programme and the JobsPlus scheme, have resulted from the jobs initiative.  One of our biggest issues is that we are not communicating all the new incentives that are out there.  Many people involved in small business have told me they did not avail of certain schemes because they did not realise they were available.<\/p><p> It is incumbent on us to try to make local councils welcoming places for those who want to start or expand businesses and are looking for help.  Proper assistance needs to be available.  Up to now, many people involved in business have felt they will be fine as long as the council stays away from them.  That is not the way forward.  I welcome this Bill.  I look forward to seeing it in action after it has been passed.  It is a major step in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300043#RR00200","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382545200,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath and John Halligan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300044#SS00200","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1382545200,"counter":900,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Everybody knows we have one of the most centralised systems of governance in Europe, if not the world.  We will not be much better off in that respect after this much-discussed Bill has been passed.  It will not reverse the trend of stripping assets and decision-making from local authorities.  It will probably accelerate that process by abolishing town and borough councils.  I imagine that the idea of axing councils and reducing the number of councillors, thereby striking a better balance between the population of this country and the number of councillors nationally, would be viewed as a popular vote-getting measure.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, seems to have peddled it in that way.  I think it would appeal to most people because they believe councillors are useless and do nothing.  Having spent 13 years as a councillor, I do not believe councillors do nothing, although a few of them might be useless.  We do not have time for that aspect of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300044#SS00400","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1382545200,"counter":902,"content":"<p>What about Damien O'Farrell?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300044#SS00500","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1382545200,"counter":903,"content":"<p>The problem is not that they do nothing - it is what they do and what they are allowed to do.  It was ludicrous for the Deputy who spoke before me to argue that councillors should be paid a full-time wage, while at the same time making the case for a system that has stripped away the decision-making powers of councillors.  In my experience, many councillors spend their time annoying council officials by looking for information that is in the public domain anyway.  Rather than participating in governance and decision-making, they look for letters to promote themselves.  The nub of this issue is that local councillors are not empowered to make decisions on small or large items, which means that the public is similarly disenfranchised.<\/p><p>  I will mention a simple example of the problem I am talking about.  When the county manager and the officials in Fingal County Council were grappling with a large number of retiring librarians in the context of the recruitment embargo and the opening of a new library, they decided to axe library hours at lunchtime and in the evenings at a number of libraries.  The councillors and the public were up in arms - motions were passed unanimously at council meetings - but the cuts went ahead nonetheless.  That example has been repeated in every county regarding many other issues.  Powers were removed from councillors to disenfranchise the public.<\/p><p>  When I listened to the debates that took place in advance of the recent Seanad referendum, I found it ironic to hear Michael McDowell casting himself as a great liberator and defender of democracy as part of the campaign to maintain the elitist Seanad.  He was a member of the Cabinet that ensured decision-making powers were removed from councillors, one after the other.  He showed some neck, given that his Government removed from councillors the power to set or levy council rents, water charges or bin charges or to locate landfills or sewerage plants in certain areas.  The only power that councillors still have is the power to make decisions on development plans and zoning matters.  Even then, their hands are tied in many instances by the regulations and guidelines set by the Government at national level.  If the Government was really serious about local authority reform, Deputies would be asked to consider more than a simple mathematical sum that will reduce the number of councillors.  We would be asked to consider the delegation of power and to examine how councils are funded.  The Bill does not do those things.<\/p><p>  I have a serious problem with town councils as they stand.  I do not mean any disrespect to any town council members when I say there is no question about the fact that they are an absolute joke.  They are talking shops because they have no powers.  There are based in certain areas but not in others without there being rhyme or reason to it.  There are many town councils in areas outside Dublin, but there is just one town council in the Fingal County Council area.  The area controlled by the town council in question is confined to the old part of Balbriggan, based on historic boundaries, which means all of the new population could not vote in town council elections.  I would certainly be surprised if anybody tried to defend town councils are they currently constituted.<\/p><p>  People at local level must be empowered through the empowerment of local councils.  The best decisions are those made locally by those who live in the relevant area and who know what is best for it.  If one takes a trip to any part of Europe, one will see that such an approach is being implemented and is working incredibly effectively.  We are taking the opposite approach by moving in the direction of outsourcing, privatisation and the removal of powers and assets from local authorities lock, stock and barrel.  We are stripping funding from councils at national level and replacing it with the proceeds of the hated home tax, the implementation of which they are having to grapple with.  The money that is coming from this source will not undo the damage caused by the funding cuts.<\/p><p>  I remind the House that the programme for Government states:<blockquote>We will abolish the position of County Manager and replace it with that of Chief Executive, with a limited range of executive functions.  The primary function of the Chief Executive will be to facilitate the implementation of democratically decided policy.<\/blockquote>That sounds good.  It would be great to strip power from county managers, but that will not happen under the Bill.<\/p><p>Under section 49, amendment to chapter 2 of part 14 (4) of the principal Act, &quot;Any function which immediately before the date of the commencement of <i>section 49<\/i>of the <i>Local Government Act 2013<\/i> ... shall, on and from that date, continue to ... be a function of the chief executive.&quot;.  In other words, no change.  We change the name of the county manager to chief executive but all of the decision-making rests with central government with the county and city managers and unelected quangos.  That is not reform that is the continuation and acceleration of an undemocratic process.  This is not even window-dressing, it is an insult and a serious lost opportunity.  I am completely opposed to it as being nothing positive whatsoever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300044#SS00600","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382545800,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the Local Government Bill 2013.  At the last election all candidates whether independents or from political parties promised reform and change.  We need to stick to that agenda if we are ever to change anything this country.  I fully agree with aspects of this legislation and I will deal with these later.<\/p><p>  I also have concerns about democracy and our people's respect for democratic values in this country.  Our people are calling for quality and efficient local government.  Reform involves accountability, transparency and good quality local government.  It should not, however, use this as a front to bash or damage the integrity of democratic politics.  It is trendy in some quarters to slag off politicians and politics in general and lately, even local councillors.  The recent referendum on the Seanad was a case in point.  The so-called &quot;Yes&quot; campaign left a lot to be desired.  The argument for fewer politicians and the misleading figure of &euro;20 million saved in the cost of the Seanad, have damaged politics and democracy.  We can all whinge about Deputies, Senators and councillors but if there is a fairer and better way, call me and let me know about it.<\/p><p>  I was a councillor in Dublin City Council and enjoyed my stint in City Hall, working at local and community level.  I commend and thank the majority of councillors for their dedication, commitment and duty to public service.  Most try to do their best for their local communities.  Any corrupt councillors should be driven out of politics or be locked up.  This legislation should attend to and support the silent majority.  That is why I want to make sure that their voices are heard in this debate.  Abolishing them or telling them to get lost is not good for local democracy, it distances people further from local politicians.  This worries me because already, 30% to 40% of people are disconnected or are not engaged with politicians and democratic politics.  In my area, Dublin Bay North, there is usually a good turnout, in the region of 65%.  That was the case even in the recent referendum.  While many think that 65% is a good turnout, I have major concerns that 30% to 35% in my constituency either stay at home or do not vote.  I worry about this from a democratic point of view, particularly for those in the poorest and most disadvantaged areas.<\/p><p>  Overall, the legislation deals with reform.  I welcome that aspect of the Bill.  The Bill provides the necessary legislative basis to give effect to many of the reform measures set out by the Government.  It contains 65 sections in 10 Parts and five Shedules.  Its detail includes reorganisation of the structure of local government at county, sub county and regional levels, involving the merger of six city and county councils into three and the dissolution of all 80 town councils.  It also puts in place a comprehensive modern system of municipal governance with an integrated county and sub-county organisation and appropriate reserved functions and powers assigned to elected members at county and district levels, and appropriate financial arrangements.  The revised council membership is in line with the local areas drawn up in May 2013.  There is wider provision for devolution of functions from central to local government.  These are all positive steps and I welcome them.  It is very easy to be critical when you are in opposition but when change is happening we must look at the serious options on the table and say &quot;Yes&quot;.<\/p><p>  I warmly welcome the provision for community and local development, including the establishment of local community development committees within the local government system and dissolution of the county development boards.  This has huge potential for the future.  I also welcome the provision for a plebiscite on the possible establishment of the office of the directly elected mayor for the Dublin metropolitan area and related governance options because it gives the people of Dublin city and Dublin county the opportunity to consider different options.  Having considered the detail I am going for option one, the directly elected Lord Mayor with a cabinet.  Let him or her serve five or six years, do the business and then be accountable to the people of Dublin.  That section involves accountability, transparency and efficiency.  Above all, it means that if the candidate does not deliver after five years he or she can be booted out by the people.  That is what democracy is all about.<\/p><p>  The legislation contains amendments, repeals and recommendations arising from the reorganisation of local government structures.  The post of manager will be replaced by that of chief executive, providing a statutory expression of the duty of the chief executive to assist in the formation of policy by the elected council to comply with the council's policy.  That is another positive aspect of the Bill.<\/p><p>  I have concerns about section 23, which provides for the dissolution of town councils.  I have a problem with this because I believe it is important to listen to town councillors.  I have many friends who have served on local town councils and have done excellent work.  Many members of this House served on town councils.<\/p><p>  Part 6 deals with the alignment of the local community development sector with local governance.  Section 128B in the new chapter 2, amending the principal Act, provides for the function of the local government development bodies.  That is a positive statement.  Section 128F(1) in the same chapter, provides that the Minister can make regulations for the purpose of the chapter generally, in respect of local development committees and may issue general policy guidelines with which the committees must comply.  That is a strong section.<\/p><p>  I have concerns about aspects of this legislation, particularly town councils but overall I welcome it because we were elected on a platform of reform and change.  Damage was done over the past six or seven years.  Now those of us who have the honour to have been elected and have another chance must come forward in support of reform.  The positive elements of this legislation should be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300045#TT00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1382545800,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I have argued from the outset that the sweeping reduction in the number of elected representatives as set out in the Bill has the potential to create a damaging distance between voters and local government.  Having served as a councillor for many years I know all too well the importance people place on knowing an elected representative in their community and on having personal contact with that representative.  At a time when it should be promoting and developing active citizenship the Government is instead putting in place a policy that will further detach many citizens from the elected representatives.  I have read the Bill carefully and I agree with some of its aspects.  It would be naive of me, having been a councillor for 14 years, to say that significant reform is not needed.  I am not saying that every village or main street in the country requires a town council but the fact that large towns, such as Tramore in my own constituency, of Waterford, which has a population of 10,000 are to be left without political representation is a step too far.  The closure of area offices in well-populated rural areas such as Kilmacthomas in County Waterford will undoubtedly cause difficulties particularly for older people.  I am disappointed that as with the campaign to abolish the Seanad, the Government has no interest in proposing reform.<\/p><p>Slash and burn appears to be the order of the day.   <\/p><p> It is incomprehensible that legislation to provide for the election of mayors is not already in place given that the mayor is an important figure in any city and is still elected by a pact system.  I must admit that I was elected through this system.  That is wrong.  The vast majority of people do not accept that and want to be able to vote for their mayors, yet we have not even put in place proper legislation as to when we will elect a mayor in Dublin.  Perhaps I am wrong on this.  Anybody who served on a council will know that the committees were always divvied out depending on the party that had most seats on the council.  That was wrong.  Very competent councillors were excluded because they were not members of the main parties.  I suppose all parties were affected by this depending on whether Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or Labour had the power on the council.  That was fundamentally wrong.  I always found that the committees that were money-spinners inevitably went to people on the pact who were in Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or Labour.  That was wrong.  Even the budgets were entirely economically controlled.  One would say they were not but they were controlled apart from car parking charges and small issues.  They were almost entirely controlled by the central government.  I am disappointed that there is no reform along those lines.<\/p><p> It is being claimed that the changes proposed in this Bill will allow for savings of between &euro;40 million and &euro;45 million.  That is overly simplistic.  It is an assumption that larger local authorities serving larger populations will automatically be cost-effective.  That has not been the case across Europe.  If one studies Europe and even town councils in the US and Canada, one can see that this is not the case.  A large body of research suggests that there is a weak link between size and efficiency in local authority mergers with little or no effect on savings in most services.  One can get these statistics anywhere one likes.  Extensive international research on local authority amalgamations suggests that one-off transitional costs can hugely limit the potential savings that may arise from mergers.  Again, these are all studies that have been carried out in central Europe.  In particular, we should look at the system in France.  I accept that there are certain areas where economics of scale may exist such as sharing IT and back office services but surely a shared service arrangement would have been a more practical solution.  <\/p><p> I would have liked far more time in which to speak but I would like the Minister to clarify why these costs are still not available.  We are told that the Waterford city manager has estimated that it will be an up-front cost of about &euro;2 million excluding the cost to the State of staff members who are made redundant as a result of the merger.  The question of whether the savings will outweigh the costs has not been answered adequately.  This question needs to be answered.  We certainly have not been told what improvements to services will come about as a result of mergers.

This has the effect of reducing the overall number of councillors in the State from 1,627 to 949 while increasing the number of county councillors from 883 to 949.  Section 15 sets out the number of seats for local electoral areas in each local authority.  It provides that the Minister may, by order, disband regional authorities and replace them with regional assemblies composed of existing councillors.  The immediate impact of the structural changes are that 31 city and county councils will replace 34 county councils and 80 town councils and that there will be a district level tier to cover the full territory of the State bar Dublin.  There is a significant reduction in representation for the 14% of the population who live in areas with town councils.  On the other hand, in places which had no town councils, the effect of creating municipal districts whose councils together act on behalf of the district would seem to improve the quality of representation.  The effect of the changes on the quality of representation depends very much on how the municipal districts function and on the extent of their autonomy and power.  The Bill sets aside specific functions which are to be performed at the district level, including that the district members contribute to the drafting of the district budget and the annual schedule of works for the municipal district and may amend the chief executive's final draft of both.  The county council may, by resolution, delegate other tasks to the district level.  However, the county council is legally responsible for decisions taken at the municipal level.  The municipal district is not a separate legal entity but a formation of the council.<\/p><p>  As part of a policy to enhance the role of elected councillors in local government, the position of county manager is replaced by that of chief executive who has more statutory obligations toward elected members.  The chief executive remains a central Government appointee appointed by the Public Appointments Service and subsequently by a formal resolution of the council.  The Bill gives the local council the power to veto such an appointment after which the recruitment process begins again.  The Bill restricts the power of local councils to use section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 in respect of planning.  It provides that each of the 31 councils will establish a strategic policy committee on social and economic development to function as other strategic policy committees as per the Local Government Act 2001.  It dissolves county and city development boards and provides that all councils will have local community development committees.  The policy objective is to align local community and economic development with local government.  <\/p><p>  On 16 October 2012, the Government published an action programme for effective local government entitled Putting People First as part of its commitment in the programme for Government to reform local government.  The action programme outlined a range of possible reforms to local government before presenting the reforms which the Government is to implement under four categories: reform of structure; reforms of funding, accountability and government arrangement, including balance of power between the Executive and elected council; local government involvement in economic development and job creation; and reforms to ensure efficiency in service delivery.  An independent boundary committee established by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in November 2012 in accordance with the 2001 Act made recommendations for the division of each county council area into local electoral areas and on the number of councils seats to be assigned to each local electoral area.  The committee was asked to make its recommendations in the policy context set out in the action programme and to be cognisant that as far as possible, the local electoral areas were to coincide with the new municipal districts.  Its terms of reference also required that it improve balance and consistency in representational status throughout the county and take into account the location of towns and their hinterland in the creation of new local electoral areas and that each municipal district will constitute a single electoral area with a membership of between six and ten councillors except in exceptional circumstances.  <\/p><p>  There are four local authorities in Louth - Louth County Council, Dundalk Town Council, Drogheda Borough Council and Ardee Town Council.  There are 47 elected councillors representing the four elected councils in 11 electoral areas.  That will change to 29 elected councillors covering four electoral areas - two six-seaters, one seven-seater and one ten-seater.  The reforms introduced by the Bill will result in gratuity payments for town, city and county councillors for losing their seats.  Under current rules, following the replacement of town councils with a system of municipal districts, members who do not go to be re-elected to city or county councils will be entitled to pay-outs for losing their positions.  According to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, amounts are expected to average almost &euro;4,000 for town councillors but exact compensation payments will depend on number of years served and position.  The limit is &euro;16,000 for 20 years' service.  The overall cost of the payout has been estimated at &euro;45 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300046#UU00500","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1382547000,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Local Government Bill 2013, which introduces some of the biggest reforms we will see during the term of this Government.  The abolition of town councils is a positive development.  Rather than being a diminution of local government, as some would suggest, it will empower local government and make it more efficient.  Whereas the number of councillors will be reduced by 600 overall, my county, Kildare, will get a significant increase from 25 to 40 councillors due to the increase in our population.<\/p><p>  I will draw on my experience of being a member of Kildare County Council and, in particular, a member of the Athy area committee from 2009 until the general election in 2011 because I saw at first hand how inefficient the system was.  I was elected to the council with 1,980 votes but, even though the last seat on Athy Town Council was taken with 67 first preference votes, as a member of the area committee I was not allowed to ask any questions regarding planning or housing matters in the Athy Town Council area.  Those in Athy who voted for me were not getting good value because power was not divided equally across the councils.  It has been suggested that towns like Athy and Newbridge will lose representation but it is clear that the municipal areas of these towns are being expanded into parts of the hinterland that were not previously part of the town council.  Residents in Athgarvan and Milltown should be treated no differently to those of Newbridge and the people of Kilkee and Castlemitchell should be treated the same as the residents of Athy.  That is what the municipal areas will do.  The two urban district councils in the county, Naas and Athy, existed for historic reasons but in moving towards a one county authority we should be mindful of the potential for disparities in the rates that businesses pay in these councils.  I understand the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is aware of this issue.<\/p><p>  I was a member of the finance committee of Kildare County Council.  We held interesting meetings in advance of the annual budgets to discuss the issues arising.  I went into my first meeting with excitement at the prospect of influencing the budget only to find out that more than 80% of the budget was non-discretionary.  When I asked what areas of expenditure were discretionary, areas like the fire service, which we obviously were not going to cut, were mentioned.  This meant we ended up with little influence over the budget.  The variation on the local property tax from 2015 onwards, as announced in this Bill, changes that somewhat because we know from the mistakes made in abolishing rates in 1977 that there is an inextricable link between power and money.  If a local authority cannot collect rates it does not have the same amount of power.  Councillors will be more responsible in exercising that power because if, for example, they decide to reduce the property tax rate they will have to defend the reduction in services, whereas if they increase it they will have to be able to point to greater service provision.  That, in turn, will impact on accountability among officials because the local councillor will not be able to blame central government or anybody else for inefficiency.  <\/p><p>  The strengthening of SPCs is welcome and the local enterprise offices will ensure that resources go directly to local businesses.  I commend this Bill to the House as a reforming piece of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300047#VV00100","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1382547000,"counter":913,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Local Government Bill 2013.  We all know that every sector of government, both national and local, must achieve more with fewer resources.  Waste and duplication of services must be eliminated and every penny of taxpayers' money must be spent carefully and effectively.  This Government is committed to reforming local government at all levels.  County and city councils, enterprise boards and local development companies must use funds from central government in a co-ordinated manner to ensure the best delivery of services.  To this end, the Bill sets out major structural reforms.  The number of local authorities will be reduce from 114 to 31 and the number of elected members will decrease from 1,627 to 949.  Each councillor will represent his or constituents and community at municipal district and county council level.  The dual mandate of membership of town council and county council will end.<\/p><p>  The reforms provide for the alignment of the local community development sectors with local government.  Local community development committees will be established to bring strategic co-ordination to the millions of euro spent annually on local and community development initiatives.  Each county will be required to establish an economic development SPC.  The SPC in County Cork has been in operation for a number of years and has engaged business organisations, third level institutions, local development companies and enterprise boards in a co-operative effort to establish new business ventures.  The new economic development SPCs will also provide direct planning oversight and accountability for the new local enterprise offices.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, has emphasised the importance he attaches to local democracy.  Services must be delivered through the democratic structures that are closest to the people and their communities.  To this end, the Bill provides that in future no separate structures for delivering public services will be established outside of local government.  This Bill will strengthen the role of councils and provide platform for their further expansion.  Provision is made in the Bill for the devolution of functions to include those of State bodies generally.  However, with increased power comes increased responsibility.  From 2015, councillors will be able to vary the rate of the local property tax by 15% upwards or downwards.  They will also have control over many other charges and fees.  Citizens will have better engagement with local councillors in regard to how their money is spent and, therefore, will be able to judge how well their council performs compared to other councils.<\/p><p>  The Bill will introduce a new era for local governance.

As a representative of the Connemara local electoral area, I felt the system worked quite well.  Local government is currently overseen by the Local Government Act 2001, which consolidated previous legislation on local government.  The Putting People First document, which was published in October 2012, sets out a well-drafted action plan for effective local government.  It represents a culmination of time, energy and effort invested in designing a more effective system of local government.  It outlines a range of possible reforms in the following four broad strands: reforming structures; reforming funding, accountability and governance; involving local government in economic development and job creation; and maximising the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery.<\/p><p>  The Local Government Bill 2013 builds on these strands to introduce the necessary changes to enhance functions, performance and structures of local authorities, with the overarching aim of providing the highest level of public service.  The localism of our politics and national Parliament is the subject about much debate.  In many ways, this has detracted from our system of local government.  The differing experiences of councillors across the country should be added to this.  It is fair to say that councillors in urban areas can get more attention than their rural counterparts, particular in respect of media attention.  The recent RTE documentary focusing on the constituency work of Deputies demonstrated the close interaction between local citizens and the national Parliament.  It is interesting to note the range of commentary regarding the hands-on approach that Deputies take to politics.  Some commentators have decried the system and argued that the role of Deputies' should be confined to the national stage.  The question arises, however, of how we reconcile the apparently low representation per voter in respect of the number of constituents required to elect an individual to a local authority.  The ratio is much lower in many other countries than in Ireland.  That is not the public perception.<\/p><p> The disparity is compounded by the uneven spread of town councils across the country.  These are historical in nature and reflect a long since changed Ireland.  The electoral area of Connemara in which I was elected in 2004 has a voting population of approximately 30,000, yet it has no town councils.  There was no town council at all in the Galway West constituency, which stretches from Annaghdown to Athenry and Clarinbridge.  Galway city has its own city council.<\/p><p> A further 80 locations have town councils of various sizes and with various powers.  Some have revenue raising powers, in that they can set local rates, but day-to-day functions are by and large enacted by their county-based authorities.<\/p><p> Of particular note is the new chief executive role in the new municipal district category.  The relationship between county managers and elected council members can often provide media outlets with much material.  That county and city managers are appointed by central government and are, in effect, responsible to the Minister are undoubtedly factors.  This can disempower the elected public representatives to a certain degree and sometimes create an unhelpful tension and adversarial atmosphere.  The Bill contains a number of provisions to address these issues, not least by enhancing the policy making role of councillors.  It is appropriate to increase the accountability and obligations of the chief executive and the heads of services to elected councillors.<\/p><p> As the Putting People First document states, municipal districts will be the first level of governance and democratic representation.  The independent boundary committee has declared that each municipal district will constitute a single electoral area with a membership of six to ten councillors and that each county will have three to four such districts.  Section 21 of the Bill inserts a new section in the Local Government Act 2001, outlining the new functions of councillors at municipal district level, including issues pertaining to property, dwellings, monuments, business, trading, the environment, litter, roads, parking, local improvement works and a fund for community works.<\/p><p> I referred to my position as a councillor in the Connemara electoral area.  That system worked well and is the model for the roll-out of municipal areas to the rest of the country.  A municipal area is a confined area, as we were at the time, with seven councillors - increasing to nine - who elect a chairman and run the affairs of that area as best they can.  The councillors with whom I worked and who are still there have been able to perform these functions well.  I am sure they will continue to do so.  I am delighted that this local area model of governance is being enhanced and extended via municipal districts, as the people are the ultimate beneficiaries of such an approach.<\/p><p> The re-alignment of the community sector has raised some concerns, although those have settled down somewhat.  Connemara has bodies such as FORUM in Letterfrack that provide valuable services for their local communities.  These communities believe that any re-alignment or provision of power to local authorities will disempower them because they are more than one hour away from County Buildings in Galway city.  This is a genuine concern, as those bodies provide a good service and people are able to approach them and their workers on the ground with proposals for job creation and various other initiatives.  It is important that this bottom-up approach continue.  The Minister has advocated that it will not change.<\/p><p> I wish to address an issue that has arisen and that will be a focus in terms of councillors' increased powers.  Deputy Heydon also mentioned it.  It is difficult to believe that there are seven fire stations in east Galway whereas there is only one in Clifden, Connemara.  South Connemara's large population has no fire service.  This issue was raised in the council chamber last week, when all councillors were in agreement on the need for such a service.  I can see from the Minister's gestures that he is fully in support of this proposal.  Local councillors must debate this issue.  Within the constraints on the country and their local electorates, councillors must make difficult decisions on what to do with the property tax so as to ensure that necessary and deserved services like a fire station in south Connemara are provided.<\/p><p> I commend the Minister on this reforming Bill.  I am sure the roll-out of the municipal districts will work well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300047#VV00300","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382547600,"counter":916,"content":"<p>Next are Deputies Timmins, Terence Flanagan, Keaveney, Broughan and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, with four minutes per Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300048#WW00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1382547600,"counter":917,"content":"<p>The Minister will hear many contributions on Second Stage.  Most, mine included, will be tailored to our own areas and experiences.  Probably more than any other Deputy, the Minister has experience of local authorities and councillors.  I do not say this lightly.  I commend him on introducing this Bill.  Notwithstanding broad-ranging Second Stage speeches, he knows that how the Bill is handled on Committee Stage will define whether the reform of local government works.  The Bill has many good aspects and there are aspects with which I do not agree for personal and policy reasons.  The Minister will ensure that Committee Stage gets the time it deserves, as this is the first time in 100 years that real reform is being introduced.<\/p><p>  It is good that the Minister does not court publicity or popularity.  In this regard, he is unique in politics.  He does what he believes is right.  I am not patronising him or seeking an amendment to the Bill.  As a political entity, we have continuously handed power to other bodies in recent years because we could not trust ourselves.  What I am about to ask the Minister for will be difficult for him to do.  It is called the postman concept.  At one time, the curate, the public health nurse and the postman knew where everyone in a community was.  Given how often the register has gone wrong, I am an advocate of letting the postman work on the boundary commission.  Notwithstanding the fact that, by and large, the broad sweep is correct, some communities have been divided by electoral boundaries.  I do not know the Kilkenny situation, but two boxes in Thomastown might be in the north Kilkenny district while two might be in the south.  This does not make sense.  The overemphasis on getting the population factor right has divided communities.  I do not know whether the Minister has the remit to revise the boundaries.  It would be unpopular and we could be accused of interfering, but it does not matter to me whether people are placed in this or that district.  Dividing a local electoral district, LED, does not make sense.<\/p><p>  I have mixed views on the membership of the local community development committee.  It is important that councillors are the driving force behind everything, as they are responsible to their local electoral areas.  I am a great advocate of people each having one, two, three or however many jobs, but two people having one job can create difficulties.<\/p><p>  Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy is in charge of the working group on citizen engagement with local government.  The legislation has a shortcoming from the LED down.  As with countries such as France, there can be an unpaid system of forums.  Blessington is a classic example of a non-statutory forum elected by the people.  I will send the details to the Minister's Department.  This forum works.  The town experienced considerable difficulties when new people moved there, with conflicts over developments etc. but the forum was set up and defused everything.  It is working in an harmonious manner.  Currently, it is following up on the issue of the Glending estate, which the Minister knows needs a radical overhaul.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister ensure that area councils where there have been no town councils heretofore will set up offices that are staffed from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., five days per week or whatever?  It should not be the case that a county manager would try to run a north Kilkenny or Castlecomer district from the town hall in Kilkenny.  There should be an office in Castlecomer, Tullaroan etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300048#WW00300","speaker":"1184"},{"type":"speech","time":1382547600,"counter":918,"content":"<p>As a member of the reform alliance, I welcome the Bill.  All steps towards reform are welcome.  The local government system is clearly in urgent need of reform.  The Minister's description of the proposed reforms as the most radical reform of local government in more than a century is true.  He is to be commended in that regard.<\/p><p>I am concerned that we did not move towards a system with more local authorities, such as in France which has a local authority for every 1,500 inhabitants.  In addition, a local mayor is elected in every French town and village.  People there feel that they are part of a community with shared values.  That system has worked very well in France as many Irish people will have seen during visits there over the years.<\/p><p> The Minister will be judged on what differences this Bill will make to customers and consumers.  Will a quality service be provided for all citizens?  Under the new measures councils will have a greater say in local enterprise, jobs and economic development.  <\/p><p> There are many provisions in the Bill but I wish to focus on two areas in particular.  One concerns directly elected city mayors and I welcome that plan for Dublin.  As previous speakers have said, they wish to see someone elected who will have a strong voice and be seen as a figurehead with real power and responsibility.  That is long overdue.  It is a good move, but when does the Minister see this being rolled out?  A previous speaker expressed concern that it may take up to seven years for directly elected mayors to become a practical reality.  Dublin's citizens want to see the city run as efficiently and effectively as possible.  We have seen the great success of directly elected mayors in London who have full executive powers to deal with housing, culture, transport, economic development, regeneration, planning and environmental issues.  <\/p><p> The Bill also gives councils power to increase or decrease property tax by 15%.  It is crucial that citizens should perceive changes within their communities before any property tax increases are introduced.  The Minister is aware of how people feel on the issue, particularly with regard to seeing benefits in their local areas as a consequence of paying such a tax.  People are concerned that local authorities should not see this as a method to grab cash through increasing property tax by 15%.  Residents are also concerned by the length of time it takes to repair roads and footpaths, in addition to other local authority works.<\/p><p> How much will it cost to abolish town councils?  The Bill does not provide for measures to devolve more power to local government from central government.  Perhaps the Minister could address those points in his reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300048#WW00400","speaker":"1182","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382548200,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I wish to acknowledge the work of all local authority staff and thank them for their dedication and commitment to delivering public services in our communities.  Local government reform is one of those topics that can often secure broad agreement across the Chamber, but I have some reservations about the Bill.  Nevertheless, I welcome the fact the Minister has introduced the legislation which, I agree, represents a substantial overhaul of our local government system.<\/p><p>  The Bill encompasses many facets and I will focus on a few specific areas.  Properly functioning local government should represent the first comprehensive link between citizens and the State, but that has not been the citizens' experience since the inception of the State.  I would argue that has been the case, in particular, since the abolition of rates in 1977 by the government of former Taoiseach Jack Lynch.  That move is now understood to have been a policy mistake.  <\/p><p>  While I would quibble about the form in which the recently imposed property tax has been presented to the public, it represents the forging of a powerful link between the people and local government.  Local taxes to fund local government services will only be accepted if they are seen as just.  In addition, such scarce resources must be spent transparently.  <\/p><p>  I will not expand on my objections to the format of delivering the local property tax.  However, I call on the Minister to examine how we can secure accountability.  The Bill's provisions should ensure that every citizen will be given a clear annual statement on how their property tax is spent in that municipal area.  When I canvass in my local community, many people say they are prepared to co-operate but they want to know where that property tax is being spent in their area.<\/p><p>  Municipal councils must have an appropriate spending power so that councillors can work in close co-operation with executives, communities and citizens to determine how those resources are spent.  Such expenditure can only be supported where it is transparent.  When money is spent on behalf of citizens it is important for them to have an annual statement on how such an investment has been made.<\/p><p>  One of the key points of grievance in my county - as I suspect the Minister is well aware - concerns the property charge on people who live in unfinished estates.  The Minister has taken a special interest in that regard.  Many people are rightly unhappy at having to pay a charge while living in such estates and waiting for a developer and the council to sort out legal issues, including outstanding bonds.  I have been working with several residents' groups across east Galway in an effort to resolve this issue.  We need to see far greater activity from central government encouraging our county managers to take up this issue.  To the Galway county manager's credit, this process has been kept well in train to date.  It is, however, essential for all local authorities to address this matter specifically.<\/p><p>  Some previous speakers spoke about the customer's relationship with the local authority.  There is a unique opportunity to underpin the property tax policy by giving a relationship to citizens allowing them to demand customer services from their local authority. <\/p><p>  I will support the Bill and its proposed reforms.  Large tranches of this legislation need to be introduced as soon as possible.  Our citizens expect this type of reform.  This is a unique opportunity and I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought these significant changes before the House in the form of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300049#XX00200","speaker":"1179"},{"type":"speech","time":1382548200,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I join with my colleague Deputy Keaveney in commending the work of all our local government officials around the country.

First, decisions and the decision-makers should be as close as possible to the citizens they affect.  The closer they are, the better the decision.  This is because people are offered an opportunity to become the decision-makers and also ensures decision-makers are accessible to citizens.  This close proximity allows for far better oversight by the citizens.  Conversely, if one distances the decisions from citizens, this has the affect of making the decisions unrepresentative and lacks necessary oversight.  We see this happening all the time when citizens become frustrated and disengage from the political process.<\/p><p>  The second rule is that the deeper the democracy, the better for the quality of the decision.  When one reduces the number of representatives in a democracy, this makes the democracy shallower and reduces the voice of the citizen.  The EU as currently constituted is the great dysfunctional example of this.  This Bill breaks both rules.  It creates a distance between the citizen and the decision and reduces the voice of the decision-maker.<\/p><p>  The wholesale destruction of the town council model is a mistake.  Critical to large cities and towns in the context of spatial development are specific resources and a political centre of gravity.  They need a council.  The absence of a city council in certain areas and town councils in larger towns will create a significant challenge for those areas in competing against larger resource-rich and strategy-rich cities.  The difference is clear in my county.  While there is a town council in Navan, there is none in Ashbourne, which is the second largest town in the county.  Strategic development, resources and funds have historically gone to Navan, with none going to towns such as Ashbourne.<\/p><p>  That money needs to be saved is not contested.

It is important to note that decisions without resources are a nonsense.  Without the resources to implement decisions, councils will be only talking shops.  Local authorities are cash starved.  Funding for the repair of roads in my county has been radically reduced over recent years.  There are currently 3,300 people on the local authority housing list in my area.  Last year, the council there made only three acquisitions in the whole year.  The recently introduced budget identified 500 new local authority housing builds.  This equates to three additional houses in each of the six local electoral areas, LEAs, in Meath.  In the context of a housing waiting list of 3,300, an additional three houses for each of the six LEAs is ridiculous.  On a human level, the local authority crisis in County Meath and other counties is a disaster.<\/p><p>  This type of reform is a sham if the Government continues to reduce necessary budgets.  There is much confusion around the proposed new municipal districts.  Some councillors to whom I have spoken, including from the Fine Gael and Labour parties, believe that the municipal districts will have power, autonomy, headquarters and budgets.  As I understand it, they will not.  Rather, municipal districts, which often will have replaced a town council, will be able to make decisions with a cost implication independent of the remainder of the council and, most importantly, without a budget.  In that scenario, who will make the decision?

The fall-out from the tribunals in regard to planning corruption dominated that period and continued up to recent years.  The drip-drip effect of these tribunals since then has rightly angered the voting and tax-paying public.  It was this anger, coupled with a desire for change and a better way of doing things, that, along with a great deal of persuasion from a local teacher and others, encouraged me in 1999, at 21 years of age, to include my name on the ballot paper for election to Meath County Council and Navan Town Council.  Much of what frustrated me as a young councillor is addressed in this Bill and the overall reforms introduced by the Minister, Deputy Hogan.<\/p><p>  Local government now has its own tax which it can alter as the need arises.  While more should be done in the area of commercial rates, that is an issue for another day.  I know the Minister has plans to tackle that issue.  The establishment of local community development committees will make local government a one-stop-shop for all aspects of community, EU and other funding sources.  This is to be welcomed as it will lead to a much more joined-up and strategic approach to investment in our communities.  The enhancement of the role of local government in enterprise is also to be welcomed.  I hope it will lead to a renewed push for home grown jobs in SMEs, which will be the key to our nation's continued recovery.  I am aware that some business organisations are concerned about how all of this will pan out.  I think this measure is a real positive and an opportunity for local government and local business to work well together.  Up to now, the perception in local government has been that businesses can afford to carry all the costs.  They cannot.  There is a need for a much greater understanding between the two, which can only be good.  This will be the effect of the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  I look forward to seeing how this develops.  It is a positive move that should be welcomed and encouraged, including through the policies of Enterprise Ireland.  The Bill also provides for a greater role for strategic policy committees, SPCs, in the auditing of spending throughout the year.  This is another welcome change that will enhance local government and the role of the local councillor.<\/p><p>  Returning to 1999, while I was elected to Meath County Council, despite needing fewer votes, I was unsuccessful in getting elected to Navan Town Council.  I did not feel at a huge loss in not being elected as a member of that body, in part because a good friend, colleague and mentor, Councillor Jim Holloway, had been elected to both bodies at that time.  We have worked well together since then.  There are many elected representatives in Navan, Kells and Trim, of all parties and none, who have committed their time to represent the people of their respective towns on town councils.  Each must be recognised and thanked for their work and efforts on behalf of their constituents and communities.

If the Taoiseach thinks it is no big deal to take the telephone allowance off the elderly, he obviously does not know exactly what they use the telephone for.  I have had several people contact me about losing this allowance, because it means their pendant alarm will not work anymore.  It was a big enough struggle for people even with those pendant alarms, given that the Government closed down their local Garda station and they do not feel that secure as it is, but it is a real low blow to take away their telephone.  Some people will say that they can use mobile phones or some other form of technology, but the reality is that many elderly people find it very daunting to use a mobile phone.  This means that the Government has cut them off.  As far as I can remember, that is not what Deputy Enda Kenny was promising.<\/p><p>  I notice that Vincent Browne played the clip twice last night of the Taoiseach making that wonderful promise.

It is appalling in the extreme to take away their telephone allowance.  Symbolically as well as practically it is disgusting to take away the bereavement grant, and to remove the subsidies for those who feel forced to take out private health insurance, which will now make it unaffordable and throw those people back into the public health system, from which the Government intends to take &euro;1 billion and which will not be able to cope with the pressures it will face in the coming year.  These cuts mean misery, suffering, cruelty, anxiety and, in some cases, may even lead to unnecessary deaths of people.  That is the reality and it is all the more appalling that it could be done by a Minister and several members of his Government who railed against precisely these measures when they were attempted by the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  How can the Minister look people straight in the face after saying the things he said in 2008?  How can the T&aacute;naiste or the Taoiseach do so, and then do what they are now doing to our pensioners and vulnerable citizens?<\/p><p>  This is appalling and I ask the Minister to pull back from the brink.

However, none of it rings true to people outside, because everybody knows that those moving the motion tonight were the same people who did exactly the same as this Government when they were the Government.  When the Government Members were in the Opposition, they did the same thing.  For many Members in here, it is all a big joke and a charade.  They get up here and they huff and puff, and then life goes on.  The real message is that life does not go on for the people who are suffering from the consequences of the decisions that are being made here.<\/p><p>  Let us park all the waffle and the rhetoric and look at the actions that have been taken.  In presenting this budget, the Government has made a choice to put on the shoulders of the elderly direct cuts equating to about &euro;100 million.  That amount of money is nothing.  The Government has exceeded the budget that the troika asked it to cut.  If the Government had levied a paltry 1% wealth tax on incomes of over &euro;1 million, it would have had five times that amount of money.  If the Government had insisted on the actual rate of corporation tax - one of the lowest in Europe - being the effective rate, it could have raised an extra &euro;2.5 billion.  The Government could have presented a budget that would have given elderly citizens a decent retirement and medical and health security, but it has chosen not to do so, even though the figures are there to back up such a budget.<\/p><p>  Not only will the cuts be devastating, but a number of them are sneaky.  Telephone lines will be cut at a time when people need to ring their grandchildren who have been exiled to Australia.  Under any normal situation, a couple is dealt with as two single people for the purposes of measuring medical card income limits, but they can no longer do that so the Government hits even more people.  The bottom line is that the Government has alternatives and we are here to say it is about time the Government took these alternatives and that we support the grey army in its crusade to secure them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300051#ZZ00700","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1382549400,"counter":943,"content":"<p>Social Justice Ireland lists the cuts over the last six years that have adversely affected older people.  These include cuts to public services, such as home help and community nursing units, reductions in the fuel allowance, abolition of the Christmas bonus, increases in prescription charges, and reductions in the household benefit package.  Budget 2014 has now abolished the telephone allowance, has increased prescription charges and has abolished the bereavement grant.  Mairead Hayes of the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament said that the people who need care and need to be enabled and assisted to care for themselves and others were on the receiving end of the toughest measures in budget 2014.  Here is one women's story:<blockquote>My name is Ellen.  I was born in a tenement room in Summerhill in Dublin, in 1939.  I went to school and grew up and I got a job.  I paid all my rates and taxes and I put a few bob by for the future.  All of a sudden, the future is here.  I am 74 years old.  I am on the State pension, but the prices have gone through the roof.  I cannot afford to live on them.  My savings are almost gone.  I am slowly being driven into poverty.<\/blockquote>There is something seriously wrong with a society that does not value and respect the people who have lived out the majority of their lives.  There is little doubt but that how we care for them and relate to them as older people says a lot about who we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300051#ZZ00800","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1382549400,"counter":944,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment to this Private Members' motion.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the thousands of senior citizens who came to Molesworth Street and Kildare Street yesterday to have their say on these mean spirited cuts that are taking place following this budget.  Unfortunately, this Government will be immune to their voices but it is important that they were here to have their say.<\/p><p>  The motion tonight quotes from the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, to which Ireland signed up in 2002.  Article 14 of that plan states the following:<blockquote>We recognize the need to achieve progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.  We reaffirm that the attainment of the highest possible level of health is a most important worldwide social goal, the realization of which requires action of many other social and economic sectors in addition to the health sector.  We commit ourselves to providing older persons with universal and equal access to health care and services, including physical and mental health services, and we recognize that the growing needs of an ageing population require additional policies, in particular care and treatment, the promotion of healthy lifestyles and supportive environments.  We shall promote independence, accessibility and the empowerment of older persons to participate fully in all aspects of society.<\/blockquote>The previous Government ignored the Madrid plan and this Government is ignoring it as well.

We want a health service that is patient-centred, whether that patient is young or old.  We want a health service that delivers care as close to home as possible in order that older people will be able to live in their homes where they feel safe and comfortable for as long as possible, rather than going into long-stay nursing homes, regardless of how nice they might be.  There is a no substitute for the autonomy people feel in their house.<\/p><p>  We want a safe health service, focused on clinical effectiveness, whereby everyone, including older people, receives safe, timely and efficient care and treatment.  These reforms have delivered.  The numbers of patients waiting on trolleys have been greatly reduced, which benefits everyone, especially older people.  Under the previous Government's reign, patients often spent up to four days on a trolley.  There are still too many people who have to spend time on trolleys and we are working hard to address that.  I thank all the people who work in our health service for the fantastic job they are doing despite dwindling budgets and dwindling staff numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300052#AAA04100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1382550000,"counter":986,"content":"<p>The ones who are left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300052#AAA04200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1382550000,"counter":987,"content":"<p>I am delivering on hospital groups which will enable care to be delivered closer to home in local communities, which will benefit everyone, especially older people.  With the introduction of clinical programmes and the piloting of the model of money following the patient, we are ensuring high quality and safe care in our hospitals for everyone, including older people.<\/p><p>  The ongoing reforms in health and social care will ensure older people receive safe, timely and efficient care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely and efficient as close to home as possible.  As a result, there will be fewer hospital admissions with care closer to home provided in local communities.  This will result in less travelling for older people.  More older people will be able to live in their homes for as long as possible rather than going into long-stay nursing home care.<\/p><p>  We also have the frail elderly clinical programme which allows older people, once their medical problem is resolved, to start on a course of rehabilitation immediately resulting in fewer people having to go into long-term care before their time.  Older people will not be treated differently in the health service just because they are classified as older people.<\/p><p>  Despite the extremely difficult financial situation the country is facing, the Government has worked hard to ensure more than 90% of people aged over 70 continue to have access to free GP care, whether through a medical card or a GP-visit card.  Every person over 70 who relies solely on the State pension continues to qualify for a medical card.  Indeed many pensioners of this age who also have private income will continue to qualify.  Those who do not qualify on means alone but who face significant health costs can still qualify for a medical card under the discretionary arrangements operated by the HSE.<\/p><p>  I emphasise that no one who is entitled to medical card coverage will lose their card as a result of the probity measures announced in the budget.  Older people have nothing to fear in that regard.  I remain committed to ensuring resources are directed to those who need them most.  The Government remains committed to providing free GP care to the entire population because this will ensure patients are diagnosed early and treated more effectively in their communities.  This is a vital step to dismantling the obscene inequity of a two-tier system though the implementation of the universal insurance scheme.  Those over 70 who are no longer entitled to a medical card will still have access to free GP care and the safety net of the drugs payment scheme, meaning they will have to pay no more than &euro;144 per month per household for medicines.<\/p><p>  This year, the nursing homes support scheme will support more than 22,000 people, the majority of whom are older people, in meeting the cost of long-term residential care, at a cost of &euro;970 million.  I know the great majority of older people want to remain in their homes for as long as possible and to be supported in doing that.<\/p><p>To honour their wishes in 2013 funding of over &euro;390 million was provided for community services for older people.  In addition, this year we will provide 10.3 million hours of home help to over 50,000 people.  Almost 11,000 home care packages are in place and a further 20,000 people have day care places.  However, we always seek to do better for older people and to this end a review of the nursing homes support scheme is currently under way.  A key question for the review is how to achieve a better balance between residential care and care in the community in line with the desires of most older people.<\/p><p> As a doctor I know only too well that the onset of Alzheimer's disease or dementia can be a devastating blow to a family.  However, it is important to recognise that many people live well and happily for a long time after dementia enters the picture and there is much that can be done to make each personal journey better.  To this end I have convened an expert working group to consider how we can provide a better response to people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia and the group will publish its work early next year.<\/p><p> Age should be no barrier to active participation in all dimensions of Irish society.  Our positive ageing strategy calls for a shift in how, as a society, we think about growing older.  We all have much to learn from the skills and experiences of older people and our strategy is geared to ensuring that older people can continue to make a strong and positive contribution in our society.  I daresay no one in the Chamber does not wish to grow old in comfort.<\/p><p> I reiterate my personal commitment to the welfare of older people.  It is a commitment that applies throughout the members of my Cabinet and their Departments.  We will never regard or treat older people as anything other than people, full and valued members of our society whose efforts and sacrifices have built this nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300052#AAA04300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382550600,"counter":989,"content":"<p>Sadly and wrongly, since the budget we have had a sequence involving scaremongering, alarmism and placing unreasonable fears on our older persons.

The income threshold for the general practitioner visit card, which is very valuable to people, remains unchanged.  That is a fact.  The long-term illness card, available to sufferers of diabetes and a range of costly illnesses remains in place.  That is a fact too.  A total of 35,000 people will be affected, but 93% of over 70s will retain their medical card.<\/p><p>  We need to communicate the message properly, but the validation of medical cards is in the public interest, in taxpayers' interests and in the interests of a better service.  It is the right thing to do as well.  Anyone who for populist reasons seeks to posit the opposite view to the House is sadly lacking as a public representative.<\/p><p>  Let us put in context what has not altered for our older people.  The core rate of the State pensions remains in place as does free travel, the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance, the free television licence, the electricity and gas allowance and the over 80 years allowance.  The carers rate is preserved and the half-rate carers rate is preserved.  The extra payment for caring is in place as well.  In 2014 an investment of &euro;25 million will create 12,500 warmer homes under the better energy scheme.  When I referred to 93% just now I was explaining that 93% of over 70s will retain either a GP visit card or a medical card.<\/p><p>  The telephone issue has been raised but the Government is set to examine the senior alert scheme.  It is important that this happens and I commend the announcement.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that many of the telephone companies are now vying to get into this market.  The reality is that services will be available to many people.  For example, Eircom has a vulnerable users scheme.  This is all many of them use in any event.  Under the scheme the first &euro;8 is allowed for an older person to telephone family members if their telephone bill is less than &euro;17.21 in a month.  That will apply in many cases.  The senior alert scheme will be addressed.  Some &euro;200 million is in place for housing adaptation and dealing with housing grants, a real service.  The DIRT tax measures do not affect married couples aged 65 years and over with &euro;36,000 of income or individuals with &euro;18,000 of income.  The nursing homes support scheme remains in place, as the Minister noted, and there is an aggressive, active and satisfactory primary care development programme in the country.  Happily, several primary care centres were opened in my constituency recently by the Minister.  These will allow people access to services nearer to home.<\/p><p>  Let us consider this holistically and consider all the facts.  We were in a situation involving the troika and a bailout.  At the moment &euro;1 billion per month more is being spent than taken in.  In this context what we have achieved for our older persons should be lauded by the House.  Any objective commentary would hold that we deliberating on a minute telephone allowance which will be addressed as far as possible.  The fact remains that someone over 70 years with up to &euro;500 in income per week or a couple with &euro;900 per week will still have a medical card, although there are few of these in my constituency.  If that is all we are discussing then there is no issue.<\/p><p>  Thanks be to God, the Government and the Minister sitting in front of me have every reason to be proud of our extraordinary record for old people.  We have got people off the trolleys or the solution is virtually achieved and the emergency ward situation is being addressed.  We have achieved for older persons holistically and comprehensively.  The motion does not stand up; it is based on a fallacy.  The honest and intellectually straight thing to do would be to withdraw it or certainly not put it to a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300053#BBB00400","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1382550600,"counter":992,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that we need to protect the most vulnerable in society and I am proud to say Ireland has a good record on this.  The record stands up internationally.<\/p><p>  That aside, the quality of Private Members' business that we are getting in the House should be questioned.  This debate seems to be almost a rerun of the debate that we had last week.  As Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan will remember, I prefaced my comments last week by saying that just because a person sits on that side of the House does not mean that he has a monopoly on sympathy, empathy or any of the emotions that they like to portray.  What we have on this side of the House is a responsibility and if it had existed on this side of the House when it should have, we might not be in the situation we are in.  We need to remind the public about that constantly.  It was the fault of Fianna F&aacute;il and this is the reason we are debating these issues tonight and the public should be reminded of that at every turn.  I realise those in Fianna F&aacute;il do not like to be reminded of it but we should remind them and it should never be forgotten that this is the reason we are here.  There is a collective amnesia among those in Fianna F&aacute;il and they would like to be able to forget that they had any hand, act or part in this episode, but they did.<\/p><p>  I wish to address some of the issues raised in the Private Members' motion.  I am sure older people do not want to be pressurised about means testing or application forms.  This is something no one likes no matter what their age.  I have spoken on this issue on more than one occasion.  Equally, I have outlined that much of the documentation being sent to constituents is far too complex in format and, as I have said previously, this has a natural tendency to put the fear of God into older people, especially those of advanced years.<\/p><p>Despite this, the fact remains that means testing is the most efficient and effective solution in determining who is eligible.  In advance of such testing, I ask that documentation being sent out by the Department should reflect this sentiment and allow for a less formal tone and format to be used.<\/p><p> It must be pointed out that the Government has retained the core rate of State pensions.  It has maintained free travel for the elderly, the free television allowance, the living alone allowance and the electricity and gas allowances for those aged over 80, as well as the carer's allowance and half-rate carer's allowance.  The medical cards issue is something about which everyone is very passionate, as highlighted by the protests outside Leinster House.  I will conclude by noting the elderly must be protected, which is the reason the Labour Party in government has maintained the core rate of State pensions and, as I stated, has protected free travel and fuel and television allowances, as well as electrical and gas allowances.  In the straitened circumstances in which the Government finds itself, it is greatly to be commended on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300053#BBB00500","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382551200,"counter":994,"content":"<p>I welcome the Private Members' motion because no one in this House disagrees on the protection of senior citizens.  In common with many other Members present, I work with various groups in my constituency to ensure senior citizens get every opportunity to enjoy life, to participate in their communities and in all aspects of it, and in which many opportunities are available to them.  One can see, through various organisations, the amount of time, effort and dedication volunteers give to senior citizens.  What I like most about this is that senior citizens in many places are beginning to realise their potential to give back to the community.  In many cases, it is their ability to run all aspects of their associations.  Bowls has become a major activity in my home area and there are so many clubs that the county board must run events six nights a week to ensure everyone is able to partake.  This is because the senior citizens themselves wish to participate.  They wish to give back, to be responsible and in that way to enjoy themselves.  Those who may be unable to partake are brought along for the enjoyment and participation.  This works across all aspects of the community, be it sport, drama, community activities and so on.<\/p><p>  The misinformation in respect of the medical card appears to be the central focus of many of the problems.  Even given that focus, however, it is important there should be a review of the medical card system.  There have been efforts in this regard, comprising both a targeted and a random review, within the past two years.  The targeted review was carried out in 2012 in respect of 40,000 medical card holders who had not accessed medical services for a period of 12 months or more, and approximately 39% of those medical card holders did not respond to the effect that they were resident in the country.  Consequently, one can discern immediately that a review is needed.  The random review of 2,628 medical and GP-visit cards was carried out in early 2013.  Eligibility was confirmed for 73% of the cards while it has not been finalised for another 2%.  A total of 4% of the cards were not renewed because of eligibility criteria and 21% of the card holders did not respond to renew their cards.  Again, one can discern immediately that there is a need to bring these data up to date, to ascertain our direction on this issue and to assess the costs that must be determined in these times and, in so doing, to ensure the Health Service Executive will be able to evaluate and give value for money in the medical card system.<\/p><p>  Medical cards also have been awarded on discretionary grounds and I have a concern in this regard, having encountered particular cases in which cards have been withdrawn.  I hope these issues can be surmounted through the application of common sense.  One point about a person having a discretionary card is the comfort of having it.  In many instances, the card is not simply something the person has for the sake of having it.  The person in question uses it because of the circumstances in which he or she finds him or herself.  Will the Minister for Health ensure the HSE uses an available mechanism to get all the information, to get it correctly and to process it as quickly as possible?  There have been too many instances in which an appeal has been made or a review instigated that has necessitated the sending of the file from Dublin to Cork or to Donegal.  This lengthens the process, which is not good work and it should not happen like this because it places the family concerned under pressure.  In respect of the appeal mechanism, the card should remain valid while the appeal is being heard.  I ask the Minister to review this situation and when a card is being reviewed, it should be allowed to remain in place.  This would give comfort to the people who were subject to the review because they would know that were they to make a mistake and fail to submit the information the first time, they would be given this chance and would not be obliged to have the entire card reassessed.  I will conclude by asking the Minister to do these two things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300054#CCC00200","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1382551200,"counter":995,"content":"<p>I read the Private Members' motion tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il and was quite struck by the language used.  The motion \"agrees that older people are more anxious now ... concurs that older people do not want to be pressurised about ... application forms\" and so on.  While I have no doubt these sentiments apply to some older people, the language in the motion is so generic, empty and lacking in depth that it verges on stereotyping.  What is worse, it implies that older people, contrary to what I and most Members know to be true, are only concerned about themselves.  I consider this to be a shallow and foolish approach by Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  If Members truly are to discuss issues of concern to older people, the language one must use must refer to them as citizens and members of the wider community of which they are proud stakeholders.  It may surprise Fianna F&aacute;il but older people have children about whose livelihoods they care.  Older people have grandchildren about whose education they care.  Older people have husbands, wives and partners about whose health services they care.  Older people have friends and neighbours who lack a job and about whom they worry.  Moreover, older people have a real and genuine concern for their country, for which they worked so hard and about which they care so much.  While it is true it has not been possible to exclude any single group from the economic disaster Fianna F&aacute;il brought on this country, older people appreciate, and to a greater extent than Fianna F&aacute;il give them credit for, the difficulties and challenges the current Government faces.  They understand that as we move through these fiscal adjustments and economic corrections, neither they nor anyone else is immune from the consequences they bring with them, and yet many acknowledge the hard work done to protect the pension, free travel, free television licence, gas and electricity allowances, living alone allowance, carer's allowance and so on.  Moreover, they do not take this for granted.<\/p><p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il motion implies that older people are a selfish uncomprehending group of people who do not understand the economic reality they, their children and grandchildren are in and that society as a whole faces.  Let us desist from the artificial nonsense of carving older people out of the community and segregating them into a disconnected group that is separate from everyone else.  It is such thinking that is seriously dangerous to older people's well-being and participation in society.<\/p><p>  If there is one issue I had thought ought to have been included in the motion, because it seriously affects older people in particular, it is loneliness.  I have taken a particular interest in the issues of loneliness and social isolation among older people and the reason they should have been included is because they affect older people to a greater extent than any other section of society.  This is because as they leave work and social isolation occurs, as family members and friends pass away and as mobility issues kick in, loneliness can be a serious problem.  In its 2011 report entitled Older People - Experiences and Issues, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul quoted one elderly person as saying there was nothing worse than loneliness.  It is the worst form of poverty.<\/p><p>That is the reason it is particularly important to frame our attitude to older people, and older people who are isolated in that sense, by focusing on participation in society.  As we consider the supports we offer to older people in the community, is it best that we give them cash or, more importantly in terms of the impact on their health and well-being, should we put in place services that will ensure they can interact with society and be a part of their communities and neighbourhoods?  That is the question we should consider as we examine our attitude to older people.<\/p><p> We have a role in Government in this respect but citizens across the country can also participate.  It costs nothing to visit an older person.  It costs nothing to check in on one's neighbour on one's way home.  If we were to get anything out of this economic crisis where it is very difficult to get access to money, we should make a call to action for citizens across this country, be they politicians, ordinary members of the public or family members, to interact and take account of our society, community and our older people who are suffering in certain instances from isolation and a lack of social contact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300054#CCC00300","speaker":"1045","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382551800,"counter":997,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Kitt who has five minutes and is sharing time with Deputy Niall Collins who has six minutes, Deputy McGuinness who has four minutes, Deputy Finian McGrath who has two minutes, Deputy Calleary who has eight minutes and Deputy Smith who has five minutes<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300055#DDD00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1382551800,"counter":998,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Kelleher on tabling this motion.  It presents a welcome opportunity to discuss a very important issue.  The motion is about protecting the rights of older citizens and solidarity between the generations.  I do not see any sign of solidarity when the Minister is removing a large number of medical cards, estimated to be 35,000, from people who are over the age of 70 years.  They are being removed not only from the elderly, but from people who are sick, people on the breadline and people with disabilities as a result of this budget.<\/p><p>  The abolition of the telephone allowance in particular is a mean-spirited cut.  This cutback will have serious consequences because, as was said, many older people have their personal security alarms and house alarms linked to their landline.  If people are forced to give up their landlines, they will be hit in other ways.  I raised the issue of alarm systems last year when the telephone allowance was reduced.  Some families told me that their elderly relatives were going into nursing homes and when they went to remove the landline, they learned that the alarm was linked to it.  A constituent told me recently, following the recent announcement, that it would cost &euro;111 to disconnect a landline because the telephone company claims it is within the contract period even though there was never a written contract, only a verbal agreement.  Irrespective of whether a person keeps the landline or gets rid of it, it will involve a cost and the loss of benefit will hurt an elderly person who had that allowance. <\/p><p>  I was interested in what Deputy Joe O'Reilly said, namely, that some people were able to get a better telephone package for their landline.  I think that is correct but why did the Government did not refer to this or did it know what could be purchased as regards these packages?  If we are going to help older people to live independently and with dignity, I hope the full telephone allowance will be restored.  Isolation in rural Ireland, to which Deputy Nolan referred, is a particular issue in this context as is illness.  Medical cards are important when one is coping with an illness.  Having a telephone is important when people live in an isolated area.  The provision of rural transport is also very important.  When I hear talk of a review of the rural transport scheme, I get very worried.  I hope that services will be maintained for older citizens in a fair and progressive manner.  I hear that point being raised all the time and it was even raised today by the Tuam Active Retirement Association who meet every Wednesday.  They met today-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300055#DDD00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1382551800,"counter":999,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300055#DDD00400","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1382551800,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>-----and raised the issues of the increase in prescription charges, the loss of medical cards for the over 70s and the abolition of the telephone allowance.  These active retirement groups have been having meetings, their members protested outside the House yesterday and they talked about the difficult situations they find themselves in having worked hard all their lives and made great contributions to society.<\/p><p>  Energy costs are also an important factor.  Increasing energy costs are putting a good deal of pressure on families and on elderly people who live alone.  It is ironic that meetings are currently being held in Galway about increasing restrictions being imposed on turf-cutting.  The humble sod of turf is now to the forefront of many people's minds.  Turf is the main fuel in many houses, whether it is used for heating or cooking.  More areas of bog are being put out of bounds for turf-cutting.  The restriction used to apply to special areas of conservation and now it applies to natural heritage areas.  <\/p><p>  I hope that all these issues, including in particular the budget measures that will impact on health insurance costs, will be examined.  Those measures are likely to worsen the position for elderly people.  It is estimated that more than 1 million will face a tax hike with this charge.  It will not only affect the gold-plated polices.  More and more people over 60 years of age are taking up private health insurance.  I understand the number of people over the age of 60 with private health insurance rose by 22,000 between 2011 and 2012.  I hope that these measures will be resisted and the Government will reverse them and do so as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300055#DDD00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1382551800,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>We discussed the medical card issue in the House a little over two weeks ago and the Minister was present for that debate.  On that occasion I gave him the details of a constituent of mine from Caherguillamore in Bruff, County Limerick, and I regret to say that I have not heard from him in that respect in the intervening two weeks.  I did not even get an acknowledgment from him that he would look into the case.  That lady is suffering from cancer.  She is very sick.  She is going through three parallel treatments at the moment to try to overcome the challenges that cancer has presented to her.  I spoke to her as late as last Saturday in her hospital bed.  She was quite sick and she still has not had a determination or an outcome regarding her medical card.  That should not happen.  I regret that I have to raise her case again tonight on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As I said to the Minister two weeks ago, it is not good enough that any particular case should have to be raised in isolation in this House.  I feel strongly about this case.

I ask the Minister again to make this a matter of priority through his good offices.<\/p><p>  We spoke about the ongoing medical card issue a number of weeks ago.  There has been a de facto change in policy.  I listened to some speakers on the Government side who talked about communications, scaremongering and misinformation.  The facts are out there and we are bringing them into the Chamber.  Nobody is making this stuff up.  We need a dose of realism and a dose of honesty regarding the medical card issue.  There is no point in saying to the people that there is a communications problem and that the Government is fixing it.  When I hear that coming from Government, fixing a communications problem means that it is going to spin some other version of events.  The fact of the matter is that the Government has determined an amount of savings that it wants to accrue from the medical card budget and it is working back from that.  It is making the criteria fit as it works backwards from the bottom line savings figure that it is trying to reach.  The Government has not decided what the new criteria will be but working forward from that it is a case of however many fall out of the system fall out of it.  It is working backwards from the figure to try to arrive at a starting point, but that is not a good way to do it.  <\/p><p>  The people deserve a little bit of honesty.  I  compliment RTE's &quot;Prime Time&quot; on sticking with this public debate.

Many of these cuts have been hidden in the fine print of this budget.  Whether it is a change of regulation or a change of qualification rule, there have been cuts.  Deputy Nolan made a suggestion, and I support him in it, that we should visit older people and that people outside of this House should be encouraged to do so also within communities.<\/p><p>  I visit older people.  To take away from some of the statements that have been made by Ministers and some backbenchers and apply some reality, I will tell the House what I find in their homes.  When they apply for grants to the county council to do something minor to make their house reasonably accessible, they cannot get it because there is no money.  When the older person in hospital is being discharged, there is no money to refurbish the house.  They are stuck in a hospital and they cannot come home to their families.  I came across a case where a woman and her disabled daughter have not been able to get accommodation with their other sister simply because there is no money to carry out the refurbishment works.<\/p><p>  There is then the case of the medical cards.  We have had all the changes with the budget.  People are suffering and medical cards are being withdrawn from older people but what happened before the budget?  We had what they call a random check.  Every Member on the opposite side of the House must know from their clinics that there was nothing random about it.  It was a cull of medical cards from the elderly, an attempt to take those cards and not give them back for one reason or another.<\/p><p>  The son of a 90 year old woman in my constituency went to the chemist and it was only then that he was told that the medical card had been taken from his mother.  Only yesterday, a couple went to the chemist and without any notification their medical card had been taken.  That is not a lack of communication.  That is complete chaos within the Health Service Executive, HSE.  It is a misunderstanding of the problem at the political level because the HSE has a political leadership within the Department of Health, and that political leadership should be showing the way.<\/p><p>  I point the Minister to the hospital waiting list.  I listened here the other day to a Minister telling us that there were no trolleys in the corridors.  The Government must have its head stuck in the sand because there are trolleys in corridors.  Again, in my region, all of the cases for senior citizens looking for hip and knee replacements or cataract operations were sent to Cappagh hospital.  They were told they would be fast-tracked and prioritised but do the Members opposite know what happened after a few months?  All of the files were sent back down to Waterford, and the people were told to rejoin the waiting list but they have been on the waiting list for six years.<\/p><p>  Members make the accusation that this was all Fianna F&aacute;il's fault.  They are in power since 2011.  They got a mandate from the Irish people and they have totally ignored that mandate.  The message they are sending out about the past is now being rubbished not by us on this side of the House, but by the general public who are getting fed up listening to that message.<\/p><p>  All of the issues that have been addressed by my colleagues here are real issues that the Government will have problems with in terms of the care of the elderly.

Older people are now more anxious about services being removed from them, which will lead to isolation and illness.  Older people do not want to be pressurised about means tests and application forms for health services.<\/p><p>  I call for public services to be maintained for older citizens in a fair, progressive way and I call on the Government to reaffirm Ireland's agreement to the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300056#EEE02600","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1382552400,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>On many occasions in this House I have railed against what I call the notion of silo government where Departments take decisions without any co-ordination or consultation with other Departments and one sector or community invariably gets overly impacted.  The evidence is there that this is what has happened on this occasion.  The Department of Health decided to go after medical cards.  The Department of Finance decided to cut the tax relief on health insurance.  The Department of Social Protection decided that the telephone allowance and the bereavement grant were within its sights but it seems that nobody in the three Departments spoke to each other to try to assess if this would impact on one particular group in society or the other.  That is what has happened.<\/p><p>  If we are to look at the reports on the lead-in to the budget, which I notice have not been denied, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, was the last man to go into the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to present and seek support for his budget.  Other Ministers had done it.  He was the last man to do so and he presented an unachievable budget to the Minister, Deputy Howlin.<\/p><p>That then forced the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to take control of the Minister for Health's Department and its expenditure.  What we now have is a collection of departmental initiatives which are impacting in a very severe way on older people, in particular.<\/p><p> I heard phrases such as &quot;scare-mongering&quot; and &quot;communications problems&quot; used tonight.  If there is scare-mongering and if there are communications problems, I invite anyone to come to my office to see the real cases with review letters from the Department of Health which I have dealt with, and not only since the budget.  This has been going on all year, that is, the reduction in the number of medical cards and the changing conditions.  Even the Minister admitted he was not aware that the qualifying provisions for medical cards had changed, so it is no wonder we are slightly wary about his ability to perform in his own Department.  Those on the Government side cannot accuse the Opposition of communications problems and stoking fear when the figure of &euro;133 million is put beside a very vague issue of medical card probity.  That is not communications in terms of how one presents a measure.  The Government keeps saying many people have gone away and have died but that is not correct.  It states 35,000 medical cards will be taken from the over 70s or will be switched to GP cards.  That is the figure when one calculates the saving in the budget documents.  Either the figure put down as savings is wrong or it is right.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy White, will clarify that.<\/p><p> On budget day the Minister for Finance said the change to tax relief for health insurance policies would only affect gold plated policies, which the Taoiseach repeated on Leaders' Questions this morning.  The difficulty is that as people get older or as they develop a medical conditions - many young people are in that situation - their health insurance gets more expensive.  It is not gold plated to have basic cancer treatment covered by Vhi or Aviva.  If one suffers from chronic pain syndrome and must travel to Dublin every six weeks to have one's pain pump filled, which gives one relief and allows one to live one's life, it is not gold plated to have a Vhi policy costing &euro;3,000 per year minimum.  The Department has not come up with an alternative figure to that suggested by the insurance companies that 70% of policies will be affected.  Older people will bear the brunt of that change to tax relief for health insurance.<\/p><p> The big problem with medical cards is the number of people whose cards have been reviewed unbeknown to them.  They have medical cards with expiry dates next year but when they go to the doctor, he or she informs them the card has been changed.  The doctor can no longer treat them because he or she has been told by the Department the medical card has been discontinued, or will not be renewed, before the patient has been told.  It is not the fault of the people in Finglas, who are doing a very good job in difficult circumstances.  It is due to a complete lack of centralised policy at the top of the Department and seeing medical cards as an easy fix when it is panicking to get a budget figure.  That seems to be what is happening, if we are to believe all the stories from Fine Gael about the Minister's activities in the days before the budget.  Unfortunately, the people paying the price are medical card holders and people over 70 who are losing the right to medical cards, bereavement grants and telephone allowances.<\/p><p> I refer to the bereavement grant.  The Minister said the exceptional needs payment was still available in the community welfare office but there has been a cut in the overall heading for that payment.  The bereavement grant has been abolished but the budget available for exceptional needs has been cut.  People are being crucified twice here.  <\/p><p> The provision regarding the telephone allowance has not been included in the Social Welfare Bill.  Not only is the Government taking it away but the Minister dismissed it as being only a payment for line rental to various telephone companies.  It does more than that; it gives people a landline in their homes and in rural areas, in particular, it allows them to have the emergency pendant, which they use for crime and health security.  They face losing that because they must pay the full amount to Eircom due to a very measly cut.  Since it is not included in the Social Welfare Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy White, might outline the Government's plans in regard to that cut.<\/p><p> Many departmental decisions have come down on the heads of one sector.  Older people are paying the price for a way of government which has been practised by every government, so I am not personalising it to any Minister.  It is time Departments started to co-ordinate approaches.  Given the way this budget was devised, with last minute meetings and last minute rows, it was inevitable somebody would pay the price and it seems to be our older people.  As the Government prepares for next year's budget, let us hope there will be more co-ordination so that one sector of society does not bear the brunt of budgetary decisions in the manner older people are in this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300056#EEE02700","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382553000,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on what is an important debate.  I am one of the Members representing counties Cavan and Monaghan, an area commonly referred to as drumlin country.  I have a particular concern in regard to the poor or, indeed, non-existent mobile telephone coverage in parts of the two counties.  When one travels through that area, calls constantly drop.  We have the additional problem in that some of the British telecommunications companies dominate the coverage along the Border.<\/p><p>  It is in the context of the removal of the telephone allowance that I raise the following point.  The panic buttons and home security alarms are an extremely important support, in particular for elderly persons living on their own.  We all know people need a landline to use those facilities.  The abolition of the telephone allowance is a deplorable decision which will affect almost 395,000 people, including the old, the disabled and carers.  Over the years, practically every home had a landline installed.  Older people relied on such a communication link to keep in touch with family and neighbours and with personnel delivering social services, whether from the statutory agencies or voluntary organisations.  <\/p><p>  This decision means a reduction of &euro;9.50 per month in the Government support for those 395,000 people.  That is a reduction in the person's income and means.  The additional anxiety that will be caused by the abolition of the telephone allowance will impact most on those persons living in the most isolated communities where, by and large, the poorest mobile telephone coverage exists.  <\/p><p>  Over the past decade, many people worked hard in local communities to ensure that the vast majority of older persons or persons with a disability obtained the panic buttons and security alarms.  Those communities were supported through small, but significant, grant schemes.  Recently, I heard one of the advocacy groups ask where now stands the promises in the Government's National Positive Ageing Strategy.<\/p><p>  All of us doing constituency work must be very conscious of the considerable and, indeed, justified concern of people in regard to medical cards.  We are all aware of individual cases of huge hardship in households where medical cards have not been renewed or where first-time applications have been inexplicably refused.  This has been happening for months and the recent budgetary decisions will lead to further hardship for the elderly, the ill and vulnerable people.<\/p><p>  Recently, I dealt with the case of a woman aged 96 who, unfortunately, has totally lost her sight.  That family had to re-apply for her medical card.  It is a very literate family but it created that extra pressure.  To its credit, that family has cared for that woman at home and she has never spent a day in a nursing home.  Why should a family face that additional unnecessary pressure to get a medical card renewed for a lady of 96 years of age?  <\/p><p>  The elderly people who contacted me are very concerned and worried about the change in eligibility for these necessary supports, whether medical cards or supports from the Department of Social Protection.  Pensioners who worked hard for decades, often in the most difficult circumstances, paid their dues to this State and made a huge contribution to our society.  The least they should expect now is to have the necessary support that they can live securely and free from worry about day-to-day living costs.<\/p><p>All of us support and understand their wish and desire to live independently with dignity and without anxiety at this stage of their lives.  At no time is a family more vulnerable than at the time when a bereavement occurs.  As Deputy Calleary said, the bereavement grant was based on the insurance contribution of the deceased during his or her working life.  In many instances, it was extremely important for families in difficult financial circumstances.  I was amazed to hear the Minister, Deputy Quinn, make a comment on the radio to the effect that the grant was eaten up by the undertaker.  The people I mix with through my work and the people I meet as I go about my daily business can ill afford the loss of &euro;850 in the event of a bereavement in their families.  All of us are familiar with the particular pressures being faced by families.<\/p><p> I welcome the comments made by Deputy Wall, who appealed for common sense to be shown in the administration of the medical card scheme.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy White, is a practical man.  I hope he can ensure that practical ideas are pursued to ensure people do not continue to have these worries.  I remind Deputy Nolan, who mentioned that the word &quot;loneliness&quot; is not mentioned in our motion, that the word &quot;isolation&quot; is included in it.  It is particularly important for those of us who represent rural constituencies because we know many people who will feel isolated if these harsh measures are implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300057#FFF00200","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382553600,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>The tone of the amendments proposed to this motion, if perhaps not the motion itself, suggests that the Government has been disproportionately unfair to older people.  This charge does not stand up to any objective scrutiny.  Of course it is possible for speakers to select particular reductions or cutbacks for special criticism.  Given the scale of the fiscal correction that has been required in recent years, no group could be entirely insulated from the impact of adjustments.  I accept that no group has been so insulated.<\/p><p>  This Government recognises that Irish people have made huge sacrifices.  However, we are now coming within sight of the point at which we can reclaim our economic sovereignty.  This will be critical if we are to put control of Ireland's affairs back into Irish hands and again have the capacity to decide ourselves how our society is shaped.  Having said this, we have prioritised the protection of older people as much as possible.  I suggest that our record bears that out.  In the short time available to me, I would like to mention a few areas in which this protection has applied.<\/p><p>  The nursing home support scheme continues to be an extremely generous support for those who need long-term residential care.  Even after the changes that were announced last year, the State is continuing to meet by far the greater part of the cost of care in the majority of cases, with nursing home residents making a much smaller contribution.  The average weekly contribution by an individual under the scheme is less than &euro;285, while the total weekly cost of care is approximately &euro;1,500 in some nursing homes.  In 2013, some 10.3 million hours of home help will be delivered to over 50,000 people, with an additional 10,870 people receiving home care packages.  A review of the balance between residential and community care is taking place as we consider how more people might be better supported at home for longer, in line with the wishes expressed by older people themselves.<\/p><p>  Even after the changes that were announced recently, well over 90% of those over the age of 70 will continue to hold medical card or GP visit cards.  Any single person with an income of up to &euro;26,000, or couple with an income of up to &euro;47,000, will continue to hold a medical card and will therefore be unaffected by the recent change.  I wish to confirm a figure in response to Deputy Calleary, who asked for clarification in this respect.  Some 35,000 people will move from full medical cards to GP-only cards as a result of the eligibility changes for over 70s that were announced in last week's budget.  People over the age of 70 who now qualify for GP visit cards rather than medical cards will continue to be entitled to make use of the drugs payment scheme.  People in that age group who have weekly incomes of between &euro;500 and &euro;700 - between &euro;900 and &euro;1,400 in the case of a couple - will pay a maximum of &euro;33.23 on medication each week.<\/p><p>  The State pension, free travel, fuel allowance and free television licence schemes have all been protected.  The tax treatment of the elderly remains unaltered, with no change in the net income of pensioners as a result of the budget.  From a policy perspective, the national carer's strategy, which was published in 2012; the national positive aging strategy, which was published earlier this year; and the forthcoming national dementia strategy, which is currently being drafted, demonstrate our commitment to giving unprecedented priority, and rightly so, to older people in our communities.  These commitments will have far-reaching effects into the future.<\/p><p>  I would like to respond to one or two issues that have been raised since I joined the debate.  Deputy Niall Collins mentioned an individual case that he raised the last time we had a debate of this nature in the Chamber.  I do not propose to engage in any discussion on any individual case.  During the course of the debate in question, after I gave an account of the manner in which the administration of the system is being affected, I invited colleagues to let me know about any cases that draw into question what I was saying about how the system is operating.  The Deputy raised such an issue with me.  I regret that I have not come back to him so far in relation to it.  I will certainly follow it up after this debate and revert to him.<\/p><p>  Decisions in relation to applications for medical cards are not matters for the Minister for Health.  I am sure Deputy Niall Collins was not suggesting in his contribution that they were.  Such matters are dealt with by the HSE in accordance with the relevant legislation.  That is how it will continue.  I reject outright the Deputy's suggestion that an effort is being made to make the criteria fit in some way to ensure a certain number of cards are withdrawn.  People are either entitled to a card or they are not.  There is absolutely no question of the Government or the HSE acting in a way that would ensure a certain target number of cards is taken out of the system every year.  If we were to do so, we would be contravening what is provided for in the legislation, which is that people have an entitlement or do not have an entitlement.<\/p><p>  Deputy Smith made a reasonable point about the need to be practical and sensible.  I am open to anything colleagues might have to say in that respect.  I would like to put a rhetorical question to the Deputy in response to what he said about the letters that are sent to people when reviews are taking place.  Is he suggesting that cards should be open-ended in terms of their duration?  It seems to me that if they were open-ended, that would represent a change in our system.  We must have a means of ensuring people continue to be entitled.  I do not know of a better way of doing this than writing to them at any given time to check on their circumstances.  I am open to suggestions about how that might better be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300058#GGG00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1382553600,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for allowing me to contribute to this debate.  At a time of budgetary cuts, I would like to know why the Government is giving &euro;700 million of borrowed money to people who are not Irish citizens and who are living abroad.  If this figure could be halved to &euro;350 million, there would be no need for the proposed &euro;113 million cut that will directly affect 100,000 medical card holders.  The telephone rental allowance, which enables people to get telephones that are vitally needed for security purposes, would not need to be abolished and neither would the bereavement grant.  This could be done at the stroke of a pen.<\/p><p>  The Government has decided to discriminate against Irish people who live in poverty, some of whom voted to elect it.  It is deliberately throwing &euro;700 million around the world even though it has no electoral mandate to do so.  It must be unduly influenced by the extraordinarily highly paid leaders of the organisations through which much of this money is being pushed.  We do not have a properly audited system.  Some of the moneys in question are not subject to proper accounting.  Charity begins at home.  I suggest that a question on this matter should be put to the people when the Government proposes to hold a referendum next year.  The Government should ask the electorate to give it a mandate to continue with policies that discriminate against the poor Irish people who elected it.<\/p><p>  Economics is about the allocation of scarce resources.  Economists are supposed to be trained and have an understanding of the sociological needs of the communities they analyse.  I am afraid there must be some very dumb economists advising the Government at present.  To be honest, their wisdom is very questionable.  The Government's parish pump in Ireland has been bled dry.  According to an article in today's <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, &quot;Greeks are on average almost 40pc poorer than they were in 2008 ... laying bare the impact of a brutal recession and austerity measures the Government may be forced to extend into next year&quot;.  The plight in this country in the comparable years mirrors what happened in Greece.  Our unfortunate citizens who are at the lower rungs of the ladder are suffering.  I plead with the Government to review immediately and reverse the draconian decisions that were taken in last week's budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300058#GGG00300","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1382553600,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy Kelleher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300058#GGG00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1382553600,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I compliment my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, for putting this motion before the House.  Like other speakers, I am somewhat bemused by the continuous spin from the Government to the effect that the Irish people's misunderstanding of the effects of these cuts is based on some kind of deficit in its communications strategy.<\/p><p>It is a sign of desperation if the Government has to say that its inability to communicate has confused the people.<\/p><p> In my experience the people are very adept at understanding how they are affected by measures brought forward in this House and through various budgets.  They are well able to read between the lines.  On this occasion they have found out the Government.  I am not talking about the Minister of State personally.  He is one of the few who talks straight when dealing with good or bad news.  Others around him unfortunately do not.  His colleagues, particularly those in Cabinet, have told too many porkies and the people have rightly recognised that the Government has sold them a pup, based on the promises that it made prior to the election and that it continues to inflict pain and unnecessary cuts notwithstanding its continuing to say that it is not doing that.  It is shameful.  No matter how the Government tries to communicate the removal of the bereavement grant, of the telephone allowance, of discretionary medical cards at the rate of 1,000 a month, of medical cards from elderly, sick people, it will not be able to fool people by somehow suggesting that it will not hurt, affect or disenfranchise them in a way that is disproportionate to others in society whom the Government has not touched because the Minister of State's friends in Fine Gael want to protect particular sectors.<\/p><p> If the Government is concerned about communications it might be worthwhile having a chat with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  She is quite adept at communicating.  She communicates very well.  She is still the darling of the media.  One almost gets unnecessary information if one brushes past her in the corridor.  She is so adept at protecting her own image she suggests that all these things are being foisted upon her, she is doing her best and she is not really reducing any of the rates, while all the while inflicting significant cuts on certain sectors within the social welfare budget.  She continues to peddle what I believe to be an untruth, that there have been no cuts to social welfare rates.  The word &quot;rates&quot; is added on.  Yet there have been very serious cuts in social welfare that impact heavily on certain sectors.  Swingeing cuts affect some of the most vulnerable people.<\/p><p> I read through some material last night in preparation for today's debate.  On 22 November 2005, when the Minister for Social Protection was an opposition spokesperson she said of the then Government's Book of Estimates that it was as worthy of credibility as an Al Capone declaration of innocence.  I would say that her declaration that social welfare rates have not been cut is just as worthy of credibility as an Al Capone declaration of innocence.  She might reflect on that when she spins her next story against whomever she chooses.  Needless to say, the Minister of State's party leader was adept at criticising and spinning in a particular way when he was in opposition.  On 20 January 2009 at the commemoration of the ninetieth anniversary of the first D&aacute;il, he said:<blockquote>[C]an we say that we have lived up to the objective that &quot;the first duty of the Government of the Republic is to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children&quot;? Can the elderly patient lying on a hospital trolley, or the pensioners defending their medical cards and their pension rights feel that &quot;the nation's aged and infirm shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the nation's gratitude and consideration&quot;?<\/blockquote>I wonder do the aged and infirm tonight believe that they are entitled to the nation's gratitude and consideration as a result of the Government's budget or do they feel that they are a burden on society?  Those with whom I have conversed over the past week believe that they are a burden on society.  The continual betrayal of that important sector of our society is shameful and not worthy of the comments coming from the Government side.<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste could not help himself when he was then the leader of the Labour Party in opposition.  On 15 October 2008 he had another rush of blood to the head when he said that &quot;If the economy were the <i>Titanic<\/i>, it would be women and children last while the bankers got the first and most comfortable lifeboat&quot;.  Over that period he threatened to lock up bankers, as did the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, and others.  The T&aacute;naiste was going to do it his way rather than Frankfurt's way.  All of that was going to happen.  It seems to me on this occasion that following his input into the budget young mothers, young unemployed people, senior citizens, the sick and now those with life-threatening illnesses are left to last and the lifeboats are reserved for those whom Fine Gael believes it must protect, the wealthy and those in a position to pay.  This budget continues to inflict a regressive approach, based on our taxation system, to benefit those who have most and disenfranchise to the greatest extent those who have least.<\/p><p> I was surprised yesterday when I received an information card from the Department of Finance that describes the consolidated effect of the eight or nine budgets that have taken place over the period of correction since 2008, which set out to suggest that whatever number of billions of euro had been taken out of the economy, it was most progressive in its impact.  The Minister of State will be aware that the actions taken by his Government in the last two budgets were adjudged by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, to have been the most regressive in comparison with the measures taken heretofore.  This budget will be seen to continue that trend.<\/p><p> I take on board what we must accept about our period in office but at least when cuts and adjustments had to be made, those who could pay the most were hit the hardest.  That is not just my point it is also that of the ESRI.  The Government continues to take a regressive approach.  It surprises me that Labour Party backbenchers and Ministers continue to come in here and defend that in a naked way, as if to suggest that decisions are difficult.  We know that tough decisions have to be taken but they must be taken in a fair and equitable way and the actions of the Labour Party have been well shy of that.<\/p><p> Age Action Ireland and the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament are vehemently opposed to these proposals and I do not understand why we cannot show solidarity with them.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly could not understand why Age Action Ireland and the Senior Citizens Parliament could not be addressed in such a way as to resolve the issues.  He has shown blatant disregard for the promises that he made to them prior to the election. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300058#GGG00600","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382554200,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I welcome the contributions from Deputies on all sides of the House.  We do not claim to have a monopoly on empathy on this side of the House nor do we claim to have a monopoly on understanding but this was an important motion to put down to give people the opportunity to express genuine views.  There is an underlying narrative from Deputies on all sides.  We are more direct on this side but among the Minister of State's colleagues on the Government side there is a major problem with the budget and the targeting of this cohort of elderly people.  There is no point in dressing it up in any way.  The figures and statistics are there.  More important is that the budget's impact on people's lives is there for everybody to see.  Now we have the vista of these cuts having a major impact on older people who want to live independently, without fear and not in isolation.<\/p><p>  On a couple of occasions, the Minister of State has pointed out that 35,000 people will move from a full medical card to a GP only card.  What I find fascinating about the debate is that in 2008 when universality was changed again and a guideline of &euro;700 per week was introduced it was regarded as bad, terrible, but now he tries to tell us that &euro;500 per week is good.  We have to live in the real world.  There has been a consistent undermining of eligibility for medical cards.  We see case after case of people in their eighties - Deputy Smith gave the example of a person of 90 years of age - who are randomly selected for a review.  We are dealing with public money so of course we must live within guidelines but the idea that a person's income and health is going to change dramatically when they are 93 or 94 years of age simply beggars belief.  If the Government does target them for a review it should at least do so in a systematic way that does not put the fear of God in older people when they get letters asking for further information.<\/p><p>We asked this at committee.  It is randomly selected by a computer.  Perhaps the Minister of State should turn off the computer, have a look at the files and ask why on earth one would send out a letter to a person aged 88 who is blind and incontinent and depends on support from family to live.  The person is asked whether their circumstances have changed and is told the authorities want further information.  This also involved a constituent of Deputy Smith aged 96.  This is what is happening.<\/p><p> We tabled these motions not just to highlight some of the hypocrisy of what was said and what is being done in the context of budgets but also to highlight genuine concerns of many citizens who are feeling the impact not only of the cuts but also of the weight of the State in intimidating them with unnecessary letters.  When a person is 96 years of age, is it not time for the State to leave that person alone?  When the Minister of State is talking about understanding and communications, I urge him at least to put a bit of heart and understanding into the fact these people have given this country great service and are entitled to live with dignity and without any further oppression in the context of forms or, as the Taoiseach said, the Government man calling.  The Government man is calling.  He is calling every day but not only is he calling to the house, he is taking money directly out of their pockets in the context of this budget. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300059#HHH00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382554800,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>What about my question to Deputy Smith?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300060#JJJ00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1382554800,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>We are short of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300060#JJJ00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1382554800,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>That is the issue at stake here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300060#JJJ00400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1382554800,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>Should it be open-ended?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102300060#JJJ00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1382554800,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>When a person is 96 years of age, I would say that the Government should put a full stop after that file and let that person live with dignity.

The living standards of those on lower incomes have been undermined.  There is to be no increase in taxation.  Those with higher incomes have not made the contribution they could make, yet we are taking the telephone allowance and the bereavement grant from people.
