In category A correspondence, we have correspondence items 374, 378 and 379, the opening statements from the University of Limerick, University College Cork and Dundalk Institute of Technology, in advance of today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note and publish those?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to meetings.  Correspondence items 384 (i) to (iii) were received from the HSE yesterday as follow-up to our engagement with the director general last week.  The letter also states that there was not time to respond to the further questions sent yesterday morning.  Members may not have had time to read that letter, which arrived last night.  In any event, as a result of yesterday's meeting, we sent three further requests for information and the HSE stated it did not have time yesterday.  Given that we are still awaiting further responses, I believe that the best course of action now is to put the HSE officials on notice that they may be required to appear before the committee the week after next.  We could decide a definite position on that at our meeting next Thursday when we receive the correspondence.  We have received a response to what we requested last week.  Yesterday morning we asked for three further pieces of information.  Understandably, that has not been received yet.  The HSE has indicated it will deal with it as soon as possible.  I suggest we wait until we get that.  In advance of receiving that we should now put its officials on notice to expect to appear the following week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>That sounds reasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#B00400","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>We will ask the secretariat to liaise on the date.

I was more than taken aback yesterday evening to hear on the floor of the D&aacute;il that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, had threatened, through the Chairman, to injunct this committee.  I would like the Chairman to give us an explanation as to when that happened and the context in which it happened.  We should have been made aware of that fact.  That is my first question.  Second, if it is the case - I take the Chairman's word and I have no reason to disbelieve him - that such a threat was made against this committee we need to take that matter head-on.  We need to correspond with the Minister for clarification as to his rationale.  As the Chairman stated yesterday, the Minister clearly did not injunct us and it is not a case of withdrawing the threat.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, are elected on an equal basis, as is the Minister or anybody else, to come in here and do our job.  I am of the view that we are due an apology for that deeply ill-judged threat made against us.<\/p> <p>  I also want to say this - I was a member of the previous committee and I am a member of this committee.  That it is a matter of record.  It was also alleged on the floor of the House by another member of Government that this committee had brought politics into disrepute in the previous D&aacute;il.  I want to make it absolutely clear, as somebody who was a member of the previous committee and who might be regarded as one of its disreputable members by those in government, that we did our work fairly and without fear or favour.  Dare I say it, we did our work very well.  We did it on a collegial basis.  Far from bringing politics into disrepute, I would argue that we injected a level of optimism among the general public that some level of accountability in Irish political life was possible.  I am referring to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I was taken aback because it is not his form to be aggressive in this manner.  He was referring matters relating to Angela Kerins and Rehab.  For the record, we won the court case relating to the latter.  That might upset elements of the political establishment, including some here.  We actually were vindicated in the courts.  I wanted to make those points as well.<\/p> <p>  My question is as follows.  Having dropped that bombshell last evening, the Chairman now needs to explain to us when it happened.  Was it during that conversation to which the Chairman referred previously when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, had sought to speak to him that the threat was made?  What are we going to do about it?  I would not be happy to simply carry on regardless.  There are those who would wish to spancel the work not only of this committee but also of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A message needs to come from this committee that neither will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#C04400","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I was taken aback when the Chairman revealed in the D&aacute;il last night what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, had said to him because the Chairman told us that he had a meeting with the Minister or that he had bumped into him in the canteen but he did not tell us what the Minister said.  I am not trying to bring the Chairman's character into disrepute but I thought it was opportunistic to say it under the rule of privilege in the D&aacute;il when it should have been said to us here and the Minister should have been afforded an opportunity to respond.  Also, there is very much an assumption on this committee- with which I have difficulty - that the Minister approached the Chairman or that we seem to believe that the Minister approached the Chairman rather than it being the case that the Chairman approached him.<\/p><p>We do not know what happened and this scenario is all alleged.  I am not saying the Chairman's words are untrue and conversely, I cannot say what the Minister has said is untrue.  We have a difficulty and we must get to the bottom of it.

At the time there were unprecedented attacks on the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, on him personally and on his staff.  We have dealt with all of that in our report.

That is my priority as Vice Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#E00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Members have asked me questions and I will explain the full background.  I explained previously that the sequence commences with the letter of 15 February 2017 from the Minister to this committee, which is reproduced in full in the report.  Before the members had an opportunity to consider that letter, the Minister was before the finance committee dealing with Estimates.  He took the opportunity to speak at that committee about the letter he had sent and that is fine.  I read the last sentence of the letter which stated: \"I am also sure that any conclusions which do materialise in the Committee's final report will be based on available evidence, due and fair process and logical reasoning which will withstand challenge.\"  When I read this, I took it to refer to a legal challenge.  The letter had that reference in it and I took it to mean that we were to be on notice that the report might be subject to challenge.<\/p> <p>  Later on the same day, in the restaurant, the Minister asked me to have a word and I agreed.  I have good personal relations with the Minister, and the Minister has not disputed that this took place.  He said we had not been fair and should have given him an opportunity to come in and speak to the committee.  I replied that he had not been fair.  He was here for five hours and was the only one in possession of the information.  He could not accuse us of not asking him about things which he did not know of.  The conversation continued about who had been unfair to whom and concluded with the Minister saying, \"You know I can injunct you\".  That was the end of the conversation and, having read the letter a few hours earlier, I could see that this was the frame of mind the Minister was in when writing it.  The extra bit was confirmation and an advance on the previous situation but it was not new ground.  It was highly serious, nevertheless, and I told members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  It is important for the Committee of Public Accounts that I make this statement, which is broader than my discussion with the Minister.  I think the fact that some people tried to put pressure on the committee when we issued our report did not undermine the committee but strengthened it.  It will strengthen the committee to be seen as fearless and not prepared to take a rebuke from anybody.  My priority as Chairman was to get a report agreed and I felt that to overelaborate further, notwithstanding that there was a reference to a legal threat in the letter, which every member could have read themselves, would further upset the possibility of getting an agreed report.<\/p><p>I am only new to this job since last year.  I take it as normal that the Chairman of a Committee of Public Accounts will come under pressure from a variety of sources.  I take it as par for the course and it does not influence how I am.  I want to go on to talk about two further people who threatened legal action in respect of this committee and its proceedings..  First, in my conversations with the chairman of NAMA over a period, he first mentioned that legal advice was being considered but the high financial cost to NAMA was something that had to be taken into account.  That remark did not influence me or my work here.  I am just putting it on record.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#E00800","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Legal advice on what?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#F00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>On our report, in that we were potentially making adverse findings against NAMA.<\/p> <p>I am taking it a step further.

I took it as par for the course in my job as Chairman to deal with that and move on.<\/p> <p>  I am now putting on record that I think the fact we did our work has strengthened the committee, despite people's efforts to undermine us.  We are a stronger committee for it.  With regard to NAMA, I have served on this committee for a couple of terms and, during those terms and perhaps this term, I have often been critical of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and why issues were coming to light that had not been highlighted earlier.  I was told NAMA had a dossier prepared of all my previous comments on the Comptroller and Auditor General over a period of several years and that, if we were backing up the Comptroller and Auditor General, that would be used to show that I had no problem criticising him on previous occasions but was not necessarily going down that road now.  I was made aware that was there.  I have no problem; I am proud of everything I have said during previous PAC meetings.<\/p> <p>  I am just saying, as Chairman, I have come under pressures from three sources, none of which influenced me one way or the other in terms of completing our work.  I actually think we are stronger for having withstood that pressure, despite people's efforts to limit what we might actually say.  The conversation with the Minister is there.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy MacSharry&rsquo;s point, I personally hold no personal angst against the Minister for Finance.  We are here a long time and we have good, friendly and cordial relations.  He came over to me last night during the course of the vote on the floor of the House to shake my hand and ask if we could make up and move on.  We shook hands and said, \"Let us move on.\"  There is no personal angst but there is a serious professional disagreement between us.  <\/p> <p>  I know people will be surprised by what I am saying.  In our report, there are two paragraphs out of 101 pages in respect of our comments on the Minister.  There are three full pages from the Minister on his view of what we had to say about him.  In fact, in terms of fairness, he has been given far more space for his views.  For anyone to suggest he did not have an opportunity, there are three pages of a letter from him on his views of the matter in our report.  That is more than fair play.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#F01700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I accept in the first instance that the Chairman used his judgment on all these issues and his intentions were honourable in how he dealt with all of the threats, I suppose, made against him personally as chair of the committee.  He is right that it is par for the course in terms of the role he sits in, and that this will happen from time to time.  However, to be fair to members of this committee, when we are preparing a report, if there is a threat of that nature from a Minister for Finance, we should be aware of it.  Certainly if there were threats from senior officials &ndash; and I think we should know who that senior official is because that senior official tried to thwart the work of this committee, not you personally as Chairman but all of us - we should have been made aware of that notwithstanding the Chairman&rsquo;s assertion that it strengthened us because we carried on regardless.  We would have done that anyway.  With respect, that information should have been shared with us, although I accept the Chairman used his judgment.

We felt pressure on this with the continuous leaks.  The person who leaked did it deliberately and shamefully and if he or she is within this room, I hope he or she looks within himself or herself.  I reiterate that we should have no more private meetings.  We should take the power back to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Second, we have three third level institutions waiting for us.  We have attended diligently, particularly the Chairman.  I realise as Chairman of an Irish language committee it is not easy.  There is additional pressure on him with constant correspondence from people.  We have been flooded with e-mails even in respect of the universities about serious issues.  People are calling themselves whistleblowers and so on.  We are the last hope for them and it is extremely difficult.  We are here now, we return for another meeting at 2.30 p.m. and we met yesterday.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman has gone through a number of issues.<\/p><p>The Minister had every opportunity last night to say the Chairman was not telling the truth or that he was wrong and he did not do so.  In fact, he left the Chamber.  I understand last night's debate was rearranged twice to facilitate the Minister being present.  When it came up last night, he came in and left shortly after his contribution.  He had an opportunity to contribute later and say that the Chairman was wrong about what he said and he did not take it.  Therein lies an answer.<\/p><p> To think that the Chairman was told that NAMA had a dossier on him referring to all his previous criticisms is truly shocking.  The fact that NAMA officials were speaking to him is in itself shocking because he is simply Chairman of the committee and we are all equal.  If NAMA, the Minister or any senior official had anything to say, they should have written to us and the Chairman should then have highlighted the correspondence, as he always does.  That was not done.  If we focus on the politics, that ignores the most serious threat to democracy.  From day one, I said the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was a rational, reasonable, mild report, which highlighted concerns about a sales process.  NAMA went into full attack mode rather than asking what is in this.  I believe it was not even read in total and they picked out a 10% or 5% discount rate and zoned in on that with tunnel vision as opposed to what the report was about, which was accountability and holding a system to account.  NAMA officials could have come in and said, \"We agree retrospectively.  We should have followed up the conflict of interest but we were under enormous pressure.\"  They did nothing like that and went on the attack over a small section.<\/p><p> The Minister did the exact same.  There are 32 conclusions and, in the D&aacute;il last night, he said we were \"conjuring up criticism\".  He said that twice.  I am delighted the Chairman has made up with the Minister because it is important to have cordial relations.  However, men shaking hands - or as I used to refer to them on the city council, the boys in the short pants - is not good enough.  It is good for them to do that and I am delighted for the Chairman but boys shaking hands does nothing for me and nothing for openness and accountability.  These are serious issues.  We need to deal with this serious threat to the committee and the democratic process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#F02300","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I have to leave in ten minutes for a short period and the Vice-Chairman will take the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#G00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>We now have elaborated on the position.

People can call me a cynic but I am not hugely surprised to hear that because the experience on this committee is that at a certain point during the previous term the system intervened, not because we were doing a bad job but we were doing too good a job and that caused a problem.

The University College Cork financial statements before the committee today relate to the financial year ending on 30 September 2014.  In that year, UCC recognised income of just over &euro;340 million.  Academic fee income totalling &euro;120 million represented over one third of the total, of that, some &euro;43 million was received directly from the HEA.  In addition, recurrent State grant funding from the HEA totalled &euro;47 million; and State funding for pensions amounting to &euro;55 million was also recognised.  Research grants coming from State bodies, the European Union and industry totalled &euro;79 million.<\/p> <p>The percentage distribution of income is included in my written submission.  The university&rsquo;s total expenditure in 2013\/14 was over &euro;345 million, with pay and pension costs accounting for nearly 74% of that figure. The result for the year was a deficit of almost &euro;5 million.<\/p> <p>  My audit opinion in respect of the UCC financial statements is qualified in two respects.  First, in regard to the recognition of some of the future pension funding receivable from the state and second, in relation to the non-consolidation of the UCC trust fund into the accounts of the university.<\/p><p>On future pension funding, the university has been in dispute with the Department of Education and Skills about one element of its pension funding.  The college agreed, for pension purposes, to award what are referred to as \"professional added years\" to certain staff recruited from elsewhere in the public sector.  The Department of Education and Skills has told the university that it will not meet that liability in its funding of the university.  Following the settlement of a legal case taken against the college by one retired staff member, the cost of the professional added years for transferred-in service was fully borne by the university from its non-Exchequer funding.<\/p><p> At the end of the 2013 to 2014 period, UCC estimated the total future cost of the disputed pension benefits at &euro;14.3 million, and included this amount in its deferred pension funding asset.  I concluded that the recognition of the &euro;14.3 million asset is not in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  I understand that contacts are ongoing between UCC and the Department to resolve this issue.  The president will be able to update the committee on any developments in that regard.<\/p><p> The second aspect of my qualified audit opinion relates to the failure to consolidate the results of the UCC trust fund into the accounts of the university.  The audit concluded that consolidation was required on the basis of evidence gathered of the university&rsquo;s ability to control the financial and operating polices of the trust fund.  The accumulated reserves of the trust fund stood at &euro;12 million on 30 September 2014.  The university has now indicated its intention to consolidate the results of the trust fund in its 2015 to 2016 accounts.<\/p><p> The audit certificate also draws attention to the non-consolidation of the results of Cork University Foundation Limited on the basis that the foundation is not controlled by the university.  The foundation&rsquo;s main purpose is to provide financial and other support to assist the university in delivering on its strategic goals.  It had accumulated reserves of &euro;5.5 million at 30 September 2014.  The foundation is identified as a related party in the university&rsquo;s accounts and some information is provided in note 28 on transactions between the university and the foundation.<\/p><p> The audit certificate also draws attention to disclosures in the university&rsquo;s accounts regarding specific instances of non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  The audit identified payments totalling &euro;616,000 made to eight suppliers during the year in respect of goods and services that had not been subject to competitive public procurement.<\/p><p> My recent special report on financial reporting in the public sector indicates that UCC was one of four universities that had not completed their financial reporting for 2013 to 2014 by the end of 2015.  UCC was the last of these audits to be certified, in December 2016, which was almost 27 months after the end of the period of account.  I am glad to report that some progress has been made with the 2014 to 2015 financial statements and I have just signed off on that audit.  The financial statements will now need to be finalised by UCC&rsquo;s audit committee and governing body, and I expect that the process will be completed by the end of April this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#H02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and call Professor Patrick O'Shea to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#J00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490860800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here.  I have recently returned from 37 years in the United States, working most recently at the University of Maryland.  Though just returned, I am fully aware of the financial constraints Irish higher education sector has been operating under for the past decade, and I think the people of Ireland and the Government are to be congratulated for their accomplishment and forbearance during this difficult time.<br\/><br\/>UCC has risen to these challenges with increasing student participation, increased graduate output, lower staff numbers and growth in income diversification to offset the reduction in State support.  While the university has provided briefing papers to the members on the areas the committee wishes to examine in detail, I will make the following comments on the overall financial performance during the period 2013 to 2014, while my colleagues will be in a position to provider greater detail to members during the session.<br\/><br\/>Income from operations was &euro;285.4 million and shows a decline of &euro;5.2 million, or 1.8% from the previous year, primarily due to the reductions in Exchequer funding in support of all teaching, learning and research activities.  While academic fee income has increased year on year, it did not increase to a level to keep pace with the Exchequer decline.  Research income recorded a welcome increase of &euro;1 million to &euro;79.4 million.  To offset the decline in income, expenditure at &euro;290.3 million is lower by &euro;4.7 million as the university reduced pay by &euro;1 million and operating costs by &euro;1.5 million, despite rising student numbers.  Depreciation is also lower by &euro;2.6 million, given the continued reduction in Exchequer grant support for the university&rsquo;s estate.  Overall earnings before depreciation, interest, tax and amortisation result in a surplus of &euro;4.4 million.  However, when adjusting for depreciation and amortisation, the net out-turn for the year on the income and expenditure showed a deficit of &euro;4.9 million, primarily due to a greater level of depreciation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>amortisation due to asset revaluation.  There was a delay in 2014 of total resolution of funding issues for the dental school and hospital, and there was the overall decline in State funding for higher education.  Reserves on the balance sheet following the performance in the year have declined to a surplus of &euro;138.1 million, comprising revenue reserves now of &euro;3.9 million and revaluation reserves of &euro;134.2 million.<br\/><br\/>In the longer term, the decline in capital support for the sector remains a major concern.  The existing recurrent funding model assumes continued Exchequer support for ongoing refurbishment, maintenance and infrastructural capacity needs.  The absence of same will seriously impact the quality of higher education and further increase the financial pressure on already reduced operational funding.  On funding policy, the sector urgently requires the ambition we all have for our young adults to be matched by implementation of one of the recommendations of the expert group on future funding for higher education, currently being considered by the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  In saying this, I acknowledge that legislators must make difficult choices with competing demands for limited resource allocation.  As pointed out by the chair of the group, Mr. Cassells, doing nothing for funding of higher education is no longer an option.  The changing geopolitical landscape presents some real opportunities for higher education.  There is a great opportunity for higher education to contribute strongly to the overall economic recovery.<br\/><br\/>I myself am committed to ensuring accomplishment, transparency and accountability for all taxpayer resources that flow to the institution.  I want to build trust between public, legislators and the university.  I want to increase the socioeconomic and ethnic diversity of our student population.  I am a strong supporter of what I call &ldquo;needs blind admission&rdquo;, which is that those who can pay should and those who cannot pay should be provided with necessary financial support to realise their potential.  I support the application of knowledge we create at the university for the benefit of the community, society and economy.  I am committed to increasing philanthropic funding for the university to leverage the contribution the State already makes to the university.  My own overriding goal and ambition for my tenure is that after my stewardship at UCC, we will be seen as a great modern metropolitan model of a research university that is dedicated to discovery and understanding of knowledge, its dissemination through education, and to application of that knowledge for the good for all people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Shea.

As such, when the trust fund that is there to support students, scholarly activity, access and so forth provides income to pay for that, the income arrives into the university and is included in the university's overall banking position and accounts.  The expenditure as a result of that income is also included in the university's accounts.  What is not consolidated is the balance of the fund that is invested.  That will be invested post the 2015-2016 accounts.  FRS 102 allows us, in the construct of that reporting standard, to be a bit more expansive on the face of the balance sheet between reserves that are restricted and those which are unrestricted.  Arguably, up until now, we would not have had that level of it.  In the prescribed accounts we have today, unrestricted reserves would not be as visible in the accounts that are there post-FRS 102 consolidation.  Our position is that once we have 2015 and 2016, which is up and running today, we will consolidate.  It is not as if we have not reflected the trust funds today in the accounts.

The financial statements before the committee in this session relate to Dundalk Institute of Technology's financial year ending on 31 August 2015.  I draw the committee's attention to the fact that the universities' end of year is end September.  The institutes all have an end of year of 31 August.  Dundalk Institute of Technology's total income for the year amounted to &euro;47.4 million.  State grant funding totalled &euro;16.3 million, which was approximately one third of the total.  Tuition fee income of &euro;18.7 million included fees paid by the State totalling &euro;3.6 million and student contribution income of &euro;10.1 million.  Expenditure in the year was &euro;48.7 million.  Of this, just under 70% was accounted for by staff costs.  A detailed analysis of expenditure is given in note 12 of the accounts.  The income and expenditure account indicates that the institute incurred an operating deficit in the year totalling &euro;1.3 million.  I point out in my audit report that this is the third successive year in which the institute has incurred a deficit, leaving it with an accumulated deficit at the year end of &euro;3.2 million.  The governing body addressed the question of its recurring deficits in note 26 and concluded that it remained appropriate at the date of signing to prepare the financial statements on a going-concern basis.  I also point out in my audit report that there was procurement by the institute totalling &euro;1.18 million worth of goods and services under arrangements that had not complied with standard competitive procurement procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I now call Ms Campbell to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#S00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490860800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>My colleagues and I thank the Chairman and members for their invitation to attend this meeting to discuss issues relating to Dundalk Institute of Technology's financial statements 2014-2015, specifically to address the accumulated deficit, non-compliance with procurement guidelines, and developments at Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, since the publication of these financial statements.  We have submitted detailed information to the committee in advance of this meeting on the matters for consideration.  Therefore, in my opening statement I will summarise the key points.<\/p> <p>  To put the accumulated deficit in context, it is important to note the severe cuts in funding to higher education as a result of the recession.  At DkIT, HEA funding was reduced by 34% between 2007 and 2012.  The institute managed to maintain a break-even financial position until 2012-2013, when an operating deficit of &euro;711,000 occurred.  From that point onwards, DkIT was no longer attracting sufficient income to meet its obligations.  Funding for apprenticeship blocks, for example, declined by &euro;2.5 million, and funding for nursing education reduced by &euro;1.4 million over the period.  Given that staff and support facilities were effectively fixed costs, it was unavoidable that financial challenges would arise.  A plan agreed with the HEA in May 2014 to address an underlying deficit from the previous year and return the institute to a balanced budget did not meet its objectives in that period for the reasons outlined in our written submission.  However, this plan did provide a foundation for savings in 2015-2016.  The institute recorded a net operating deficit in 2014-2015 of &euro;1.314 million, bringing the accumulated deficit to &euro;3.24 million.  A new three-year financial plan agreed with the HEA in January 2016 identified savings of &euro;2.074 million over a three-year period from 2015 to 2018 to bring the institute to a balanced budget.  The institute is pleased to report its draft accounts show an operating surplus of &euro;127,000 for 2015-16, and current estimates indicate the institute will again break even in 2016-2017.<\/p> <p>  The institute endeavours to ensure full compliance with procurement procedures and guidelines and is actively working with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to ensure that all procurement is in accordance with its model.  The general principle is that a competitive process should be carried out for all public contracts.  However, urgent and exceptional circumstances may arise which are unforeseen and have not arisen due to any action or inaction on the part of the contractor.  Regarding the procurement with supplier B in 2014-2015, such exceptional circumstances did apply, as set out in our written submission.  Regarding the other more significant items of non-compliance, DkIT considers that supplier C should not be included in the list of non-compliance as this refers to a student recruitment agency based in Beijing, and given both the nature of the service and the location, a tender process could not be run.  Regarding supplier D, the OGP had no framework in place for the service in question.  DkIT discussed the matter with the OGP and on its advice extended the contract.  The contract with supplier A was extended to provide additional necessary security at short notice, pending the procurement of a new contract.<\/p> <p>  Over the years, DkIT has delivered learning and teaching, research and engagement within budget and in good value-for-money terms for the State.  The institute's accumulated deficit, which arose as a result of deep cuts to its budget, represents 2% of its annual income.  As previously outlined, the institute achieved a small surplus in 2015-2016 and forecasts a balanced budget for 31 August of this year.  Such savings are achieved at a considerable cost, but the institute is resolute in its determination to return to sustainability so that it can continue to serve its learners and the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I offer a very warm welcome to the president and all the other staff of DkIT.  As a Deputy representing a Meath constituency, I am acutely aware of the role of DkIT as an institute of technology, its importance to the wider north-east region as an educational campus and its wider importance to the economy, not just of Dundalk, but more widely.  Denis Cummins came to Meath County Council when I was a councillor and spoke extensively to our economics department, and there was a liaison between Meath and Louth in that respect.  My brother graduated from DkIT this year, so I am acutely aware of the 5,500 students on its campus and the critical role the institute plays and hope its future is bright and very prosperous.<\/p> <p>  However, ensuring there is a future for DkIT is at the heart of what we are discussing, following on from the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.  Note 26 of the audit calls into question the going concern status of the institute in the medium term by virtue of a depletion of the reserves in line with those suffered during the period 2013-2015.<\/p><p>That would be alarming for the students in Dundalk, Drogheda and Navan - I know that 18% of DkIT's student base is in Meath - and their parents.  Ms Campbell noted that a plan had been put in place with the HEA, whose representatives are before us this morning, to stop the haemorrhage.  I want to go through those measures and their impact on the college but before we do so, can we address the accumulated deficit?  Despite the surplus for 2015-2016 that Ms Campbell referred to, and breaking even for the follow-on period up to the summer of this year, there will still be an accumulated deficit of &euro;3 million come August.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#S00700","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490860800,"counter":607,"content":"<p>That is true.  We have not been able to reduce the accumulated deficit since these accounts were published.  The accumulated deficit still stands.  Our priority under the plan agreed with the HEA was to return to a balanced budget by 31 August 2018.  We have been successful in achieving that.  In fact, in the last academic year we had a modest surplus of just over &euro;100,000.  I think it was &euro;120,000.  Our forecast suggests that we will at least break even this year.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy's earlier remarks on the importance of ensuring the future of the industry, I could not agree more.  We have to return to sustainability.  That has to be done in steps.  The first step is to ensure that we operate on a break-even basis and that we grow student numbers through measures that will hopefully at some stage include increased State funding, but also through measures for which we have to be responsible ourselves.  In our new strategic plan we are particularly targeting growth in the provision of life-long learning, growth in online provision and ensuring that international student recruitment continues to bring in money for the institute and to grow that area if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I want to talk about that, but before we get there, the first priority of the financial plan, to which Ms Campbell has referred, is getting the college back on an even keel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#T00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490860800,"counter":609,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":610,"content":"<p>Ms Campbell seems to be doing that, bringing DkIT to a year-on-year position of breaking even, but come the summer of next year, how is it envisioned that accumulated deficit will be tackled?

In terms of how costs are cut to try to break even, and to reflect on the impact of the loss of these services provided by the college, as Ms Campbell said, between 2007 and 2012, HEA funding to Dundalk was cut by 34%.  The students picked up the tab through increased contribution fees.  That is an immediate impact.  Then we see the strategy of not replacing identified retiring staff.  I think the staff complement is 500.  Will Ms Campbell indicate the number of staff shed in recent years?  One of the key points identified by the expert working group on higher education was that there cannot be a continuing policy of cutting staff numbers to meet this funding deficit.  If anything, it identified the need for the staff complement to increase by many thousands over the next five to six years.  That is why I am interested in probing this area and determining where DkIT stands.  Will Ms Campbell address, first, the reduction in staff complement over that period of time, and second, the plans to try to increase numbers while simultaneously needing to increase income?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#T00700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490860800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>It is very difficult to cut staff costs in an institute of technology because the majority of staff have permanent contracts or contracts of indefinite duration.  One of the reasons it takes time to address a deficit is that we can only save on staff costs through retirements.  In the current three-year plan, we identified certain posts - not all posts - that we would not replace.  These were primarily within areas where there had been a decline in student demand, for example, the number of our students studying engineering has dropped considerably because of the recession.  The majority of staff who have not been replaced were in those areas.  We have very careful planning in respect of where we can and cannot replace a staff member.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I was going to ask a follow-on question on the review of the school of engineering, because Dundalk always had a very good reputation in that respect.

There is no point in asking them to withdraw.<\/p> <p>  On this morning&rsquo;s meeting, I want to clarify an issue raised.  I mentioned an issue relating to the Minister for Finance, NAMA and officials in the House.  I wish to make clear that the two other external groups dealt with the potential for external legal challenges.  The issue relating to the House is quite different, but significant.<\/p><p>I ask people to bear with me on this as it may be news to them.  Senior people in the House made it very clear to me, as Chairman, that if they were not happy with the wording in the report, they would prevent it being issued and take it to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, to be approved by it.  That is what was said this morning.  This is not intended to imply that any official had attempted to interfere with the work of the committee, as has been reported in the media.<br\/><br\/>I want to outline the factual position.  In recognition of the fact that the decisions or actions of the committee can have legal and financial consequences, a protocol was adopted by the CPP and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission in November 2014.  That protocol, which is lengthy and will be circulated, includes the following, and I quote selectively for the purposes of clarity:<\/p><blockquote>Where the committee, the clerk to the committee or the relevant principal officer considers it necessary, procedural advice may be supplemented with legal advice from the Parliamentary Legal Advisor.  [We understand that].  Where a committee proposes to make a decision otherwise than in accordance with the advice from the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, it shall stand referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which shall consider the matter.  In such circumstances, the committee concerned shall take no further action until the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has reported on the matter and the House has considered that report.<\/blockquote><p>Standing Order 107(1)(<i>g<\/i>) requires that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges considers any report on a matter so referred to it.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make clear that given the sensitive nature of the report, officials were not only entitled, but obliged to bring to my attention the risk that the referral of our draft report to the CPP might be an outcome and to suggest that the draft report should be reviewed by the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor.  I wish to make it clear also that the advice given to me was provided to be of assistance, having regard to the content of the draft report among other matters and how those potentially affected might respond to publication.<br\/><br\/>The draft report, as I said earlier, was presented with my approval and I did not feel any pressure to make any changes to that or any veto.  However, members will be aware that consistent with the protocol and officials' advice, the committee had the benefit of the views of members of staff of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor in the course of a number of the meetings at which the draft report I brought forward was considered.  Members will agree that this was appropriate assistance and in no way interfered with the work of the committee.I hope members will agree this explains the situation.  I accept that my linking that particular inhouse Standing Order with the issues involving the Minister and NAMA may have given the impression that there was a legal threat internally in the House when what officials were saying to me was to draw my attention to a Standing Order of which many members may not be aware.  That Standing Order states clearly that where a committee proposes to make a decision otherwise than in accordance with the advice from the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, it shall be referred to the CPP.We would not have been aware that essentially had the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor not been happy with our report , in layman&rsquo;s English, the report would have been taken from us and given to the CPP for it to decide what action to take.  Under procedures in the House and the protocol agreed between the commission and the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, we would not have been in a position to complete or publish our report.  That was news to me; officials were bringing it to my attention not in any threatening manner, just to alert me to the fact that if it looked like causing a problem with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, this would be the likely outcome.  Members may not have been aware of that protocol and its implications.  Is that clear?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#JJ00100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":902,"content":"<p>Rather than going into this with the witnesses present, I suggest we proceed with the meeting and come back to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#KK00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":903,"content":"<p>I concur.

As shown In the figure now on screen, academic fees account for around one-third of the income.  Of the total &euro;86 million in fee income, almost &euro;29 million was received directly from the HEA.  In addition, recurrent State grant funding from the HEA totalled &euro;34 million; and State funding for pensions amounting to &euro;35 million was recognised.

The results of the UL Foundation have not been consolidated with those of the university group, on the basis that the university does not control the foundation, and notwithstanding that the main purpose of the foundation is to support education and research carried out by the university and other bodies associated with the university.  I draw attention in the audit report to the fact that at 31 August 2015, the foundation had net assets of &euro;15.1 million.

At this session, I hope to provide them with further detail on UL's financial statements ending 30 September 2015 and to address any further questions they may have.<\/p> <p>  As I approach the end of my term as president of UL, I wish to provide a brief overview of the university which it has been such a tremendous privilege and honour for me to lead over the last ten years.  UL is a large centre of academic activity and student life and is home to more than 14,000 students, a full-time staff of approximately 1,400 and a range of high profile thriving centres of research, learning, cultural and sporting excellence.<\/p><p> Employability has always been at the core of our teaching mission and it continues to be a central tenet of our distinctive approach to higher education in Ireland.  We pride ourselves on our reputation for delivering research that delivers impacts for industry, society and the wider community.  As a university, we are committed to continually raising the level of ambition of our staff and students.  We have worked through the difficult decade of funding constraints Irish higher education has experienced and remain in relatively good financial health mainly because of our efforts to build new income streams to sustain the university.<\/p><p> To deal with the matters at hand, I have provided a detailed statement to the committee in advance of today's meeting which addresses the matters highlighted in the invitation to attend, namely, the relationship with the UL Foundation, non-compliance with procurement guidelines and the HEA investigation into allegations regarding financial irregularities and HR practices.  I hope to provide reassurance to the members that in respect of the matters raised and in the context of the recommendations made by the HEA-commissioned Mazars report, UL has applied progressive systems changes that have further enhanced financial governance and HR practice in the university.<\/p><p> The committee has indicated that it wishes to examine the relationship between the University of Limerick and the UL Foundation.  Specifically, the question arises as to whether it is appropriate to continue to exclude the foundation from the consolidated financial statements of the university.  The University of Limerick does not have formal control, exercise control or have a dominant influence over the UL Foundation in accordance with the provisions set out in FRS 2 and the statement of recommended practice.  Following a review by the university, which is detailed within the briefing paper,  and a 2012 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the university considers it appropriate to continue to not include the UL Foundation in the consolidated financial statements of the university.  However, we recognise that philanthropic funding is an important resource in helping to widen the funding base of the university and we will continue to consider this issue annually when finalising the financial statements of the university.<\/p><p> As with all universities in Ireland, procurement within the University of Limerick is subject to legislative requirements in EU procurement directives which are enforceable under Irish law.  Systems improvements introduced by the university in 2014 have enabled us to do a full, 100% review of all our transactions in 2014-2015.  This review identified a number of issues, which in total amount to approximately a 2% of recurrent, research and capital expenditure.  In 2014-2015, the university procured 98% of spend on recurrent, research and capital costs in line with procurement guidelines and regulations.  As president, I am confident that the university has strong controls and systems in place and continues to introduce process improvements.<\/p><p> I turn to the HEA-commissioned Mazars report.  In the briefing paper circulated to members, I endeavoured to compile and provide a timeline of the objective elements, events and processes pursued by the university in advance of the commissioning by the HEA of the Mazars report.  As indicated in the paper, this has been a lengthy, complex and multifaceted process.  As such, the background to the process is not a matter I intend to repeat to the committee in this opening statement.  However, I assure the members that the University of Limerick is committed to an ethos of continuing improvement and it is in this context that we welcome the Mazars review and, in consultation with personnel and trade unions, that we have applied the lessons learned, implemented 12 of the 15 recommendations and are in the process of implementing the remaining three.<\/p><p> We remain mindful of the need to review our processes and procedures continuously in order to ensure that they adhere to best governance practice, both nationally and internationally.  As a key education stakeholder in Ireland and receiver of public funds, we are always cognisant of the need to be accountable for our actions and to operate in a transparent and fair manner.

The first step in the making of a claim is that an employee, having incurred expenses in the course of his or her duties, will prepare a claim.  The process then is his or her supervisor signs off on that claim - the supervisor would be aware that he or she would be travelling or whatever.  The claim, once approved by the supervisor, flows into finance then.  Within finance, the first port of call is the expenses administrator.  That was the post which was held previously by person A.  The expenses administrator will check the claim has been approved and is in accordance with policy.  Then, within our finance department, we have a structure, depending on where the claim originates, such as whether it is related to research or the recurrent budget or whether it is over a certain value.

We went back and looked at every sabbatical and worked out the length of time that people had spent outside of the country.

I do not believe there is a pattern or culture that indicates otherwise.<\/p> <p>  In answer to Deputy McDonald's earlier question, the allegations made by persons B and C were made in general sense and there were not specifics.  In the absence of specifics, we conducted a general review of travel and subsistence policy and its implementation within the university.  We brought in Deloitte to audit, and we made available to it all of our expense claims from March 2014 to August 2015, which we felt covered the period of the allegations.  Deloitte did not identify any issue.  I wish to give that assurance that it was an independent review and the company was given access to every expense claim it went through in that period.  Subsequent to the review being completed, in January 2016 persons B and C identified 69 specific transactions about which they raised concerns.  We reviewed all those transactions.  They were all ones which had been paid.  They differed from person A's allegations in that they were paid rather than unpaid.  They also differed in that persons B and C did not raise issues about having difficulty in getting them signed off, because as we have outlined, we changed the approval process so that it was an entirely online process.  The expense claim must be approved online or it does not progress to the next step and will not get paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017033000002#WW03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Field"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1443,"content":"<p>I have given Mr. Field a long time to answer the question but he has still not done so.

I thank members for being here.  The initiative we are trying to achieve is a single focus issue but a very important one, that is, the extent to which rogue counsellors and rogue agencies are, to put it bluntly, lying to women with crisis pregnancies.  Some of these agencies have been operating, on and off, for more than a decade.  Undercover journalism has disclosed the extent to which this so-called counselling involves lies, deceit and sometimes grotesque mistruths.  Women in crisis pregnancy situations are being told, for example, that abortion increases a woman's risk of breast cancer or that women who have had abortions will later abuse or neglect any children they might subsequently have.<\/p><p>My starting point is that it is no longer tenable to stand over a situation in which health care professionals such as dieticians and opticians must be regulated before they can offer any services to the public but those people who counsel women who are in vulnerable situations face no requirements to register, to be regulated or to be overviewed.<\/p><p>In the belief that new legislation is needed to regulate this area, after some consideration Labour chose the Health and Social Care Professionals Act as the vehicle for this proposed reform.  It is the vehicle best suited to deal with the elimination of rogue counselling agencies from the spectrum.<\/p><p>The Act applies to the newer health and social care professions outside the traditional core sectors of medicine and nursing, which as the Chairman knows very well is tightly regulated and always has been.  The Act establishes registration boards for those designated newer professions; it protects the use of the titles of those professions and it provides for the resolution of complaints relating to fitness to practice.<\/p><p>We recognised from the outset that there might be practical difficulties in applying this Act to crisis pregnancy counsellors.  The Bill was accepted by the Government and by the D&aacute;il on Second Stage.  I have discussed it several times with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who has been very helpful and supportive.  I thank the Minister and his officials for their support and ongoing engagement.  I appreciate his anxiety to co-operate on the Bill and to accommodate what he agrees is a much-needed reform.  The Minister for Health and I are at one with regard to the objective and we are trying to work out the best way of achieving that objective.<\/p><p>As we understood from the start, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act applies automatically to certain professions directly named in the legislation itself.  These include: chiropodists, occupational therapists, psychotherapists and psychologists.  These professions already have what we might call the infrastructure of a recognised and regulated profession, namely, a defined scope of practice, a representative professional body; defined routes of entry and recognised qualifications.<\/p><p>The Act then goes on to enable the Minister by regulation to designate additional health and social care professions.  He or she does so by reference to the stipulated factors.  In other words, the Minister assesses whether the profession has in place the infrastructure to enable it to be regulated.  Normally speaking, the path towards recognition and designation may take months, if not years, involving consultation, assessment, the satisfying of preconditions and so on.  That, however, is not the end of the matter.  Designation of a profession as suitable to be covered by the Act is just the start of a process that will only lead to full regulation some months later.<\/p><p>For the reasons that will be spelled out later to the committee, the Minister&rsquo;s approach is to designate counsellors generally, rather than trying to single out pregnancy counsellors and I do not oppose that approach.  It might be a better route.<\/p><p>I will leave it to the officials to spell out how much progress they have made to date on this project.  The Minister tells me that the Houses may have draft regulations to consider and approve before the summer recess and what work will then remain to be done.  I do appreciate that this is inevitably a methodical process.  I believe that part of our joint function is to ensure that progress is maintained on this matter, as a priority.  I remind the members of section 4(4)(<i>e<\/i>) of the 2005 Act.  It states that, in deciding whether it is appropriate and in the public interest that a particular health or social care profession be designated, regard must be had to &quot;the degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession&quot;.  That should be our overriding consideration as the giving of incompetent, unethical or impaired advice or counselling to vulnerable women with crisis pregnancies represents an unacceptable risk to their health and safety.  It is for this reason that immediate action is warranted.  I am glad that the Minister for Health agrees and that he has engaged so positively on this issue.<\/p><p>The progress achieved to date is not exactly along the lines proposed in the Bill but that is not the material point.  What is important is whether and to what extent we are making real progress and whether we can sustain that progress and see this matter through to a resolution.<\/p><p>There is a role for Government and Opposition and for the committee in all of this, as well as for the Department of Health.  I do not want to take up more of the committee&rsquo;s time than is necessary because I believe it could more usefully be spent in listening to a presentation, which is about to come from the Department's officials, as they map out their views and the steps and timelines for achieving a way forward.<\/p><p>There is one other aspect I should mention.  It relates to another Act with which I had some involvement when I served as Minister for Health a number of years ago.  That is the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995.Committee members will be aware that this Act arose from the 14th amendment to the Constitution, which enshrines in the Constitution that Article 40.3.3&deg; cannot be used to limit the freedom to receive and impart information about services available in another state, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law.  The 1995 Act lays down these specific conditions.<\/p><p>It seeks to balance the constitutional rights and freedoms bearing on the question of abortion information.  The legislation seeks to ensure that any doctor or advice agency that provides what is classified as abortion information to pregnant women does so only in the context of full counselling on all of the available options, without any advocacy or promotion of abortion.<\/p><p> Section 5 of the Act applies to anyone who engages in the activity of giving information, advice or counselling to individual members of the public regarding pregnancy.  The section states that where such a person is requested by a pregnant woman to give information, advice or counselling on her particular circumstances, it is not lawful for that person to give what is called \"Act information\" to the woman unless that information, counselling and advice are \"truthful and objective\".  However, it is important to bear in mind - this is something that I want to underscore for the committee - that the scope of the 1995 Act is confined to Act information.  This is defined as information likely to be required by women in availing themselves of pregnancy termination services.  In other words, Act information relates to that information which helps somebody have an abortion, that is, providing the name, address and telephone number of a foreign abortion service and so on.  The 1995 Act does not apply to more general information, such as information about the nature of abortion itself.  Therefore, if a rogue agency that seeks to restrict access to abortion provides women with information that is objectively and factually wrong and untruthful, it can do so in my view without breaching the 1995 Act.<\/p><p> I understand that the Department is considering the possibility, in the context of a designated and regulated counselling profession, of amending and perhaps broadening the terms of the 1995 Act.  Again, I will leave it to the officials to spell out what options are being considered.  I will not take up any more of the committee's time.  It may be unusual for the mover of a Bill and somebody who is very anxious to have it enacted to come before a committee and not argue for its urgent and immediate passage, but I know that the committee will want to hear from the Department.  If the members are satisfied that real and substantial progress, in accordance with a realistic timeframe, is being maintained towards a practical and workable solution, then it may be that the committee&rsquo;s best option would be to adjourn consideration of this particular Bill until we see what specific timelines and actions are to be made by the Minister for Health and his Department.<\/p><p> We are looking at a difficult issue and trying to find a solution.  In this Bill, I have put forward what I think is a good solution.  The Minister for Health has been thinking about this for some time since I have engaged with him.  He may have a slightly different solution.  To me, the objective is simply to find a solution rather than to have any particular legislation enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#E00500","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1594,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Howlin.

Fair play to her for that.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the agency that was most recently highlighted in the media and the sort of disgraceful information that it was giving to women in crisis pregnancy situations.  Is Deputy Howlin satisfied that said agency, given that it does not necessarily represent its staff as counsellors, will be covered by the Bill?  I am not going to name but it is not very far from here and we all know what we are talking about.  When we discussed this in the D&aacute;il, I think there was unanimity among all Deputies that these people prey on vulnerable women and need to be stopped.  We all want to ensure that, whatever is done, we do the right thing and the best thing for women in this.  Is the Deputy satisfied that the 1995 Act can be amended in order to shore up the sort of information that can be given?  My primary question is this: is the Deputy satisfied that the people operating the agency most recently in the media will be encompassed by this legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#F00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1596,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Howlin.  It is nice to see a Bill moving through the various Stages.  From an Opposition perspective, we very often put forward Bills knowing that they may not travel very effectively through the legislative process and may at times not be legislatively sound.  At the same time, however, they stimulate the debate and move the system to react and respond to the proposals being put forward.  From that point of view, I want to congratulate the Deputy in that context.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy O'Reilly stated, the very least that people in crisis pregnancy should be entitled to is correct information that is sound in its medical aspects and professionally delivered.  The Bill seeks to amend section 4 of the 2005 Act.  In that Act, professions are primarily regulated by the setting of qualification standards.  However, in the Deputy's proposal, it will not be set or regulated by qualification standards.  It will be measured by the activity and the advice offered.  Would that broaden the scope out to the point where there could be several professions and professional entities included beyond crisis pregnancy counselling, for example, a nurse or a GP, who would also very often give advice on these issues?  In the Deputy's discussions with the Department, is there a way around that?  Let us be very clear: many of the entities that we would like to regulate are ones that pop up and move on.  While the Bill has very noble aspirations, there are, and I hope that the Deputy can accept this, huge technical difficulties in the context of achieving its aim.  Is the Deputy willing to engage in a co-operative way to see this Bill amended to the point at which it would do what the Deputy and the committee would like it to do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#F00400","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1597,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy.

I would like to pay tribute to Ms Ellen Coyne, as Deputy O'Reilly did.  How would all of this be policed?

I believe it is hugely important that information made available needs to be accurate in general.  There is so much false information in every sphere of life that affects us all.  There is so much false information out in the open arena purporting to be well-meaning and soundly-based.  Of course, that is not always the case.  Where it affects the health of the community, and women in this context, it is particularly important that the information being made available is fair, even, balanced and factual.  The presentation of false information in that context can have serious consequences for the people to whom the advice is given.  In our business, we would often like to think that politicians should give fair, accurate and balanced information all of the time.  We believe that they do to the best of their ability, though we might question that from time to time.  This is a different issue altogether.  This affects people's health.<\/p> <p>  In light of our recent history, it is very important that we recognise the urgency of the need to regulate the extent and degree to which the information is being made available, regardless of who is making it available.  The theory is that professionalism should at all times prevail and that, as a result, there should not be a necessity to regulate.  However, as times goes by, there appears to be a necessity.<\/p><p>The general thrust of the Bill is to ensure, by way of legislation, that fair, accurate and balanced information is made available to women in sensitive situations, with particular reference to crisis pregnancies.  I know that the Minister is anxious to accommodate the Bill.  It would be helpful if it were included under the general umbrella of legislation affecting regulation.  I am not sure whether that can be done effectively or whether Deputy Howlin sees that as effective.  Either way, we should support the thrust of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#F00600","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1600,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their supportive comments.  I express my appreciation for the work done by journalist Ellen Coyle, Catherine Sands and by a colleague of mine, Sinead Ahern, who, in a difficult way, went undercover to hear exactly what \"information\" was being imparted.  <\/p> <p>  To pick up the point made by Deputy Durkan, can one imagine a vulnerable woman, not knowing what to do, being told that if she has an abortion she is likely to abuse any children she may have in the future?  It is shocking.  We need to ensure that any advice or purported health supports are given objectively, truthfully and factually.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how this will work, we looked at both the 1995 Act and the 2005 Act to see which we could address by way of amendment.  The 2005 Act looks at how to regulate the newest categories of health and social care professionals.  There are a range of new health and social care professionals alongside the traditional doctors and nurses who, for generations, have been regulated in what they can do.  In terms of Deputy Kelleher's point about GPs or nurses giving advice, they have professional standards and oversight.  They have a fitness to practise procedure and any complaint can be properly dealt with by their colleagues.  It is not that category of people that now need to be regulated, it is people who purport to be counsellors giving objective information through counselling agencies.  <\/p> <p>  At the core of what Deputy Kelleher and Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked is whether this approach will be watertight.  I do not know the answer to that.  That is why I have been engaging with the Department of Health.  This aims to regulate a profession.  It may be possible to get around this if a person does not set him or herself up to be a counsellor and states he or she is not providing information, .  People will at least be alert that they are not going to a professional counsellor if they are not regulated.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher asked about co-operation.  I have absolutely no objective other than to get this job done.  If there is an easy way of getting it done, I am all for it.  As Deputy Durkan pointed out, it would be really good if this could be done by way of statutory instrument that would not require legislation.  The Minister is working on that.  We need to ensure that it is comprehensive and watertight to extend the categories through statutory instrument, which the Minister has the power to do.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked about the policing of this.  All the new categories of health care and social care professionals are regulated by the overarching new registration authority, CORU.  The idea is that a person captured by the 2005 Act will be subject to registration and regulation by a statutory agency.<\/p> <p>  I think I have touched upon all questions that were put.  I am interested in hearing the views of the Department and the Minister.  My only objective and my encouragement to the committee members is to ensure that this is not put on the long-finger.  I do not believe that is the intention of the Minister.  Hopefully, before the summer break we will have draft statutory instruments before this committee for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#G00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1601,"content":"<p>Is it possible to define specifically what a pregnancy counsellor is?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#G00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1602,"content":"<p>Those who hold themselves out to be counsellors can be regulated.

However, one knows what one is getting there.  If one goes to a family member, a priest or member of the clergy, one knows upon what it is based.

I am assistant secretary in charge of national HR division in the Department of Health.  I am joined by Ms Deirdre Walsh, principal officer, Mr. Kieran Duffy, assistant principal officer, from the professional regulation unit of my division, and Ms Geraldine Luddy, principal officer, bioethics unit, which forms part of the office of the Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer.<\/p><p> The Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2016 seeks to amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  While I do not intend to go into details on the provisions of the 2005 Act in my opening statement, it is important to give the joint committee a brief overview of the 2005 Act, as this is key to considering the amendments proposed in the 2016 Bill.  The information brief furnished to the committee also provides detailed background information on the operation of the Act and progress to date on the regulation of the designated professions.<\/p><p> Regulation under the 2005 Act is primarily accomplished through the statutory protection of professional titles by confining their use solely to people who have been granted registration.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, known as CORU, which has overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  CORU is Ireland&rsquo;s only multi-profession health regulator, with 14 professions currently designated for regulation under the Act.  Government policy is to conclude, by late 2018, the regulation of the 14 designated professions and to designate by regulation in the coming months the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist for regulation under the Act.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2016.  Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s primary concern, as shared by others, is to better protect women who are experiencing crisis pregnancies and seeking support at a time of extreme distress and vulnerability.  He seeks to ensure crisis pregnancy agencies and individual counsellors offering crisis pregnancy counselling do so responsibly.  This concern is shared by Government and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has advised the D&aacute;il that officials will work with Deputy Howlin to address these concerns.  Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Bill seeks to amend section 4 of the 2005 Act to address the issue of persons who masquerade as counsellors, providing information on crisis pregnancy that is clearly neither truthful nor objective.  The Bill seeks to do this by adding crisis pregnancy counsellor to the list of 14 professions designated for regulation under section 4 and to define the scope of practice of a crisis pregnancy counsellor by regulating the activity engaged in.<\/p><p> As outlined in detail by the Minister, Deputy Harris, during the debate on Second Stage, there are a number of policy, legal and implementation difficulties with the detail of these proposals.  First, the Bill seeks to establish crisis pregnancy counsellors as a profession separate and distinct from counsellors as a whole.  Crisis pregnancy counsellor, not being a distinct profession, does not meet the criteria for designation nor does it fulfil the legislative requirements with regard to implementation by way of establishment and population of a professional registration board and maintenance of a professional register.  It is intended that the priority work currently under way on the designation in the coming months of counsellors generally by way of regulation under the 2005 Act, will encompass crisis pregnancy counsellors as part of this profession.  This does not require an amendment to the primary Act and will provide an opportunity to assist in addressing Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s concerns.<\/p><p> The amendment Bill also seeks to regulate crisis pregnancy counsellors by way of defining the activity engaged in.  However, the activity outlined is also undertaken by a variety of other regulated professionals who may include doctors, nurses, social workers and psychologists.  The 2005 Act regulates professions by way of setting qualifications and protecting title, and not by activity or scope of practice.  There are very sound policy and legal reasons for this.<\/p><p> The amendments to the 2005 Act proposed in the Private Members' Bill would not prevent rogue crisis pregnancy counsellors from deliberately providing incorrect information.  Registration under the 2005 Act is voluntary.  While it is an offence for non-registrants to use protected titles, rogue practitioners, including those struck off the register for professional misconduct, could get around this by using an alternative title such as adviser.<\/p><p> Scope of practice is ever changing as education, training and the impact of technology on health and social care professions evolves, as indeed it should do.  The activities engaged in by a number of professions can overlap and the professions are often regulated by different regulatory bodies with differing legislative provisions.  Defining in primary legislation the scope of practice or the activity engaged in by a health profession, or both, has the potential to hinder health professionals working to ever-expanding scopes of practice, something which is vitally important in the delivery of services across all health settings.   It would also result in primary legislation having to be amended on an ongoing basis as scope of practice evolves and, most importantly, to ensure those working to an expanded scope of practice did not find themselves being brought to fitness to practise arising from their scope of practice being rigidly defined in primary legislation.<\/p><p> Introducing a defined scope of practice for one profession under the 2005 Act would undermine the entire legislative construct of the 2005 Act which is based on protection of title and not defined activity.  If the 2005 Act were amended to define activity for one profession, it could give rise to similar amendments being sought by some or all of the other 14 designated professions.  This could restrict entry to the professions and pose significant legislative and practical difficulties given that their scope of practice overlaps, in part.  As in the case of crisis pregnancy counsellor, defining the activity or scope of practice of these professions in primary legislation could also result in restricting their delivery of services on the ground and complicate implementation of the 2005 Act&rsquo;s fitness to practise provisions.<\/p><p> With regard to other technical matters, the Bill as drafted does not provide for a number of key requirements such as the critical issue of setting grandfathering qualifications, a challenging but essential requirement for the registration of existing practitioners.  When a designated profession is being regulated for the first time, the level of grandparenting qualifications to be set will determine the number of existing practitioners who will be granted registration.  In addition, provision would also have to be made for the establishment of a 13-person registration board and a range of consequential amendments that would have to be made to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.<\/p><p> During the Second Stage debate on the amendment Bill last November, the Minister, Deputy Harris, in his desire to be constructive and make progress on this matter, detailed a sizeable and important body of work to be undertaken over a period to give consideration to better protecting the public from certain crisis pregnancy agencies or counsellors that are providing information that is clearly neither truthful nor objective.  He committed to making progress through the forthcoming registration of counsellors, the existing Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995, and the review of this Act.<\/p><p> With regard to the regulation of counsellors, having consulted the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, as required under the 2005 Act, and having proceeded to public consultation in September 2016, 84 submissions were received by the closing date of 30 November 2016.  Following examination, it is envisaged that the next steps in the statutory regulation of the professions under the Act will commence in the coming months with the submission of draft designation regulations to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will be followed by the establishment and appointment by the Minister of the 13-member registration board charged with establishing the registers, which in turn commences the two-year transitional period, after which only registrants will be permitted to use the protected titles.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995.  This Act prescribes the conditions for making available information to pregnant women and the public about services lawfully available outside the State for the termination of pregnancies.<\/p><p>During the Second Stage debate on the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2016 the Minister undertook to have the Bill reviewed by the Department to establish whether its provisions needed to be strengthened.  The review is ongoing and a range of possibilities are being examined.  Subject to the views of the Attorney General, for example, it may be possible to amend the Act to ensure only registered professionals would provide service under it.  In particular, this might be feasible if, as expected, it were to be decided to proceed with the statutory regulation of counsellors.  This would be looked at in tandem with forthcoming decisions on the statutory regulation of counsellors.<\/p><p> It is important to note in relation to publicly funded crisis pregnancy services, that under the crisis pregnancy programme in the HSE a framework for crisis pregnancy counselling services was developed.  The standards were designed in line with HIQA's national standards for safer and better health care and consist of eight themes broken down into 28 essential elements.  The framework commenced in 2015 and there is a requirement to implement it in the HSE's funded services.  This requirement is outlined in the signed service agreements between the HSE and the individual service providers.  However, the agencies that seek to manipulate women by providing \"disingenuous\" crisis pregnancy counselling services have, in the main, been private establishments that appear to set up and close down over short periods and have no linkage with State funded services.<\/p><p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, committed to keeping Deputy Brendan Howlin informed on matters as work progressed.  He wrote to him on 11 January 2017 and departmental officials also met the members of his team on Wednesday, 8 March to engage further on the matter.<\/p><p> I hope my statement has assisted the committee in appreciating what appears to be a short and straightforward Bill but which, in fact, poses significant policy, legal and practical difficulties in the operation and ongoing implementation of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2015 and the regulation of health and social care professionals in general when the broader context is considered.  I reiterate that it is the Minister's intention to address the serious issues involved by working through the sizeable and important body of work under way.  My colleagues and I will be happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1616,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cody for her opening statement and will now take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#M00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1617,"content":"<p>I, too, thank Ms Cody for her presentation.

The major issue is the revelations in the media of how vulnerable women were treated.

The Bill has been designed to target a specific group of rogue counsellors or whatever name one wishes to call them who prey on vulnerable women at a particularly vulnerable time in their lives.  Could the legislation be amended or tweaked to ensure it would encompass the people who put the issue on the agenda in the first place?  We all know who they are and from where they operate.  I am not convinced that they necessarily call themselves counsellors.  My fear is that reputable counsellors, men and women who give good solid advice to women in a crisis pregnancy, will now have to pay a fee for registration.  I am not saying it is necessarily a penalty, but those who are doing it correctly and well and their best to try to help women will be subject to regulation, while at the same time those who should not be let near women in a crisis pregnancy will not be encompassed by the legislation.

While the Act does not define the scope of a practice, each registrant signs a code of professional conduct and ethics, whether as a dietician, a speech and language therapist or a counsellor, to say he or she will work in accordance with his or her qualifications, skills, knowledge and competence.  If a complaint is made against him or her, it will become part of the fitness to practise process.  What the Senator is asking is how will one be able to prove the complaint in such a scenario.  First, it will have to be looked at by the preliminary proceedings committee to establish whether there is a <i>prima facie<\/i>case to be answered.  The Senator is correct in saying it is difficult to define it, but let us say it goes through the fitness to practise process and it is established that the person concerned did act outside his or her qualifications, competence or skill and give inaccurate advice.

That is the easier part to set.  It is not very easy, but it is easier.  One establishes a standard, be it at level 8, level 7 or whatever.  That is for new people going into education to pursue that profession.  The difficulty arises with the vast number of people who are already practising, who have a range of qualifications and none.  In the consultation process we are looking at the grandparenting qualification.  We must arrive at a qualification standard that will capture a sufficient amount of people who are currently practising.  One of the matters coming through in the consultation process is that, given the nature of counselling and psychotherapy, it will have to be a uniquely devised grandparenting, multilayered approach.  It could be people who have a qualification, not of a very high standard, and 30 years of safe practice; it could be people who have quite a high qualification and a very good standard.

The Minister has given an opinion to the effect that it might be possible to accommodate what is contained in the Private Members' Bill under the umbrella of existing legislation.  How feasible is that?  It is important that the information being made available to somebody where there could be health implications be accurate, fair and balanced and, importantly, not lead to health consequences that, for whatever reason, might impact on the women concerned at a later stage.  Perhaps the witnesses would outline what they would regard as a crisis pregnancy.  A number of situations come to mind.  If I were a counsellor and I was anxious that the legislation would accurately reflect what I was doing, I would like to know exactly what I could and could not do.  If the intention was to depart from what is legally compliant, what measures would be in place to collect or entrap the information that I was giving with a view to ensuring that it did not have a negative impact on the health or well-being of the women concerned?  I say that against the background of a number of incidents that I can recall in recent years relating both to treatment in hospitals, following treatment or advice from individuals, and subsequent treatment by individuals, some of whom were professionals and some who were not.  There should be a very careful assessment of who has the right to operate and of the guidelines, rules and regulations within which they must operate.  It is not just a social issue.  It is a health issue as well and it can have health and psychological consequences.  What are the witnesses' views on that?<\/p> <p>  In the opening statement there is a reference to the crisis pregnancy counsellor not being a distinct profession.  It probably is not a distinct profession but the advice given in that area will have to have some type of health or medical basis in certain circumstances.  Not all circumstances are the same.  There are different situations.  Again, I can think of at least one situation where a certain set of circumstances prevailed.  I do not know whether advice was or was not given or whether action was or was not taken, but certainly the consequences were serious for the individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#N01300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490860800,"counter":1637,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, committed to making progress on the forthcoming registration of counsellors, which we mentioned and on which Ms Walsh will expand further, and also on the review of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995.

That is a very individual issue relating to the woman or the couple involved.  For some women, a crisis pregnancy may be because of all sorts of reasons.  It might because the woman has had two children, is now having a third and the first is nine months old.  There could be all sorts of reasons.  Not all of them will go to counselling for their crisis because it may only last an evening or a night or because they have other support systems in place.  That is a more generic sort of issue.<\/p> <p>  The 1995 Act with the very long Title is an Act designed to do a very narrow thing.  It is designed for and applies to women with a crisis pregnancy who wish to seek information about services outside the State for a termination of pregnancy.  It is quite narrow.  It regulates that information.  The Act states very clearly that when information of that nature is given out, the accompanying non-directive information has to be truthful and objective.  If there is a breach of that Act, it is against the law.  However, under section 10 of the Act, in order to activate that, the individuals would have to take that complaint to the Garda themselves.  That is already covered in the Act.<\/p> <p>  With regard to crisis pregnancy counsellors, they are a distinct profession but more and more, they are people who provide a counselling service.  The Act obviously covers people who can give advice: doctors, nurses, psychologists and counsellors.  Those in the counselling service industry would say that they would really welcome the regulation of counsellors because it would set them with a criterion and would mean that their own profession is protected in some ways.<\/p> <p>  It is very difficult to capture the rogue agencies or the disingenuous agencies.  They pop up and close down fairly quickly.  They then open up again under another name in a different place.  The crisis pregnancy programme does advertise its services quite well.  If women google such terms as \"abortion\", \"I am pregnant\" or \"I have a crisis pregnancy\", the Positive Options services will hopefully pop up first.  It has worked with Google and is paying to outbid the word so that its services will come up first.  Obviously, the disingenuous agencies are also doing that.  That is a constant that is kept under review.  It is doing its best.  As has been mentioned before, it is very difficult to stamp it out completely.  What we have to do is try to cover any angles that we can.  We will certainly look at amending the 1995 Act, when counsellors have been regulated under the 2005 Act, to state that it is only registered counsellors that may give this information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017033000002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Luddy"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1641,"content":"<p>With regard to giving counselling advice from a general practice point of view, we are advised to give non-directive counselling.

I also welcome Mr. Barry Quinlan, Mr. David Walsh, Ms Nina Murray, Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa and Ms Mary Hurley.  We will proceed straight to questions.  I call Senator Boyhan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#C00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1668,"content":"<p>We are dealing with Pillar 3 and I wish to comment on 3.1 which relates to the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and then I will ask three questions about 3.6, 3.8 and 3.9.  I do not wish to miss the opportunity to say well done to all involved in LIHAF, which was very impressive.  We had a discussion about these three pillars in the Seanad with the Minister responding.  Now we are having a discussion with the officials and I am very interested to see whether there are nuances or differences between the responses.  We were told the LIHAF might be available at the end of the month, but it made for very interesting reading.  If one looks at the document, Rebuilding Ireland, it is about having a focus.  We must not lose sight of the fact there is an ambition to build a substantial number of new homes, 47,000 new units, up to 2021.  When one reads the document concerning LIHAF, one realises it is talking about the expectation for the longer term way beyond 2021.  If one reads anything in the media about it, they have identified places beyond that period.  It is good and positive news.  One could get into a debate about where it will all end and who, ultimately, will be living in those homes.  That is another day's work, but in terms of delivery, Rebuilding Ireland is on track and I acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  In the description of action No. 3.6 it is stated: \"We will legislate to enable larger housing development applications (100+ units) to be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la\".  The officials are aware of it and the fast-tracking process so I will not go on at length about it.  That was one of the key reasons the Minister gave for wanting to get the legislation through, and not one application has been or can be made under the scheme.  It is not likely to happen for some months.  That must be a disappointment for the Minister and for everyone involved because having a fast-track approach was a key plank of Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p><p>During the debate, we were also assured that we would have a fine-tuned An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that e-planning would be on stream and that we would have regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's report.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la had an internal report compiled.  There were many recommendations made in that regard.  These matters are not progressing as fast as everyone would like.  I understand that there are processes and that things slow down but I really would like some sort of comment on this matter because it is really important.<\/p><p> Action No. 3.8 states, \"We will develop and publish an Implementation Plan\".  I have already covered that and the key recommendations of the plan in respect of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Will Mr. McCarthy comment on that and on where matters stand in respect of it?<\/p><p> Just to wrap up, action No. 3.9 states, \"We will support the development of on-line planning services\" with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Again, this hinges on fast-tracking, which was the most important thing on the Minister's mind at that time, besides the homeless and the emergency responses required.  We are glad to see that measures in that regard have begun to be rolled out and that people are getting housing.  What is the timeframe involved in light of all the setbacks and given what Mr. McCarthy now knows?  How is it all going to happen and when is it all going to happen?  I am speaking specifically about the fast-track housing scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#C00300","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1670,"content":"<p>I am also keen to get an update on the implementation of fast-track planning.  That would be useful.  I would like to raise three other issues.  Obviously, one of the actions under this pillar is the report into the overall cost of private housing construction - not just construction but the all-in costs.  Can we get an update on the progress of that work?  Could we also have an indication of whether it is the intention when the report comes, for it to come with policy recommendations, which will then be considered by the Department and Government?  Any information Mr. McCarthy has on that would be very useful.<\/p> <p>  On the local infrastructure housing activation fund - to avoid acronyms because I got into trouble the last time - there are two concerns which many of us have expressed from the start, although, again, I think the scheme is a good idea in principle.  The first issue is, notwithstanding the general comments about affordability in the launch documentation from earlier this week, there is no clear obligation on the private developer who will benefit from this infrastructure investment to provide homes in a certain price range.  If I am wrong, I would like to be corrected but certainly, looking at a number of the LIHAF projects in Dublin, including the two in my constituency, there is no way of knowing at this stage what the price range of the properties would be at the Grange or at the Clonburris SDZ, for example.  The same point could be made in respect of the Hines site in Cherrywood.  The first concern is, while the infrastructure fund is a good idea, it is only a good idea if it not only produces a return in terms of housing units, but if those housing units are affordable.  I would like to hear Mr. McCarthy's response to that.<\/p> <p>  My other big criticism of the scheme is that it is a very small amount of money over the three or four years.  That has been proven by the scale of the applications.  I think the amount involved is &euro;800 million.  Does Mr. McCarthy know if it is the intention of the Minister to review whether there will be a second round?  How many of the projects that were not successful would have been successful on the criteria if there had been a larger fund?  How many of them would just not have been successful?  I am not asking Mr. McCarthy to name the projects but to give us a sense of what is involved.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there is the thorny issue of house completion figures, to which we will continue to return.  I am still really concerned that the methodology for calculating the figures, including the figure of 15,000 for last year, is wholly inadequate.  I know that Mr. McCarthy has received freedom of information requests and all sorts of other things from a number of external experts, but I am specifically keen to discover if the Department knows how many estate homes were completed and registered with the building control management system database in 2016.  That is what we are really trying to find out.  If we had that figure, we would be able to compare it to the number of ESB connections to see what we are actually looking at in terms of completions.  How many estate homes were completed and registered on the database in 2016?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#D00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1671,"content":"<p>Basically, the main point, which has already been mentioned, is in respect of when the fast-track planning process will be implemented.

On 9 March, Mr. McCarthy spoke to this committee on Pillar 3, regarding active land management planning reforms.  I am aware that every local authority has been written to about their landbanks.  My biggest issue is that I have gone through this with local authorities and we have, through the Department, developed a spatial strategy, which is based on our population.  We have dezoned.  We have constantly been dezoning land in recent years.  We are now in a time of need and crisis and there is so much dezoned land.  I asked the Minister about this and he was not aware of it.  I have gone through it with the local authorities.   We were told by the Department to pick a particular area, to start from inside that area and dezone what was outside it, which we did.  We started with the population inside and then we dezoned anything outside the boundary.  What is the Department actually going to do about these dezoned lands?  Some of the land in question belongs to local authorities, some to builders or farmers.  What will the Department do about this because, and as previous speakers have said, it is crucial?  I know that the Department has written to the different local authorities seeking information.  What is the plan going forward in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#D00500","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1674,"content":"<p>I have one question following on from that.  I am probably being parochial now, but I know that in D&uacute;n Laoghaire we have enough land zoned for residential development for 33,000 units, including land that is partially serviced, fully serviced or not serviced at all.  The land is predominantly serviced, enough for 18,000 units.  We were told, in the context of the previous development plan, that was enough and that there was no requirement to rezone any further land.  We were also informed that there was enough land zoned residential nationally and that there was not a requirement in that regard either.  Will Mr. McCarthy clarify the position for the committee?  That would be great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#D00600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490878800,"counter":1675,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators.  I will take some of these questions and I might ask Mr. Walsh to come in on some elements of LIHAF and on the fast-track planning process.  In terms of the fast-track planning process, when I was last here, we had some discussion on this.  There were a number of things that needed to be done and there are a few bits that still need to be done in terms of regulations and other issues.  The final, critical piece in that was the completion of the work being done by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is an eight-week period that kicks on from that.  That work has been done, so the intention at this stage is that process will kick off in the second week of May.  Mr. Walsh might comment on some of the issues relating to fees in a moment.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the e-planning action to which Senator Boyhan referred, this is tied in to the other planning Bill before the D&aacute;il, rather than the legislation that was dealt with before Christmas.  The one that was dealt with before Christmas sort of bumped the other one back.  It is a matter of legislation and getting time to move that Bill through, but I think  Committee Stage is to be taken before Easter, I believe on 12 April.  The intention is to try to have that legislation through the Houses by the summer so that we will be in a position to still deliver e-planning in accordance with the timeline we had envisaged.<\/p><p>We are trying to ensure the delay in the legislation does not give rise to a delay in the timeline for implementation of e-planning, which was going to be in quarter 3 or quarter 4 anyway.  We are continuing to work on that and I know An Bord Plean&aacute;la is very active in the space and is aiming for quarter 3 for its online capacity.<\/p><p> On the costs issue raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, two pieces of work are running in parallel and are designed to be completed by the end of quarter 2.  One is being led by the Department and involves a range of stakeholders.  It is looking at the range of the key component costs of housing construction, all the way from land through to different planning standards and design standards, the impact levies can have and, crucially, the whole issue of the cost of financing.  We are trying to look at it in as rounded a way as possible because there can sometimes be an element in the debate on the cost of construction whereby different parties will say, \"It is not us; it is that other element\", and it tends to bounce around the place.  This is an effort to try to look at all of the key elements so we can come to conclusions.  We want to look at it in different contexts because the costs and the other elements can be different in city centre contexts, where there is more apartment-type development as opposed to more traditional housing duplex-type arrangements in suburban areas.  It will look at those two different contexts as well.  The second piece of work is being led by the Housing Agency, which is looking at the Irish cost position versus the position in some other countries, so we have some sort of international benchmark with which to compare.<\/p><p> The intention is that both pieces of work will be concluded by the end of quarter 2.  Our intention after that is to take the lessons and issues coming out of that work and to move them into the policy consideration space very quickly so we can come to conclusions.  It is important to say we are not starting from point zero.  Some of the initiatives that have been taken, including the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, scheme, are designed to take out some of the cost elements that would otherwise arise and have to be ultimately factored in to house prices - for example, the apartment guidelines that have been introduced will certainly have a positive impact on cost without impacting on quality.  There is a lot of work in train that will have an impact but, as I said, the purpose is to look at this in as rounded a way as we possibly can in quarter 2 and we will certainly be aiming to act very quickly on whatever emerges from those two related pieces of work.<\/p><p> With regard to the house completion figures, as we said in our monthly reports, which put out a range of housing-related statistics, house completion statistics for the past 40 years or more have been based on ESB connections.  While that is a long-standing proxy we have used, it is not the only indicator of activity we rely on.  The building control management system, BCMS, is now very helpful in terms of giving us commencement data.  It is not so helpful at this stage in terms of giving us completion data by virtue of how notices can be filed and how they can relate to different developments, but we are examining whether we can develop it further in order to provide additional data.  As I said, we have used ESB connections as a proxy for completions for 40 years and we have good commencement data coming from the BCMS system.  We also have planning permission data compiled by the CSO and, moving one stage further back in the pipeline, there is the whole land issue, on which we have some data.  We have not presented that data well at times, so over the next three months we will be going through three or four layers of mapped data that will help to put a better sense on the process, and this will be publicly available on a web browser.  Therefore, we have a range of indicators.<\/p><p> There has been a lot of talk around completions, including some units that might have started perhaps five ago but have been stalled because of the economic situation.  We have been publishing data on that as well.  We have done an annual survey every year for the last six years on unfinished housing developments to track how such unfinished housing developments have been progressively becoming more completed.  Similarly, that sort of data will be reflected in the completions.  When we started putting out the new monthly reports, one of the critical points we included was that we wanted to hear from people who have views in regard to our statistics, for example, if they have issues or if they think there is a way in which we could present the statistics better.  We certainly want to hear from people and we have had engagement with a range of parties, including some of the commentators who have been critical in regard to the statistics.  That is a process we are committed to continuing because, at the end of the day, data and information are crucial for getting us to where we want to be in terms of ensuring we have the right policies and are drawing the right conclusions.<\/p><p> I will ask Mr. David Walsh to come in shortly to address some of the questions on LIHAF and the fast-track planning process.  Deputy Ellis raised issues in regard to CPOs.  The use of CPOs varies between different local authorities.  For example, Louth County Council has used CPOs quite effectively in compulsorily acquiring not quite, but maybe not far off, derelict properties that are the precursor to our buy-and-renew scheme.  Very often, the CPO process can be effective from a legal point of view in regularising messy issues around title.  In terms of housing acquisitions, to the extent we have had them and to the extent they are programmed into activity over the next while, I am not hearing from local authorities that they need to resort to CPOs to underpin that level of acquisition activity.  In the same way we have given funding to Louth County Council for acquisitions it has made through CPOs, we are not hugely hung up on whether a local authority uses a CPO or just enters into a normal transaction.  If it is an acquisition and it makes sense, we will provide the funding for it.<\/p><p> In terms of public-private partnerships, some 1,500 units will be delivered by 2021 under the public-private partnership programme.  In order to be able to progress it in chunks, we have split that 1,500 into three different bundles.  The Deputy will be familiar with bundle 1, which Dublin City Council is leading on behalf of the relevant local authorities, and for which the National Development Finance Agency is the financial adviser and will be the procuring authority.  That is the most advanced bundle and the intention is that the procurement process will kick off in quarter 2 this year - my colleague might correct me if I am wrong on that.  Bundle 2 is a little further behind and we are working on identifying the sites for bundle 3, which will move on after that.<\/p><p> It is a different PPP approach to the type of PPP approach that would have been used and that perhaps fell apart back in 2008-09, when the economy went downhill.  It is designed as an off-balance sheet approach which provides us with the capacity to move beyond the constraints of the Government's balance sheet, so we can actually deliver more social housing units than would otherwise be the case.  That is the prime intention behind it.<\/p><p> Senator Murnane O'Connor and the Chairman raised the issue of land and, in particular, the de-zoning of land.<\/p><p>One of the data sets that I mentioned, which we will be putting out on our map system over the next three months, is what we call the outcome of the land availability survey.  That will show how much area is zoned residential and what is the housing capacity attaching to that across the country.  When the economy went downhill, there was gross over-zoning and what was coming down the tracks potentially was a certain amount of leapfrogging, as the Senator described it.  The urban form might get to a particular point, followed by a sudden gap and with housing development taking place further out with all of the infrastructural cost associated with it, not to mention the less than perfect planning.<\/p><p> There was an engagement with local authorities on the need to reduce the amount of zoned land and to strike the right balance between trying to ensure there is enough zoned land and that there can be a competitive land environment without being in an over-zoning space.  I do not have the data in front of me but my recollection is that nationally, the residential land availability survey is telling us that there is enough zoned land for about 440,000 or 450,000 units which, if the housing supply that we want to get to is about 25,000 units per annum, is approximately 20 years' worth of supply.  This will all be mapped and be highly visible.  There is currently more than enough land zoned to meet short and medium-term housing needs.  I might ask my colleague Mr. Walsh to come in on some of the more on both fast-track planning and on the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490878800,"counter":1678,"content":"<p>On future population and demand requirements for land, the big benefit of having a new national planning framework to replace the national spatial strategy, NSS, is that there is a clear, evidence-based and sequential approach to where we estimate the growth demand will be.

The question is where should they be and whether we have the land, associated infrastructure and services to back it up.  As the Secretary General stated, too much land was being developed with no real connection back to urban centres.  As part of the national planning framework, which will look very nationally and at a quite a high level, there will be regional spatial economic strategies that will flow from that and on which work has already begun.  The same data will be used to sweat it down across the three new regions.  The next step is for each county to reflect and ask what the likely growth will be.  There will be six-year development plans and the norm to safely have enough land to allow for flexibility where some development may not happen for different reasons is to have between 12 and 15 years of land supply.  That would be a minimum requirement as part of any development plan, that a local authority can say that they can manage and deliver the next 15 years, assuming some of it may not happen over that period.

As the Secretary General said, 10 May 2017 is the start date.  I will try to give a sense of what has happened since the Bill was enacted before Christmas.  As soon as we came back after the Christmas break, intense negotiations took place between the Department, the board and local authorities on key issues of how the interaction would happen.  The last thing we wanted to do was to push something in that was half-thought through, that did not have the actual structures and processes in order that the local government sector would know what its job or role was to feed in and likewise, that the board would have the structures in place to manage the first applications as soon as they came through, as well as the pre-application processes.  Two elements flow from those discussions.  One was engagement around the fees issue.  As the legislation sets out, the board outlines and agrees what its fees structure should be.  On foot of the Minister approving that, it was published on 15 March for an eight-week period - that eight-week notice is specified in the Bill to allow people to consider it - and that is how 10 May was arrived at as a start date.  We had discussions with the local government sector and agreed that all fees would be on a 50-50 spread so that the share of fees coming in for the different scales and types of projects coming through would be shared equally between the local government sector and the board itself.

Those regulations are well advanced and will be signed in advance of 10 May.  On 10 May we can expect applications to come in and An Bord Plean&aacute;la's strategic team to be fully in place.  We have sanctioned ten administrative posts and we have also approved the addition of two new board members to bring the board membership of the strategic division up to four.  They are currently being recruited and will be <i>in situ<\/i>on day one to manage the queries on the issues as they come through.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of the LIHAF, there has been a lot of activity over the last nine months and we are delighted to see the great news and the fact that we can now support and get projects moving across a range of local authorities.  Fifteen of the 21 local authorities that applied have received funding to different scales, with the major projects in the Dublin and Cork areas, as one might expect in terms of scale and potential.<br\/><br\/>Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised the question of affordability.  It was a factor in assessing them and was one of the five criteria set out.  Part of it is about affordability in the whole of the development of the site.  In some cases there would have been local authority-owned land that was part of the site we freed up, those would be regarded as a social mix.  If 50% or 60% of the site was private but 40% was going to be owned by the local authority and therefore rolled out, that would meet the affordability piece in some respects.  On the two examples of Clonburris and Grange, or Kilcarbery as we will call it now, the issue is what are the pricings that will come through.  In the case of Kilcarbery that will be an open tendering process so part of the assessment by the local authority will be on what is the price range.  We have spoken extensively with South Dublin County Council and the key element is what will be the tenure mix, what will be the types of houses, will they all have three bedrooms, will they be a mix of one and two-bedroom units and townhouses?  That is probably where we will see the affordability scale delivered in a lot of the sites that are there.<\/p><p> It is not the case that the Department will say certain levels must be met, but if people do not meet them they do not get the money.  We recognise that each site will have its unique challenges but also opportunities to match the affordability at a local level in the context of assessing what is affordable.  What is affordable in south Dublin might be different from what is affordable in Tipperary, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown or Limerick.<\/p><p> A point was made by Senator Boyhan around the numbers.  The figure of 23,000 units is what we have calculated and tested with the local authority for the 34 sites being funded now.  The estimated delivery for those sites is by 2021.  Over the longer term, if we fully build out these sites, we reckon there will be a further 44,000 or 45,000 units.  This would bring the total over the longer term to approximately 68,000 or 69,000.  These figures are only for those sites.  A large number of sites do not have infrastructure bottlenecks and there are other developments as well.  It is an important contribution and brings large scale activity, but it is not the only deliverable under the Rebuilding Ireland programme.<\/p><p> Another question was asked about an extension to the local infrastructure housing activation fund and the number of potential projects that we might wish to fund if we had more money.  Several did not make the cut-off because of the limited funds available.  I have no wish to name them, but in the case of some projects substantially more work and analysis would have been required.  We certainly could have spent more money than the money available.  At the announcement on Tuesday, the Minister signalled that we were seeking further funds under the capital review.  Obviously, that is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government in balancing wider demands to determine whether there are opportunities in that area.<\/p><p> There was a question on fast-track planning.  Deputy Casey asked whether the boat had sailed in Wicklow in respect of whether a developer could apply outside.  The answer is \"Yes\".  The legal advice we got was to the effect that this is the process for 100 plus or 200 plus student units.  If developers exceed those numbers, they go straight to the board.  That is the law as it stands.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis asked about compulsory purchase orders and whether they were being used by local authorities.  As the Secretary General has said, several local authorities, including Louth County Council, are availing of them.  Equally, a certain local authority identified a number of properties that were lying vacant.  Perhaps not all the sites were derelict, but certainly they were unused for several years.  The authority tracked down the people who owned them or who had control over them.  The authority wrote to all 21, seeking views and pointing out that if they did not do something with the properties, the authority would proceed with a CPO.  All 21 responded.  A total of 14 said they would bring them back in under their own to use them, while seven offered to sell them to the local authority.  The use of CPOs is an important step.  It is complex but usable.  However, there are many other ways to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1686,"content":"<p>The local authority has to designate sites as derelict before they issue a CPO.

The answer he gave was the same as the answer the last time I asked the question.  My problem is twofold.  On the one hand, the Government plan is setting up the figure of 25,000 units annually as one of its major delivery targets.  At the same time, the Department website, which I have before me, tells us that the figures Mr. McCarthy has given us are not accurate.  The problem is that we do not know how inaccurate they are.  I imagine the Department officials do not know how inaccurate they are.  They might be marginally inaccurate and, if so, there is no problem.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the different sources of data.  Mr. McCarthy went through the ESB connections and the building control management system data.  However, we can also look at stamp duty transactions, for example.  A range of other measures is relevant.  The difficulty is that when we sent the various sets of data alongside each other, the discrepancies can be substantial.  It cannot be impossible for the Department to find a mechanism.  However, it cannot currently give data on the number of completions and explain how it is going to operate in future with local authorities, whether it is through a revision of the BCMS or whatever, in respect of registered completions.<\/p> <p>  I welcome strongly the comment by Mr. McCarthy on how the Department is keen to hear suggestions from other parties about how the statistics can be improved.  However, some commentators are publically expressing real frustration because they do not believe they are being listened to.  Some have said they have to submit freedom of information requests to try to get the data.  Then, when the freedom of information requests come back, the data is in a form that is virtually unreadable or unmanageable.  It has to be possible for us to have certain figures.  For example, leaving aside one-off housing and ESB connections, it should be possible to find out the number of properties that are vacant for two years and, given a high level of vacancy rates, the number of such properties becoming re-connected after a given period.  Even if the Department is 10%, 20% or 30% out, rather than out by 50% as suggested by Lorcan Sirr or Mel Reynolds, that is still a major gap.  I believe this issue deserves more attention than it is getting on the basis of what Mr. McCarthy has said to me today, which is the same as what he said to me a month ago.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to affordability and the housing activation fund.  I was not aware that the Department could consider the social housing element of a joint venture land as part of the affordability segment.  That means we get no additional benefit because we would get getting that part of it anyway.  Again, I am not opposed to the idea of the housing activation fund if it assets in delivering more affordable homes for people.  However, if the Department is simply rolling it in and sees it as an added benefit to an eventual joint venture, then we have a real problem.<\/p> <p>  Nothing that Mr. McCarthy has said has reassured me about cases involving private land where there is a private housing development with solely 10% social housing.  Such projects get significant infrastructural investment from the taxpayer.  From what Mr. McCarthy has said, I do not see how that approach will deliver properties, or a section of those properties, that would be even close to affordable.  Perhaps I do not understand how the criteria work.<\/p> <p>  I know of two sites in particular.  One is the private section of Clonburris.  The other, if I understand the location correctly, is the Grange or Kilkarberry, which is on public land.  My concern is that the infrastructure might go ahead and the houses might be built, but those houses will cost &euro;350,000 or &euro;400,000 each.  That means the developer benefits and the person who has a high income benefits, but there is no affordability return.  I am concerned about the answer Mr. McCarthy has given.  If there is anything he can say to reassure me or convince me otherwise, I would welcome it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#G00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1690,"content":"<p>My question is on Pillar 3 and the number of houses being built, especially for social housing.  The final figure for new build housing last year was released.  The number was 652.  This was evenly split between the housing bodies and local authorities.  However, when we exclude regeneration, which is simply replacing pre-existing stock that was social housing stock at one point, only 253 new local authority homes were built.  By any standard, that is a continuation of a situation that was appalling.  The policy of a handful of houses being built here and there is all we ever hear of.  We never hear of 200 or 400 being built, although that used to be the case.  Previously, most housing estates were made up of at least 200 houses.<\/p><p>It is clearly not going to work.  It is a political decision to have small-scale social housing.  It will not be able to deal with the huge crisis we have.  I see and hear nothing that will change that.<\/p><p> The other issue is the lack of Part V development because only 64 units were provided in 2015.  The latest statistics from the Department show that there were only 37 in 2016.  That is a major problem because Part V is meant to supply one in five of the 22,577 new build social housing units promised in Rebuilding Ireland by 2021.  It is not happening.  This means that we need more direct build to make up the figures and that is not happening either.  The plan is not working.  I know we constantly hear that it takes time to build houses, but the plans, figures and projects are not sufficient to suggest that there will be houses even in two or three years.<\/p><p> The other problem we have had, which I have raised consistently and which is also doing down the number of social housing units, is part privatising or selling off public lands to private developers, because that is eating into the potential to get local authority stock.  I know the Senator mentioned that rural areas are not being focused on, but the areas with the largest amount of homelessness are not being focused on.  There is no targeted action.  It is a bit like a doctor being approached with a cancerous tumour but treating all of the other things instead of the tumour.  If there was a serious plan on the part of Government to resolve the worst of the housing crisis, it would be focused on Deputy Ellis's area and my area - the places where massive homelessness exists.  That is what the figures show.  As the previous meeting, I said that houses were not being built in Fingal, and Heathfield was cited.  It is not Blanchardstown.  It is not housing for people who live in greater Blanchardstown.  It is fine, I am delighted for those who get it, but I am just saying that it is not targeted at huge areas, whereas the last remaining site we do have in greater Blanchardstown could accommodate 1,500 units if fully built.  This is land north of Wellview.  Apparently, the plan is that only 13% of it will be social housing because of this new fabulous policy of sustainable communities which the Government keeps telling us is great.  A total of 20% will be rented out - to people on the social housing list, I am sure - while 50% will given to a developer.  It is outrageous and I will certainly campaign politically to ensure this does not happen.  Councillors might have supported it in theory, but in practice one can see the impact if that is the last remaining piece of zoned council land for housing in the area.<\/p><p> I know homelessness figures are covered in the other pillars but it relates to completed houses.  They have gone up dramatically.  A total of 1,250 more people are homeless since the Minister took charge.  The rapid builds are not happening.  Coming to these meetings is very depressing.  I would love to be able to say that I am glad to see that something is working but it is a continuation of the same type of inertia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#G00600","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490878800,"counter":1692,"content":"<p>In respect of Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, I do not want to be difficult about this but the fact I gave the same answer as I did on the previous occasion is not an indication of any sort of lackadaisical approach or lack of engagement with this issue.  It is a reflection of the fact that when I was here the previous time, I was trying to signal that we were engaged with the issue and we continue to be engaged with the issue.  It is not impossible and we are certainly working on a number of fronts to make sure we take whatever opportunities we have to refine our data and satisfy ourselves that we have the best possible range of data available to us.  For example, we are engaging with the ESB in respect of its connection system because, as the Deputy said, there is a sense that this reconnections piece is probably a very small element but nonetheless, if we can identify it exactly, it will help us.<\/p> <p>  Developments on the building control management system could also help us, and we are working to see if we can accelerate that.  Again, I do not want the Deputy to say that I am saying the same thing again, but it is important to emphasise that we do use other data sets such as commencements.  Possibly some of the completions have been in respect of developments that may have been started some time ago and one would have expected them to be built out as the housing sector recovers.  We are getting to a point where the commencement figures are rising and are not too far away from exceeding the completions figures, so that is further evidence of a pickup in activity.  We have engaged with a range of people, including some of the people referred to by the Deputy.  We continue to be committed to engaging with anybody who is interested in this space.  We are also working with the CSO, which has a lot of expertise around quality assuring statistics and has protocols around that.  We want to learn from it to ensure we have that quality assurance piece that we can apply to our statistics.  There was some commentary in the media during the past week or ten days that referred to some of the debate around activity figures, but the conclusion it came to was that regardless of that debate, there is one undeniable reality, which is that activity is picking up significantly.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Coppinger's points and the social housing figures for last year, units we classify as regeneration units are new units in regeneration areas, so they are actually new stock.  They are different from the voids programme which is still bringing stock back into use and is critically important in terms of meeting need.  Generally, these regeneration units are new units being built in areas like the Limerick regeneration area where sites would have been cleared and demolitions would have taken place going back some time.  If we look back at social housing new build two or three years ago, which has been spoken about in this committee on many occasions, we can see that activity had reached an incredibly low level.  Everybody is aware of that.  If we look at the period since Rebuilding Ireland was published, and we published data on this with the quarterly progress report and will update that data on a quarterly basis, we can see that we are now at a point where more than 500 projects are in the social housing construction pipeline.  They range from small projects to larger projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1693,"content":"<p>What is the largest?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#H00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490878800,"counter":1694,"content":"<p>There are projects of 60 or 70 units.

A very large number of projects are either on site or have been fully cleared in the tender process and will deliver units this year or next year.  We are adding to that pipeline every week.  When we come to produce the quarter one progress report, we will produce an updated version of the construction status report and the extent to which the pipeline has been added to, and the broader progress within the pipeline over the course of that quarter will be evident.  We will do that every quarter from here on.<\/p> <p>  Part V is 10% of housing yield on sites of nine or more housing units.  Obviously, it is critically dependent on private housing supply coming on stream, but as the Deputy knows, there were amendments made to the Part V regime so that the use of cash payments is no longer allowed.<\/p><p>We expect to see Part V delivery continue to accelerate over the next few years as private housing supply in larger schemes of more than nine units accelerates.<\/p><p> I do not want to get into a policy debate on the use of public lands for mixed tenure housing.  The policy rationale is set out in Rebuilding Ireland.  Much of the commentary regarding the need to try to accelerate housing supply overall concerns the fact that relying on private housing supply to the extent it was relied on before is taking too long.  Many people argue for the use of public lands in the short to medium term as a vehicle for delivering mixed tenure housing for social housing, rental and purchase.<\/p><p> Regarding targeted activity, every local authority in 2015, I think, was given a programme of targets for the 2015 to 2017 period, and those targets were influenced by the social housing needs assessment as it stood then.  We have a new social housing needs assessment now, the results of which were published at the end of last year, and we have committed to setting new targets for local authorities in the second quarter of this year, which again will be influenced by the new outcome of the social housing needs assessment.  This will see the available resources targeted on the areas of greatest need, as the social housing needs assessment tells us, but this will be on a local authority basis.  I think we have spoken previously in the committee about what happens within local authority areas.  We are very reliant on the local authority to identify and prioritise the projects within its area and identify where it feels they should be located, as opposed to there being a central instruction to local authorities to start picking out individual sites.  We rely on the local authority to come forward to us in this regard.<\/p><p> In general with Rebuilding Ireland, we are trying to set out on a multi-strand housing journey to deliver on the targets that have been set.  This involves a range of elements, including building, purchasing, leasing and the buy-and-renew and repair-and-leasing schemes.  All theses schemes contribute to what we want to achieve, and the mix of these ingredients will change over time as different programmes grow in importance.  Overall, a pool of funding in excess of &euro;900 million was available to us last year to deliver on housing programmes.  We utilised the full resource to ensure delivery of the maximum amount of output through all the different strands of activity, including building, buying and all the others I mentioned.  This year, we have a significantly increased pool of resources available to us.  It is &euro;1.3 billion in total.  To give the committee a sense of the increased momentum, already in 2017 we have spent the same capital amount of money as we had spent at 2 September last year.  That gives a sense of the extent to which the programme and the level of activity is building up, and we are now at a much increased and much more uniform pace of delivery over the course of the year.  Again, housing will see a further significant capital increase in 2018.  Part of our activity this year, as I said, is building the pipeline of projects that will be able to avail of that funding next year.  We used all our housing capital money last year, we will use all of it this year, and we are preparing to make sure we will be in a position to use all our housing funding again in 2018 so that we deliver as much as we possibly can from the resources available to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1696,"content":"<p>We now move on to Pillar 2, which concerns the acceleration of social housing.

A total of 194 houses were going through the four stages in Wicklow, 34 of which reached stage 4 approval in mid-December last year.  The planning permission runs out on Saturday.  I have heard about the eight-stage process and the four-stage process and I hear of oversight, approval processes, criteria, checks and balances, and governance.  This was 20% of the total stock of social housing for Wicklow.  In all the checks and balances, did no one pick up on the fact the planning permission would run out on this project?  Who, if anyone, is responsible for this?  Is it the developer, the proprietor, the affordable housing body, the local authority or the Department?  Something has gone radically wrong with the process if something like this is allowed to happen.  None of the other projects in Wicklow is at stage 4 in the process, so we have no hope of delivering these 34 houses for Arklow.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Chairman for a little leniency as I must go into the D&aacute;il at 4 o'clock.  I wish to refer to homelessness before I leave.  Deputy Coppinger is right.  We all want to solve the problem.  There is nobody here who does not want to solve it.  It is disappointing that the homelessness figures, month on month and since Rebuilding Ireland, have gradually gone up and up.  We have seen a 10% increase in families and an 8% increase in children becoming homeless.  We have seen a 21% increase in the use of private accommodation, hotels, and bed and breakfast accommodation, and a 13% increase in supported temporary accommodation to accommodate homeless people.  I know the Minister means well and wants to get people out of hotels by July, but they should not be moved out of hotels if we are going to move them into worse accommodation.  Let us not make that mistake.<\/p> <p>  The use of residential developments in Dublin and other cities outside the planning laws has also been identified by the Minister, and I have also spoken on the matter.  I know the Minister wrote to all local authorities asking them to take action on the use of properties for short-term letting on a long-term basis.  Has anything been done to follow up on any action taken by local authorities?  We all know now that thousands of properties are being used for short-term letting on a long-term basis in cities.<\/p> <p>  Regarding rapid-build housing and the shortfall in its delivery, is it now time to move some of the money from the rapid-build programme to the voids programme?

The first concerns public private partnerships.  We had a long exchange on this at the end of our previous meeting.  Since then, I have met the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, the Department and Dublin City Council, DCC, and have spoken to the county manager of South Dublin County Council and to the Sinn F&eacute;in councillors in the councils affected.  I have even more concerns with the model than I had the previous time.  In all the conversations I have had with officials since the previous meeting, the first thing they have said is that we should not have an ideological conversation about this.  My conversation about this is not ideological.  One of the reports I have read since our previous meeting is the very detailed report of the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on the use of public private partnerships in Britain, including in social housing.  The core conclusion of its report, and this is after 15 years of experience of these matters, is that the benefits of off-balance sheet borrowing do not offset the long-term additional costs, let alone the additional risks when the projects go wrong.  The Treasury Select Committee is a body that is probably more conservative than anyone in this room in its general thinking about these matters.<\/p> <p>  I am still concerned about the benchmarking process and the lack of transparency surrounding it.  I am even more concerned about the potential risks that could fall back on the Exchequer, whether in respect of central or local government, as a result of the contracts, particularly if there are defaults or disputes in respect of the contracts, especially over the 25-year maintenance period.  I am absolutely opposed to the inclusion of approved housing bodies in the public private partnership, PPP, companies.<\/p><p>Nobody has given me any rationale for why the local authorities should not only own these units at the end of the period if they go ahead but also manage them throughout. <\/p><p> I do not understand the absolute exclusion of elected members in the councils from pretty much any of this, other than approving section 85 developments and planning permissions, given the risks of which we know of Britain.  We are in a real dilemma.  On the basis of the first bundles, there are 108 units in my constituency.  I do not want Sinn F&eacute;in councillors in South Dublin County Council to vote against delivery of these 108 units that will house 108 families within two years.  There are, however, so many risks involved in this model that this evening I will make a written submission which has just been completed.  I will not ask the delegates to respond on all of these matters because I have other questions to ask, but I want the Department to give me a formal written response to the submission which goes through all of my concerns in the areas to which I have just referred.  I will ask it to consider a series of reasonable amendments to what it is proposing.  I would much prefer it to use 100% upfront Exchequer funding or Housing Finance Agency loans, but I am not optimistic that the Minister would agree to that.  In its absence there is a set of other matters that it needs to consider.  We do not want to sit here in a couple of years when many of the things the House of Commons Treasury Committee has confirmed will have come to pass.  When I asked the last time we met about HFA loans for local authorities, I said there was no plan for them to increase HFA borrowings, yet on page 45 of Rebuilding Ireland there is an explicit commitment to increase capital and HFA loan facilities for local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Will local authorities be able at some stage to borrow from the HFA to build, in addition to capital funding from central government?  <\/p><p> I would like to receive an update on the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU.  I know that the Department is not the block but the Registry of Credit Unions, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  Have there been subsequent conversations?  Is pressure being exerted, or is there engagement with these two bodies to try to free some of the money the ILCU and others have put on the table?  <\/p><p> I am very concerned that cost rental is one of the ideas many people say is a good one; everyone has a vague idea about it, but as no model is emerging, it will not be delivered.  I take a slightly different view from Deputy Ruth Coppinger on the land initiatives or joint ventures.  I am open to discussing them as long as they deliver good quality social and affordable housing and nobody is getting anything for free and that there is a clear return to the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#J00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1700,"content":"<p>They are getting land for free.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#K00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1701,"content":"<p>If they were, I would not support it.

I am open to consideration of 30% social housing and 20% cost rental.  My preference is cost rental delivered by local authorities, with the private developer purchasing the remainder of the land, with the money ringfenced to produce more land or social units.  I am worried about cost rental, which could undermine some of the political support for joint ventures.<\/p> <p>  I am with Deputy Pat Casey on the approval process.  The delegates know my feelings on the subject.  They produced a very good report recently and I welcome its publication.  Many of us would like to know, however, whether the timescale of 18 to 24 months that everybody has said is unacceptable is being shortened?  Is there some way in subsequent versions of the report or others to show evidence of the consequences of the work being done in terms of design teams, etc?  We do not know if it is working and if it is, we would like to see that it is.  Although this may seem parochial, we have a right to raise matters in our constituencies; there are 186 new builds in Dublin mid-west, half of the number in the South Dublin County Council plan.  Eighty-nine of them will not be delivered.  They are on two sites where the Department will not receive Part A planning permission.  We have told the manager this and given him alternative sites for the units and more.  It will not happen on St. Mark's Avenue and in Balgaddy and there is no point in lying to anybody.  It is not that we are opposing the provision of social housing.  We want the units and have identified alternative sites, owned by the council, in areas which are close by and which would be more suitable.  Of the 186 units the Department plans to deliver in the next three years in my constituency, only 87 are deliverable.  A Simon Community planning application is going through the mainstream planning process, but there is no guarantee it will get through.  I hope it will.  I have made a submission in support of it.  <\/p> <p>  The document does not include the rapid builds which should be included because they are Part 8 long-term social housing.  It also does not include a significant development by Cl&uacute;id Housing on Station Road of 65 units at Milford Manor, which is really good news for the constituency.  There is more housing being delivered in the constituency which I would like to see included.  Given that there are only 97 units in the Department's programme that are deliverable, can I take it that if the local authority decides to come forward with new projects, the Department will actively consider them?  If I ask Danny or Billy in South Dublin County Council to develop a site owned by the council and they say to me the Department will not consider it, can I say the Department told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that it will give due consideration to any concrete proposal made?  <\/p> <p>  Approved housing body reclassifications have happened across the water and are the subject of consultation in the North.  Are we concerned that it could happen here?  Will it have implications for anything included in the plan?  Is there any information the Department can give us about it? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#K00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1702,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we are here to read a report on actions due to be taken by the last quarter of 2016.  There were 13 items under Pillar 2.  According to the report, eight were on schedule and five had been completed.  One of the great features of Rebuilding Ireland, as I said to the Minister, is that it is a brave Minister who sets out his plan, vision, timeframes, actions and deliveries.  They can then be challenged and questioned.  This is a very focused response.  The first target to be met is the provision of 47,000 houses.  I hope we will see a hell of a lot more provided and  have a good feeling in that regard.  There many more houses that will come on stream, as everyone here hopes.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus first on the reporting process, paragraph 2.3 and the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, under which the objective was to have counties Cavan, Kerry, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow included by the end of 2016.  They were brought on board when the scheme was rolled out on 1 December.  I am not sure that would have happened if there had not been this focus.  I was a councillor for many years and this is an issue.  Two local authorities sent me some documents which mirrored Pillars 1 and 2.  I will send them to the delegates because I was highly impressed by them.  They show how they perceive the objectives for their local authorities and how they were delivering on them, including in part.  I would like to think that was happening in 31 local authorities.  There has to be a sense of ownership at local level.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin made some points about councillors feeling left out of many aspects of the process.  This should be taken on board.  They are advocates too for the delivery of social housing, regardless of their political dogma or agenda.  Everyone wants to see the delivery of social and affordable housing.  The Department should consider how each local authority is playing its part in the bigger plan of Rebuilding Ireland and meeting the great objective of providing 47,000 new homes.  Of the 13 included in the list, I only question the last for refugees, but in their status report the delegates say it is complete.  Will they, please, tease that out?  I am referring to paragraph 2.24.  It is not enough to get to where they want to be and drop it, stating they have concluded their business.  I am not suggesting they are doing that, but they might tease out the matter.<\/p><p>I am referring to rapid build housing, which come under Pillar 1 but are referenced in Pillar 2 also.  We have not seen any rapid build taking place in the constituency in which I live, and there was great excitement about it.  I have looked at the number of rapid build projects in the 31 local authorities and there are not that many of them.  I am not sure if it the best use of sites.  I do not consider two storey, rapid build houses on a site zoned for a major town centre to be good use of land.  It is an appalling use of land which is served by great public transport.  The suggestion that there will be two storey rapid builds is a scandal when across the road there are five storey private residential houses that one could not buy as they are all sold.  There is a demand.  It is possible to build that level of higher density housing in a major town centre.  I would be appalled to think that the Department, and the Minister, would not be alerted about this situation or that if he was alerted, he would not take immediate action because that is a terrible waste of a resource within a local authority.  However, I acknowledge, based on the delivery of the actions for quarter 4 in 2016, that this is progress and that it is very positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#K00400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1704,"content":"<p>To continue on from what Senator Boyhan said, I have major concerns about this area, particularly when we consider that there is a rolling fund of &euro;70 million to purchase vacant properties from banks and investment companies.  That is welcome but where is it happening and what is being done?<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to defend the housing assistance payment, HAP scheme, which all of us mentioned.  This year, &euro;153 million is being put aside for the HAP scheme.  As we know, people on local authority housing lists qualified for rent allowance.  The HAP is better than rent allowance because it gives people more scope and they receive a higher payment but the problem in my area is that people cannot find accommodation due to the lack of supply.  We have people now who have qualified for the HAP and who are trying to find accommodation.  I have started to look for accommodation for people who are coming to me because they cannot find any.  Furthermore, many landlords are not taking people on the HAP.  As I have said previously, there is a great deal of confusion and a lack of understanding of this new HAP scheme and the Department should put something in place, with the local authorities, in that regard.  I could give examples of ten cases where the persons qualify for the HAP scheme but we cannot find accommodation for them because of the lack of housing.  We have gone to different places to see if landlords will take on people who are in the HAP scheme.  In fairness, some will but others will not.<\/p> <p>  This year, we will put &euro;153 million into the HAP scheme but we should be looking at the bigger picture in that regard.  There are no big local authority building projects.  We see &euro;70 million allocated for vacant properties through investment in bank companies, and that is fine, but we need to build local authority housing to provide the supply that is needed because there is no supply available.  I know of people who are qualifying now as being homeless.  We are making people homeless in certain cases, although not in all, through this HAP scheme because they are on the housing list but they cannot find rented accommodation.  We will see much more of that in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  I ask about the 47,000 social housing units to be provided through local authorities.  Could we have a breakdown of that?  I, too, have seen the report.  Is that money available or do local authorities have to ring up the Department and ask for it?  When the Department sets its plan it knows that every local authority will seek a certain amount of money towards a particular scheme.  Is that money available or is there a shortfall when it comes to local authorities in that things are being put on hold, whether it is through the HAP scheme, which I know is done through a different body, repairs, release or whatever?  Is that money available and how long are local authorities waiting for money?  That is the biggest delay in terms of supply.  I welcome the fact that money is available but is it coming through the local authorities?  That is a massive issue for me.<\/p> <p>  On the plan for 47,000 social housing units, could we have a breakdown of that figure?  What is the Department's target for every local authority?  I know that is the overall picture.  I read in the Department's submission that it brought together all the local authorities recently to participate in a workshop.  Was that done through the rapid build or other such programme?  I am sure the Department takes them up on a regular basis in that regard. <\/p> <p>  We have a massive homelessness problem, half of which is not even being documented now.  As so much is happening that is not being allowed for we need to ensure that local authorities, with the Department, understand that.  There are 31 local authorities but every local authority is different.  There are local authorities in cities and in rural areas, in Carlow, Laois, Naas and so on.  I hope that the allocation to every local authority is based on what they come back to the Department with.  What is happening in the long term?  I have major concerns about this area but I do not see what is happening in terms of the bigger picture, although I am willing to await the response from the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#L00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1705,"content":"<p>I have some concerns about the public private partnerships, PPPs.  My party has done a fair amount of research on this and Deputy &Oacute; Broin alluded to some of the problems.  On the long-term value for money, it is debatable whether that is a good road to take.<\/p> <p>  I have to be a little parochial in this case.  I support social housing but 71 units are planned for Scribblestown, which is an area that does not have a single bus service.  There are no community facilities, not even a shop.  It is a very isolated area.  We cannot pick a site on the basis that, say, Dublin City Council indicates that it has a site when proper research has not been done and there is no interaction with the communities regarding the site.   The argument being put forward by people in this case, whether the Department likes it or not, is that we all support a mix of social, affordable and private housing and now the intention is to build only social housing on a site.  That may work in some areas but it is having a very bad effect in others.  The people in that area are up in arms and it will be very difficult to deal with the issue locally, and local politicians will struggle to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  Much remains to be done on the refurbishment policy and in terms of how quickly units are being dealt with.  I know there has been a bigger turnaround but it needs to improve, and there should be more investment.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the rapid build housing, I have experience of the 22 units that were built to a very high standard in Ballymun.  It is very good housing, and I have not had reports of any problems with them.  Forty rapid build houses are being built in St. Helena's in Finglas.  We were told they would be turned over rapidly.  The build started in 2016 and regardless of what the witnesses say, I have spoken to the people on the ground and at the current rate at which they are being built, realistically, people will not be living in those homes until September or October.  The project has taken a year and three months.  We could have done them another way.  However, they are of the highest standard and I have no problem in that regard.<\/p><p>We need to be delivering more quickly.  We call them rapid-build units but they are not rapid-build.  The way in which the Government introduced Part V and cut back on the amount of social housing we were able to get was a disaster.  That policy should be reviewed and we should be going back to the drawing board.  We also introduced a rule that one social housing unit had to built for every nine units, whereas previously it was one in five.  The Government cut back on social housing in every way under Part V.<\/p><p> There is more scope to be looking at NAMA in terms of how it is delivering.  There are an awful lot of properties under the control of NAMA and it is getting funding from many of them through leasing arrangements or otherwise.  That money is slowly trickling back as NAMA is supporting some projects.  We need to accelerate this.  NAMA has a big fund that could be utilised in a major way.  I would have preferred if the State had taken control in the first instance or if the local authorities were given control of the portfolio that NAMA got its hands on.  Be that as it may, we cannot allow NAMA to sell those properties off in blocks.  That is an area in which we could accelerate the whole issue of social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#L00300","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490878800,"counter":1707,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies and Senators.  I will try to deal with the questions in sequence and will start those posed by Deputy Casey, who is under time pressure.  I do not know the details of the particular project to which he referred.  If a project gets to a point of approval and the planning permission runs out for it a couple of months afterwards, there is no win for anybody.  I will certainly look at that.  If Wicklow County Council were to come to us with an alternative, be it to go out and get a turnkey development or something else that could substitute, if the planning cannot be renewed for some reason, we would certainly look very positively on that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of homelessness and move-on solutions, there is no intention that people would move into worse accommodation.  A range of solutions will need to be put in place to ensure that we achieve our objectives there, namely, quality and better housing outcomes for people, be they of a short, medium or long-term nature.  We will certainly be working to ensure that improved, quality housing solutions are actually put in place.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Airbnb issue and the short-term letting of property, we have committed to looking at that in the context of the rental strategy.  A group on which Ms Nic Aonghusa participates is looking at it and is due to report in quarter 2.  It is very much on our radar.  Previously, we had a discussion about the number of units that are used.  Different figures are spoken about, which is something we need to work out.  A lot of the units are bed and breakfast properties, as it were.  They are very often people who are letting out a property for a week or two while they are away themselves.  They are not actually units that would be available as alternative rental units.  Equally, we do need to bottom out on the ones that should be used for long-term accommodation and that are going into the short-term space.<\/p> <p>  On the voids and rapid-build, one general comment is that we have tried to be as flexible as we possibly can with local authorities.  We do not start out at the beginning of the year by saying \"This is the way the year has to pan out and if it does not pan out that way, good luck to you.\"  Going back to what I was saying to Deputy Coppinger earlier, one of the main reasons we managed to ensure that we spent our full budget last year was that we took a very flexible approach with local authorities.  Accordingly, if some projects are delayed for whatever reason, we engage with the local authority involved so that it has the capacity to put alternative solutions in place, be that through a purchase programme or by moving funds into programmes such as that relating to voids.  We have made significant progress on the voids in the past three years.  Offhand, I think we have supported getting over 7,000 void units back into use in recent years, in addition to the ones the local authorities themselves have supported.  We are probably getting to a point at which, while there is more work to be done in some places, other local authority areas have really broken the back of the issue.  We do have provision for a voids programme this year.  Certainly, if any local authority were to come to us to say they had a bigger voids programme than what we might initially fund, we would look to see if there was a way to move money around.<\/p> <p>  On PPPs, the Deputy is going to make a submission to us and we will certainly look at it.  As part of the process of developing the housing PPP programme, consideration was given to experience of PPPs both here, not for housing but for other types of development, and abroad, including the UK.  I think there were even visits to the UK to try to learn from the experience over there.   We will not be looking to repeat any mistakes that were identified elsewhere.  The Deputy stated that he would prefer it if direct public funding was being used.  All I can say on that point is that, for better or worse, there are public funding parameters within which we have to work.  The PPP programme is an attempt, from a policy point of view, to try to see if there is additionality that we can get outside of those parameters.  We do not want to be making mistakes.  We do not want to be solving today's problems while creating problems for five, ten or 20 years down the road.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ellis was referring to the Scribblestown site, for which 71 units are envisaged.  There would have been considerable work done with the local authorities in examining the individual sites.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about having 70 social housing units on one site.  It had to be looked at in the wider context.  I am conscious that Deputy Coppinger might be of the view that we should have gone up into triple digits.  All I am saying is that there are different approaches for different locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1708,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy is getting me wrong.

I cannot remember offhand what I said.  This ties in with another point the Deputy raised about reclassifications.  HFA borrowings by local authorities are on-balance sheet.  It is in that same sort of space.  Borrowings by approved housing bodies, as matters stand and provided the project is appropriately structured, would not be on-balance sheet.<\/p><p>As the Deputy rightly points out, there has been an exercise through EUROSTAT and the National Audit Office in the UK, which looked at what we call approved housing there.  They were brought on balance sheet and a similar exercise was undertaken in Northern Ireland.  There is an exercise under way here between EUROSTAT, the Central Statistics Office, ourselves and the approved housing body, AHB, sector.  A number of the larger approved housing bodies are working very closely to engage with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which is the national body for statistics and will be the ultimate conduit back to EUROSTAT.  It will probably come to finality in the second half of the year.  There are a number of factors taken into account as part of that.  The funding arrangements are an element but there are also matters concerning where risk is shared between different parties and who controls the asset etc.  There are a number of elements and we are looking at all of them in order to ensure the best case is made.  We will have to deal with the outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1711,"content":"<p>We do not know the outcome of that exercise and I presume the Department would like the designation to remain as it is.

We have no vested interest in continuing to push local authorities with projects; if they are not going to get Part 8 approval, we must respect the democratic process locally.  One of the points I made to Deputy Coppinger was that we would rely very significantly on local authorities to make the judgments locally as to whether a project in a particular area will fly.

We desperately want those 89 units meant for those sites; we would take three or four times that number and give sites for them too that are just as good.  We would get the Part 8 through.  There will be a second phase of this beyond these sites and some of the difficulties of the Part 8 process could be designed out with a little more engagement with elected members who will play a constructive role.

We get much engagement from local authorities at times around us being seen to put more reporting burdens on them.  We always try to strike a balance.  There is a critical part of the ownership of Rebuilding Ireland, as I stated to Deputy Coppinger; in the second quarter we have committed to taking the outcome of the recently completed social housing needs assessment and developing targets, probably for the next three years, for each of the local authorities.  That will give a very clear headline ambition for each of the authorities.  It will be influenced by social housing needs assessment and, equally, the extent to which some local authorities have been quick out of the traps, with significant work in hand.<\/p> <p>  On the refugee issue, the particular action we committed to was establishing an operational subgroup between ourselves and the Department of Justice and Equality, in particular, as well as other agencies under the refugee protection task force.  That has been established and there has been very good engagement from the local authority sector.  I hope there is a smooth pathway ahead, once the refugees have been through the process with the Department of Justice and Equality to get them initially assessed and considered, as to where they will ultimately find their long-term home.  The local authorities are certainly very much engaged with that.  It is a very good example of different parts of the public system working in a very co-operative way.<\/p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor spoke about the Housing Agency acquisitions, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and various other mechanisms, including the local authority build programme.  Rebuilding Ireland is really designed to have multiple tracks of activity, partly in the early stages because building takes time to ramp up.  We cannot have a plan with the idea that building takes time to ramp up while we wait for the solution; that is why we have other strands of activity around acquisitions, particularly strands of activity heavily reliant on vacant property.  Mr. Walsh spoke earlier about the census figure of approximately 190,000 in this regard and we will hear more about it in the more detailed census stuff in the next few weeks.  With regard to \"early wins\", that is why we are in the space of repair and leasing and buy and renew.  It is so we can tap into an existing stock of accommodation that can be brought on-stream quickly while other strands of activity are building up.<\/p> <p>  Going back to what I said to Deputy Coppinger, the build programme has ramped up quite significantly over the past 12 months from an incredibly low space.  There are 8,500 units in the pipeline, as we published in the quarterly update at the end of 2016.  We are adding to that on a weekly basis.  In Carlow, within the pipeline of build projects there are 13 schemes with over 120 units.  We will publish this in the update at the end of the first quarter and in many local authorities there have been further projects added as we go on.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about HAP before at the committee.<\/p><p>We are very conscious of the importance of ensuring that there is a proper understanding of HAP, both by landlords and tenants.  As the Senator rightly points out, some people say that some HAP tenants are people who were formerly in receipt of rent supplement and that it is just a different scheme.  However, there is a very important difference for those households in that they are now social housing tenants and are governed by differential rent.  Unlike the rent supplement scheme, where they would come to a certain number of hours work a week, suddenly fall off a cliff and lose all of their support, in HAP their differential rent changes but they do not lose their social housing tenancy.  That is a very important benefit of HAP compared with rent supplement.<br\/><br\/>Since 1 March, HAP has been rolled out in the final three Dublin authorities.  There is now full national coverage for HAP.  As part of that, we have put a new <i>hap.ie<\/i>website in place with a lot of information for both tenants and landlords in order to promote the scheme as best we possibly can.  Our experience of the local authorities is that they have really played a hugely important part in making sure that the HAP scheme has rolled out very effectively in most areas, coupled with good local engagement between the rent supplement people in the Department of Social Protection and the local authority officials looking after HAP.<br\/><br\/>The Senator mentioned issues around scarcity of accommodation.  That is a general issue.  It is what Rebuilding Ireland is in overall terms designed to achieve in terms of getting housing supply back up to where it needs to be.  Whatever about some supply issues that may arise in some locations, we had a target last year to get to 12,000 tenancies and we achieved that.  We have a target this year for 15,000 tenancies and we are already more than 25% down that road with less than 25% of the year gone.  There are problems and pressure points in terms of supply in some locations, but in overall terms, it is not constraining our level of activity under HAP at a national-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1719,"content":"<p>If the witness does not mind, I just want clarification on HAP.

It is very confusing and I believe it is very unfair.  I think the criteria brought in for the statistics are way off the mark.  It is doing damage.  When one county is getting it and its neighbour is not, it is very unfair.  There are 12 local authorities plus Dublin and Cork getting it.

I know there is pressure in certain areas, but what is pressure for one area might be different in another area.  In Carlow, the lack of housing supply is a major pressure for us.  It might be double the rate of somewhere else.  The criteria are the same for all 31 local authorities and I have massive issues with that.  In the long term, would the Department look at extending the scheme further?  There are about five areas that I have been making representations for and I have been told that they will not qualify for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#O00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490878800,"counter":1720,"content":"<p>A critically important element of making sure that the rent pressure zone arrangement is fair and effective is that it needs to operate on a very objective basis.

The Housing Agency will be keeping the issue under review.  Ultimately, a debate can be had on whether it should be 7% or 5%, but in terms of the state of the market locally, one would expect it to be reflected in rents and the rate at which rents are increasing.  Supply and demand will ultimately dictate the level of rent and the pace at which rent is going to increase.  That is the rationale for it.  As I say, there is a policy discussion that could probably be had for a long time with regard to that.<\/p> <p>  On the acquisitions of the Housing Agency, which the Senator also mentioned, there are more than 330 units at this stage for which the purchase has been closed, contracts signed or bids put in.  We are obviously trying to get the Housing Agency to target and focus initially on areas in which the pressures are greatest.  It has signed contracts for 238 dwellings and 80 of those have closed.  Bids are pending on a further 89.  It is looking at further possibilities on an ongoing basis.  The critically important thing for that fund, as it is a revolving fund, is that as it engages with the banks and gets them in, it passes the ownership onto the approved housing bodies, which can finance a significant proportion of that through private financing.  That then helps to replenish the fund.  Of that 330 units or thereabouts, the Housing Agency has already identified a number of approved housing bodies for about half of those units, 150 or 160, to be sold on to.  I would expect those sales to start to finally close in the next five to six weeks.  The funding will then come back into the fund, which will allow the Housing Agency to continue with the purchases.<\/p> <p>  I may have confused my notes at this stage.

For the early part of that, each year it was going down rather than going up.  What we now have is a good sense of what our capital is going to be all the way out to 2021.  That allows us to plan really proactively with local authorities and approved housing bodies and give them the certainty that the funding is actually there.  When I responded to Deputy Coppinger earlier on, I referred to the fact that we had a budget last year of about &euro;933 million for housing across the whole range of programmes.  We fully utilised that.  We even found a few million euro of savings in other areas that we brought into the housing space as well.  There is a very significant increase this year.  It is up to &euro;1.3 billion.  As I mentioned to Deputy Coppinger, we are already much farther ahead in terms of spending this year than we were even by August or September last year.  That is the value of full forward visibility of the capital programme.  That way, we can build up a significant programme that allows us to make progress much faster.

There will be busy people in the Department.<\/p><p>I thank the Chairman for facilitating a varied discussion.  I also take the opportunity to thank the secretariat and the Secretary General and his team in the Department because the information we have received has been very helpful.  I acknowledge that it is very helpful for us because not only do we attend meeting such as this but we also interact with local councillors and county managers around the country, including my own.  I am aware that the Chairman will meet him tomorrow.  I spoke to my county manager today about housing issues.  Our relationships are close and everyone is keen to get on with it.  I am conscious that we will have another quarterly report.  There are 15 items under Pillar 1.  That is all that is up for review, but we must go on what has been set out.  At the end of the day, this is Government policy.  We can forget about having debates about what we might like to see because this is the policy.  The Minister is going around with the plan in his pocket and wants it to be delivered.  That is the legacy the Government wants to have.  I am not here to speak for it, but I am a realist and aware that this is, so to speak, the blue book and what the Department must deliver and on which it will be judged.  There were five of the 15 items on schedule; eight had been completed and only two issues were outstanding.<\/p><p> Action 1.1 relates to rapid build housing.  Deputy Dessie Ellis is correct.  I am not happy with the words \"rapid\" or even \"fast track\" which implies a lot of things that are not necessarily true.  It does not mean that it is a lesser system or that rapid builds are inferior houses.  Some of the rapid builds I have seen on the Continent and in Scandinavia are very impressive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#O01500","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1734,"content":"<p>Yes, they are of a very high standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#P00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1735,"content":"<p>The standard is very high.  There was great excitement about rapid build housing, but there has been no delivery.  It is an easy knock to say they have not been delivered, but it is never too late to pull back on something.  My view is that the rapid build programme in D&uacute;n Laoghaire should not go ahead as part of a major town centre zoning.  I would like someone to examine this and to find an alternative mix.  I do not have any ideological hang-up; this is about delivering homes for people who need them.  Let us keep it simple.  That is what the message is.  The goal is to provide 47,000 homes.  The officials must deliver on the little yellow and red book.<\/p> <p>  Action 1.15 reads: \"We will improve mental health and primary care services for homeless persons\".  We know that is an integral factor for many homeless people who have a range of complexities and issues with which to deal.  We all have a range of complexities, but homeless people do not necessarily have the supports they need.  We must address the underlying issues affecting homelessness.  We must deal with addiction and mental health issues and other complexities in an holistic way.  That is an area on which we should keep a focus.  We do not need to discuss it today, but it is a very important issue and we want to have a transitional arrangement.  I would like to think we would have no or very few homeless hostels in Dublin.  We want to follow up on this action.  I am aware of two such places.  One individual is in a homeless hostel for 16 years, which is a failure of the system.  I am happy to share information with the committee on a project for 26 people.  When they came into the services, they were asked when they had been put on the housing list and why they were still in the accommodation in which they were living.  I was appalled by the figures.  People on the books of local authorities were in homeless accommodation for ten years.  The intention was that it would be a transitional arrangement and that people would be moved to supported accommodation which would be appropriate to their needs.  It is about providing accommodation appropriate to people's needs, but that is not happening.  As part of the objective set out in action 1.15, it is important that we conduct an audit of all the homeless accommodation operated by local authorities or the agencies or sub-agencies funded by the Department.  I do not think anyone should be living in emergency or homeless accommodation for a long period.  Such accommodation is transitional and fills a need.  It has a role, but it is not good enough to say it satisfies people's housing needs.<\/p> <p>  I apologise as I have to attend another meeting, but real progress has been made.  There is no point in introducing measures not included in the plan.  The objectives have been set out in the plan and the Department is clearly delivering.  That must be acknowledged and I hope it will continue.  I was suspicious about many aspects of the plan, but I am beginning to see the light.  Everyone needs time.  While I might have issues about the process, especially in the area of fast-track planning, the plan is what is on the table and we must work with it.  I say, \"Well done,\" to all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#P00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1736,"content":"<p>It was disappointing to see the recent increase in the homeless figures, although I accept that the numbers vary from month to month.

If the project could be rolled out on a temporary basis, it would give security to many people.  One of the things one hears about hostels is that some people do not wish to go there for security reasons.  The Respond initiative would solve many of the problems and one could then tackle the problems with drugs and mental health issues.  The HAIL housing association looks after people with mental health issues.  We must push such initiatives more and encourage having dedicated housing bodies to deal with issues such as addiction and mental health problems.<\/p> <p>  Is there any indication that the mortgage to rent scheme is having an impact?

I have been talking to many people recently and do not see much of a difference.  Is there an update?  I do not think much of a benefit has accrued from the scheme.  Perhaps I am wrong, but that is the impression I get from people with whom I deal on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>  A total of &euro;153 million has been allocated for the HAP scheme in 2017 and there will be a roll-out of &euro;70 million for vacant properties.  In my home town of Carlow there is no emergency accommodation available.  While we should not have to use them, I accept that hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation are fine for a short period as an emergency measure and that we must put people somewhere.  Buildings are coming onto the market that are quite cheap, yet there does not seem to be funding available for local authorities to buy them.  For example, a premises could be purchased as a women's refuge.  In every county in the country there should be a long-term women's refuge facility.  It is sad that we need to have them, but we do.  No investment is provided for them.  There is no help for people who find themselves in such situations.  There is a home for men in Carlow but no women's refuge.  We try to get women into accommodation in Kilkenny and Waterford where the facilities are full and then they become homeless.  There are factors which add to homelessness that could be addressed in the long term instead of putting money into hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation on a short-term basis.  There does not seem to be any intention of buying such premises.  I could name two or three which are for sale that I know would be ideal and the prices of which are reasonable.  Is funding available for such a purpose?  I refer to people who are among the most vulnerable in society.  The figures for homelessness have gone up again and will increase even more.  People on local authority housing lists qualify for the HAP scheme, but they cannot find accommodation.  They are caught in that they are included in the scheme but cannot find a place.  In effect, they are homeless.  What is the long-term picture for them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#P00500","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490878800,"counter":1738,"content":"<p>I will take the questions in turn.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Victor Boyhan has left the meeting, but I will deal with what he said in general terms.  It goes back to some of the earlier discussion with Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin about information and statistics.  I acknowledge the Senator's positive comments on the scale and range of information we have provided.  Some of us are here.  The rest of the team dealing with housing are back in the Department.  There is no one on the team who does not understand the scale of what we have to achieve and the critical priority attached to it.  It is of no benefit to us to do anything other than what we have said we would support the Government in delivering.  We have outlined what we have achieved.  I accept, however, that there has been slippage in some areas.<\/p><p>It was inevitable that this would happen but we have been upfront about what the issues are and how we are trying to deal with them.<\/p><p> Returning to what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said about housing completion statistics, I reinforce the point to the effect that we have no interest in having anything other than the best possible information and statistics as it is only then that we can be sure we have the best informed policy to deal with the reality of the situation.<\/p><p> Senator Boyhan raised the wider issue of dealing with homelessness beyond people needing homes.  He was spot on in terms of the extent to which a home is one part of a solution for many people who find themselves homeless but social supports, particularly in the context of evictions and mental health issues, are vital.  There is an appendix to Rebuilding Ireland setting out all the actions that will be taken.  We are the owners and the lead people to drive the majority of those actions but this must be an across-government strategy if it is to work.  The action to which Senator Boyhan referred is led by the Department of Health and the HSE because it relates to the important issue of mental health.  That action is marked as incomplete because the commitment is to get to a point where funding for mental health supports and addiction services for homeless people would be increased to &euro;6 million per annum.  This year, as services are ramped up, the funding allocation for the services will be &euro;4 million, not &euro;6 million, because some of the provision will come on stream at the end of the year.  As a result, there will not be a full-year cost attaching to it.  However, the commitment is for the allocation to increase to &euro;6 million next year.  That is the reason that action is marked as incomplete, but considerable work is being done in respect of it.<\/p><p> Senator Boyhan also referred to cases of people living in emergency accommodation for far too long.  That is recognised, as is the need to deal with the issue under the Housing First approach.  People need to be equipped to live as independent a life as they possibly can but for some, that will require having range of supports in place.  We have the Housing First programme and there is a separate action in Rebuilding Ireland to triple the number of Housing First tenancies by the end of this year.  There are two elements to that, an accommodation element and the wrap-around services that people will need in their own homes to be able to sustain independent living.  A significant number of the Housing Agency acquisitions that we spoke earlier are of the one-bedroom unit variety that will provide ideal accommodation solutions for some Housing First tenants but we also need to get the wrap-around services in place to ensure that they can sustain independent living.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis mentioned that we had talked at the launch of the High Park model units.  That model represents a much improved, better-quality solution for a short-term period and it is significantly better than hotel accommodation in terms of the range of facilities - including cooking and laundry facilities, homework clubs and practical supports for identifying the long-term housing solution that families will need - available to families.  We want to replicate that model as part of our solution to dealing with the hotel accommodation issue  The Deputy is right in saying that it is an ambitious target to achieve by the middle of the year but we are engaging - Ms Mary Hurley and Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa in particular are doing so - with the Dublin local authorities on a weekly, and sometimes more frequent, basis as part of the process to ensure that every possible effort that needs to be made to achieve that target is made.  It will be a case of us all putting our shoulders to the wheel on that one in the next few months.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis and Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the mortgage to rent scheme.  We carried out a review of it and published the outcome in February.  Up to the end of last year, 217 mortgage-to-rent cases were completed and there were more than 600 other cases in progress.    We heard some of the same commentaries the members have heard about the scheme, namely, that the process involved takes a long time and that it is cumbersome.  We have itemised a number of actions in the review we published in February to try to improve the level of take-up in respect of the scheme.  Some of those actions relate to the process involved - to try to make it faster - and some are around access to it.  For example, we have increased the value of property that can be accepted into the scheme.  We have also increased the thresholds for different houses and apartments in various parts of the country.  We increased what can be accepted as spare capacity within a house.  Under the new arrangements we have put in place, a house can be over-accommodated, so to speak, by two bedrooms.  The owners of houses can have two spare bedrooms and they will still be able to qualify for the scheme.  There is a programme of actions listed at the back of the review that are to be completed over the course of this year and that are set out to be done quarter by quarter.  We are pretty much on track with most of those.<\/p><p> Some of the changes I have outlined came into force in recent days.  Since the publication of the review, there has been a good, active programme with the AHBs.  The latter take ownership of the properties to try to smooth out the conveyancing process and there a number of workshops have been held with other parties to try to ensure that we can massively reduce the time the process involved takes and to open up the scheme to a wider cohort of people.  We will keep the scheme under review over the next few quarters and we hope there will be an increased level of activity under it, a return for the effort that is being put into it and, ultimately, that it will deliver housing solutions for the people who need them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017033000002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490878800,"counter":1740,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As Garda Commissioner and on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I sincerely apologise for the grave mistakes and wrongdoing during the last decade that have led to the two controversies we are here today to discuss.  Those mistakes and wrongdoings are unacceptable in policing terms, unacceptable in ethical terms, unacceptable in terms of public trust, and, most critically, unacceptable to the advocacy and support groups involved in road safety and to those who were wrongly brought before the courts.  They have raised serious issues about how at all levels the service was managed, how certain garda&iacute; operated on the ground and the supervision applied.  Given the scale of these issues, they cannot simply be blamed on one individual or one area.  It is a collective failure from top down and bottom up.  We all take responsibility for this and for ensuring we establish how this happened and that it cannot happen again.  The committee has been provided with a detailed timeline of events for both matters.  As these are two separate issues, I will deal with each one separately.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the issue of summonses for fixed charge notices, FCNs, being wrongly issued.  In February 2016, a garda contacted our call centre, known as the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC, in Castlebar and alerted them that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was issuing summonses for not having a valid national car test, NCT, certificate when it should have been a fine.  GISC put checks in place to stop this happening but some summonses had been previously issued and were still in the system.  Discovering the issue was nationwide; we took two actions.  The first was to put an information technology fix in place to prevent it happening it again.  An instruction that all proceedings incorrectly instituted be withdrawn was also issued.<\/p> <p>  We immediately initiated a look-back, which demonstrated that a number of cases had already been incorrectly referred to the courts and dealt with by way of summons rather than FCN, and this had to be rectified.  In each and every case an offence had been committed, but an incorrect procedure had been employed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has spoken to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the Courts Service about how to address cases where a penalty point has been imposed.  A dedicated team has been set up and we are liaising with the Courts Service to expedite this process.  We will be writing to all the people affected from 3 April 3 2017 on the foot of the advice we sought from the DPP.  We will explain what happened and how we propose to rectify the matter.  Any fines imposed will be reimbursed and all records involved will be corrected.  Anyone who believes they have been affected by this matter will be able to contact a helpline from 3 April 2017.<\/p> <p>  I will deal now with the separate issue of breath tests.  Correspondence from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to the Minister responsible for transport was brought to our notice in 2014, where the issue of mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints and other matters were raised.  The fact that the original complaint was anonymous hindered our ability to investigate the matter fully.<\/p><p>However, I issued an instruction to deputy commissioner of operations who subsequently directed all regional assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents to ensure effective mechanisms were in place to monitor the operation of Mandatory Alcohol Testing, MAT, checkpoints within their respective divisions and districts.  The Department of Justice and Equality was also advised of this.  In addition, we set up a working group to review the recording of traffic equipment and PULSE related data.  The outcome of this working group indicated significant discrepancies in data in one region.  Following this, a nationwide review of all breath test data commenced in June 2016.  We then notified the Department of Justice and Equality of this review and put a note on our website saying our breath test figures were subject to review.  The review was unable to reconcile the PULSE data and the paper-based breath test data, primarily due to significant gaps in the manually recorded breath test data.  To validate the data, we asked the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to provide us with  the data from its breath test screening devices.  In terms of the scale of difference between its data and ours from 2011 and 2016, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na PULSE data was 1,995,369 and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety data was 1,058,157.<\/p><p> In November 2016, new electronic procedures were installed on the Garda PULSE system.  This meant personnel had to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test, plus the meter reading, before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint and it indicates that our figures match with those of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for 2016-17.  The breath testing and FCPN issues are being resolved and this will be externally validated.  However, the fact is that we now know some garda&iacute; recorded exaggerated numbers.  At worst, this was deception.  At best, this was incompetence.  Either way, it was individually and organisationally shameful, and will be seen to be shameful by the public and the thousands of garda&iacute; around the country who operate every day to the highest ethical standards.  It also raises serious questions of supervision and management.  My fear &ndash; my real fear - is that this falsification and these mistakes may not be confined to traffic data.  I will ensure that the people responsible at all levels will be held to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017033000002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1748,"content":"<p>I thank the Garda Commissioner for her opening statement.

We are trying to put things right and trying to ensure that we serve the public in an open, professional, transparent and ethical manner and to the standards that would be expected of a modern, professional policing service.  In doing that, we are turning over a lot of stones.  We do not leave a stone unturned.  The turning of one of those stones involved a review of issues that were raised with us around the conduct of MAT checkpoints and the breath testing issue that arose in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Last March, assistant commissioner, Mr. Michael Finn, identified massive discrepancies between the recorded breath tests on PULSE and the records held by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.

Before the Commissioner answers me, I want to put a couple of questions and points to her.  Yes, we are talking quite big numbers, it is a discrepancy of approximately 1 million and we are talking about a lot of mandatory tests, but she commands a force, and by her own statements, she has been conducting her own investigation that started approximately in 2014.  She has come in today, and she has said that the Garda management has still not completed the audit.  Does she think that is acceptable?  <\/p><p> I would be very interested to know if the Commissioner could give me a logistical breakdown on how many people have been deployed to carry out this work, from the initial audit in the southern region to date.  That speaks volumes to how seriously she is taking this.

This issue was raised in April 2014.  I want to preface this statement by saying that this is not an excuse, these are just facts.  The facts were that the former Commissioner had retired.  I was acting in an interim capacity only, performing the functions of the Commissioner, both deputy commissioners - Deputy Commissioner Operations and Deputy Commissioner Strategy and Change Management - so I was the single person in the executive.  I had the most seriously reduced management team ever in the history of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The assistant commissioner who was given this responsibility to do was carrying portfolios, three very significant portfolios.  These are not excuses but the facts were that the layers of management below that were depleted.  To link in with Deputy Daly's question - the committee members will understand but I say this for the benefit of the public - the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has devolved functions.  There is the Commissioner, there are deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, and they form the nucleus of the management team.  At that stage, we were dealing with such a depleted management team that I was almost single-handed, with a team of five assistant commissioners, trying to run what was then a 14,500 person organisation.  To be fair to the individual who was given this task, he had to do it with a myriad of other responsibilities.  I do not have a logistical breakdown of the people who applied but I would be very happy to provide it to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The chief superintendent, who was in the traffic bureau at the time, was also carrying multiple portfolios, as was the superintendent.  We had come through a very significant recession and the Garda were no different from anywhere else in the public or private sector but some of the legacy issues that we are dealing with now arise from the deficit and depletion of the supervisory and management capacity.  It is worth remembering that I spent nine months in that position as interim Acting-Commissioner.  I was appointed in November of that year.  It took a further 11 months to have two deputy commissioners appointed and it is only in January of this year that we eventually got the appointment of a full executive, that is the people you see here.  We very much welcome the transition of senior Garda appointments to the Policing Authority and thankfully, last week, along with the Policing Authority, we eventually got a panel of assistant commissioners -----  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017033000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":1901,"content":"<p>That is very good, but the Commissioner has answered none of the questions I asked.  She has said she is not making excuses but she then delivered a complete set of excuses as to why she did not do something.<\/p> <p>  I asked how many people were deployed to the audit.  She does not know.  That is incredible.  There are two aspects of this that are very important.  First, the Garda conducted the initial audit in the southern region.  Whatever about the time lag between the Garda management deciding to change processes afterwards, the initial audit was conducted in the southern region and something obviously registered with the Garda that there was a problem, regardless of how many people were not there to make decisions.  Did the Commissioner not think that problem was so serious that she should inform the Policing Authority properly?  I put it to the Commissioner that not only did she not think that the problem was serious enough at that stage to inform the Policing Authority, but that in some of the answers which she and her colleagues gave to the Policing Authority, they went out of their way not to make it obvious that they were dealing with something very serious.  The Commissioner knew it was serious enough that processes were going to have to be changed.  She knew it was serious enough that she would have to trigger a national audit, even if she took forever to do it, but the knew it was serious enough.  She did not think it was serious enough to go out of her way to forthrightly bring it to the attention of the Policing Authority, or to anyone else, to say there was a belief there was a very serious problem.  Maybe more was done in private in which case the Commissioner might tell us, but in public answers to the Policing Authority a minimum amount of information was given.  <\/p> <p>  The reason I asked the Commissioners to apologise for how she has conducted the investigation is that Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management has a method of answering questions which involves not supplying information unless we absolutely get to the heart of it.  It deeply upsets me and is unacceptable in our time.  Again, I ask, how many people were involved in the audit?  Does she have any indication as to whether it was one person writing letters?  Does she have any indication as to whether a team was established?  Does she have any indication as to whether, if that team was established, there were, say, ten people on it or 15?  She is in here and says that it is not completed.  How many people are currently working on the audit?  What level of priority is given to it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017033000002#F00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490860800,"counter":1902,"content":"<p>I will make some general points.  Deputy Commissioner, John Twomey, was there for the initial part of the audit and it has continued.  I do not have the logistical breakdown of the individuals but we are happy to provide it.  The Deputy makes a very interesting point about the old culture of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of waiting until we get to the heart of the answers.  That is the way we do things.  We have been brought up as policemen and women and we like to establish the facts before we come out publicly.  Part of the commitment to openness and transparency which we committed to in our modernisation and renewal programme, and that we committed to and I committed to as part of the Government reform programme, was exactly what we saw happen in this case.  We do not have all the answers.  The assistant commissioner has outlined how it was of such significant proportions that we made a decision and the assistant commissioner raised this with the public.   In June 2016, when we became aware that there was an issue with the fixed charge notices, we put a notice on our website to tell people.  On the breath tests, we put a qualifier on the website to say that this data is subject to review.<\/p> <p>  For the record, as the committee knows, the Policing Authority was constituted on 1 January 2016.  The authority was not there in November 2015.  I will ask the deputy commissioner to deal with the informal briefings that were given to the authority.  It is a matter of regret that when the Policing Authority was constituted, it was not informed of this fact.

In this case, both of my colleagues sitting to my right and left, can explain how this would mean a trawl through volumes, mountains of paper records to try to match them with the PULSE system which the Garda inspectorate quite rightly pointed out is outdated and archaic.

One of the significant changes we have made in our culture is making sure we put prevention first and at the heart of everything we do.  The following is a hypothesis - I want to be very careful - that perhaps the preventive nature of MAT checkpoints was not valued or viewed as being as important as detections.  I do not wish in any way to detract from what I said in my opening remarks about the very good, diligent, professional and ethical work done by the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na every single day, but one hypothesis is that because of this, recording accurate numbers, be it 24 or 48 hours after a very busy period - that does not lessen or diminish the actions involved - was not seen as important as being accurate in the detection of offences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017033000002#J03100","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":2003,"content":"<p>I hope to come back to Deputy Jack Chambers, but, in fairness to everyone else, I call on him to ask one last question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017033000002#J03200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":2004,"content":"<p>I have a few more questions to ask, but perhaps I might get to them later.  There must have been a cultural trigger for these actions and the representatives must provide some idea for the committee as to why they happened.  It is not acceptable simply to wait for a factual understanding.  They should give us, as senior members of the Garda, as the ones who accept responsibility collectively, as they stated, some idea as to why this happened.<\/p> <p>  I want to track back.  Again, I am interested in the period from 2006 to 2009.  There are a number of reasons one could have had a cultural trigger.  One was there would have been an incentive.  There can be an incentive for a member of any organisation to do better or perhaps gain credit within the system in terms of promotion.  That is one question.  Do the representatives believe any Garda member anywhere tried to manipulate data to drive potential promotional opportunities?  <\/p> <p>  I refer to the bonus-related payments system in place from 2006 until 2010.  We know that senior officials in the Civil Service and the wider public service were paid bonuses based on particular outcomes driven by human resource management within the context of whatever system in which they were operating.  We know that a bonus system was in place for members of the force from assistant commissioner level up.  What were the performance-related targets at the time when bonuses were paid and could this have been the trigger for driving data upwards in the force?  Was that the trigger that drove a cultural norm within the force to maximise data outcomes?  We know that bonuses were paid to most senior officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At the time the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, criticised the bonus culture across the senior sections of the Civil Service and the wider public service, but we know that senior officers in the Garda also received bonuses.  What I want to know specifically is whether data for traffic, alcohol testing and checkpoints were potentially linked with bonuses?  In a particular division if one Garda member had a better outcome in the data submitted as against his or her colleagues, was there a difference in the bonuses paid?  Were there performance-related targets linked with bonuses which we know were paid to senior officers in the force at the time.

We took not only the 11 Garda Inspectorate reports but the 43 reports that were completed on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the previous ten years.  I was asked about those ten years.  The 43 reports contained no less than 1,400 recommendations and a significant number of those were from the Garda Inspectorate.  For the first time ever in the history of the State and the history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we set about developing a comprehensive and coherent reform programme and last June we launched the programme.  The last time I attended the committee, we shared that document with it.  However, we did not just launch a glossy document.  We set out a roadmap of precisely what we were going to do over the next five to seven years.

I thank the Commissioner and her team for attending.  A number of colleagues have tried to tease out with limited success through no fault of their own the mechanics and timelines around the disastrous controversies that the Commissioner has outlined.  I want to home in primarily but not exclusively on the rather short statement the Commissioner made to the committee this morning.  While I concede that I do not have the legal experience or prowess of some of my colleagues, I did note the Commissioner's very careful use of language in her opening lines.  Even at this stage, I wonder why this disastrous controversy is regarded as either \"grave mistakes\" or \"wrongdoing\", especially as she later went on to concede in her oral contribution that we may be dealing with a situation in which garda&iacute; knowingly submitted false information.  The other scenario she offered up was that they did this somehow in error or through ignorance.  I was always told and directed that ignorance of the law was no defence.  Either way, I am curious to know why this is not a much more serious issue than simply a mistake or a wrongdoing.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the witness's own remarks and her contributions to the press over the last couple of days, I wonder whether she specifically informed the Minister for Justice and Equality before she or her organisation spoke to the press.  When did she make the Minister aware of the scale of this controversy and of the falsified breath tests?  What was the level of information that she offered to the Minister in that regard?<\/p> <p>  I understand we are under time pressure, but I wish to make a point that deeply troubles me and should cause this committee and the public great concern.  It relates to the second last line of the witness's opening remarks today, in which she said, \"My fear &ndash; my real fear - is that this falsification and these mistakes may not be confined to traffic data.\"  I think the Commissioner does us and the public a terrible disservice by raising a red flag like that without expanding upon it.  She raised that red flag and then told us she has no specific evidence.  Has she limited evidence?  Has she an idea?  Has she had any kind of confidential disclosure?  For example, has she had any detail around whether this data relates to the recovery of drugs, weapons and firearms, domestic violence statistics as referred to earlier today, or the arrest and registration of sex offenders?  Where exactly are her concerns on this?  The witness has spoken about leadership and I agree with her.  At times of crisis in particular, there needs to be very strong leadership indicated.

I noted that Senator Conway referred to it and I was glad that other members were aware of what she said.  One does not always find something when a stone is overturned.

They relate to the broad brush of our data and our data retention.  It identified specifically crime classification, reclassification, attention and complaints.  It recommended that there were too many people involved in that entire process up along the chain and there was no strict rigidity in how we dealt with it.<\/p> <p>  On Monday, in our information centre in Castlebar, we made the decision that it will become the centre of excellence for the country.  All decisions on classification, reclassification and detection will be made in that centre.  In the work over the past year we have been considering the processes and procedures.  We had to get two things into place, one was additional staff and one was additional information technology, IT, facilities to do that.  The staff have now been provided.  With effect from next Monday all stations in the northern region of the country will enter into this process.  In essence what will happen now is that a crime will be classified by Castlebar, by the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC.  The quality assurance will be provided by the same centre.  Any decision about reclassification will be made by those particular people.  They will assure the quality of all the data that comes in.  That will cascade around the country and will take control of it.  That is a clear recommendation from the Garda Inspectorate.  It goes a step further in that it takes out an individual layer the inspectorate suggested should be there.  On reviewing it we took that out.  <\/p> <p>  We will review the crime classification, the reclassification and the detections, for example, a new domestic violence policy is coming out.  The Commissioner spoke about the protective service bureau that has been established in the centre.  It quality reviews incidents daily.  The divisional protective service units will be in place next month, May, in three divisions around the country and that will continue to roll out.  The domestic violence policy will ensure that every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is trained in doing a risk assessment in advance of the incident; doing a risk assessment while at the incident and in the interaction that will take place with the various non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that work in this area.  There is a great deal of work coming through in that specific area.  Our most vulnerable victims will have access to fully trained, fully resourced investigators, interviewers and people who can deal with these dreadful issues that they encounter.  That will start from next month.  That is the process and that is the work this committee has done.  It is an ongoing process.  It takes time from a resourcing perspective and a research perspective.  That work will continue.  It starts on Monday and we expect that it will be completed by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  The committee is aware from previous presentations that we are unable to properly record our call data.  There is an interim IT fix coming in.  It has started and we expect it to be everywhere throughout the country by the end of June, and by the end of the year there will be a form of integration with police using leading systems effectively, PULSE.  We are dealing with very old technology and we are trying to bring that up to modern standards.  We are putting a fix into something that is 25 years old.  That is where we are coming from.  We have repeated on several occasions that where there are issues of wrongdoing or matters of concern that we need to tell people we will do that.  That is what we are doing in this instance.  It is unfortunate that we do not have all the answers everybody requires because we took the unprecedented step of putting the information into the public domain when we felt it was the right thing to do from a cultural perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017033000002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Twomey"},{"type":"speech","time":1490860800,"counter":2216,"content":"<p>I want to be clear in my own head in terms of my earlier remark because much of that did not cover what I asked.

We have had issues with the statistics, as the Commissioner is aware.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is standing over the statistics and publishing them.

I am always very keen to parse that.  The Commissioner referred to \"mistakes and wrongdoings\".  To my mind, \"wrongdoings\" constitute immoral or illegal acts.  There is no other way of interpreting the word.  It might sound less dramatic than words like \"immoral\" and \"illegal\", but there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that we are certainly talking about wrongdoings that equal immoral or illegal acts.  Without question, there is a public sense - not just a political sense - that all this must have consequences.  Some members of the committee have reflected the fear in this regard.  The Commissioner said earlier that \"we all take responsibility\".  She is well aware of the adage that when we all take responsibility, nobody takes responsibility.  Nobody is responsible.  I am not putting the Commissioner in a difficult position when I say, as Chairman of this committee and as an elected representative of my constituency and my community over many years, that I believe there is a critically important need to address this matter in a substantive and forensic manner.  There must be a clear understanding that wrongdoing is an immoral or illegal act and must have consequences.<\/p><p> I ask the Commissioner to respond as she deems appropriate to a final comment.  In the closing part of her opening statement, she summed up what has taken place by saying \"at worst, this was deception\".  Again, this is a question of language.  I do not know whether the word \"deception\" is a sufficiently strong portrayal of what has taken place here.  Our understanding of the word \"deception\" is that it means the act of deceiving.  It involves a person having someone else believe something that he or she patently knows to be false, or setting out quite purposely to have somebody else believe something he or she knows to be false.  It is a very serious matter.  This is important because words like \"wrongdoings\" and \"deception\" do not quite hit the pitch in what we are discussing here.  Some key questions arise in this context.  Who were those responsible seeking to deceive?  That question has not been asked.  Were they seeking to deceive An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, senior Garda management or the public?  The Commissioner's very interesting hypothesis may very well be the case, but it is important that in the production of Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's report, there is clarity as to the purpose, intent or motivation, or all three, of those involved.  Motivation is an area of clear interest.  What was behind their action?  What was their purpose?  Was there a return or reward for acting as they did?  It is important for the answers to these questions to be established properly and placed in the public arena.  I hope this exercise will be as comprehensive as the Commissioner has assured the committee this morning it will be.  I invite her to respond to the issues I have highlighted and to make any other closing remarks she would like to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017033000002#Y02300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490860800,"counter":2454,"content":"<p>We hope our statement was worded in a way that indicates the seriousness and gravity with which we are taking this matter.

That will remain the position until Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan carries out his work and the external investigation concludes.  Beyond that, we do not know.
