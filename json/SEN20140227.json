I know that manifesto promises do not really mean anything but this is an opportunity for Fine Gael to make good on its promise on this issue.  Senator Quinn did a magnificent job yesterday and my party was only too happy to support him.  The Bill has now passed in the Seanad, with the tacit assistance of the provisional Labour Party grouping of the three missing-in-action Senators.

I ask that we be given an opportunity to put some of the concerns of the GPs directly to the Minister or Minister of State.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate specifically on the contract for the under-sixes.  Most of us would prefer to see children who need GP cards getting them.  I am all for the idea of under-sixes having free GP care but I am not in favour of children who are seven, eight or nine losing medical cards or GP cards.  What is the point in trying to roll out an unworkable contract to give free GP care to healthy children under six, many of whom are in families who can afford to pay for such care, while taking medical cards and GP cards from children and the elderly who need them?  I met a woman last week with terminal lung cancer who really needs her card.  Cystic fibrosis patients are having their cards taken from them and the Government knows this.

For some time, this side of the House has called for a Minister for rural affairs and that legislation should be rural-proofed.<\/p><p>I tabled a matter on the Adjournment about the closure of a number of banks in west Cork, in particular in Schull and Ballydehob, and the Minister of State the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, felt that, in some instances, the banks were using economic restructuring as a scapegoat and that was not justified.  As the banks in Schull and Ballydehob were closed, he indicated that the three post offices on that peninsula would be supported by extra financial business which the banks had failed to provide to the local community.  As has happened all over the country, another bank was closed in Dromcollogher.  One arm of Government is saying that social welfare must be paid through the banks rather than the post offices but Government policy should be tweaked in such a way that rural post offices are supported.  <\/p><p>Last night I met a postmistress from Ardgroom village, which is 110 miles from Cork city.  She said farmers who were in receipt of farm assist had to travel 50 miles the bank in Bantry to draw the money as the money must be lodged in a bank rather than a post office.  This is serious kick in the teeth to rural Ireland.  As it is such a serious issue and as this is the first time I have spoken on it for some weeks, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, or whoever is the appropriate Minister comes to the House today, even for one hour, to explain the direction in which we are going in regard to rural Ireland.  <\/p><p>The banks have closed and the Garda stations are closing.  If the rural post offices go, it will be an awful kick in the teeth.  The policies of the Government are dictating that they will be closed.  The banks bullied us and let us down with a bang and now the post offices, which are the only back-up people in rural Ireland have, are being ground to a halt because the policy of certain Ministers is that people should forget about rural post offices and use the banks.

It took guts to stay away.  I do not think anybody in Fianna F&aacute;il would have done any more than that or would have broken the Whip.  This is the realism of politics and it allowed that Bill to go through.<\/p><p>Being a politician, I would like to lay a bit of a claim to the triumph because I both took and gave advice.  I asked Senator Quinn if he wanted support for the Bill.  He said: &quot;Yes, but would you ever keep your mouth shut because we are afraid the Government will talk it out&quot;, so I went to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and came back for the vote.<\/p> <p>I suggested to Senator Quinn that we call a walk-through vote.  That is part of the way we run it, but it is the Senator's triumph and we should all unanimously commend him on this.<\/p><p>This also questions the Cathaoirleach's position under Standing Orders.  I do not mean this in a personal way or as a criticism of the way he chairs proceedings.  The Cathaoirleach is elected as an independent representative to be neutral and I am not sure if this nonsense that he or she must always go with the Government is in Standing Orders, but it is not in the Constitution.  I acknowledge that it follows precedent, and the Cathaoirleach was perfectly correct in what he did, but that is one of the reforms that needs to come in.  Perhaps if we provide for a secret ballot for the Chair whereby he or she is instructed to vote on the issue and not to automatically to go with the Government, that would be an enhancement of our democracy.<\/p><p>I refer to the question of the Garda Commissioner.

It is obvious from some of the comments made yesterday on HGV regulation that there is a great deal of confusion, or else Members are getting misinformation from their SDLP or Unionist colleagues in the North regarding the HGV levy.  It is a tax over which the Assembly has no control.  I assure anybody who is concerned that Sinn F&eacute;in has lobbied long and hard to ensure the levy is not introduced.

The reply given by the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Tom Hayes, was correct in that he said the licensing process must be independent, but the fact that the Minister and the Taoiseach have met one of the major stakeholders in the industry at a time when the licensing process is under way was inappropriate.  I ask the Leader to use his office to ask the Minister to make a clear statement that the issue of the Inis Oirr fish farm was not discussed with the chief executive officer of Marine Harvest when they met recently and that he does not intend to discuss it when he attends the aquaculture conference in Norway in the next few weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022700005#D03100","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1393498200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>A social welfare contract worth &euro;50 million has been awarded to An Post, which will secure its future and the jobs therein.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022700005#D03200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1393498200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Did the Senator notice the postmasters' briefing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022700005#D03300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1393498200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I refer to the sale of the Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, loan book, which has been raised in the House on a number of occasions.

It is appalling that we are approving a situation in which foreign private equity funds can target the purchase of the loans with no safeguards and we are depending on their goodwill in treating borrowers sympathetically.  It is unacceptable for any Government to be in that position.  The loan book will go to the funds who target returns on investment of 20% to 30%.  Usually, this is in a high-risk area.

The Bill is very positive.  It should ensure considerable improvements in the access of many people to broadband and should enhance the quality of life because of the issues that have arisen with the last mile of broadband from some of the companies that have been rolling out services to date.  However, we still have reservations which is the reason we put forward this simple amendment which calls for the fibre optic cable not to be privatised.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the Minister has said it is not the intention of the Government to privatise the system but in order to copperfasten the position we should include the provision in the legislation to ensure that no Government can in future make such a change without going back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  One of the main reasons we have such a poor broadband infrastructure compared to our European neighbours is due to the fact that Telecom &Eacute;ireann was privatised in the 1990s.  Ireland is a small country and a national State provider such as Telecom &Eacute;ireann was needed to provide the necessary infrastructure to extend the broadband network.  That is partly the reason this solution has been sought.  I am pleased the ESB is now coming on board to assist in the roll-out of broadband services as it has a relationship with every home in the country.  I take the Minister at his word that it is not his intention personally at this stage that the system would be privatised but the position should be copperfastened in the legislation because we have seen what can happen when Ministers or an Administration change.  I hope he will take the amendment on board which has been put forward in good faith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022700010#J01600","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393500900,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is very welcome to the House for this Committee Stage debate.

As regards the amendment before the House, the purpose of this Bill is to provide an explicit legal basis to enable the ESB to engage, now or in the future, in the installation and operation of an electronic communications network attached to the existing electricity network and to provide for consequential matters.<\/p><p>  The current legislative proposal does not exempt the ESB from any current legislative requirements or regulatory rules.  The ESB is required by the Electricity (Supply)(Amendment) Act of 1988 to secure the consent of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to dispose of shares or interests in the assets of any such company.  This requirement will apply to any electronic communications assets the ESB may develop directly or through any subsidiary.<\/p><p>  If the ESB enters the fully liberalised electronic communications market in the future, in the manner it has proposed in outline form, or in any other form, it must do so on a commercial basis.  It is essential therefore that it has the <i>vires<\/i> to negotiate on commercial terms with potential partners to co-fund the capital required to develop electronic communications networks.  The authority to negotiate such funding would be significantly compromised if ownership of the asset is restricted to the State by primary legislation.

The idea is to use the existing infrastructure of the ESB to roll out future-proofed fibre optic cable to parts of Ireland that would not have a realistic prospect of that happening.  It is a very innovative use of infrastructure in the ownership of a commercial State company.  It proposes to do it by way of a joint venture with a leading telecommunications company.  If I took on board Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s amendment it would tie the hands of the ESB in terms of the commercial negotiations with a telecommunications company on the funding of the roll-out.  I have not yet seen the detail although I have been concerned with and supportive of the proposal for quite a long time.  It is one of the most exciting projects that has come on the scene in terms of providing connectivity to parts of Ireland that otherwise could not remotely expect to have fibre optic cable.  I presume the partner will come up with a great deal of the funding in order to allow that to happen.  Apart from anything else I would be constraining that possibility if I were to accept the amendment.<\/p><p>If we have survived the hurricane of the past five years without privatising the ESB the Senator can be reasonably relaxed that we are likely to be able to defend the citadel into the foreseeable future.  It is very difficult sometimes to get any credit for things that one does in this business but it is exceptionally difficult to get any credit for things that one stopped happening.  I am personally very pleased - like Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh I have great respect for Senator Quinn &ndash; and proud that the ESB is still in State ownership.  Senator Quinn did not say any different to that.  What he said is that we ought not in primary legislation tie the hands of a future Administration in terms of the joint vehicle we are rolling out.<\/p><p>There are very good reasons the flexibility that exists at the moment to allow the ESB to do business as it thinks proper, in order to provide this service and to secure as much funding as possible with whomever it is it will partner, is a very good outcome in the public interest.

T&aacute;im thar a bheith bu&iacute;och d&oacute; as teacht isteach ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  The ferry service to the Aran Islands and Inis M&oacute;r in particular is in effect the highway for people living on the island because it provides their access to and from the island.  Until recent years there was a subsidy available to the operators of the service to serve all three islands.  The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy McGinley, decided to unbundle that contract so that the service to Inis Me&aacute;in and Inis Oirr continued with a subsidy but there is no subsidy available for the service to Inis M&oacute;r.  The logic was, I suppose, that because many tourists go to Inis M&oacute;r, it is a busy service and would be self-sustaining.  It appears that is not the case.<\/p><p>Members of Comharchumann Forbartha Arann have raised this with me.  They are very concerned.  They met representatives of the Oireachtas in January and asked us to raise this issue.  The local Deputies on the Government side assured us at that meeting that they would seek a meeting with the Minister of State on this issue because it is very serious.  That has not happened.  What engagement has there been between the Minister of State and the people of Inis M&oacute;r on this issue?  The major issue raised by Comharchumann Forbartha Arann is that an unsubsidised ferry service cannot be guaranteed during the winter months, and it asks that this route be advertised for tender as soon as possible.  The company running the service commercially says it is losing money during the winter months.  There is no obligation on it to provide a service during the winter months and therefore the people of Inis M&oacute;r could be left without any service whatsoever.<\/p><p>The comharcumann also has a problem with levies imposed by Galway County Council and has asked the Minister of State to intervene.  As islanders they feel this is an unfair tax and they vehemently oppose it.  They have asked the Minister of State to intervene with the local authority to try to come up with another solution instead of a levy, which they maintain has an adverse effect on the numbers travelling to the island.  The numbers have dropped dramatically and they have written to inform the Minister of State about this.  They feel that Galway County Council as a public body should work in the interests of the island and not impose a tax on travel to the island.  This Government abolished tax on flights in and out of the whole island because it was detrimental to tourism but allowing a county council impose a tax on people travelling to a smaller offshore island raises the same argument, as the figures show.<\/p><p>The co-op also notes that no other coastal island has such a levy, and the loss of between 40,000 and 50,000 people per annum travelling from Doolin to Inis M&oacute;r is due to this levy.  This is generating a great deal of negative publicity and ticket prices will probably increase due to this levy, resulting in fewer people travelling.  This is a serious problem for the people of the Aran Islands.  They have forwarded the statistics to the Minister of State on the fall in visitor numbers.  They feel the locals are being penalised because the cost of travelling from Inis M&oacute;r to Rossaveal has increased as a result of the subsidy's being discontinued.<\/p><p>It is unacceptable that since the meeting in January the Minister of State has not met the Comharchumann Forbartha Arann on this issue.  I will call on him to have that meeting as soon as possible to see what can be done to rectify the situation.  The tenders for the ferry service at least could be advertised to see what type of operators would pitch for them, how much it would cost and whether a subsidy could or needs to be reinstated for the ferry service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022700013#M00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1393501800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Ta me ag labhairt inni&uacute; ar son an Aire St&aacute;it Mac Fhionnlaoich a bhfuil aifeala air nach f&eacute;idir leis a bheith i lathair de bharr go bhfuil s&eacute; ar ghn&oacute; eile.<\/p><p>The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is the principal Department charged with island development by supporting the improvement of infrastructure and assisting with the provision of essential services.  The Department subsidises lifeline transport services for inhabited offshore islands.  These comprise passenger and cargo ferry services, with a connecting bus service where necessary.  In addition, the Department subsidises an air service for the three Aran Islands, which includes Inis M&oacute;r, under a public service obligation contract.  In this regard the Department also subsidises a management service for the aerodromes based on these islands.  In all, the Department subsidises transport services for 19 offshore islands in counties Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Cork.  These services provide safe, all-year round transport services for the islands involved, thereby improving the quality of life for islanders and supporting sustainable island communities as well as promoting island tourism.  Expenditure on these services was &euro;5.9 million in 2013.  The same allocation is available in 2014.<\/p><p>The contract for the subsidised passenger ferry service for Inis M&oacute;r came to an end on 31 January 2013.  The Department sought tenders through a public tendering process, as it does with all its subsidised services, for a further five-year contract until 31 January 2018, but received no tender within the deadline set.  In the absence of a tender, officials from the Department held discussions with the ferry operator that had been providing the contracted service to explore the possibility of entering into a new contract for the service on the same terms as the previous contract.  Unfortunately, these discussions were unsuccessful as the Department could not accept the operator's claim for a substantial subsidy increase on a service that is, by all accounts, profitable without a subsidy.  The Department understands that the operator continued to provide the service at the same level since the end of the contract with the State but that the fares payable by island residents were increased.<\/p><p>I understand that some uncertainty has recently arisen regarding the continuation of the service at the current level.  A representative of the operator met with my Department and indicated that circumstances for the company have altered and that it cannot guarantee it will be able to continue operating as previously.  Officials also met representatives of the island co-op and the Minister of State is aware of their concerns with regard to the present situation.<\/p><p>The Minister of State would like to make it clear to the Senator that he is open to undertaking any reasonable steps that would assist in finding a resolution to meet with the requirements of all parties.  Any steps the Department might take must fall within public procurement regulations and be achievable within the resources available to it.  There are no plans at present to re-advertise this contract as the Department does not have in its possession any evidence to indicate that the outcome of another public tendering process would differ dramatically from that which took place towards the end of 2012.  As the Senator will appreciate, it is incumbent on the Minister of State to ensure public money is spent in the most cost-effective manner and achieves the maximum return for the State.  The Department cannot justify subsidising a service if such subsidy is not warranted.<\/p> <p>I assure the Senator that efforts will continue to ensure there will be a regular passenger ferry service to the island at reasonable cost throughout the year and Department personnel are always available for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022700013#M00400","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393502400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it agus molaim &eacute; as c&uacute;pla focal Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id ag an t&uacute;s.  The key line in the reply is that the Department does not have in its possession any evidence which would indicate the outcome of another public tendering process would differ dramatically.  I contend that there cannot be any extra evidence unless there is a tender.  The Minister needs to put the needs of the people on the island first and should meet representatives of Comharchumann Forbartha &Aacute;rann Teoranta, as they may have the evidence sought by the Department.  His first priority should be a year-round sustainable service to Inis M&oacute;r so they can continue to develop the island economically, socially, etc.  I call on the Minister of State to ask another Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, to intervene and meet representatives of the co-op as soon as possible in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022700014#N00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1393502400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Senator's contribution.

Although this issue is not directly connected to his Department, it is an extremely important matter in the north side of Cork city.  There is a proposed amalgamation and reconfiguration of schools in the area and one is Scoil Mhuire Fatima, or North Mon.  That school has 170 students and no infant classes; if it had a full complement, it would probably have over 200 students because the infant classes are dealt with at the North Presentation school and St. Vincent's school.  When this proposal arose, there was no consultation with parents, teachers or boards of management.<\/p><p>The proposal is for the amalgamation of North Mon with St. Vincent's and there is major concern among parents and teachers that the facilities at St. Vincent's are inadequate with regard to play areas, for example.  The proposal would also have a Gaelscoil at Farranferris move to North Mon.  There is concern that the proposal seems to be going ahead with little or no consultation with parents, teachers or the principals of the schools.  I attended a meeting of over 250 parents recently and major concerns were expressed.  The Minister should get involved in the issue as there is no support for the proposal as it currently exists.  The Gaelscoil could still be accommodated at North Mon without the primary school moving to St. Vincent's.  This concern has been expressed by parents, teachers and the principal at North Mon.  It should be taken on board by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022700014#N00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1393502400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  As a Minister of State in the Department of Education and Skills and being from Cork I am very much aware of the issue at hand.  I thank Senator Burke for raising the matter as it offers us the opportunity to clarify the current position of the proposed amalgamation and reconfiguration of primary schools on the north side of Cork City.  I advise the Senator that we are aware that a consultation process has been initiated involving North Presentation primary school, St. Vincent's girls' primary school, Scoil Mhuire Fatima - or North Mon primary school - and Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers.<\/p><p>As the Senator may be aware, the initiative for any amalgamation or reconfiguration of schools may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, boards of management and patrons.  Any such proposal must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders and follow decisions taken at local level.  In that regard, any proposed changes must be well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of parents, teachers and local communities, which is a key point, and contributes to an inclusive education system.  It is a matter for the relevant school authorities, including the parents and school community, to arrive at a satisfactory outcome.<\/p><p>I confirm that although the decision making authority for the amalgamation of any school belongs to the patron of the schools concerned, such a proposal is then subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills.  With regard to the primary school amalgamation and reconfiguration being proposed, I understand that details of this proposal has recently been sent to the boards of management, staff and parents of the four schools involved.  It is understood that when the consultation process is concluded, the trustees of the schools concerned will make a recommendation to the patron for his decision in the matter.<\/p><p>In that regard, I confirm that to date the Minister has not received any proposal from the patron or trustees in the matter.  I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to clarify the current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022700014#N00500","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1393502400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>There is some confusion about who is the patron.

In the absence of any application, correspondence or proposal to the Department or Minister, it could be argued that we are blind to any proposal.
