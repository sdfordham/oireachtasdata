Following the publication of the TII report on these consultations,\u00a0a decision was taken in late 2015 to pause development of the Greenway west of the Shannon\u00a0to allow all stakeholders to consider how best to progress this project.

A PIA includes a number of important statutory protections for the debtor.  These include the right to reasonable living expenses before payments to creditors are fixed, a statutory priority for their continued ownership and occupation of their home subject to the conditions set out at section 104 of the Act, a right of court review (subject to certain conditions) under section 115A if creditors reject a reasonable PIA proposal by a debtor, a return to solvency on completion of the payments envisaged by the PIA, and protection from other enforcement action by creditors during the period of the PIA.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Personal Insolvency Act does not set any minimum duration for a PIA.  Section 99 of the Act sets the maximum duration of a PIA at 6 years, although this period may be extended for up to a year in certain circumstances. In fact, many PIAs are concluded with a very short duration.  Analysis by the Insolvency Service of Ireland of a sample of 100 recently concluded PIAs showed that 43% provided for a period of less than 12 months, while 41% lasted from five to six years. None was concluded for longer than 6 years.<\/p>  <p>  This flexibility regarding the duration of a PIA is an important element which can significantly benefit the debtor.  Allowing a longer period can be very important in allowing an insolvent person to put together a proposal which can be accepted by creditors and, in particular, can be sufficient for them to remain in their home.  It can allow for a person in financial difficulty, or with temporarily reduced income or working hours, to recover from illness or unemployment, retrain, or increase or restore their earning capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Reducing the maximum length of a PIA from six years to three years is likely to have the unintended effect of denying some debtors the opportunity to avail of a PIA as they would not be able to make sufficient payments to creditors during the shorter arrangement period.  The Act's provisions already allow a PIA to be concluded for a much shorter period where this is desirable in the light of the debtor's individual circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200063#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insolvency Payments Scheme Payments","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200064#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[14484\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200064#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider increasing the amount of the reasonable living expenses, in particular for rural families for whom costs are higher; if she will consider allowing the cost of a second car to be included for rural families; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1263","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which provides that in deciding what payments could reasonably be made by an insolvent person to their creditors, account must be taken of that person's reasonable living expenses.  <\/p>  <p>  Under section 23 of the Act, the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) is required to prepare and issue guidelines on what constitute a reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses, taking account of differing personal and household circumstances including the composition of the household, age, health, and any disability.

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.<\/p>  <p>  In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools in the DEIS School Support Programme.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Schools included in the list published\u00a0by my Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Schools which have not been included or upgraded\u00a0at this stage, including the school referred to by the Deputy,\u00a0are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification process, which is fair and objective.<\/p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social inclusion@education.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. <\/p>  <p>  However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p>  <p>  Once this work\u00a0has been\u00a0completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p>  <p>  In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200067#WRM00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200067#WRM00350"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[14316\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200067#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of funding for a new school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department met with the school referred to in the context of an application received for a replacement school.

One of the criticisms of the last process was that it did not take sufficient account of local communities and local stakeholders.  The ETBs, as statutory education authorities, present in every county, with representation from local groups on their boards, are ideally placed to carry out this process.  The protocols surrounding how the consultation will be carried out will be carefully designed by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and each ETB will submit a report to the Department showing the results of these consultations, including details of how they were carried out in accordance with the protocols. <\/p>  <p>  There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons\/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.<\/p>  <p>  Each ETB will prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.<\/p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multi-denominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron\/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.<\/p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs&rsquo; in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered.  I would urge all parties to engage in this process constructively, with a view to reaching solutions to meet parental preferences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200068#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200068#WRN01350"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[14537\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200068#WRN01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status in relation to a school (details supplied) which has applied for additional accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my Department is in receipt of an application for additional accommodation from the school to which the Deputy refers.

Employers in the construction sector are represented on many of the Fora. <\/p>  <p>  The apprenticeship system is a major supplier of craft skills to the construction sector.  Following a number of years of decline, registrations in the 27 existing apprenticeship trades are rising as the employment and economic situation improves.

The Citizens Information Board (CIB) assures me that there will be no job losses, no closure of services, no change to service delivery locations and no change to the terms and conditions of serving staff during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  Most importantly, there will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them.  The decision was communicated by the Board to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on the same day. <\/p>  <p>  The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  It is worth clarifying that the new governance arrangements are not aimed at centralising the services provided by CIS and MABS.  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The decision taken will simply reduce the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  <\/p>  <p>  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3 million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.  Current costs are an aggregate of the costs incurred by each of the ninety three (93) local companies on items such as audit fees, professional fees (including legal services), payroll administration and board of director expenses.  While cost is not the driver of the restructuring project, some efficiencies are likely to result from moving to a reduced sixteen (16) company model.  The main aim of the project is to improve existing governance arrangements and optimise the benefits from operating a more modern, streamlined and customer focused service delivery model.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200069#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Delays","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200069#WRO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[14377\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200069#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason it has taken 14 weeks for the carer's allowance file of a person (details supplied) to be sent from the carer's allowance section in Sligo to the social welfare appeals office in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>I confirm that my Department received an application for carer's allowance from the person concerned on 8 June 2016.<\/p><p>It is a condition for receipt of a CA that the carer must be providing full-time care and attention.<\/p><p>The person concerned was refused carer's allowance on the grounds that she was not providing full-time care and attention.

Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means tested pension.  Secondly, the State pension (contributory) is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  <\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  <\/p>  <p>  Using another date would require legislative provision, and introducing such legislation would mean a number of decisions would have to be made, notably (a) what date should be used (preferably it would be a date that was not considered arbitrary)? (b) would the contributions paid before that date be ignored in the calculation of the yearly average, and would there be relief for such pensioners if this change reduced their entitlements? and (c) if there was a significant net benefit for pensioners as a result of this change, what would be the source of that funding (e.g. higher PRSI\/taxes, or a lower core rate of the pension generally)?<\/p>  <p>  The &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; describes a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As it was a rule rather than law, married women affected by it could take up other employment, and many did.  It is worth remembering that most public servants recruited prior to 1995 pay a reduced PRSI rate of 0.9% and so they are not generally entitled to the State pension.  Therefore, in such cases, the marriage bar would not be expected to have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  Instead, by impacting upon their continuing public service employment, the marriage bar&rsquo;s pension implications, where they exist, more generally relate to a person&rsquo;s eventual entitlement to a Public Service pension.  Any questions regarding this issue are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension there are supports available in the overall State pension system which assists qualification for a contributory payment, based on factors such as the contributions made by their spouse, and\/or other factors likely to impact upon their needs. These include &ndash; <\/p>  <p>   - The Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. This applies to periods following the introduction of that scheme in 1994.<\/p>  <p>   - Widows generally qualify for a full-rate Widows Contributory Pension.<\/p>  <p>   - Increases for Qualified Adults.<\/p>  <p>   - Credits for periods of unemployment and illness. <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;227 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension). <\/p>  <p>  I know my office received this query from your office and responded with a reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200070#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Waiting Times","counter":415,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200070#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":416,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[14558\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200070#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the average waiting time for a decision on a carer's allowance application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":417,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.

The discussions are focused on addressing outstanding issues, including the implementation of past agreements and addressing the legacy of the past, as well as on the formation of a new power-sharing Executive.  Both parts of these discussions are essential and inter-dependent.  <\/p>  <p>  All parties have shown a willingness to engage on the key issues. However, there is a limited timeframe for the formation of a new Executive.

I very much hope that the new Executive will be in place as soon as possible so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these vital negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The interests of the island as a whole and protecting the gains of the peace process will remain a priority for the Government in the upcoming EU-UK negotiations and the Government will continue to be proactive in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland, including through engagement with the Northern Ireland parties.

The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.<\/p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: .<\/p><p>The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement, which is made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the drug Respreeza was considered by the HSE Drugs Group, which did not make a recommendation for reimbursement on clinical grounds.  The HSE Leadership team has accepted the Drugs Group recommendation of non-reimbursement.<\/p><p>Under the HSE statutory assessment process, the HSE is required to set out a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company.  The HSE is legally required to provide at least a 28 day period (from the formal written notice of proposal), to enable the company to consider any such proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE if it wishes to do so.  The HSE is required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.<\/p><p>Therefore, as the statutory process is still ongoing, the company has an opportunity to have further discussions with the HSE.<\/p><p>In relation to the access scheme, the operation of such schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.  As Minister for Health I have no role in the operation of these schemes.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need.<\/p><p>I have previously said that any attempts by manufacturers to link continued access, for patients already being treated with a new medicine, with decisions under the statutory reimbursement process is both inappropriate and unethical.  Manufacturers should operate such schemes in a compassionate and not a commercially-motivated manner.  There should be no link between compassionate use schemes and reimbursement decisions and manufacturers should be open with patients and clinicians from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200074#WRT01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200074#WRT01300"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[14359\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200074#WRT01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a specialised wheelchair to a person (details supplied);

The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill contains a suite of meaningful measures to reduce the level of harmful consumption of alcohol in Ireland and the harms caused by alcohol.<\/p><p><b>Separation and Reducing Visibility<\/b><\/p><p>The Bill provides for restrictions on the display, advertisement and visibility of alcohol products in mixed trade retail outlets.  These provisions address concerns that alcohol is not an ordinary consumer product but a psychoactive drug that requires a licence for sale.  The separation and reduced visibility of alcohol products in the manner prescribed will achieve the following objectives:<\/p><p>- access to alcohol products will be controlled in premises to which it applies;<\/p><p>- alcohol products cannot be on open display near grocery products, thereby discouraging impulse purchases and the purchase of alcohol products as part of everyday household grocery shopping;<\/p><p>- separate display of alcohol products or closed display in storage units will make alcohol products less visible to children and protect them from in-store marketing techniques.<\/p><p>The options provided for in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill address the reasonable need for flexible implementation of the requirement to separate and reduce visibility of alcohol products in mixed trade retail outlets.<\/p><p><b>Labelling <\/b><\/p><p>The principle of the labelling provision is to provide consumers with information about the alcohol product and to provide health warnings.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill provides a 3 year lead in time for the introduction of the labelling provisions.  This time frame is considered to give sufficient time for manufacturers and retailers to prepare for these new provisions.  The labelling provisions are necessary as part of the suite of measures to increase awareness and knowledge of the dangers posed by alcohol consumption.  Research indicates that the labelling measures will be welcomed by consumers.  The Health Research Board Report &lsquo;Alcohol: Public Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviours&rsquo; stated that there is strong support for more labelling on cans and bottles containing alcohol.  The vast majority of those surveyed support including the number of calories (82 per cent), details of alcohol-related harms (95 per cent) and the ingredients (91 per cent) of alcohol products.<\/p><p>My Department considers that the suite of measures contained in the Bill are a proportionate response to address the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol and bring about a cultural shift in our attitude to alcohol.  The Bill commenced Committee Stage in the Seanad on the 26 October 2016.  The Bill is scheduled to return to Committee Stage in the Seanad during this session of the Oireachtas.  In the interim, consideration is being given as to how best this important public health measure can be brought forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200076#WRV00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1339"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200076#WRV00500"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[14506\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200076#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the capital funding that is available from his Department for community groups and voluntary organisations, in view of the fact the national lottery grant scheme is not available in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1334","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>While my Department no longer operates a National Lottery Fund, the Deputy should note that the HSE operates a similar scheme and continues to provide grants to health agencies and other organisations from National Lottery funds.

Ireland opted to apply clawback on the sale of entitlements without land.<\/p>  <p>  EU Regulations state that the application of \"clawback\" must not present a substantial obstacle or prohibition of the transfer of entitlements in a Member State.  Ireland is one of the only Member States in the EU\u00a0that operate a \"conacre\" system, and widespread corresponding short term leasing of entitlements.\u00a0 In many cases the only option open to Irish\u00a0farmers at risk of losing entitlements due to non usage is to lease entitlements without land to a farmer who\u00a0has \"naked\"\u00a0hectares to use them, thereby safeguarding their assets.  The introduction of \"clawback\" on leased entitlements would present a significant obstacle to this option.<\/p>  <p>  The option to lease entitlements without land is critical for many Irish farmers who are unable to obtain sufficient hectares of land to use their entitlements annually.  Under the Single Payment scheme the rotation of entitlements safeguarded farmers&rsquo; entitlements but this is not available under the Basic Payment Scheme where 100% of farmers&rsquo; entitlements must be used at least once every two years.  A large number of farmers in Ireland depend on the availability of affordable leased\/ rented land to use their entitlements.  If farmers are unable to obtain leased\/ rented land through unavailability or high price they are at risk of losing their Basic Payment scheme entitlements permanently through non-usage.

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.  This Scheme is significant in this regard, providing farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, which will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.  The Scheme is administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank and they will report on progress to the SBCI on a regular basis, although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet.

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated. The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.\u00a0\u00a0The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 and its primary function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  The Commission presented its first report in July 2015 in which it recommended an increase of 50 cents per hour to the minimum hourly rate bringing it to &euro;9.15.  That increase, which was accepted by Government, came into effect on 1 January last. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission presented its second report in July 2016 and its recommendation that the minimum wage be increased to &euro;9.25 per hour was subsequently accepted by Government and came into effect on January 1 last. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might note that the most recent figures published by EUROSTAT show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,563 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;1,999 per month.

The benefits of moving to an income basis for payments under the new scheme include:<\/p>  <p>  - Clarity, with a move away from a complex array of eligibility criteria under the current programmes to a single, clear basis under the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  - Reduction of welfare traps and increased support for progression into employment and retention in employment.<\/p>  <p>  - Equity, in ensuring that low-income families that are in employment or self-employed are not excluded from benefitting from subsidised childcare. (Under the current schemes, payment is largely based on receipt of social welfare payments, rather than income.)<\/p>  <p>  The base income threshold of &euro;22,700 in the new Affordable Childcare Scheme will guarantee that the maximum rate of subsidy is available to all families below the relative income poverty line, while ensuring that the taper rate between the base and maximum thresholds does not generate strong disincentive effects with regard to taking up or increasing employment.  It will also ensure that the majority of current scheme beneficiaries will receive the maximum subsidy rate under the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  While the new scheme will target subsidies predominately based on income, it was considered whether other criteria such as a work\/training requirement should also apply, i.e. whether the family needs childcare because both parents - or one parent in the case of a one-parent family - are working or in training.<\/p>  <p>  Incorporating a work\/training test into the eligibility criteria ties the scheme more clearly to its labour market participation objective, given parents&rsquo; need for childcare availability to match hours of work.<\/p>  <p>  Given that both a child development objective and a labour market objective are relevant to this scheme, it was determined that there should be a balanced approach to eligibility: while parents will qualify for a subsidy because of their income level, participation in work\/training will determine whether the subsidy is for enhanced hours of childcare (up to 40 hours per week) or standard hours of childcare (up to 15 hours per week).  When parents are not in work or training, childcare will be subsidised on a standard hours basis.<\/p>  <p>  This approach will mean that this scheme is open &ndash; albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours &ndash; to parents who stay at home to care for their children, or who are not taking part in work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week. This 15 hours is inclusive of time spent in school or the ECCE Programme each week; in the case of school-going children it is considered that the child development objectives are met through school attendance and, therefore, the standard 15 hours of subsidised childcare per week will be available only in holiday periods (i.e. non-term time).<\/p>  <p>  Finally, under the existing Community Childcare Subvention programme, to be replaced by this new scheme, beneficiaries may qualify for full-time childcare subsidies even if they are not in work or training.  During the transition to the new scheme, any current beneficiaries who face a reduction in their subsidy will enjoy a &ldquo;saver&rdquo; status whereby they will retain their existing benefits for a period of time following the introduction of the new scheme.  However, thereafter they, and any similar new entrants to the scheme, who are not in work or training will qualify for the standard hours of childcare only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200084#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":802,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200084#WRDD01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Signage","counter":801,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200084#WRDD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[14291\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032200084#WRDD01800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans to upgrade the signage for the closure of the Hollow Road on the Curragh; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>Range No. 3 is a rifle range within the Curragh Camp and since March 2016 the Defence Forces have resumed training on this range.
