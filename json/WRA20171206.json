Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis,\u00a0as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.<\/p><p>It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0 Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.

An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. <\/p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal on this basis were asked to do so by March 31st 2017. These appeals have been processed and this appeal process has now concluded. <\/p><p>A second process has been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17\/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12\/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).<\/p><p>Schools who qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>Schools were also advised\u00a0that it acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>The NCSE has now published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Should a school\u00a0consider they fulfil the criteria for a review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances, they may request such a review at: <\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600071#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600071#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[51818\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600071#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to ensure an investigation takes place into bullying concerns raised by current and former staff members of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that I have recently appointed an independent\u00a0external\u00a0examiner to carry out an investigation into claims made by a number of current and former staff of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), contained in a disclosure made under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the\u00a0independent external examiner\u00a0to report to me on the review and to make any appropriate recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600071#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600071#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[51814\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600071#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the memorandum of understanding between his Department and local authorities with regard to site acquisitions for new school builds includes provisions relating to the necessity for the identification of sites for temporary accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1300","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>A copy of the Memorandum of Understanding\u00a0on the acquisition of sites for school planning purposes, referred to by the Deputy is available on my Department's website.

Some 2,300 new teachers were recruited in 2016-2017 and 2,900 are being recruited in 2017-2018. The figure of 2,900 is 21% more than the number announced in budget 2017, so we have in fact been able to recruit more new teachers than we have announced. All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete. We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level and in certain subjects at post primary level, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding issues around finding substitute teachers at primary level, there are strong career opportunities in teaching and the numbers of permanent full-time positions are currently increasing at over 1,000 per year in 2016\/2017 and 2017\/2018. Due to the additional permanent positions being created, young teachers have greater opportunities to take on permanent positions, and as a result some schools may be experiencing issues in hiring teachers to fill temporary or substitute roles, which arise in schools for a number of reasons, including covering sick leave and career breaks.<\/p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools in particular to fill short term vacancies. My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his\/her registration with the Teaching Council. My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year. In addition, as a longer term measure, under my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht Policy, an RFT is currently being developed for a new Irish-medium B.Ed. (primary teaching) ITE programme.<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subject areas. These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018\/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017. This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers.

The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere.

The SEC has informed me that the openness and transparency of the Leaving Certificate examination place it among the most transparent globally, with published marking schemes, marked scripts made available for viewing by candidates prior to deciding on an appeal and an accessible multi-stage appeals process. Leaving Certificate examinations are marked in accordance with marking schemes which are published by the SEC following the marking of candidates&rsquo; work. Examiners are drawn from among the subject experts who apply for the positions. They are fully trained in the application of the marking scheme at a two-day training and standardising conference before they commence to mark candidates&rsquo; work. Examiners&rsquo; work is subject to ongoing review by more experienced examiners throughout the marking process and they must follow the advice of these more experienced examiners if any deviation from the marking scheme and national standard is identified.<\/p>  <p>  In a system as large as the Leaving Certificate in which the SEC generates 400,000 individual grades based on 900,000 items of candidates&rsquo; work, the SEC fully acknowledges that examiner error can happen. For this reason, the SEC has a robust and transparent appeals process in place. Before deciding whether to appeal a result, candidates, accompanied by a person of their choosing (generally their teacher in the subject), are encouraged to view their marked scripts. They are provided with the marking schemes used by the examiners which assists the candidate to identify if an error in marking has occurred, and candidates are invited to highlight any such errors when appealing. In the course of remarking the full script, the appeal examiner is also obliged to address and provide a written response to the points raised by candidates in this way. The appeal marking is undertaken by a different examiner to the earlier, Summer, marking and is subject to rigorous overview by more experienced examiners (again, different personnel to those involved in the Summer marking). Ultimately, candidates who continue to be unhappy with how their appeal has been processed by the SEC can have their case referred to a panel of Independent Appeal Scrutineers and, if they choose to raise specific issues of concern regarding the application of the marking scheme to their work, these must be fully addressed and answered by the Chief Examiner for the subject.<\/p>  <p>  The SEC issues almost 400,000 Leaving Certificate grades each year. In recent years the number of individual subject appeals has generally been around 9,800. There were approximately 1,400 upgrades awarded \u00a0on foot of the 2017 Leaving Certificate appeals process. Up to 2016 the successful rate of upgrade was approximately 18% of the appeals received. In 2017 this rate was 14.5%, which reflects the move to broader 10% grade bands in 2017, compared to the previous system of 5% sub-grades (when all original grades were within a maximum of 2.5% away from the next grade boundary). These rates compare very favourably with other examination systems, particularly in the UK, where the average rate of upgrade is 20% (based on 10% grading bands). The number of grades changing on foot of the Leaving Certificate appeal system this year represented 0.36% of all the grades awarded in the 2017 Leaving Certificate examination.<\/p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission has assured me that it is satisfied that it operates a transparent, accessible and effective Leaving Certificate appeals system in which candidates can raise issues of concern regarding the marking of their work and have these fully and transparently addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600072#WRD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600072#WRD03300"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[52013\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600072#WRD03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a school (details supplied) can expect to have its school building; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>The school to which the Deputy refers\u00a0is currently located on the Notre Dame campus, Upper Churchtown Road, Dublin 14 pending completion of the permanent accommodation for the school at the St. Tiernan&rsquo;s Community School site in Balally.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, outline planning permission at a site in Balally for the school to which the Deputy refers was submitted to the relevant local authority in December 2012 but was refused on the grounds of site access.

In respect of all other schools, the practice is to admit all applicants. This will become law following the enactment of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill &ndash; when schools will be required to admit every child who applies.<\/p>  <p>  Last June during Committee Stage debate on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill I advised that my preference is to make changes to the Equal Status Act, 2000 that would remove the capacity for state-funded denominational primary schools, where they are oversubscribed, to use religion as a criteria in admissions process,\u00a0with\u00a0an exception for pupils\u00a0of minority religions. <\/p>  <p>  My officials are currently engaging with the Office of the Attorney General on the development of legislative proposals on this matter which I hope to bring forward to Government for approval shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600072#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":137,"content":"<p>Question No. 84 answered with Question No. 61.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600072#WRD04000"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[51904\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600072#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when approval for stage 2B will issue for a project (details supplied); if funding is in place for this project in view of the fact that the brief change documentation has been submitted to his department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":140,"content":"<p>The Major Building Project referred to by the Deputy is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, Stage 2b - Detailed Design, which includes applications for Planning Permission, Fire Safety Certification, Disability Access Certification and the preparation of tender documents.

As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government has a solemn responsibility to protect the Agreement, in all its parts, and the gains of the Peace Process. I am very conscious of the enormous benefit which the Agreement has brought to people and communities within Northern Ireland, across the island of Ireland and in Britain. The British Government has likewise confirmed its commitment to upholding the Good Friday Agreement, including in Prime Minister May&rsquo;s Article 50 notification to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, in March.   The Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement with EU partners over the last eighteen months and more has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns - including the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts - have been fully understood by the EU27 and have been reflected in the EU Negotiating Guidelines and Directives for the Article 50 process.  The support and solidarity of our EU partners for the unique challenges facing the island of Ireland has been strong and consistent throughout the Article 50 process. <\/p>  <p>  The Guiding Principles for the Dialogue on Ireland\/Northern Ireland, published by the European Commission Article 50 Task force in September, form the basis for the EU&rsquo;s engagement with the United Kingdom in the Article 50 negotiations on the shared objective of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and protecting the gains and benefits of the Peace Process.  <\/p>  <p>  The Guiding Principles affirm that, as an essential element of the withdrawal process, there needs to be a political commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, protecting the gains of the peace process and the practical application of this to the island of Ireland.  A number of principles guiding this approach are set out, specifically that:<\/p>  <p>  the interlocking political institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement will need to continue to operate effectively; <\/p>  <p>  the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland is central to protecting the gains of the Peace Process underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement;<\/p>  <p>  North South cooperation is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement and should be protected across all of the relevant sectors;<\/p>  <p>  with reference to the Good Friday Agreement provisions on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity, the United Kingdom should ensure that no diminution of rights  is caused by the departure from the European Union, including the area of protection against forms of discrimination currently enshrined in Union law;<\/p>  <p>  full account should be taken of the fact that Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens;<\/p>  <p>  in relation to Union support to the Peace Process including through programmes such as PEACE and INTERREG, the United Kingdom and the Union need to honour their commitment under the current Multi-annual Financial Framework and examine how to ensure implementation in line with applicable European Union rules.<\/p>  <p>  The Guiding Principles also affirm the importance of the continued operation of the Common Travel Area to facilitating the mobility of people between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain and also between North and South.

Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought the loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm then the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes of conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Code, the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears 2013 and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Since the enactment of the 2015 Act, the original lender must now provide a consumer with at least 2 months&rsquo; notice before transferring all or part of a loan book covered by the Code to another person, including where the transferee is an unregulated entity.  Where the transferee is an unregulated entity, the Code now requires that the regulated lender also notify the consumer of the regulated entity that will be &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; the loan for the unregulated entity.  This was not the case before the enactment of the 2015 Act because servicing a loan was not a regulated activity requiring authorisation by the Central Bank.  In the event that the entity &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; a loan for an unregulated entity is to change, the existing credit servicing firm must also notify the Central Bank and the consumer in advance, in accordance with the timelines set out under Provision 3.11 of the Code. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to record keeping, the Central Bank has informed me that Chapter 11 of the Code provides that regulated entities must retain records for six years from the date on which the regulated entity ceased to provide any product or service to the consumer concerned.

Some 2,300 new teachers were recruited in 2016-2017 and 2,900 are being recruited in 2017-2018. The figure of 2,900 is 21% more than the number announced in budget 2017, so we have in fact been able to recruit more new teachers than we have announced. All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete. We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level and in certain\u00a0subjects at post primary level, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding issues around finding substitution at primary level, there are strong career opportunities in teaching and the number of permanent full-time positions are currently increasing at over 1,000 per year in 2016\/2017 and 2017\/2018. Due to the additional permanent positions being created, young teachers have greater opportunities to take on permanent positions, and as a result some schools may be experiencing issues in hiring teachers to fill temporary or substitute roles, which arise in schools for a number of reasons, including covering sick leave and career breaks.<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subject areas. These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018\/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017. This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers. I have also increased from 85 to 101 the number of students admitted to St Angela&rsquo;s, Sligo to follow the Home Economics ITE programme in the current year, with further expansions in future years being considered.<\/p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools in particular to fill short term vacancies. My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his\/her registration with the Teaching Council. My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year.

My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.<\/p>  <p>  The demographic data for all school planning areas\u00a0is being reviewed by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data.\u00a0 It is anticipated that\u00a0this exercise will be concluded shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  Teacher allocations to primary and post primary schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on my Department website.<\/p>  <p>  In general, there have been no problems in relation to the recruitment of teachers.\u00a0\u00a0In Budget 2017, we announced 2,400 new teachers whereas we are in the process of actually hiring 2,900 teachers - 21% more than the number announced. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0am aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level and in certain\u00a0subjects at post primary level, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing these issues.<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subject areas. These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018\/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017. This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers. I have also increased from 85 to 101 the number of students admitted to St Angela&rsquo;s, Sligo to follow the Home Economics ITE programme in the current year, with further expansions in future years being considered.<\/p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools in particular to fill short term vacancies. My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his\/her registration with the Teaching Council. My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at post primary level to a maximum of 300 hours in a school year and at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; which, while focussing on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, outlined the work which will be required to establish a long term model of post-primary teacher supply. \u00a0The Teaching Council, which has an advisory role in this matter, recently convened a consultative forum on teacher supply with relevant stakeholders with the aim of producing teacher supply proposals and I look forward to seeing the report from this forum which will further inform our thinking in this matter.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am reviewing a number of options in order to incentivise students to undertake the two year Professional Masters in Education, including financial incentives.\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, in the recently launched STEM and Foreign Languages in Education Implementation Plans, my Department has committed to undertake baseline data collection and analysis to inform policy on the supply of STEM and foreign language teachers and to develop policy actions to support the supply of teachers of these subjects.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, third level institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for the day to day management and operational affairs of the institute, including the management of its staffing requirements. My Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to the HEA designated higher education institutions and the internal disbursement of funding (both public and private) is then a matter for the individual institution. <\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the moratorium on public sector recruitment, an Employment Control Framework (ECF) has been in place for the higher education sector which provides institutions with considerable flexibility to fill vacancies, through recruitment or promotions on the basis of meeting an overall ceiling of posts. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that the existing ECFs and associated moratoriums would be lifted and replaced with a system of delegated sanction for recruiting and promoting up to Principal Officer level, subject to adherence by Departments to binding pay ceilings and ongoing compliance with Workforce Planning requirements.

The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cavan\/Monaghan Division, in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner. I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing. To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions Levy","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[52096\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the public service pension reduction is payable by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have worked their full years service and continue to work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the public service Pension-Related Deduction (PRD), which applies to the pay of all pensionable public servants including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, under the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  It is also assumed that the Deputy is referring to a scenario in which a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attains maximum service for occupational pension purposes and continues to work beyond this while not accruing any further pension entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  PRD applies to the pay, including any non-pensionable pay elements, received in a calendar year.

Sometimes referred to as \"pay parity\", this non-statutory linkage lapsed in 2010, when the values of pensions in payment were left unchanged notwithstanding salary cuts at the beginning of that year which affected all public servants, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, under the financial emergency legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Due to a grace period associated with the 2010 salary cuts, public servants and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who retired in the 26 months following those cuts, i.e. in the period to end-February 2012, had their pensions based on the higher pre-cut salary levels. This has led to the current situation whereby post-February 2012 retirees, on a like-for-like basis, mostly receive lower pensions than their earlier retired counterparts.<\/p>  <p>  The lapsing of pay parity along with the pension differential arising between pre and post-2012 retirees, has created the conditions under which the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of Garda and public service pensions, through appropriate pay or other linkages has required consideration.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, pension increase policy in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was considered by Government during the mid-2017\u00a0public service pay talks, which led to the recently ratified Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA). <\/p>  <p>  Section 6.2 of the PSSA indicates that, over the duration of that agreement, policy on public service pensions in payment will be guided by the following three elements:<\/p>  <p>  - First, the need to adopt an equitable approach to the various public service pensioner cohorts differentiated by date of retirement (in particular pre and post end-February 2012) is affirmed.<\/p>  <p>  - Second, for those who retired or will retire post end-February 2012, to the extent that they retired or will retire on reduced salaries for pension award purposes, they will receive pension increases in line with pay increases received by their peers currently in employment in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement.<\/p>  <p>  - Third, when alignment is achieved between pre and post end-February 2012 pensioners, as will happen progressively for salary ranges up to &euro;70,000 in 2020 under the proposed collective agreement, pay increases will continue to benefit pensions in payment for the duration of the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The essence of the Government&rsquo;s pension increase policy over the PSSA lifetime to end-2020 is that pensions in payment will increase in line with pay increases where that is necessary to ensure that underlying salary on which those pensions are based is equal to that of the salary on which new-award pensions of same-grade retiring staff are based.<\/p>  <p>  This effectively represents a limited resumption of the pre-FEMPI \"pay parity\" model, under which pension rates rose in line with pay increases, and will be applied within strictly controlled terms until end-2020 only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH02200"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[52136\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his Department has sworn an affidavit of discovery for the purpose of the disclosures tribunal; if so, if that affidavit contains a claim of legal professional privilege over documents generated in 2014, 2015 and 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>Discovery orders were issued by the Tribunal to my Department in February, April and September.

The number of Orders granted by the District Court in the course of 2016 was more than double the number of waivers granted by the Registrar in 2014 under the previous scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 repeals section 343(7) of the Companies Act 2014.\u00a0 A new section 343A provides that a company may apply to the District Court for an Order waiving the fee required for the late filing of its annual return. This is similar to the position that obtained before the enactment of the Companies Act 2014, whereby a company could apply to the Registrar but that decision now falls within the remit of the District Court. <\/p>  <p>  The loss of audit exemption where an annual return is not filed on time was introduced as a policy response for such failure in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003.  Compliance with filing deadlines were at 13% before that time.\u00a0 Today the compliance level is at 90%, a dramatic increase that is associated with the introduction of the loss of audit exemption.\u00a0 It has proved central to creating a culture of compliance and acting as a support to good corporate governance practices.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Companies have a considerable period of time, up to 10 months, to prepare and file their financial statements.  The vast majority of companies manage to file within this timeframe.\u00a0 Any further delay risks making that information less meaningful to the third parties concerned. <\/p>  <p>  This is an important consideration as those third parties may also be small companies that supply or otherwise do business with that company.\u00a0 Given the time allowed to companies to prepare their financial statements, the fact that the financial reporting obligation has been simplified and reduced in the Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 and that this Act also made more companies eligible for the audit exemption, I consider that proposals in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 to be a proportionate measure to protect the interests of users of company financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH05900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy Provision","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH05800"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[52313\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which speech and language therapy continues to be available to pupils with a specific requirement in north County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":354,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600076#WRH06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motorised Transport Grant Closure","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600077#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[52075\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600077#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 177 of 7 December 2016, if he plans to bring back the motorised transport grant following on from a review committee set up in 2013; if so, when; the conditions that will be attached to the grant; if the primary legislation has been drafted; and if the policy proposals have been brought to the Government.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>I was pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the proposed Health (Transport Support) Bill with the Joint Committee on Public Petitions on Wednesday 11th October.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.

The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:<\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination  against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  My Department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process.  I have recently met with representatives from the I.F.A.  to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress. We agreed to meet again in the near future for further discussions.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600077#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600077#WRJ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[52112\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600077#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) can expect an appointment.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

These services also provide consequent support to carers in their caring role.  The HSE provides Home Care Packages (HCPs) which are enhanced supports, over and above existing mainstream Home Help service and these can include additional home help hours, nursing care and therapy services that might be needed due to illness, disability, after a stay in hospital or following rehabilitation in a nursing home.  Access to HCPs is provided on the basis of assessed care need, carried out by health care professionals. In 2014, the HSE introduced Intensive Home Care Packages to facilitate timely discharge home from acute hospitals of people who require very significant interventions to an extent not previously provided as part of the Home Care Package Scheme or current community services.   <\/p>  <p>  The principal focus of these services is on people aged 65 years or over. There is some flexibility in relation to applications, and if a younger person&rsquo;s assessed needs can be best met by services designed for older people, then occasionally such an application may be considered. However, access to home care packages by reference to illness type is not provided. <\/p>  <p>  The overall funding allocated for Home Care in 2017 is &euro;376m. The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2017 provides for a target of 10.57 million Home Help Hours, 16,750 Home Care Packages and 190 Intensive Home Care Packages. Funding for home care supports continues to increase with a further &euro;32m for home care and transitional care provided for in 2018 in the recent Budget. The detail of service delivery for 2018 is currently being developed through the National Service Planning Process. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to protecting the level of Personal Assistant and Home Support Services available to people with disabilities.  In their 2017 National Service Plan, the HSE expects to deliver 1.4 million Personal Assistant hours to 2,357 adults with a physical and\/or sensory disability.  With regard to Home Support hours, the HSE's 2017 commitment is to provide 2.75 million hours to people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600077#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600077#WRJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[52131\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600077#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he received a petition requesting him to establish a general practitioner out-of-hours service for north Wicklow; if progress has been made on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p>I am aware of the petition referred to by the Deputy regarding GP out of hours services in North Wicklow.

The results of this investigation showed that in that ten-year period, there were barely a handful of infectious disease cases that could be explained by bird contact.\u00a0 Between 2006 and 2016, there were just three cases of salmonellosis (two of these mentioned contact with caged, pet birds) and a further two cases of campylobacteriosis (one of which mentioned proximity to gulls).

To do this effectively, we need\u00a0to spend time 'on the ground',\u00a0developing positive relationships with Japanese and South Korean buyers, regulators and political counterparts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In Japan I met the Minister for Health Labour and Welfare, Minister Katsunobu Kato. This was a useful opportunity to hold high level discussions with a Senior Minister\u00a0in Japan, with responsibilities in the areas of food safety, standards and certification. I took the opportunity to request that the 30-month age limit on our beef exports be raised and also undertook to begin the process of gaining market access for Irish sheepmeat to Japan. I also met with the State Minister for\u00a0Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Mr Yousuke Isozaki.\u00a0This was another valuable opportunity to raise awareness of Ireland as a strategic partner from a food perspective, and a similar range of issues was discussed.\u00a0Indeed, Minister Isozaki, who also holds responsibility for the equine sector, was interested to hear about Ireland&rsquo;s success as a world leader in the thoroughbred horse industry.\u00a0Parallel to this meeting Department officials held technical discussions with their Japanese counterparts.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Japanese element\u00a0of the mission was extremely useful in gaining a better understanding of Japan's priorities in the agrifood area,\u00a0while\u00a0also raising awareness of Ireland as a potential strategic partner.\u00a0 Japan has one of the most highly respected food safety systems in the world, and it was important to get the opportunity to let potential Japanese customers know that our own systems are of a similarly high standard. The Ministries of Agriculture and Health both responded very positively to the issues raised, and it is clear that Japan is open to further cooperation and collaboration with Ireland. I also hosted a number of promotional events such as the Bord Bia Origin Green Dairy Seminar, which\u00a0facilitated further\u00a0engagement between Irish food companies and potential customers. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Korean leg of the trade mission began with a meeting with the South Korean Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Kim Yung-Rok. During the meeting I emphasised\u00a0the very high priority that Ireland accords\u00a0to achieving beef market access to Korea, and the importance of further advancing the process, following on from recent inspection visits. A follow-up meeting has been arranged between Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine officials and Minister Kim's technical experts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In South Korea, I had the pleasure of opening an Origin Green Dairy seminar and also addressing &lsquo;The Flavour of Ireland&rsquo; networking reception which showcased the best of Irish food and drink to an audience of South Korean buyers and media. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I concluded the trade mission with a meeting with South Korea&rsquo;s Minister for Food and Drug Safety, Minister Ryu. During the meeting it was useful to receive a direct appraisal from the Minister on the progress of our application for market access for Irish beef. While a number of stages remain to be cleared in the multi-stage\u00a0process before market access can be secured, Minister Ryu indicated that it may be possible to move to the next phase of the process before the end of the year. I also took the opportunity to communicate to the Minister our intention to initiate applications for poultry and sheepmeat access.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the 5-day mission was very positive for Irish agrifood ambitions in the region. I met four Senior Ministers in two major economies, engaged with\u00a0five multi-billion euro companies, and attended thirteen separate promotional events attended by over 400 Japanese and Korean buyers. More importantly, the travelling delegation from the agrifood industry considered\u00a0the mission\u00a0a success in terms of helping their efforts to build links in these\u00a0markets. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that Trade missions like these play a crucial role in raising the profile of Ireland. They help to build the kind of political, official and commercial relationships that can make a real difference to Irish food and drink exporters, which is, of course,\u00a0critically important against the background of the challenges presented by Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600078#WRK04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":471,"content":"<p>Question No. 210 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600078#WRK04100"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[52210\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600078#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied) for a scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a GLAS 1 application on May 20th 2015 and following the initial checks the Bird Box action was rejected resulting in the application not being approved as the minimum score of 16.3 was not achieved on the remaining actions.<\/p>  <p>  The Department reviewed this decision and deemed the action to be eligible which means that the Bird Box action will be reinstated.

It works in partnership with health service providers and similar organisations in Ireland and around the world, to provide the best possible information for the control and prevention of infectious diseases. The roles of the HPSC include providing timely information and independent advice, carrying out disease surveillance, epidemiological investigation and related research and training.<\/p><p>Earlier this year the HPSC undertook an investigation to determine if gulls posed a potential infectious risk and to attempt to quantify this in the most valid manner.\u00a0 The main focus of investigation was an examination of the potential for transmission from gulls to man, of infectious disease. An extensive review of the relevant international literature on the evidence for transmission of infectious disease from gulls to man indicated that, although disease carriage is relatively common amongst such birds, there is very little evidence of disease transmission to humans and that wild birds play a limited role in human infectious disease.<\/p><p>About 5% of gulls are infected with Salmonella. \u00a0This is a lower prevalence than many other common wild birds.\u00a0 For example, amongst starlings and house sparrows, a number of studies agree that the prevalence of carriage of various pathogens is about is in the range of 24% for Salmonella, 4% for Campylobacter and 24% <i>Clostridium perfringens<\/i>.\u00a0 About 20% of starlings carry <i>E.coli<\/i>and the same levels are seen in crows.\u00a0 Levels of these pathogens are even higher in long distance migratory birds.<\/p><p>With regard to antibiotic resistant pathogens, in general about 10-15% of isolates carried by wild birds, are resistant to the common (and not so common antibiotics).\u00a0 Transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by wildbirds is a potential health issue, but it has its greatest potential for impact when the birds acquire these AMR pathogens in countries where there are high levels of AMR.\u00a0 These can be carried long distances by far-reaching migratory wild birds.\u00a0 Gulls do not migrate very far, and so tend to be infected with local pathogens.<\/p><p>A review of 10 years Irish national infectious disease data was carried out to determine how many cases of any infectious disease (but particularly instances of gastrointestinal disease caused by Salmonella and Campylobacter) could be attributed to contact with birds. The aim was to determine the proportion of human infectious disease cases in which wild birds (including gulls) were associated. The results of this investigation showed that in that ten-year period, there were barely a handful of infectious disease cases that could be explained by bird contact.\u00a0 Between 2006 and 2016, there were just three cases of salmonellosis (two of these mentioned contact with caged, pet birds) and a further two cases of campylobacteriosis (one of which mentioned proximity to gulls). These were suggestive of association but not evidence of cause.\u00a0 Moreover, there were no outbreaks of human disease over the same 10 year period in which gulls (or any other wild birds) had been implicated as the cause of an outbreak of infectious disease, or even a contributory factor.<\/p><p>Over the last 10 years there have been in total in Ireland, about 25,500 reported cases of Campylobacter and 3,900 cases of Salmonella.\u00a0 That investigation found that, of our salmonellosis cases, 0.06% and of our campylobacteriosis cases, 0.012% mentioned some form of bird contact, though not necessarily causative.\u00a0 In other words, cases of these diseases that even mentioned birds as possible risk factors are extremely uncommon. <\/p><p>The  information that gulls are colonised with bacteria which demonstrate varying levels of antimicrobial resistance does not add to the negligible risks of transmission from gulls to humans. Just because these are AMR pathogens, this does not alter their ability to be spread from these birds to humans and AMR pathogens are just as unlikely as non-AMR pathogens to be spread in this manner. Moreover, among wild birds, gulls would seem to have a lower propensity (as evidenced by their lower rate of carriage) to carry these pathogens than other, far more numerous species, such as crows, starlings and sparrows.<\/p><p>In Public Health,  health threats are prioritised using a number of parameters (severity of disease, potential for transmission, numbers of cases of illness).\u00a0 Diseases that have such features as severe of illness, ready transmissibility, or high numbers of cases then become priorities for Public Health interventions such as control and prevention.\u00a0 It is evident that there are extremely low numbers of cases of diseases spread from gulls to humans in this manner and that this is an extremely uncommon way in which humans can acquire these diseases.\u00a0 It this was a common or significant mode of transmission there would have been considerably greater numbers of these diseases  over the years in which gulls as a potential source of infection were mentioned and there would been evidence of outbreaks of illness that could be validly explained by gull contact.<\/p><p>The available evidence, while indicating that gulls and other wild birds do carry potentially harmful pathogenic bacteria, does not indicate that they transmit these microbes to any significant extent, or in any meaningful amount, to humans despite these birds having been documented as carrying and excreting these bacteria, in close proximity to humans, for many decades.<\/p><p>With regard to the interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee which was launched in November 2014.

CRU estimate the cost of the project at &euro;1.2 Billion over the six year roll-out period. This cost will be included in the costs of distribution networks in the same way as all other electricity infrastructure investments are paid for. This will be reflected on consumer bills through an additional cost of approximately &euro;5.50 per annum per customer. It is expected this investment will be more than offset by the potential savings customers will be able to make as a result of the greater information that will be available through the smart meter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600079#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":528,"content":"<p>Question No. 214 answered with Question No. 209.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"RT&Eacute; Staff","counter":529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600079#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":530,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[52149\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600079#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns by music lovers regarding the ongoing downgrading and shrinking of the RT&Eacute; orchestras; his plans to preserve the orchestras and bring them up to the full staffing level required (detail supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":531,"content":"<p>While I am aware of ongoing concerns relating to this matter,\u00a0it is\u00a0not one in which I have a statutory\u00a0function.\u00a0RT&Eacute; is an independent national public service broadcaster established under the Broadcasting Act 2009.

In the specific case of Dublin, a shortage of available hotel bedrooms in the city has caused hotel room rates there to increase in recent years. I am informed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland that the most recent information available to it indicates that the rate of increase in hotel room pricing is slowing.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the issue is fundamentally one of supply and demand, I welcome the results of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's assessments of hotel accommodation in Dublin, which indicate that there should be sufficient stock to meet projected demand after 2018, with approximately 5,500 bedrooms coming on stream by 2020.  This should moderate price increases.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Government has continued a range of supportive measures, such as the reduced VAT rate, aimed at enhancing Ireland's tourism competitiveness.  With specific regard to factors within the Department's and F&aacute;ilte Ireland's remit, changes introduced in the revised Hotel Regulations introduced in August 2016 should also make investment more attractive by allowing hotel operators provide more rooms and operate at a lower cost base, thus improving hotel capacity, competitiveness and profitability.  Consumers should also benefit from the resulting increased availability, competition and range of accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Finally I would like to assure the deputy that this is a matter I keep under constant review. I personally check hotel prices on a regular basis and while I will am concerned some room prices seem excessive it can be said that excellent value can still be found throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Applications","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[52182\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason a club was unsuccessful in the 2017 sports capital scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>Details of all local allocations under the 2017 round of the Sports Capital programme were announced on the 30th November and can be viewed on my Department's website.

In the last three Budgets (2016, 2017 and 2018) investment in Early Years sector has increased by some 87% which reflects the emphasis being placed on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.  This has helped to address affordability, access and quality, although it is recognised that there is more to be done.  Budget 2018 announced an extension of the universal provision of the ECCE scheme accompanied by increases in capitation rates, both standard and higher, by 7% particularly aimed at supporting the workforce. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 also announced &euro;18 million in Programme Support Payments in 2018 will be provided to Early Years services to assist with non-contact costs.  Programme Support Payments, previously known as non-contact time payments, are now fully secured and will be available again in 2018 and thereafter.  &euro;14.5m was originally secured in Budget 2017, and this was topped up by &euro;3.5m this summer for services who signed up to the September measures. The latter was provided however on a one-off basis. The full allocation of &euro;18 million is now in the early years funding base going forward.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare. The 'Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Quality Childcare' which will be carried out by Crowe Horwath, will examine the costs faced by childcare providers in delivering quality childcare  and will include a survey of childcare providers. Following completion the review is intended to be used to strengthen the evidence base underpinning investment in early years. As such, it will feed into future policy development, including in relation to levels of payments to services.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2016 Government approved policy proposals for the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS).  ACS will provide a new basis for funding childcare with both universal and targeted subsidies available for parents of children between six months and age 15.  The scheme will streamline the existing targeted schemes to make them more accessible for both parents and providers; provide a fair and consistent system of progressive financial support towards the cost of childcare; and provide a robust and flexible platform for future investment in childcare in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, a range of measures have been introduced in September to increase investment in childcare.  The &lsquo;September measures&rsquo; relate to the introduction of the Community Childcare Subvention Universal (CCSU) payment and the increase in band rates across the different strands of the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Scheme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Scheme. As part of these 'September measures', a universal subsidy is available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age (or until they qualify for ECCE if later than 36 months) in registered childcare. This amounts to up to &euro;20 a week or &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare.  <\/p>  <p>  Although my Department has been successful in securing additional funding for this sector over the past three budgets, as outlined above, it is acknowledged that much more must be done to continue to improve both the affordability and quality of childcare. To this end I will continue to engage with Government colleagues with a view to securing additional investment for the Early Years sector in future budgets. Childcare workers are part of a growing sector, which the Government is strongly supporting. My Department and I believe that by working together with all the stakeholders in the Early Years sector we can ensure that it is a viable and strong sector which makes a significant contribution to the care and personal development of our children. I am committed to ensuring childcare is affordable, accessible and of a high quality.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the second part of the Deputy's question, while the early childhood education and care sector is largely funded and regulated by my Department (DCYA), the Department of Education and Skills (DES) plays an important role in the development and implementation of the two national practice frameworks, S&iacute;olta and Aistear. \u00a0DES also supports and advises DCYA on qualifications and workforce development and is in the process of conducting a review of education and training programmes for early years practitioners. \u00a0DES, with its agencies, works to ensure that there is a smooth transition for children from pre-school into the primary school sector and also supports DCYA in the implementation of AIM. \u00a0On my behalf, the Department of Education and Skills has put in place early years education-focused inspections which inspect the educational provision in the ECCE programme.\u00a0 However, beyond the promotion of this alignment and support for quality, there is no plan to further integrate the schools sector, statutory provision for which lies with the Minister for Education &amp;amp; Skills, with the formal ECEC sector which is my responsibility as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":599,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM03500"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[52228\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM03600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the expenditure by his Department by heading (details supplied) in each of the years since June 1997 to January 2011, in tabular form; and the miscellaneous expenditure not relating to set Department budgets pertaining to the headings.","asker":"1329","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":600,"content":"<p>The Department of Rural and Community Development was established on 19 July 2017.\u00a0 Any information relating to the functions transferred to this Department, for the requested period, will be reported by the relevant parent Departments in their responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Expenditure","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[52155\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120600080#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated daily cost of rent supplement payments in 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme currently supporting 35,000 recipients at a cost of &euro;253 million in 2017.<\/p><p>The strategic policy direction of my Department is to return this scheme to its original purpose of being a short-term income support with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.<\/p><p>Rent supplement&rsquo;s outturn forecast is calculated based on its expected level of activity taking into account transfers to, and the impact of, the HAP scheme, on-going transfers of rent supplement tenancies to other social housing options; and the general improvement in the economy.

According to the records of my Department, the person concerned has a social insurance record of 1,719 reckonable contributions and credits.  A reduced state pension (contributory) was awarded based on an assessed yearly average of 36 contributions, covering the period from December 1968 to December 2016.  The person concerned is in receipt of the correct rate of contributory pension based on this record.  Any gaps in the person&rsquo;s insurance record will impact on the person&rsquo;s overall yearly average and, consequently, on their rate of weekly pension entitlement.  <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for state pension (contributory) easier for a claimant who has taken time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years (since 1994) spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or for an incapacitated person(s), to be disregarded when the claimant&rsquo;s social insurance record is being assessed for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, and making it easier for them to qualify for the most beneficial rate of state pension (contributory).  As part of the pension eligibility assessment of the person concerned, a disregard of one year and an award of 24 additional credits in the person&rsquo;s yearly average calculation resulted from home-making periods from 6 April 1994 to 19 September 1995.  <\/p>  <p>  If the person concerned considers they have additional contributions or credits that have not been recorded, it is open to them to forward documentary evidence of the missing periods of employment to my Department and their pension entitlement will be reviewed. <\/p>  <p>  The changes made to rate bands in 2012 more closely reflect the social insurance contribution history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.

In isolation, credits do not give entitlement to social insurance benefits. In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Credits may also enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes such as the level of payment of State pension contributory (SPC), but only where the individual has already met the condition relating to the minimum number of paid contributions.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for credits an individual must satisfy entitlement to the credits scheme.  While there are no self-employed credits, individuals who were previously employed can access the scheme in the same manner as other workers, subject to meeting the conditions of the scheme.  In general credits can only be awarded where an individual has had a recent attachment to the workforce as an employee i.e. within the last 2 years.  Therefore credits are not automatically awarded to all recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  <\/p>  <p>  Individuals who are caring on a full-time basis, including those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance may, however, qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.
