In the area of child welfare and protection services we now have, with the establishment this year of the Child and Family Agency, the necessary structure to ensure the provision of a more responsive and integrated service to children and young people at risk.  The Agency, in discharging its functions, is placing a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support, therapeutic and care interventions, all of which are key to the provision of integrated, multi-disciplinary services for vulnerable children and families. <\/p><p>  Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services services are currently being provided by arrangement with the Health Service Executive.  <\/p><p>  The Child and Family Agency and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol to underpin the provision of these services for children. The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding and the Joint Protocol is to set out arrangements for collaborative working by the Agencies in order to ensure the provision of efficient, effective and proportionate services for children and families across the full range of health and social care services.  The arrangements also specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families where their care needs cross the Child and Family Agency and the HSE. <\/p><p>  Both agreements are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families. Additionally, the Agency and the HSE are working to finalise a service level agreement to underpin the provision of psychology services by the HSE.  This will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency&rsquo;s requirements in this area, and will operate as an interim arrangement pending the Agency providing the service directly.   <\/p><p>  Separately, my Department chairs an Inter Departmental Group on the implementation of Children First.

Further details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; www.dcya.gov.ie.<\/p><p>  My Department has completed a Value for Money and Policy Review of the youth funding schemes that target disadvantaged young people. The review makes recommendations for the future operation of youth programmes that will shape their development in the years ahead to ensure quality, effective, value-for-money services that are evidence based and secure the best outcomes for young people. I intend that the recommendations of the review will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy that is being developed by my Department for the end of 2014. The Strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people, aged between 10 and 24 years, while having particular regard to those young people who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes and, therefore, in most need of support.   <\/p><p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups, including those from disadvantaged areas throughout the country. My aim is to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900065#WRA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Qualifications","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900065#WRA04150"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[43922\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900065#WRA04200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to make it compulsory for those caring for preschool children to be trained in paediatric first aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>As pointed out to the Deputy in replies to previous Questions on this matter, this Department is in the process of introducing a number of reforms with a view to improving the quality of early years services.<\/p><p>  The revised Child Care Regulations which are required under the new amendments to Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 are currently being developed in association with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.

The overall level of funding available to the Agency, which is significant by any measurement, is designed to ensure that the Agency can provide a comprehensive and integrated service to children and families who require support.

This has been reflected most recently in a report prepared by the Agency, titled 'Measuring the Pressure' which shows, inter alia, that there has been a strong rise in demand for foster care and private residential care over the period.  Operational reforms are ongoing to achieve the most effective utilisation of existing resources. In addition, the Agency has been working to bring added controls in the area of legal services and continues to develop its approach to commissioning.

Accordingly, it is not possible to forecast what the capital acquisitions tax yield is likely to be from the proposed changes. In any event, the changes being proposed to section 82 in Finance Bill 2014 are not for the purpose of raising tax revenue but to counter abuse of the provision.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the second question I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information in relation to the number of persons who paid capital acquisitions tax each year is not directly available. However, the number of persons who filed capital acquisitions tax returns in the years 2011-2013 and to date in 2014 and who had a liability to capital acquisitions tax is as shown in the table.<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>11,129<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>11,520<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>11,595<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 (To-date) <\/td><td>11,776 (Provisional)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>It is not possible to provide a breakdown of capital acquisitions tax by asset class as the capital acquisitions tax returns do not require a breakdown of the tax due by asset type and there is, therefore, no reliable basis for compiling this information.<br\/><br\/>The total capital acquisitions tax paid on inheritances in each of the four years is as follows: <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>&euro; Million<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>213.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>254.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>257.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 (To end October)<\/td><td>146.8 (Provisional)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>As regards the third question, there are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.<br\/><br\/><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br\/><br\/><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br\/><br\/><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, <\/b>applies in all other cases.<br\/><br\/>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold. These thresholds have been reduced in recent years in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes, \u00a0as part of the effort to restore the public finances, as taxes on capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.<br\/><br\/>The property market continues to improve with positive developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country though not to the same extent in terms of price rises.

This means that where both cohabitants pay tax at the higher rate, an additional &euro;2,000 of a cohabiting couple's income will be subject to income tax at 20% rather than at 40%, resulting in a potential increase in net take home pay of &euro;400 per annum.<\/p><p>  In relation to your specific query, a married one earner couple with two children, earning &euro;1,261.28 per fortnight, who is availing of the Homer Carers Tax Credit will pay &euro;136.58 per fortnight in income tax, USC and PRSI in 2015. In contrast, a cohabiting couple with a single income\u00a0of the same amount,\u00a0who also have two children, will pay &euro;231.19 per fortnight next year.\u00a0 These calculations are based on the assumption\u00a0that the married couple are jointly assessed for income tax purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900067#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":140,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 56 and 57 answered with Question No. 52.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Transport","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900067#WRC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[44890\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900067#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the ministerial transport costs for the years 2010 to 2013, inclusive, for each Minister and Minister of State in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the table.<br\/><br\/>These ministerial transport costs do not include air travel or foreign travel.<br\/><br\/>For 2010 the ministerial transport and the costs associated with this were provided for by the Department of Justice.<table><tr><th>Department of Finance<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ministerial Transport Costs<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;87,289.91<\/td><td>&euro;116,297.76<\/td><td>&euro;117,085.91<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900067#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900067#WRC01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Applications","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900067#WRC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[44442\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900067#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on a funding application from Kildare County Council for flood alleviation works in respect of an area (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>Kildare County Council submitted an application for funding for flood alleviation works at Ballymore Eustace under the Office of Public Works (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.

The text of the mandate is available on the EU Council&rsquo;s website: .  <br\/><br\/>Under the terms of the mandate and in accordance with Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU Commission is required to conduct the negotiations in consultation with the Council and to regularly report to the Council.  The EU Commission consults the member states through the EU Trade Policy Committee on all aspects of the negotiations. Officials from my Department represent Ireland on the relevant committees.  To this end, my Department co-ordinates the views of all the relevant Departments, in line with the usual inter-departmental co-ordination procedure in developing the Irish position on other EU matters.  I welcome all opportunities to discuss TTIP and to receive views of stakeholders.  Furthermore, I was very pleased to have been invited within the last year to have exchanges with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs from which I received a written political contribution. <br\/><br\/>The purpose of the study commissioned by my Department is to examine the economic and other impacts of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and related potential opportunities for Ireland.

These estimates were based on the average cost of each State car including the cost of Garda drivers at &euro;280,000 per annum. In the case of Ministers using their own cars, including the cost of 2 civilian drivers, it was calculated that the cost was in the region of &euro;120,000 per annum per Minister. Following a review in 2012 it was found that the cost of the new system was lower than calculated and is in the order of an average of &euro;100,000 per annum. This represents a saving of 65% on the previous transport system in place prior to May 2011 and supports the view that in value for money terms, the new transport arrangements are more cost effective than the previous system.<br\/><br\/><b>Mr Batt O&rsquo; Keeffe<\/b><b>T.D.

The aid rates were reduced by approximately 7% per annum from 2004 to 2007 in line with the general reductions in support prices brought about by the 2003 Mid Term Review of the CAP. However, the Exchequer has made up for this reduction in the EU contribution, and the overall aid rates have been maintained at &euro;27.89\/100kg. Since 2007 the EU contribution is &euro;18.15\/100kg, with the balance of &euro;9.74\/100kg made up by the Exchequer.<br\/><br\/>In terms of some of the figures requested by the Deputy, the table below sets out some of the key aggregates.

Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database. This on-going review is of major significance as the Commission is seeking to disallow &euro;181m of funding to Ireland relating to payments over the past 5 years; this is currently the subject of an Irish appeal to the EU Conciliation Body. The Department was first made aware of this on 14 May 2014 in a written communication from the EU Commission.<\/p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Direct Aid Schemes and general financial provisions. All of the lands, including commonages, declared by farmers must be eligible if these lands benefit from payment under one of more or these Schemes. The threatened disallowance relates to all payments in respect of ineligible areas and not just to payments on ineligible commonage areas.<\/p><p>  Under the Terms and Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the Single Payment Scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications, and to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc. Furthermore, farmers are reminded that they should not declare for payment purposes land, which they are no longer farming. It is not sufficient to simply exclude the ineligible features from the declarations submitted; this is because land, which is no longer being farmed and\/or is abandoned should also be excluded.   <\/p><p>  To ensure the eligibility of lands declared, farmers must maintain lands through normal farming practices such as cropping, cutting hay\/silage or grazing by animals with an appropriate stocking rate to control invasive species. In the case of commonage lands farmers must therefore ensure that lands are kept adequately grazed in order to ensure that the commonage retains the area eligible for payment. <\/p><p>  Commonage lands form a significant area of the lands declared annually by some 14,936 farmers in Ireland for the purposes of claiming under the Direct Aid Schemes, with approximately 7% of the lands declared nationally being commonage lands.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  However, due to reasons such as previous destocking requirements and the age profile of farmers on commonage lands, there is a growing risk of land abandonment on commonages as under-grazing becomes more of a problem.\u00a0 It is, therefore, the case that the increasing ineligibility of these lands under the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes poses a significant risk to the State in view of the risk of financial corrections being imposed by the European Commission.<\/p><p>  In 2015, all farmers will be strongly urged to ensure that all of the land that they declare is eligible and is farmed by them.

The interpretation of the previous Annex F had caused serious difficulties and confusion in regard to applications for firearm certificates for .22 calibre handguns and has resulted in over 30 Judicial Review applications to date. The Commissioner made this decision to issue new Guidelines, without Annex F, on foot of consultations with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office (AGO) and Counsel for the State regarding Judicial Review applications on the licensing of .22 calibre handguns.

Ultimately it will assist the Department in gaining a greater depth of knowledge and understanding of child care cases and it will increase the evidence base on which future policy formulation is based.<\/p><p>  The project pursues its aims and objectives by attending the courts where child care cases are heard in order to report on those proceedings while protecting the anonymity of the children and their families. The CCLRP publishes reports of child care cases for the public and all relevant stake-holders, collects and analyses data from the proceedings, publishes reports on the nature and outcomes of the child care proceedings and seeks to promote a public debate on the issues raised through seminars and conferences.<\/p><p>  Child care cases, heard mainly in the District Courts, involve applications by the Child and Family Agency for orders to protect children, including supervision orders, emergency and interim care orders and full care orders. Under supervision orders, families receive help and supervision from the Agency; under care orders, the child is placed on either an interim or more permanent basis in care. The cases are heard in camera in order to protect the privacy of the children and their families. There are rarely written judgments in the District Court.<\/p><p>  In the second interim report, published last month, it was noted that the project team record the main reason given in support of each application. Often more than one problem is present e.g. the parent may suffer from a disability and abuse alcohol or drugs or both, and the child may suffer both neglect and abuse but only one main reason is recorded. The highest single category, as recorded by the reporters, is parental disability (15%). While physical, mental and intellectual disabilities are not distinguished, the reporting team has observed that most of these parents had an intellectual disability or mental health difficulty and sometimes both.<\/p><p>  The second interim report also found that in over 70% of cases the parent, normally the mother, was parenting alone, either because she was single, following the breakdown of a relationship, or because the child&rsquo;s other parent was dead, in prison or missing. Drug or alcohol abuse or neglect were much more common reasons for seeking a care order in cases involving single parents than cases involving married parents. <\/p><p>  While the majority of the respondents in child care cases are Irish (70.4% in the second interim report), this is substantially less than the proportion of Irish-born people in the population as a whole. 7% of the respondents are European, the vast majority of whom come from Eastern Europe. The next largest category is &ldquo;mixed&rdquo;, meaning that at least one parent is not Irish. This category includes two or more non-Irish parents from different backgrounds as well as Irish and non-Irish parents. Almost 4% of the respondents are recorded as Irish Travellers.<\/p><p>  Overall, one in four child protection cases involve families where at least one parent is a member of an ethnic minority. However the author notes that this represents a very heterogeneous group and the issues that bring them to the child care courts vary widely and so there is no single approach that could reduce this proportion. This raises issues of the need for early involvement of appropriately trained family support workers with immigrant families and community leaders.<\/p><p>  The fact that such a high proportion of at-risk children come from ethnic minority communities highlights the need for cultural sensitivity, focused integration policies and cultural mediation services. The Child and Family Agency has introduced a training component for staff on cultural competence so that they may better understand the needs and diversity of the families concerned.<\/p><p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that it brings cases to court solely on the basis of the evidence it has regarding the welfare and protection of children. All of the variations in child care applications and outcomes &ndash; regional, ethnic and in family status &ndash; that have been identified throughout the course of the project to date require further research to determine the reasons for the variations and to see how more targeted interventions can, where possible, ensure that the level of intervention is the most appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900069#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900069#WRE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[44416\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900069#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will include the Westbank Orphanage in Greystones, County Wicklow, in the inquiry into the mother and baby homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I am consulting with a number of key stakeholders, including the Bethany Survivor's Campaign and Survivors of Protestant Children's Institutions whom I have met in recent days, in order to update the parties on the emerging issues and to seek their further views. <\/p><p>  Requests to include a range of institutions, and concerns related to particular practices are being examined in our current deliberations.

I would like to outline the following:<br\/><br\/>Support for families who require income support to meet basic needs is provided through the social welfare system which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Social Protection. A range of income supports are available to parents, both those who are unemployed and those on low incomes. The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.<br\/><br\/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020,<\/i>which was published and launched by Government in 2014, provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people. As provided for in Better Outcomes, the Department of Social Protection which is the lead department on child poverty has the lead responsibility for a specific commitment to a national child-specific social target to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.<br\/><br\/>My Department is working on a number of initiatives which are relevant in addressing issues related to children poverty. It is, for example, leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.<br\/><br\/>In terms of other provision, my Department is spending &euro;260 million annually on childcare support programmes which provide childcare to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. The CCS programme provides subvention support to parents on low incomes and parents in receipt of certain social welfare payments, whose children are enrolled in community childcare facilities. Additionally, the 3 Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes - the Childcare Education and Training Programme, the Community Employment Childcare programme and the Afterschool Childcare Programme - provide childcare supports to eligible parents returning to work or to education.  <br\/><br\/>My Department also provides funding for targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people through three schemes.  The three programmes are Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. In addition, national and regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme. In 2014, current funding of &euro;49.78 million has been provided to my Department for these schemes. I am pleased to advise that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services. There will be no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which is a key priority for youth organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900069#WRE02400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children and Family Services","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900069#WRE02450"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[44494\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900069#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which the various children support services remain readily available to meet the needs of vulnerable children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":270,"content":"<p>There is a wide range of child support services available through both the statutory and non statutory sectors.  These include services provided through Government Departments, other state agencies and an extensive network of non governmental organisations.  In the area of child welfare and protection services we now have, with the establishment this year of the Child and Family Agency, the necessary structure to ensure the provision of a more responsive and integrated service to children and young people at risk.  The Agency, in discharging its functions, is placing a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support, therapeutic and care interventions, all of which are key to the provision of integrated, multi-disciplinary services for vulnerable children and families. <\/p><p>  Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services services are currently being provided by arrangement with the Health Service Executive.  <\/p><p>  The Child and Family Agency and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol to underpin the provision of these services for children. The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding and the Joint Protocol is to set out arrangements for collaborative working by the Agencies in order to ensure the provision of efficient, effective and proportionate services for children and families across the full range of health and social care services.  The arrangements also specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families where their care needs cross the Child and Family Agency and the HSE. <\/p><p>  Both agreements are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families. Additionally, the Agency and the HSE are working to finalise a service level agreement to underpin the provision of psychology services by the HSE.  This will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency&rsquo;s requirements in this area, and will operate as an interim arrangement pending the Agency providing the service directly.   <\/p><p>  Separately, my Department chairs an Inter Departmental Group on the implementation of Children First.  This group works to ensure that all bodies working with children, including those with particular vulnerabilities, are aware of their responsibilities with regard to the welfare and protection of children and are provided with the necessary training and guidance to support them in this work.<\/p><p>  My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it  is informed of risk to children and the measures put in place to minimise these risks.

It puts the everyday lives of children and young people at its centre and requires Government Departments and State agencies to work together in an integrated way along with non-government organisations to achieve better outcomes for children and young people.<br\/><br\/>Towards achieving this aim, we are working to address disadvantage, which can damage a child or young person&rsquo;s capacity to learn, grow, and have a healthy life and productive relationships. For the children and young people that need additional support, we need to identify them and intervene early. This requires good quality universal systems open to all, like our schools and primary healthcare services, backed up by additional targeted services and income supports to give &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; or vulnerable children and young people the extra help they need to keep up with their peers and lift more children out of poverty, aiming to break the cycle of intergenerational disadvantage.<br\/><br\/>While my Department has overall responsibility for the framework, individual Departments will continue to take lead roles on matters within their remit; for example, the Department of Education and Skills have lead responsibility for issues concerning educational disadvantage, the Department of Social Protection has lead responsibility for addressing child poverty. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for a range of funding schemes which target disadvantage across the areas of services and supports for children and young people.<br\/><br\/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures <\/i>recognises that disadvantage impacts on children and young people in both rural and urban areas.

An initial assessment is carried out in each case that is reported to determine if the child requires the services of the Agency and, where appropriate, engage with the parents and wider family and close family friends.

Where a woman has had a symphysiotomy immediately following caesarean section an award of &euro;100,000 will be offered and where she has suffered significant disability following these procedures &euro;150,000 will be offered. For a woman who underwent a pubiotomy an award of &euro;100,000 will be offered and for women who have suffered significant disability following this procedure, &euro;150,000 will be offered. Details of the Terms of the Scheme and how to access application forms have been widely advertised.<\/p><p>  Awards will be exempt from tax and legislation is being put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure they are also exempt from being taken into consideration for means tested welfare schemes. The Judge expects to make payments to some women before Christmas.<\/p><p>  It is not a requirement for a woman to retain a Solicitor to make an application.  However, the Scheme makes provision for applicants to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application if they wish.  Judge Clark has assured me that if women have questions on any aspect of the Scheme, her staff will be available to assist in any way possible.<\/p><p>  Applications must be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date, which was 10 November, 2014.  The Closing Date for receipt of applications is therefore Friday 5 December 2014.  In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark has discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.  It is important to note that in the event of a delay arising in the compilation of an applicant's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, the application should be submitted within the time period set out in the Scheme with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation. The details of this provision are set out in the terms and conditions of the Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Scheme is voluntary and I would like to emphasise that women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.<\/p><p>  In agreeing to this Scheme, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to trying to bring a resolution for the women concerned. The Government has acknowledged the pain and suffering which the procedure caused to many of the women and is also aware of the uphill battle many of them will face in the courts with uncertainty about the outcome of that process.  I hope the implementation of this Scheme will be of benefit to the women concerned and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900070#WRF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Service Provision","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900070#WRF03150"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[44451\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111900070#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the independent review of orthodontic services commissioned by the Health Service Executive in 2012 was published.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":339,"content":"<p>PA Consulting Group was commissioned by the HSE to undertake a review of Orthodontic Services.

Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie. <\/p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.
