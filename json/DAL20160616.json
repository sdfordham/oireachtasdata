He made this announcement amid a lot of fanfare, as was his wont.  His forecast was that 87% of customers would save money as a result of the new system but the exact opposite has turned out to be the case.  It seems from the feedback being received by all Deputies that 87% of people will be paying much more.  There has been a frenzy of coverage, showing examples of families which were paying &euro;200 but will now have to pay &euro;400.  Some families which were paying &euro;360 are being charged &euro;611.  Deputy Lahart is in correspondence with a family which was paying &euro;420 but will now have to pay &euro;770.  There is a growing sense of anger and frustration around the country because those who are in line to be hit with these bills from 1 July are not being offered a means of dealing with this problem.  They should be helped to find alternative services by shopping around and seeing what options are available.  All of the companies are piling on these increases.<\/p><p>If action is not taken now, we will be facing into a very difficult summer.  Families throughout the country will be facing very difficult situations.  I am concerned that in such circumstances, waste will be disposed of illegally and difficulties will continue to arise.  People with disabilities, older people and people with larger families are being hammered by the new regime and are concerned about the lack of information being given to them.  The private companies that are increasing the standing charges are exploiting the Government's lack of preparation in order to profit from this situation.  In one instance, the annual standing charge has been increased from &euro;60 to &euro;169.  The additional burden that is being imposed on working families across the country is forcing them to add to the profits of these companies.<\/p><p>What is the Government proposing to do?  We understand from today's <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is proposing to take action on behalf of the Government.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline here in the Chamber exactly what the Minister intends to do to stop these charges from proceeding?  Will the Government agree to freeze these charges until people can realise where the savings are, or if the savings actually exist?  Will the T&aacute;naiste say whether she and her Government colleagues agree with the increased bin charges?  Do they agree with companies profiteering from Government incompetence by adding to standing charges in the way they are doing in this city and this country today?  Are they aware of and do they understand the level of anger and worry that exists regarding these charges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600003#A00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1466075100,"counter":7,"content":"<p>This is an issue about which the Government and I are concerned.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, has asked the major waste collection companies to meet with him next week to discuss this, as well as other issues around the introduction of pay-by-weight.  He will put it up to them to explain their justification for what is happening and for such significant price hikes.<\/p>  <p>  This was never the spirit of the legislation.  The change in the way this was to be done was about ensuring the principle of reduce and reuse was built into the system.  It was never meant to be an excuse for hiking up charges.  The Minister, in the first instance, will discuss this with the companies next week.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Calleary said, these charges do not come into play until 1 July.  However, the companies have begun sending out information which has clearly caused concern and upset to many of their customers and to consumers.  We are concerned about this.  The Minister will explore what action needs to be taken in the first instance next week when he meets those companies.  I would stress that the whole change of pay-by-weight was intended to give households more control over their waste costs and to provide better value to those which prevent waste and recycle more.  It is very much in accordance with the polluter pays principle.  It was to stimulate the prevention of waste and create a more environmentally sustainable approach to the management of waste.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the approach to the issue, that is clearly what was behind the spirit of the legislation.

Elaine is a mother of three children, has a chronically ill husband and is in receipt of carer's allowance.

It is sad that today HIQA has published a report which is very critical.  It is not a problem with the staff or management who are overworked and totally overstretched.  According to Trolley Watch, emergency department trolley statistics at South Tipperary General Hospital show that it has suffered the most because of the cuts of recent years.  Figures from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation show that in March there had been a 100% increase in the number of trolleys and the level of overcrowding nationally compared to the figures in March 2008, when only 4,700 patients were on trolleys.  We need to bear in mind constantly that these statistics represent an old person, a sick child or a person with disabilities who are on trolleys in unsuitable surroundings.  They are human beings and we must always treat them as such.  The medical staff do their best for them.  It is, therefore, truly disturbing to have it confirmed that the total number of patients on trolleys in South Tipperary General Hospital this year has increased to 552, 319 more than this time last year.  It just gets worse.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the establishment of the emergency department task force has done nothing to alleviate the problem.  It is a high-powered task force and promises were made about what it would do, but things have got worse.  I am glad that the Minister for Health is present.  I ask him to look into this matter to see what the task force established by his predecessor is doing.  People are being advised to visit their GPs, but GPs are overwhelmed, particularly since the introduction of the free scheme for those aged under six years.  They cannot cope.  They are on the front line and many of them are operating on 40 year old contracts which are not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the promises made three years ago that stepdown beds would be provided in Cashel, with almost &euro;20 million spent, they are lying idle.  Never mind beds, they do not have pillows or blankets to put on them.  The facility could be used to alleviate the immediate problem and the standard of refurbishment is exceptionally.  When will this happen?  The former Minister of State, Mr. Tom Hayes, announced that it would and I am sure he did not make it up himself.  Three years ago he was told by the HSE that it would happen, but nothing has.  This cannot go on.<\/p>  <p>  We can thank the former Minister of State, Ms Kathleen Lynch, for the closure of St. Michael's, a psychiatric institution of long-standing, which provided an excellent service in Clonmel on the same campus as the hospital.  People must now travel to Kilkenny, and all the patients now present in the emergency department.  The former Minister of State was warned about this and we were told other stepdown facilities and crisis accommodation would be provided, which we clearly do not have.<\/p><p>A Vision for Change is not working.  I therefore ask the T&aacute;naiste what she will do because the HIQA report is very damning, especially regarding patient safety.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister beside her what action will be taken immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600006#D00600","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466076000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I have read the summary of the HIQA report and I agree with the Deputy that some of the findings regarding South Tipperary General Hospital are extremely disturbing.  I noted, however, that when the HIQA inspectors returned six weeks later they had found considerable improvement in some of the issues that had been identified when they first visited on an emergency basis.  The Deputy is right, however, that there are serious infrastructure and capacity issues regarding demand at South Tipperary General Hospital.  The important point is that we are entering a new era now of further investment in the health service, as evidenced by the extra &euro;500 million that has been allocated to the Department of Health and to the Minister, Deputy Harris.  There are improvements overall in the trolley situation but still a lot of work to be done.  There is clearly more investment in the area of general practitioners and investment in primary care and it is important that this continues.  It will deal to some degree with the infrastructural issues.  New initiatives and new funding have gone into the fair deal scheme, which has meant that patients now only have to wait a very short period of two to four weeks for a bed, reduced from 14 weeks just over a year ago.<\/p>  <p>  Improvements are therefore being made, but the Minister has indicated that he intends to address the general issues that the Deputy raises about infrastructure.  Clearly, however, there are also management and accountability issues, as evidenced by the HIQA report, that need to be taken up at a local level.  I note, for example, that some of the issues that were identified concerned the risks relating to infection prevention and hygiene, with very poor cleansing of equipment around some patient areas and stained, dusty and rusty rubbish bins in some of the surgical wards, and the paediatric ward was not clean.  Some of these issues can be dealt with via proper management and accountability from hospital groups.  The Deputy makes the point about investment and infrastructure in the hospital.  The Minister has said he plans to focus on the issue of capital investment in hospitals that need infrastructural development and he now has the resources to begin to do that.  There will be a capital review, as the Deputy knows, in the near future, and the issues he raises can be considered then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600007#E00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1466076000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister will address the matter.

HIQA has accused South Tipperary General Hospital of putting patients at risk because of unacceptable practices such as lack of access to oxygen, lack of space - which I see any time I am there, and I am called in there regularly - trolley overcrowding and similar issues.  There is no physical space.  The staff are at their wits' end and the nurses are under enormous pressure.  They are no longer in the reception area because they have been moved into wards, of which there are fewer and fewer.  The hospital only has a certain number of beds.  It is an old hospital and has done Trojan work.  We need infrastructural investment and we need it now, and we need support for the management and staff there.  As I said, nobody will condone any poor trolley practices.  Sick patients cannot be nursed on long corridors out into the foyer and such places, with no dignity and no privacy.

Yesterday she participated in the launch of the report of Women's Aid which set out the latest round of absolutely horrifying statistics.  She and I both know that this is not about statistics; it is about real people and real lives.  Therefore, it is a source of great concern that the legislation has been stalled for so long.  It is listed in the legislative programme under the heading of \"All Other Legislation\".  It has been noted that the outcome of the pre-legislative scrutiny was reported on in September 2015.  Will the T&aacute;naiste tell us when we will deal with the legislation and get it onto the Statute Book?<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware of this issue, not least because she has been talking to people within the community of the north inner city about it.  It concerns the illegal trading of prescription drugs.  It is welcome that it is the intention to legislate in that regard, but may we have a timetable as to when we will deal with it?  I would like to think we will deal with the matter before the House rises for the summer.<\/p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste will be relieved to hear, we say to the Government that, in the event of a Brexit, the issue for us is not simply about trade with the neighbouring island; the more immediate concern is that the country remains partitioned.

Health (Revised)<\/b>.<\/div><\/p><blockquote>That a sum not exceeding &euro;13,649,033,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2016, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health and certain other services administered by that Office, including grants to the Health Service Executive and miscellaneous grants.<\/blockquote><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Revised Estimate for 2016 for my Department - Vote 38.  It comes in the context of the Government&rsquo;s determination to put the fruits of economic success to work for the people by improving the services that really matter and make a difference to their lives.  I am privileged to have become Minister for Health at a time when we are in a period of reinvestment in the health service which gives me the opportunity to address some immediate issues facing patients, as well as meeting programme for Government commitments on which I want to deliver in my first 100 days in office.  They include a winter initiative to manage overcrowding in emergency departments, an integral part of which is the provision of increased resources for home care services.<\/p><p>It is also of particular importance that the Revised Estimate places the health service on a sustainable financial footing.  I welcome the statement by the director general of the Health Service Executive that the additional funding has stabilised the finances for 2016 and allows a realistic target to be achieved, with the emphasis he placed on the need for effective financial management.  Additional funding of &euro;300 million was provided in budget 2016 and this, with the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;600 million remaining in the health sector base moving into 2016, resulted in an increase of &euro;900 million on the 2015 budget, albeit that some of this had to be used to address once-off measures from the previous year.  While the funding secured in the budget was welcome, it was becoming increasingly clear that the HSE was facing financial challenges in 2016, including the national service plan, as approved.  The late approval of the 2016 Estimates has allowed the Government an opportunity to reconsider the health Estimate in the light of the emerging financial pressures and the economic position in which the country finds itself.<\/p><p>I am very pleased to announce that the Government is asking the Oireachtas to allocate<b><\/b>a further &euro;500 million in Exchequer funding for the health sector in 2016.  This brings the gross current budget for the health sector in 2016 to &euro;13.695 billion.  This is equivalent to an increase of &euro;1.4 billion compared to the original 2015 allocation of &euro;12.295 billion and &euro;736 million more than the final revised allocation for 2015.  In percentage terms, this represents a 6% increase on the final revised budget for 2015 and an 11% increase on the original voted budget for 2015.  This very welcome additional funding will stabilise the health sector financially and allow the HSE to set realistic and achievable targets for service areas, while still requiring it and service providers to demonstrate effective management control.  It is an indication of the Government's commitment to reinvestment in the health service.<\/p><p> While I am confident that we are in a far more stable financial position than we have been for some time, 2016 and beyond still contain real challenges.  We have an increased and aging population in this country, an increase in chronic conditions and new and expensive medicines and treatments.  Our progress in diagnosis and screening for cancers and chronic illness means more people require treatments.  Health services throughout the world are struggling with rising costs and Ireland is no exception.  We must recognise the additional resource demands that come as a result of these new pressures.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge these pressures and I am particularly pleased that the D&aacute;il recently passed a motion to set up the Committee on the Future of Healthcare to develop a single long-term vision for health care and the direction of health policy in Ireland.  I firmly believe that the Irish health service will benefit greatly from a single unifying vision that we can all get behind and that can help to drive reform and development of the system over the next decade.  In particular, it is important that we work towards achieving universal health care.  The motion establishing the committee notes the importance of achieving a single-tier health service in which access to services is based on need.  The committee is due to provide a report to the Oireachtas within six months of its initial meeting.  As Minister, I wish to assure the House that I will provide full support to assist this committee as necessary and as it requires.  I am grateful to my colleagues, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, for their support and understanding in dealing with the challenges faced by the health sector.<\/p> <p> The level of health services to be provided within the available funding is as set out in the HSE 2016 national service plan along with some additional programme for Government commitments, which I will outline later.  The service issues which will be addressed under the Revised Estimate, as outlined in the service plan, include funding to reduce delayed discharges and emergency department overcrowding through providing additional funding for community beds and long-term residential care.  It also provides for continuing the investment to improve the standard of care in residential services for persons with a disability through providing enhanced staffing levels and improving the quality and standard of their surroundings.<\/p> <p> In the primary care arena the full-year effect of the under six and over 70 free general practitioner care is provided for, along with the extension of GP care without fees for all children under 12 years of age in the latter part of this year.  The further roll-out of BreastCheck, enhanced provision of speech and language therapy, developments to our maternity services in line with the maternity strategy and further additional funding for mental health, which will be outlined by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, were also provided for in the Estimate.<\/p> <p> In the budget and this Revised Estimate the additional funding required to maintain existing levels of service in the acute sector is provided.  Funding is also provided for ongoing strategic developments in areas such as paediatric scoliosis, strokes, the living donor programme and organ donor services, acute coronary care, bilateral cochlear implants and cancer services.<\/p> <p> Earlier this year the Government launched the first national maternity strategy, a significant milestone in terms of the development of national maternity policy.  Additional funding has been provided for maternity service developments in 2016, all of which will be allocated in line with the strategy.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government emphasises the need for sustained commitment to improving waiting times for patients, with a particular focus on those patients waiting longest.  It commits to &euro;15 million funding for the national treatment purchase fund for an initiative targeted at those waiting longest from a continuing investment of &euro;50 million per year to reduce waiting lists.  The Department is currently engaging with the NTPF and the HSE in planning a dedicated 2016 waiting list initiative focused on endoscopy.  The NTPF clearly has an important role to play and next week I will be meeting those responsible to discuss further waiting list initiatives.<\/p> <p> Delayed discharges and waiting lists for acute services can arise when sufficient supports are not available for our older citizens in the community.  Our population is ageing rapidly, with advances in health care leading to a dramatic rise in our older population.  There is now a stronger emphasis on home care and other community services that provide a greater range of options to avoid admission to acute hospitals, support early discharge, and, where appropriate, to rehabilitate and re-able patients after periods of particular difficulty.<\/p> <p> The HSE provides a range of community-based services aimed at ensuring older people receive safe, timely and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity and as close to home as possible.  However, demand for these services is rising as more people are supported in their homes rather than in hospitals or nursing homes, and I am delighted that the Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an additional &euro;40 million for home care in 2016 in this Revised Estimate.<\/p> <p> For the future, A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to increasing funding for home care packages and home help year on year.<\/p><p>Of the additional &euro;40 million we are announcing today, &euro;20 million will be allocated to ensure that the 10.4 million home help hours, 15,450 home care packages, 130 intensive home care packages and 313 transitional care beds provided in 2015 are maintained; &euro;10 million will ensure that the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months; and &euro;10 million has been ring-fenced for home care as part of the new winter initiative.  There will, however, always be a cohort of older people who require a quality long-term residential care option.  This must continue to be available to anyone who needs it.<\/p> <p> The Government, together with the statutory and non-statutory agencies which provide services to people with disabilities, have been working towards empowering people with disabilities to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhancing their ability to tailor the supports they require to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This year funding of &euro;1.59 billion in total is being provided for health and personal social services for wide and complex range of services and supports for people with disabilities, including the additional &euro;31 million which was secured for disability services as part of this Revised Estimate today, details of which were outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, last week.<\/p> <p> The additional funding will cover costs incurred from compliance with national residential standards, services provided to meet the changing needs of people with disabilities and, importantly, the provision of emergency residential places.  Of this additional funding, &euro;3 million is earmarked for new initiatives, including an additional provision for services to meet the need of school leavers with disabilities and the anticipated cost of a number of emergency residential placements arising this year.<\/p> <p> There is an onus on us all to use this substantial resource more effectively and efficiently.  Most importantly, we must ensure that we are achieving real and significant improvements in the lives of people with disabilities.<\/p> <p> Enhancing primary care and integration of care between primary and secondary are priorities for the new Government.  Significant progress has already been made.  GP care without fees has been successfully introduced for children under the age of six and all people aged 70 years and over.  This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees, without having to undergo a means test.  The service for those aged under six includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and a cycle of care for children with asthma.  Other service developments include: the introduction of a diabetes cycle of care for adult patients with type 2 diabetes; an enhanced support framework for rural GPs; and a revised list of special items of service under the contract to encourage the provision of more services in the primary care setting.<\/p> <p> There will be further investment in primary care, an essential element of which must be a comprehensive new GP contract, including an extension of GP care without fees for all children aged 11 years and under, including the asthma cycle of care.  Other measures proposed are expanded GP access to diagnostic services and allowing more GPs around the country to offer minor surgery procedures.<\/p> <p> There are two areas in particular to which I would like to refer in the context of these Revised Estimates and they are home care services and mental health, areas under the control and remit of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  Members will be aware that in the context of the approval of the national service plan, it was agreed that &euro;20 million in time-related savings would be utilised to support services.  I am pleased to say that as a result of the increased provision for health, we can provide the required funding for home care without relying on these time-related savings and can therefore restore the full ring-fenced mental health budget.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and my Department will work with the HSE to ensure that our mental health services get the maximum benefit from this funding, including, where appropriate, its use to support the development and refurbishment of the necessary facilities to house our new staff and provide more therapeutic surroundings for our service users.<\/p> <p> In addition to the services set out in the national service plan, I am also pleased to announce that there is also scope for us to provide for the implementation of programme for Government commitments for the first 100 days.  In particular, the additional funding being debated in the D&aacute;il today allows us to provide &euro;40 million in funding for a winter initiative to help address overcrowding in emergency departments.  This initiative is currently in the early planning stages by both the Department and HSE.  I have met the ED task force and asked for its input and there will be a specific ED task force meeting on this initiative.  It will seek to support actions which improve patient flow through acute hospitals, as well as enhancing primary care and social care services.<\/p> <p> As an integral part of this initiative, I will increase resources for home care services.  As a result, we are not only maintaining home care and transitional care services at 2015 levels but are increasing them.  The programme for Government acknowledges the need to improve services to our older citizens.  The provision of additional home care services and transitional care will assist more older people to leave our acute hospitals when they are clinically ready to do so and this will allow patients awaiting admission in our emergency departments to be admitted.<\/p> <p> Both my Department and the HSE recognise that the need for ongoing strengthened accountability and good governance within the HSE and voluntary bodies remains of critical importance.  The HSE has reviewed its accountability framework after its first year of operation in 2015 and is involved in the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of that review.<\/p><p>This is focused on strengthening the operation, effectiveness and application of the accountability framework throughout the organisation to date, and will identify further changes to improve the process.<\/p> <p> The allocation to address the budget overrun in the HSE must and will be underpinned by improved governance and accountability.  My officials and the HSE will be working on the development of new and strengthened measures in this regard over the next two weeks.  Health service management will be accountable for performing within the budget set by these additional resources.  The Government believes the greatest need for improved accountability and control is in the acute hospital sector.  For this reason, the programme for Government contains a commitment to establishing a performance management unit, which will work with individual hospitals where there are difficulties to achieve improvements.  The establishment of this unit will contribute to a stronger focus on operational control and accountability in acute hospitals.  I also see an enhanced role for the Oireachtas and Oireachtas committees.  Those who are responsible for spending taxpayers' money on vital public services must be accountable.<\/p> <p> When we talk about the need for improved performance, it is important for us to acknowledge the progress that is being made and the work people are doing to deliver improvements.  The Department of Health is publishing the second annual report of the national health care quality reporting system today.  This report, which presents health information related to immunisation uptake, cancer screening and survival, and the management of chronic diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, stroke and heart failure, shows that clear progress is being made.  It also sets out areas where there is room for more improvement.<\/p> <p> The Government is committed to the development of a modern and patient-centred health service.  While there is undoubtedly a strong case for increased health funding in the years ahead, it is also important to acknowledge that at a time of growing demand, more funding alone will not resolve the difficulties our services face.  There must also be a focus on building a more effective health and social care service.  Our experience during the boom years of the Celtic tiger, when satisfactory returns did not always accrue from considerable increases in health spending, is a stark testament to that.<\/p> <p> I would like to take the opportunity presented by this debate on the allocation of additional resources to the health service, with the consent of the Oireachtas, to pay tribute to the health care staff who have taken us through some very difficult years.  While issues have undoubtedly arisen, there have always been positive elements in our health service that are too often overlooked in this House.  It was due to the hard work, commitment and dedication of the staff of the health service that it survived the most challenging period in its history.  While we still face challenges, there is every reason to be optimistic and to believe things are now more manageable.  We have a chance to embark together on a journey towards a better place for patients and front-line staff.<\/p> <p> I thank the Members for their consideration of this Revised Estimate.  I ask the House to consent to the provision of these much-needed additional resources to our health service.  We are now in a period of reinvestment in the Irish public health service.  I look forward to working with all Members of the Oireachtas in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600014#M01500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466080500,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy Browne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600017#P00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1466080500,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We accepted in recent years that the accounting practices, the assessment of demand and the provision of the funding needed to meet that demand were under pressure because of the financial downturn.  The budgeting system in the Department of Health and the HSE has been chaotic over the past five years.  The only people who thought the health budgets that were being proposed were believable were the Ministers of the day and those who worked closely with them when they were presenting those budgets to the House.  I suggest they were in denial.  No one other than the Ministers and their senior officials in the Department of Health believed the budgets that were being presented.  On several occasions, Mr. O'Brien of the HSE said publicly at Oireachtas committees that the budgets which had been provided were not sustainable for the delivery of the required services.<\/p>  <p>  Those who talk about the new political dispensation have said there is a need to involve everybody in the compilation of a new health strategy.  A committee is being established to consider the preparation of a ten-year plan.  The D&aacute;il and the existing health committee have a role in discussing the budgetary systems that are in place.  I suggest the best thing to do would be to start with an honest debate about the type of health service we want, how much we are willing to pay for it and what we expect out of it.  We have never had such a debate.  People waltz around this place on a regular basis promising the creation of a free health care system.  We could have a system that is free at the point of use, but there would be costs somewhere else.  Who is going to access health care?  Who is entitled to free health care?  Who needs health care?  These are fundamental issues that need to be discussed.  Over the five-year term of the previous Government and indeed prior to that, this House consistently listened to spin and nonsense about sustainable health budgets and real investment in health services.<\/p>  <p>  The bottom line is that we will be rationing health forever and a day.  Any modern country in western Europe will always be rationing health.  Somebody somewhere will be playing God with somebody's life when decisions are being made about where resources and funds should go and who should be prioritised.  I will give a case in point.  The Minister just said that free GP care for those under the age of six and over the age of 70 has been \"successfully introduced\".  Of course that has been done.  As a result of that scheme being \"successfully\" rolled out to people in those age groups, some of those between the ages of six and 70 are suffering.  They cannot get the resources they desperately need because others have been prioritised.  The successful roll-out of a scheme in one area can have profound implications for the lives of people in another cohort of the population or of society.  When we talk about investment in health services, we must be clear that we are talking about prioritising one group over another group.  We must acknowledge that in our public health system, accessibility is based on one's private health insurance or one's ability to pay, rather than one's clinical need.<\/p>  <p>  Even though he supported the previous Government, the Minister, Deputy Harris, is in no way responsible for some of the policies that were pursued by that Government.  The reality is that as soon as the then Government decided the same cost would be imposed on all private health insurance companies for public beds, it chose to prioritise the private patient over the public patient.  Hospitals immediately saw this measure as something that could be used to raise revenue at a time when they were starved of resources and funding.  Policies that were introduced during the previous Government's term prioritised the private patient over the public patient.  It is still happening to this day.  If two people are wheeled in, one of whom can pay and the other of whom cannot pay, of course the hospital will take the patient who can pay.  We need to be very honest about what we want.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the committee on the ten-year strategy well.  Deputy Browne and I will be joined by one more Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy on the committee.  We will absolutely play our role.  I want to make it clear that the committee faces a massive undertaking.  This nation has spent 60 years trying to come up with a health strategy.  We are still talking about coming up with a strategy.  Fundamentally, I do not expect the committee to come up with a complete strategy for health care over the next ten years in just six months.  We will need to have ideological debates on issues like how health care should be funded, who should be able to access health care, the role of private health care providers, the role of private health insurance and the obligations of the State.  Such fundamental issues will need to be debated as we consider how to move towards a sustainable and affordable system of universality.  Of course some people will have views on universality, which is a noble concept but comes at an inordinate cost and has significant implications.<\/p>  <p>  We could throw an additional &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion into the health system this year.  It is clear that the more one invests in health care, the better the outcomes should be.  The funds being invested have to come from somewhere else, however.  It is at that point that the competitiveness of the economy starts to be undermined.  We are always trying to strike a balance and to ensure the decisions we make do not have profound implications somewhere else.  Health care is always prioritised in that process.  Over recent years, we have consistently pretended that we are always trying to look after the most vulnerable people in our society and ensure funding is directed at those who most need it.  However, that has not been the case when numerous decisions have been made.  Mental health service budgets have been raided on a continual basis.  They have been pillaged year in, year out.  At the same time, the Minister has come in here to say that medical cards or free GP cards have been successfully rolled out to people under the age of six.  I do not believe this approach has been successful.  It cannot be said to be successful if people who are suffering with mental health issues, or people who are waiting an inordinate length of time to access essential care, do not have all the resources they need available to them.  One should not prioritise people for electoral purposes, but that is what the previous Government did.  Nobody in this D&aacute;il would argue that a healthy six year old has more entitlement to a free GP service than a nine year old child who is dying with leukaemia, but that is what has happened.<\/p><p>We have to be honest that, as a State, we are consistently rationing health care.  We must prioritise the clinical needs of the individual over political expediency.  We have been slow to admit it in recent times.<\/p> <p> This particular Supplementary Estimate, which is &euro;500 million, is essential and required because the budgetary proposition announced last October to fund health services was not sustainable.  This was highlighted by the HSE's Mr. Tony O'Brien and accepted by most Members, except the former Minister who said it was the first realistic budget in several years.  It was not a realistic budget, although there was an increase in the moneys required.  However, all the needs assessments from the HSE's service plans identified the changing nature of medical provision due to demographic changes and that this was not a sustainable budget.<\/p> <p> We have been talking about primary care since 1987 when the then Minister for Health, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, spoke in this Chamber about the need to reconfigure our acute services and ensure primary care became the bulwark and the main mechanism for delivering health care.  We are now in 2016 and still talking about it.  We have done very little with primary care.  We have opened buildings but have not opened people's minds to the concept of primary care being the major way of delivering health care.  We need to actually turn our thoughts to how we deliver care.  Home care packages, home helps, community nurse services and GP-led services have all been put under significant pressure in recent years.  We wonder why a 92-year-old is lying on a trolley in hospital for three days when they should not have been there in the first place.  They are not sick but elderly and dying.  However, they are put in corridors and wards of our acute hospital services.<\/p> <p> I hope the health strategy committee, first proposed by Deputy Shortall, can take the politics out of health.  I hope it will allow us to be honest with ourselves as a society in what we value, what we prioritise and, more importantly, what we need to do to provide health care and how we are willing to pay for it.  That will take a significant effort on everybody's part because of some strong ideological views people have on health care.<\/p> <p> For the past several years, we have consistently pretended we are prioritising health care and the vulnerable when, in fact, the opposite is the case.  This Supplementary Estimate is testimony of this again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600017#P00400","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466081100,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome the allocation of additional funding for health care.  However, it is only necessary as a result of the lack of credibility in the previous Estimates which had no real honesty.<\/p>  <p>  My concern and focus is on mental health.  I welcome the return of the &euro;12 million funding to mental health services.  I know it was hard fought for but the availability of it is only the first step.  We must ensure this money is well spent and targeted.  Going on past HSE figures, people have a trust issue as to whether this money will be spent.  It is critical this money is distributed and is spent on mental health with further spending next year.<\/p>  <p>  People with psychiatric illnesses do not have access to community-based interventions or support, ten years after the launch of A Vision for Change.  The full implementation of the policy is part of the agreement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to support a minority Government.  We will be watching closely to ensure the money is spent to fully implement A Vision for Change.  We must also review A Vision for Change and see where we are going over the next ten years in mental health service provision to ensure it is kept as a priority.  We need 24\/7 access to mental health services, particularly in our community and primary care centres for recovery-led mental health care.  As well as 24\/7 community health care teams, we need a proper plan for the attraction and retention of mental health staff.  Last week, psychiatric nurses threatened to go on strike not just about pay but the conditions under which they must work.  They are short-staffed and under pressure, seeing those looking for help cannot get the supports they need.  We need a clear plan for keeping nurses and psychiatrists, including career pathways for them.<\/p>  <p>  Emergency departments are not appropriate places for people suffering acute mental health episodes.  They need to get support in the community.  If one is suffering from a serious mental health situation, going to an emergency department is stressful enough.  Many of these departments do not have psychiatric nurses and those that do, have them only from nine to five, Monday to Friday.  We know psychiatric episodes are worse at night times and at weekends when people are alone or have taken alcohol and so forth, which may exacerbate the situation.<\/p>  <p>  If one goes to the emergency department in Wexford hospital after 5 o'clock, one will be seen by a triage nurse after four or five hours.  This nurse will have basic training in mental health and he or she will do his or her best.  The triage nurse will telephone a psychiatrist at Waterford hospital who will make an assessment over the phone.  If the psychiatrist deems further assessment necessary, the patient will be told to make his or her way to the Waterford emergency department, where one could wait another four or five hours.  We know there is a significant level of walkouts from our emergency departments, particularly from people suffering from psychiatric episodes.  It is understandable.  If they are under stress, the last place they need to be sitting for five hours is in an emergency department.

The position for acute hospital groups into the future is particularly challenging.  The plans for hospital trusts in the programme for Government raise serious concerns.  What we see there is not a blueprint for a public health system but a private health business.  The programme for Government concerns us as a charter for privatisation of our health services, putting them further out of the reach of the people who need them the most.  It is undeniable our public health system continues to suffer acute and chronic underfunding.<\/p><p>The annual deficits run up across the system every year, alongside lengthening waiting lists and numbers of patients on trolleys.  These are a testament to the failure of successive governments to allocate adequate funds.  Not only that, but it is a testament to how we have failed to develop a long-term vision for our health services.<br\/><br\/>I very much welcome the newly constituted committee.  I want to record once again my appreciation to Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall for proposing it.  We will, of course, participate in this committee.  We will be constructive and solutions-focused, as we always are.  The fact is that we must become better stewards of our health spending.  This is not about pursuing efficiencies in order to facilitate cuts to the overall health budget.  Rather, it is about ensuring we deliver the best care possible from the funds available.<br\/><br\/>While I will touch on some of the specifics of the Estimates and the ministerial announcements made in the past week, I would like to take this opportunity to touch briefly on two areas where I believe there must be greater emphasis in terms of health spending.  The first is reducing reliance on agency staff and the second is reining in the pharmaceutical bill.  In the first instance, we all know that a moratorium on recruitment across all areas of the public sector was introduced in March 2009.  Many Deputies may not be aware that the moratorium in the health service was, in fact, brought in years previously, in 2007, and it created a health system propped up by agency staff.  We need to ensure that the HSE reduces reliance on expensive agency staff and makes permanent posts more attractive for qualified applicants.<br\/><br\/>The current approach is clearly costing us dearly, not alone financially.  In financial  terms, however, in the period from January to May, over &euro;68 million was spent on agency staff, which amounts to 2,378 whole-time equivalents.  If progress is being made on this, what progress has been made to date in the conversion of agency staff posts to permanent positions?  How many posts have been converted in the last six, 12 and 18  months?  What are the approximate savings to the Exchequer through converting these positions?  The Minister has already agreed with me that agency staff do not represent good value for money, although we cannot deny they do very valuable work.  We need to see exactly what the Minister is doing about this.<br\/><br\/>The second issue is one that has been topical in recent weeks and one which I believe will become more prevalent in the future.  The undeniable fact is that the Irish taxpayer is still paying too much for on-patent medicines by international standards and, importantly, our system still uses far too much of them.  On-patent drugs account for 78% of the State&rsquo;s public health drug budget.  It is clear the State health service has a limited and finite budget, and this will always be the case.  Therefore, it is important that issues of cost effectiveness and value for money are considered.<br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in does not accept that these two policy objectives are mutually exclusive.  We have proposed a range of measures in our &quot;Better 4 Health&quot; policy document that would address the serial impasses in regard to access to new medicines.  The Minister, the Department of Health, the HSE and the pharmaceutical industry all have clear responsibilities in this regard.  Indeed, the European Commission, on page 74 of the Commission working document that is part of the country-specific recommendations process, noted:<\/p><blockquote>For medicines no longer patent-protected but which fall outside the system of interchangeable groups, no price benchmarking exercise has been performed.  As before, the authorities seem reluctant to activate their pricing powers gained under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical  Goods) Act.<\/blockquote><p>The Government, the EU and the international community should not allow pharmaceutical companies to hold citizens or states to ransom.  This is, in effect, what they are doing and what they will continue to do until such time as the structure for funding the research, development and commercialisation of new medicines is redirected towards the public good and the interests of citizens, and away from big global corporations.  The Government needs to play a prominent role in calling for this much-needed change at EU level.  Bulk buying, risk sharing, State funding of research and development and compulsory licensing are all possible options that must be considered.  I would like to know if further engagements are intended with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association in regard to proprietary drugs, and with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland in regard to generic drugs.  What further engagements does the Minister intend to have?  Is he seeking to achieve new and increased savings through agreement with both of these bodies?  On a very important point, has he identified targets in this area?<br\/><br\/>Before I come to the Estimates, I want to ask on one important detail in regard to the health Estimates.  Has the Minister put money aside for compensating Amanda Mellet and any future women who will need compensation until the eighth amendment is removed?  The UN found that our laws violated Ms Mellet's entitlement to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  The UN further found that Ireland, which is a State Party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is obliged to provide Ms Mellet with an effective remedy, including adequate compensation and the psychological treatment she may need.  We received the Estimates yesterday morning, and I apologise if I have missed it, but given the equivocation of this Government in dealing with this issue, which means it is almost certain that other women will be placed in the very unfortunate and tragic, but very avoidable, position in which we placed Ms Mellet, I have to ask whether the Minister has put money aside.  The bills and the need for compensation will rack up until something is done in this regard.  More women will be subject to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment for which they will be entitled to compensation.  It is a shame that we are here talking about compensation when we should be talking about real remedies.  We should be talking about taking care of these women, not compensating them.  Even on the issue of compensation, I see nothing in the Estimates to give me, as a woman, or Ms Mellet, as someone who has been through this, any comfort that money has been put aside to deal with these awful circumstances.  This is an issue that will not go away.  The Minister can dismiss it, kick it into a citizen's assembly and deny it, but it will not go away.  It is very real and it needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the Estimates, particularly the ministerial announcements this past week, I welcome that the &euro;12 million plundered from the mental health budget earlier this year will be restored.  I would take issue with references being made to this as restoration, which was said in some of the Minister's press releases, or as additional funding.  This is not additional funding but funding that was callously removed from this area and that is now being replenished after a public outcry.  <br\/><br\/>I read the Estimates in the short time allowed to us before this debate and I am not impressed.  I fail to see any meaningful investment and it is clear to me that the publication of the Estimates spells bad news for those who are on waiting lists - those who will spend tonight on a trolley, those who will continue to wait for vital services, those families who will be diagnosed with a fatal foetal abnormality and those who are depending on this Government to respond to their very real needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600018#Q00500","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466081700,"counter":131,"content":"<p>In 2011, in addressing the previous Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, I told him he could be a reforming, radical Minister for Health.  I then said the same to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  Unfortunately, both failed in their jobs - both failed to reform the health system and both failed to bring us any closer to a single-tier, fair universal health care system.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, now has the opportunity to do that.  I hope he will not be the third health Minister of this Government who will fail in that duty.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and the Government present this as new money.<\/p><p>The so-called extra &euro;500 million for health is typical of Government spin.  Not even Fianna F&aacute;il in its darkest days, and it was very good at spin, would have had the brass neck to come in and present this as new money when everybody knows it is not.  The Government knows it cannot introduce a supplementary budget because of rules which Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il supported.  What we have here is a supplementary budget by another name.  This &euro;500 million is not extra money but funds necessary to stop parts of the system from literally shutting down.  This is why the money is being allocated.  Why can the Government not provide adequate funding to our health system at budget time rather than having these continuous underspends every year?  We point this out and provide for increased funding for health in our alternative budgets but they are knocked back and criticised by the Government, which then comes in here months after the budget to seek more money because Sinn F&eacute;in was right when we said enough money was not put into health in the first place.<\/p> <p> The Government purposely underfunds health and then announces emergency funding as some kind of bonus.  It is some sort of gift that extra money will be spent.  This is cynical.  It is cynicism of the worst kind.  There is a need for real reform of our health service.  The Minister and the Government paint a very rosy picture of our health service when it suits, and they give the sense the Government is improving our health services and that it is making a difference.  Let us see if it is true.  Let us deal with a number of facts.  I received from the HSE a response to a parliamentary question tabled to the Minister on the number of patients at University Hospital Waterford who were languishing on hospital trolleys for the first nine weeks of this year in comparison to the number of patients languishing on hospital trolleys in the same period in 2015.  The figure for the first nine weeks of 2015 was 281.  The figure for this year was 710, which means almost three times as many patients were left lying in hospital trolleys at University Hospital Waterford.  This was just with regard to the accident and emergency department.  This was according to the reply to a parliamentary question and Minister shaking his head does not alter facts.  Facts are facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600019#R00200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466082300,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Distortion of facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600020#S00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1466082300,"counter":134,"content":"<p>This is as a result of many problems in many areas of the hospital in Waterford with regard to orthopaedics, ophthalmology and ear nose and throat.

We have record numbers of people awaiting treatment and not only in Waterford.  This morning, the Minister was in the Chamber when Deputy Mattie McGrath raised on Leaders' Questions the issue of what is happening in the acute hospital in Tipperary.

The Minister needs to prioritise post-2011 new entrants.  We cannot continue with a two-tier pay structure.  I believe in the principle of equal pay for equal work.  If the Government agrees with this, it must deal with this as a priority in health and throughout the public service generally.

This has been going on for decades under Fianna F&aacute;il and other Governments.  It is like a figure is picked from the sky for the health budget and it is constantly supplemented, as everyone knows.  We cannot continue like this.  Collectively, I hope all of us who deal with the issue of health care will come to a process by which we can support proper budgeting.<\/p><p>I note from the briefing document, for which I thank the Minister although unfortunately I received it only this morning, the Department states it is working towards the development of programme budgeting and changing the structure of the health Vote.  It is incredible that in this day and age the process by which the vote is announced and the way in which it is segmented and structured does not work.  We need to change this.  The document states it will take time to do this but I find this strange.  Why it cannot be changed quickly is, perhaps, something Deputy Harty will want to examine as part of the committee's work.<\/p><p>Later this year the Minister will seek more money.  We all know this.  That &euro;500 million will do it will simply not happen.  I will lay this bet with the Minister right now, and I guarantee him he will be looking for more money.  It is a simple fact.<\/p><p>I welcome the comments the Minister made earlier about the prioritisation from a budgetary point of view of the management of the acute hospital network.  It is the right way to go.  With regard to the mid west and south east, to be frank, I could never accuse those managing non-acute areas of not managing their budgets well.  They manage them particularly well.  I am not convinced I could state this confidently about the acute side.  This is not through the fault of management in these areas.  Different circumstances exist, which we might get onto later, and I appreciate this.<\/p><p>I am very much taken by the committee, which I believe is a good idea, but I agree with Deputy Kelleher that we will have to be realistic.  What will we achieve in six months?  It will not be utopian.  We will not be able to achieve everything.  There are ideological differences in the House, which is why we are here, on health care and health care management, which we will not solve in six months.  I ask that we identify what we will try to achieve as regards some form of pathway to a consistency of approach in health care.  Somebody will replace the Minister eventually and that person will deal with the same issues.  I hope we will have laid the foundations through the committee to create some form of pathway for managing a better health service, particularly with regard to how we manage funding the health care system.<\/p><p>It is necessary for all of us, particularly those who are spokespersons for various areas of health and the Minister, to make it above politics.  I know this is a clich&eacute; but we must adopt a different approach not only because of the political nature of the House but in general we will have to do it differently to achieve results.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions about some of the specific provisions the Minister has brought forward.  Many of these questions remain unanswered and I hope the Minister will be able to answer them.  I do not expect he will be able to answer all of them today but he might do so in writing to me afterwards.<\/p><p>Will the Minister give us a breakdown of how the much vaunted accident and emergency department winter initiative will work?  Where will the funding be allocated, in what measure and how will it be appropriated?  It needs to be appropriated in various ways.  I would like to see a breakdown of how it will work.  I know the Minister was left in a position where the funding was not there but it cannot be just a case of throwing the money out there.  It must be used in a quality way.<\/p><p>I lament the fact the post of Minister of State with responsibility for primary care was got rid of.  According to the <i>Irish Medical Times<\/i>, which I presume is correct, the Minister stated he would personally take control of the primary care portfolio.<\/p><p>I am glad to hear that.  He might explain how he will do that.  During the term of the previous Government we rolled out 90 primary care centres and commenced the construction of 73 more, and they will go some way towards the provision of facilities for people into the future.  How many will be funded over the duration of this Government?  What are the Minister's projections in that regard?  What is the target for primary health care provision and centres?  How will he measure that?  Is there a figure that he will stand over for the optimum number of primary care centres that we need across the board and the various jurisdictions?<\/p> <p> Regarding free general practitioner care, I welcome what the Minister has said about moving on from care for under sixes towards later this year increasing that to under 12s, but when will that be delivered?  When and at what time of the year will he commence doing this?  How does he see it being rolled out?  Has he abandoned the plan to extend GP care from over 65s to over 70s or is that something that he intends to do?<\/p> <p> I wish the new Minister of State for Mental Health very well.  In fairness, she has a hard act to follow.  The previous Minister was a very good one.  A Vision for Change, while a fine document and something that was broadly supported, is in an implementation phase that must continue rapidly.  Will that happen?  Does the Minister believe he has the resources to do that?  It is not something that can be done piecemeal, stopped halfway through or not implemented to the level that was planned.<\/p> <p> I welcome the funding allocation for home care packages.  This is a bugbear of mine about which I have spoken to the Minister previously.  I believe the allocation will only allow matters to stand still.  I have made my own inquiries about this and believe the allocation only fills a gap that was previously filled by taking funding from other sides of the budget, particularly in mental health.  The allocation will only ensure that existing home care packages will be funded.  It will not allow for any more home care packages.  It might allow for a few extra hours for a few people in various areas but I do not believe it will have a huge impact on the totality of people.  The Minister's figure is &euro;10.4 million.  That is up from &euro;10.3 million, I think.  I would like to see how that figure will work.  Ultimately, we must consider what home care packages cost, at approximately &euro;639 per week, compared to &euro;12,000 or &euro;15,000 for a nursing home or multiple thousands for somebody in a hospital on an acute bed.  It makes common financial sense and health sense that we fund this area appropriately because it helps with pathways to the management of people, it prevents bed-blocking and financially and from the point of view of health it is the best way.  The Minister will hear as a common commentary from me in my time as spokesperson on health that I am a huge advocate for this.  There are multiple wins in this regard, and I ask the Minister to prioritise home care packages and home help hours.  I know of people who are simply sitting in hospitals and cannot be discharged, will not be discharged or are refusing to be discharged because the home help hours are not provided to deal with them.<\/p> <p> Does the Minister have a timeline for the beginning and conclusion of negotiations on the new GP contract, which is obviously essential for the rolling out of GP care and enhanced primary care services?  Has he met with GP representatives?  If not, will he do so and when will he do so?  They are asking to meet, as the Minister knows.  A number of us in this House have a real concern about GPs in rural areas.  There are serious issues in this regard and it is something that I would like the Minister to prioritise.<\/p> <p> Has the Minister undertaken a cost-benefit analysis of the reactivation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund?  It is prioritised in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p> How will the accident and emergency and the emergency department, ED, task force, which I welcome, be managed?  This is a priority.  If one considers the situation in Limerick, Beaumont, Galway and many other hospitals, what we need regarding this task force is to see how pathways will be put in place for the management of people who are going through ED units.  There needs to be new thinking around this, and it is a critical area.  Will there be sufficient funding, given what the task force will have to come out with, to ensure that happens?  Not all of this is bricks and mortar or funding for staff, by the way.  It is about managing processes, pathways and people who come into ED units in the first place.  How can we ensure the primary issue we should be ensuring, namely, that first, patients get a good service but second, that some of them who are going into EDs are treated somewhere else because they should not be there in the first place?  I think we are all aware of this.<\/p> <p> I have a number of specific questions which I want to rattle through and on which the Minister may come back to me.  There is a cut in the budget in the drugs initiative and he is saying that that is a transfer to the community.  Can we get figures for and transparency on that?  There was a big hullabaloo when about 17,000 Ministers visited the north inner city in Dublin a few days ago, yet the communities will probably want to see an explanation for this.<\/p> <p> The allocation for medical cards on day one was not correct.  Is the Minister happy that the allocation that he has now specified will work?  There has been a huge increase in legal fees, according to what we are hearing.  Why is that?<\/p> <p> I welcome what the Minister has said about scoliosis.  This is something I have personally advocated for and I would appreciate if he would inform me of the details of what he is doing about this because it is something that has needed to be addressed for a long time.<\/p> <p> I wish to raise two final issues.  One of them does not relate to the Minister for Health directly but relates to the Minister for Finance, and I hope the Minister for Health will speak to him.  We have a serious issue in this country regarding graduate doctors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600020#S00600","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466082900,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600021#T00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1466082900,"counter":140,"content":"<p>It cannot continue.

If one multiplies that by five years, one can see what the cost is for them.  The issue is also a societal one because it is my belief that if mammy and daddy or somebody else does not sponsor these people or if they come from a certain social background, they simply will no longer be able to become doctors because it is too expensive.  What can we do, maybe through the Finance Act or the budget, to facilitate and help these people and, as part of that, to ensure that they stay in this country for a period of time, if not forever?  Can we put them on a pathway that would ensure that they want to and will stay in this country?  One of the Minister's colleagues made a proposal previously - I will not be exhaustive, but this was one of them - regarding doing something about the interest on the loans that they take out to educate themselves.  I ask the Minister to consider that and talk to his colleague.  I would support that.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as the Minister is aware, this morning there is a HIQA report about South Tipperary General Hospital which is quite damning.  It is incredible.

The crisis in the health service is universally accepted as a fact, and with good reason.  Waiting lists and trolley queues are not a seasonal aberration but a permanent fixture.  The state of mental health service staffing, after ten years of A Vision for Change, is a national scandal.  It is extraordinary that the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of this crisis is still in doubt.  The publication of the Revised Estimates for health shows that the Government, which has presided over the health crisis over the past five years, seems to be still stuck in denial.<\/p>  <p>  During the past five years, the Fine Gael mantra was &ldquo;more for less&rdquo;.  First James Reilly and then Deputy Leo Varadkar expected us to believe the cutbacks in health funding would do no harm.  A child could have predicted this.  Patient support groups and staff representatives told the Government about the devastating effects of austerity cuts on patient care.  All of this advice fell on deaf ears.  Less service for less funding would have been bad enough.  However, Fine Gael wanted to introduce the market and the private, for-profit sector, which is its answer for everything, and we got even less service for more money.  As a result of the additional &euro;5 billion spent on health insurance and out-of-pocket expenses, Ireland has ended up with health spending that is above the EU average and quality that is below the EU average.  We get less for more, not more for less.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have misled the country about our health service and they continue to do so.  All through its time in government, Fine Gael lectured the left on costing, insisting that the figures for alternative health proposals did not add up.  Meanwhile, it never costed its flagship health policy of universal health insurance, UHI.  Fine Gael introduced this UHI policy of private, for-profit health insurance in 2009 as FairCare.  It announced it as policy in the Fine Gael 2011 election manifesto and the programme for Government.  However, when it finally outlined the policy in a White Paper three years later, in 2014, it still had not costed it and could not say how much the health insurance would cost or what it would cover.  I doubt Fine Gael has learnt a lesson from this.<\/p>  <p>  The approximately &euro;500 million increase in the health budget announced in the Revised Estimates is almost entirely consumed by the current real spending in health.  This is not an overrun as the Government claims.  In 2008, eight years ago, the health budget was the same, &euro;13.6 billion, as it is today after the so-called additional money.  Inflation in the same period was cumulatively more than 30% and the population is increasing in number and in age.  This means there is less spending on health care than ever before.  The smoke and mirrors of health funding continues.  While the overall budget increases by just 6% year-on-year, the Minister has increased spending on consultancy fees in his Department by a whopping 96%.<\/p>  <p>  Given the level of public concern and outcry about the neglect of mental health services, the Minister&rsquo;s failure to address mental health is amazing.  Staffing of mental health is only three quarters what it should be and only half the recommended level for children&rsquo;s mental health services.  Despite this, while the overall budget has increased by 6% the mental health budget has increased by only 2%.  In the Revised Estimates, the &euro;35 million noted as not yet allocated for new developments in mental health is described as additional funding.  However, even when it is added in, the total is no more than the general increase in the health budget.  The level of funding in mental health is only half what it should be, based on international comparisons, resulting in a deficit of &euro;800 million.<\/p>  <p>  While the announcement of developments in primary care, speech and language and psychology services is welcome and overdue, it is dismaying that no specific funding or staffing targets are addressed.  While Fine Gael recently said it is committed to developing a one-tier, publicly funded health service, confidence is not inspired by the failure to be honest about deficits in capacity, staff, hospital beds and primary care centres.  Continued talk of superficial fixes through buying and selling care in the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the setting up of hospital trusts can only lead public representatives, such as us, to conclude that Fine Gael, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, is still up to its old tricks.  It is time for the Minister to stop running and spinning the numbers and address the staffing and funding crisis in the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600022#U00200","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1466083500,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Although I could probably speak on 20 different issues under this heading, given the time available I will speak on only one issue in more detail, namely, the rates for nurses in general and for young nurses in particular.  Even from a young age, I have always found it telling how many capitalist societies force nurses, who save lives, to live on relatively low wages while paying handsome salaries to members of the elite, who play, to put it mildly, a far less valuable role in society.  For example, a student nurse in his or her fourth year working in a hospital, with onerous duties and responsibilities receives &euro;9.48 per hour, which is 33 cent above the minimum wage.  The starting pay for a fully qualified staff nurse is less than &euro;23,000 per year and yet the salary pay cap for bank executives is &euro;500,000 per annum.  Gerry Gannon, one of Anglo Irish Bank's Maple Ten, receives a salary of &euro;170,000 per year from NAMA.  A failed developer is paid eight times more than a young nurse and a bank executive can be paid more than 20 times the salary of a young nurse.  This is a sure sign of a society which has its values screwed up.<\/p><p>Late last year, the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, published the results of a survey of 600 student nurses which showed 93% of nurses had considered emigrating.  More than 2,000 young Irish nurses have left the country and gone to work in Australia alone.  Meanwhile, there are more than 600 vacancies for psychiatric nurses.  Why are young nurses leaving and why can these positions not be filled?  Let us take a few reports from the front.  Claire Treacy, the industrial relations officer for the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, speaking in late 2014 on the situation pertaining in Galway University Hospital, said:<\/p><blockquote>On average there are nine nurses on duty and they can be caring for 70 or 80 patients.  There were nine nurses to 120 patients one day.  These nurses are burned out and stressed.  The hospital has been offering counselling and well-being sessions over the last few months but it is not enough.  It is not one bad day at work, like other people have; every day is a bad day.<\/blockquote><p>Tony Fitzpatrick, the INMO representative in the north east of the country, said of the situation in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital:<\/p><blockquote>Everything is stressful.  They [young nurses] go home crying.  Several have told me on the drive home in the car they have tears running down their faces, that they cannot sleep at night thinking about the patients, still thinking about their colleagues at work.  They know it has been impossible for them, on that day, to deliver quality care for patients.<\/blockquote><p>Young nurses are leaving the country because the job is so utterly stressful.  It is a downward cycle when that happens.  The key to breaking that cycle is an improvement in nurses' pay.  If it is increased, nurses who have gone to Australia, the UK and elsewhere will be attracted home.  Increasing the number of posts will result in more nurses on wards and will lead to a situation where there will be sufficient nurses on them.  The work will become less stressful and, as the word spreads, more people will be attracted home.  This will then become a virtuous cycle compared to what has gone before.<\/p> <p> In recent weeks, Luas workers achieved a pay increase of 18.3% and I congratulate them on having done so.  Why not give an 18.3% pay increase to nurses, not over a period of four years but as a bold stroke over one year?  The Minister and the Government will no doubt say the country cannot afford it.  However, the country cannot afford a scenario where money is spent educating and training young nurses before forcing these incredible national assets to emigrate and resulting in us losing the benefit of that investment?  This is skilful economics as well as a humane approach to the issue.  The hidden pay traps in place for nurses need to be removed in addition to giving them a pay increase.  The nurses' hand-over involves one nurse coming off duty while another is coming on.  He or she has to be informed of the position regarding the patients on the ward, which can take half an hour.  Nurses do not get paid for that in many cases.  On wards where there should be three nurses, there are two because of cutbacks.  What happens when they need a lunch break?  They cannot go to the canteen or off campus.  They have to eat their lunch in a room beside the ward but they are not paid for that.  What about the position of the many nurses who, de facto, do the work of ward managers but who have not been promoted to the relevant positions?  In other words, they are ward nurses in practice but not in the context of title or salary and they have to take a hit as a result.  What about the many opportunities for training and, flowing from that, promotion that have been denied to them during the austerity years?  These issues need to be tackled and resolved.<\/p> <p> I refer back to the example of Luas workers.  I urge the Government and the House to implement these policies.  I believe they make sense but I have no confidence in a Fine Gael-led minority Government implementing such policies.  The issue, therefore, needs to be driven by workers and the unions that represent them.  They could do a lot worse than consider the example of the Luas workers who set out their case and made a militant stand for pay increases.  If nurses make a similar stand for an increase, the vast majority of ordinary people in this nation will be fully behind them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600022#U00300","speaker":"1281","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466084100,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I deplore the fact that we did not receive a briefing document earlier.  I understand from a telephone message I received that the document was only made available in the past hour.  That is not a way to deal with this.  The Minister is shaking his head but I will not use my time on this other than to record that we did not receive a briefing document as should have been the case.  We should also have received a copy of the Estimates before yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to raise a number of issues.  I welcome the Revised Estimate but it is a drop in the ocean for a health system that is creaking at the seams because of previous decisions.  The word \"ideology\" has been used in the debate.  I am no ideologue; I am a practical woman when it comes to services.  I believe in a public health service funded by taxation and the vast majority of people want that.  It makes sense even on an economic level and I will outline a number of examples form the documents that have been circulated.  I would like the Minister to stop referring to elderly people as a burden.  Perhaps he might be doing it indirectly but the language in his documents states that elderly people place an increased demand on the health service because of an ageing population.  I would like to balance this comment with a few figures.  Only 4% of our elderly are in nursing homes and a further 5% receive home care services.  The other 90% of elderly people live independent lives.  It was established that the elderly make a substantial contribution in terms of spending and taxation to society in England following a costing that was done there recently.  We should get away from looking on the elderly as a burden and consider the talent and the money they contribute.<\/p>  <p>  Reference is made to stroke on page 24 of the briefing document.  I welcome the positive statement on the improvement in services for stroke victims.  However, Professor Harbison, the clinical director in respect of stroke at St. James's Hospital, has made figures available through a newspaper article and they are worth examining.  They outline what the failure to implement the national stroke strategy is costing the State.  He pointed out that an amount that is less than the amount proposed to be spent on two new drugs over five years has been spent on the strategy.  Strokes costs the economy &euro;500 million annually but at least 50% of them are preventable.  This year alone, 8,000 people will suffer a stroke, yet six of our acute hospitals do not have the most basic requirement, namely, a special ward or unit for the treatment of stroke.  Professor Harbison stated, \"Despite the successes, we still have huge deficiencies in stroke care in Ireland\", with only 40% of the stroke unit beds required.  Currently, only half of stroke patients are treated in special units.  That is a clear example of where money could be saved and then put into education and prevention and proper treatment in order that stroke victims would spend less time in hospital.  They would spend less time taking up beds if money was invested in order to provide appropriate care in the home.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 140,000 children live in consistent poverty.  We have a major housing crisis and, yesterday, I outlined literacy figures.  All those factors contribute to an unhealthy society and lead to people having to avail of health services, which would not be necessary if basic homes were provided for our people and if problems relating to illiteracy and alcohol were addressed.<\/p>  <p>  In the briefing document, one page is given over to mental health services.  The document does not refer to the cost to the economy of the failure to treat patients who are mentally ill.  I use these figures deliberately because this is a debate on the Estimates.  A Vision for Change was a revolutionary document published in 2006.  I am reluctant to quote one figure it contains - the figure is incredible - because it must be a mistake.<\/p><p>Extrapolating from the Northern Ireland figures, it is said that the cost to the economy for the failure to treat mental illness is more than &euro;11 billion per year.  I use that figure very carefully but if the cost to the economy is anywhere near that, do we not have a serious problem due to our failure to treat mental illness appropriately?  There is no mention in the Revised Estimates of a review of the mental health strategy, A Vision for Change.  No timespan is given for that.  The period of time that plan covered expired in January of this year and it is now June.  I do not see a reference to where that review is at.  During that ten-year period, there was an inbuilt mechanism for monitoring progress and the independent monitoring group, along with the Mental Health Commission, repeatedly pointed out that the implementation of the mental health strategy was both inconsistent and tardy.  The then Government's response to that was not to have a third implementation body, so it sat for two three-year periods and was then disbanded.  The mental health vision set out has not been monitored and we have actually gone backwards.  <br\/><br\/>During the many very sensitive debates in this Chamber on mental health, suicide was mentioned, as were all of the problems that we have.  I sat here in utter frustration simply because all those problems were identified in 2006.  The suicide levels ten years ago were very acute.  A strategy was clearly set out but none of it was implemented.  As was said previously, when we hear the whirring blades of the helicopter in Galway, it means something completely different to us now as week after week somebody is taken from the water.  The problems were identified as were the solutions to them.  However, the solutions were not implemented.<br\/><br\/>With regard to hospital beds, I have watched the underpinning of the public health system since I was first elected, particularly since I was elected to a health forum in 2006.  Certainly Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats were responsible for that and certainly Fine Gael and the Labour Party followed suit.  I hope this Government will change the direction and commit to a public health system funded from taxation.  The Government cannot keep giving money to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, a special delivery unit and agency staff.  <br\/><br\/>I would like to ask the Minister specifically about our obligation under the EU directive whereby if one can succeed in borrowing money from the credit union or any other credit establishment, one can go abroad for treatment.  Where is that factored into the Revised Estimates?  When we see all the money that is being allocated to agency staff, the special delivery unit and the National Treatment Purchase Fund and all the money going out of the country, would it not occur to the Minister or his staff to propose we put it into the public system and thereby increase the bed capacity, as we have a lack of intensive care beds and many doctors have gone out on a limb.  Doctors have put their names repeatedly to letters to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and other newspapers begging for the bed capacity to be increased and for a very long time, we have had to listen to the mantra that we need fewer beds.<br\/><br\/>We have been told we cannot employ staff.  Having had a depletion of our public health system and an embargo on recruitment, we now cannot find staff.We have not changed our recruitment system in trying to find staff.  If we have spare money in the recruitment budget, could it go to Console, the Samaritans or to the other organisations that are literally saving people from the water?  I listened with dismay to an interview where the director of mental health said she could not possibly spend that &euro;35 million before the end of the year.  I welcome the U-turn but should the Minister have any difficulties in the future in spending funds in the budget, will he come back to us?  We will certainly tell him where it could be spent, and Console would be one of those organisations.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude on a final parochial note.  We require a new hospital in Galway.  I raised this matter with the Minister and he gave me a bureaucratic answer to the effect that there were no plans at the moment, and that is despite the fact the clinical director of the hospital in Galway said everything they are doing is a fire-fighting exercise and that the lack of capacity and the inadequacy of the hospital is the number risk factor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600023#V00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466084700,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Connolly for sharing her time with me.  I want to specifically address the situation at South Tipperary General Hospital and I appeal to the Minister to give it the urgent and immediate support that it needs.  I invite him to visit it to see the excellent work that is going on there.  I have raised this issue repeatedly since this Thirty-second D&aacute;il was convened a short period ago.  I speak as somebody who knows the hospital intimately.  I was the hospital administrator for 21 years.  I have been a patient there, my family members have been patients there and I am in the hospital on a regular basis.  Only yesterday, I was there as a director of the Friends of South Tipperary General Hospital, which is planning fund-raising efforts to support the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Today's HIQA report confirms what we have known for some time.  South Tipperary General Hospital is a very progressive and successful hospital.  It is working well in excess of capacity but it is under-resourced, underfunded and understaffed.  To use a colloquialism, the hospital is bursting at its seams.  Staff are working above and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis and, indeed, on hourly basis.  The hospital is working at about 120% capacity on a daily basis and the medical department, which has 79 beds, is working at somewhere in the region of 150% capacity.  That is when 85% capacity would be accepted as full occupancy.  Inpatient and outpatient attendances have increase beyond all expectations.  There are huge difficulties in the accident and emergency department.  The trolley count at the hospital increases all the time.  The trolley count for 2011 was 750 but the trolley count now is well in excess of 3,000 and over the last period, on no fewer than five occasions, the hospital has had the highest number of patients on trolleys.  I have met patients and have seen patients who were accommodated in the foyer of the hospital near the vending machines, the lifts and the cafe and it was shocking.  I have to accept what HIQA has said on that issue but it arises because of underfunding and under-resourcing of the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  South Tipperary General Hospital, effectively, is a regional hospital but it is operating on a completely underfunded and under-resourced basis.  The background to that is that about 25% of the budget, approximately &euro;12 million, has been taken out of the budget on an annual basis over the past number of years and we have lost well over 100 staff during that period.  We need urgent and immediate action to ensure a quality hospital service for the people of Tipperary.  A number of steps need to be taken, both in the short term and in the long term.  We need the immediate opening of step-down beds, beds we were promised three years ago.  Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, which is located fewer than 15 miles down the road from this hospital, is a modern hospital, properly refurbished following millions of euro having been spent on it, but its door is locked.  That hospital should be opened and beds in it should be made available to support South Tipperary General Hospital.  We need additional nursing and support staff at the hospital and we need full-time community intervention teams.  We need to put back into the system the help hours that were taken out it during the past number of years.  Two million home help hours were taken out of the system during that period, and that is unacceptable.  A scanning unit is currently under construction.  The first floor of that unit is a shell.  We need the Minister and the Department to fund turning that shell into a modern ward with additional beds for the hospital.  In the long-term, we need the commencement of the development of phase two the hospital, the modernisation of the old hospital area and the putting in place of proper hospital structure to deliver health services and hospital services for 2016.  I hope the Minister will take up my invitation to visit the hospital in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600024#W00200","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1466085300,"counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600025#X00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1466085300,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Martin Kenny - the closure of McCormack Fuels and Services in Sligo Leitrim and the social and economic consequences of this; (2) Deputy Brendan Griffin - concerns of parents who believe their children developed adverse side-effects from the human papilloma virus vaccine drug Gardasil; (3) Deputy Frank O'Rourke - extending the period of time a person can participate in the T&uacute;s workplace initiative, giving consideration to a person's age; (4) Deputy Jackie Cahill - crisis in beef prices with a reported warning of a catastrophic collapse in demand; (5) Deputy James Browne - unemployment in the south east; (6) Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick - the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to give an update on Friday's (10 June) meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in respect of the Narrow Water bridge project; (7) Deputy John Brassil - provision of an acute stroke unit at Kerry University Hospital; (8) Deputy David Cullinane - Central Statistics Office's quarterly household survey for quarter 1 2016 which shows unemployment in the south east at 12.5%; (9) Deputy Alan Farrell - the need to prioritise the delivery of new metro north in line with the previous Government's commitment; (10) Deputies John Curran, Br&iacute;d Smith, Dessie Ellis, Fergus O'Dowd, Paul Murphy, Thomas P.

I will focus more on solutions to our health service problems rather than on criticism.  Many of these solutions will not cost any money to implement and indeed might save money in the long term.  The first issue the Minister and his Ministers of State must address is the morale in our health service.  Morale in our health service is at an all-time low because waiting lists, notwithstanding the best efforts of those working in the service, are getting longer.  Accident and emergency over-crowding continues and there is not enough capacity in the system.  This leads to low morale in our health service.  When referring to the health service, the Minister must speak about his doctors, his nurses, his therapists and his support workers.  That is not to patronise, but to be inclusive and to empathise with the problems.  If we can increase morale, we will certainly improve outcomes and increase efficiency.  In that regard, a well-constructed ten-year plan to lay out a pathway for the health service will be very important.  This plan must be implemented year-on-year once it is devised.  We are not going to wait ten years for it.  There should be an immediate dividend from the plan.<\/p>  <p>  My second point also relates to morale.  The Minister and his Ministers of State must go to our educational facilities, including our nursing and medical schools to speak to our new nurses and new graduates, including those from post-graduate programmes.  We must not allow our best educated nurses and doctors to leave the country.  There is a huge problem with retention of staff, but also of recruitment of staff.  We need to encourage our doctors and tell them the health service will improve and that we would like them to stay to be part of that.  We must give our doctors and nurses hope.  In many of our nursing schools, an entire class will go to one hospital in England be it St. Thomas&rsquo;s or Great Ormonde Street, Liverpool Royal Infirmary or Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.  They are taken entirely out of the system and we need to encourage them and give them hope to allow them to stay in it.<\/p>  <p>  The next issue is the integration of primary and secondary care.  This is not going to cost any money but it will produce tremendous efficiencies and savings.  We need to develop our ambulatory care centres.  There is a pilot centre in Kilkenny which is working very well and I encourage the Minister to visit it.  If we can investigate patients with a view to avoiding admitting them rather than to admit patients with a view to investigation, we can save huge amounts of funding and bed space.  When an elderly person goes into a bed and spends two or three weeks in it, he or she becomes immobilised and loses his or her independence.  It is hard to reintegrate them back into primary care and community care.  We must stop having patients go into hospital as much as we can.  Obviously, acute illnesses occur and we cannot prevent everyone going into hospital but if we can keep our chronically ill patients out of casualty, it would free up casualty for true casualties, which is to say accidents and emergencies.  So many of our accident and emergency departments are full of patients who would not be there if they were looked after in primary care.  We need to develop our primary and community care services.  We must look after our elderly patients within the community, but that needs support and resources.  If that support and resourcing is provided, there will be a dividend from that infrastructure by preventing patients getting into secondary care.  We need to change the focus of where we spend our money.  This is not going to cost any money.<\/p>  <p>  When we make decisions in relation to our health service, we must fully involve those supplying the service on the frontline.  So many decisions are made by HSE management without consulting the frontline staff.  Frontline staff are often bewildered by decisions made by HSE officials who have not properly consulted and integrated their decisions with those supplying the frontline service.  The Department of Health must take ownership of the HSE and force it to be more transparent.  Many decisions are made and it is quite difficult to know why or who made them.<\/p>  <p>  We have spoken in relation to primary care about extending free GP care to children between the ages of six and 12.  Most medical organisations and the majority of the medical profession want to see free care at the point of contact.  There is no dispute about that.  There is a problem in giving free care without increasing the capacity of general practice.  The introduction of free care to under sixes and over-70s has overwhelmed general practice and taken up any spare capacity if there was any.  It has meant that there are now waiting lists to see one's GP in Ireland which was not the case before.  It is commonplace in the UK to wait six days, ten days or two weeks to see one's GP for a routine appointment.  That never happened in Ireland before.  Now, however, the capacity of general practice has been exceeded by giving free care without extending the number of GPs and developing general practice to cope with the increased workload.  Waiting lists are developing within general practice and we do not want to see that.  If we were to give free GP care to everybody in the community, we would need to double our GP numbers but there is a problem because the GPs are not there.<\/p>  <p>  We are operating under a contract which is now 44 years old and completely out of date.  That contract is an impediment to the recruitment of GPs.  Deputies Billy Kelleher and Alan Kelly referred to it.  We cannot recruit GPs.  Rural practice is the most sensitive part of general practice and we have experienced huge difficulties in recruiting GPs over the past few years.  Of our GPs, 33% are over the age of 55 while 20% are over the age of 60.  As they begin to retire, young GPs are not coming in to replace them because the contract is too onerous.  Our GP contract is 24\/7, 365 days a year.  The GP has to provide the locum if he or she takes a holiday, gets ill or wants to attend an educational course.  There is a huge problem in recruiting young GPs because when they come out of their training programmes they emigrate.  The responsibility and administration involved in taking on a practice is too overwhelming.  We have proposed that in areas where it is difficult to fill a GP post, GPs should be put in on a salaried basis.  That should be an integral part of the new contract.  That contract must come very quickly.  It needs to come in the next year.  It was promised before July this year and it has not happened.  If it does not come before July 2017, general practice will be decimated.<\/p>  <p>  Another serious problem with general practice is that we were decimated by the FEMPI legislation.  We all had to take income cuts in relation to the emergency in our financial management, but general practice was disproportionately affected by FEMPI because not only was income taken out of the income for general practice, it was taken from the support structures that kept general practice working.  General practice is now lacking huge infrastructural support.  Rural GPs were also hit by their geographic locations.  There was a recognition that GPs in rural areas served a widely dispersed population, but the supports that allowed that to happen were taken away as well.<\/p><p> The Minister has had to depart, but I will make a suggestion to the Ministers of State.  In 1985 an educationist and psychologist by the name of Dr. Edward de Bono developed the six hats system for analysing problems and finding solutions.  One put on a hat to teach in one way, a had of a different colour to teach in another and so on.  I would love to give the Ministers of State the reference for this system which they could use in analysing and planning change in the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600025#X00500","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466085900,"counter":157,"content":"<p>According to the study of the impact of reconfiguration on emergency and urgent care networks, SIREN, the farther one lives from a centre of excellence, the poorer the outcome in the event of a serious emergency.  The SIREN report found that, while survival rates in Dublin were the best in the country, those in the south - counties Cork and Kerry - were the worst.  This is in stark contrast with the aim of the reconfiguration programme, namely, to achieve the best possible health outcomes for the people it served.  The people of west Cork have not been well served by the programme.  Many find themselves having to travel up to 100 miles at night by ambulance to Cork University Hospital, CUH, a journey that could take three hours.  They may then have to wait for several more hours before receiving medical attention.  The appointment of a night-time casualty officer would mean the extension of the Bantry General Hospital emergency department's night-time service.  More patients could be treated without needing to be transferred to CUH, resulting in more ambulances being freed for other emergencies and a reduction in the numbers presenting at and overcrowding in CUH's emergency department.<\/p>  <p>  Recent figures released show that 50,000 patients per year are walking out of emergency departments because of long waiting times and overcrowding.  Some leave without being seen by a nurse, which is further evidence of the failure of the reconfiguration of acute hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  Home help and home care packages are a major issue throughout the country, particularly in west Cork.  An underlying cause of overcrowding and bed blocking in hospitals is the fact that many elderly patients cannot return home owing to a shortage of home helps and a lack of investment in home care packages.  I call on the Minister for Health to invest in this area immediately.  In doing so, he would automatically reduce overcrowding and free hospital beds for those in need of more urgent medical care.  When I spoke to the Taoiseach about this issue last week, he directed me to the Minister.  I will take up that opportunity in the days ahead, but we need to consider the question of home help services as recipients are being treated poorly.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Lightfoot report, CUH takes the longest time in Ireland to clear an ambulance from the time it arrives at the emergency department until it is available for its next deployment.  The report recommends further investment in ambulances and related vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to address the issue of waiting times for the assessment and delivery of services for children with special needs.  I have been informed that some children are waiting a year and a half or more for initial assessments and a further six for the service to be delivered.  Under the Disability Act, children have a statutory entitlement to an assessment of their needs within a six-month period if they were born after 2002.  The Government is failing in its duty to these children under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to address the cuts to disability services, specifically the &euro;1 million cut in funding for CoAction in west Cork.  With growing numbers availing of CoAction's disability services and supports, the organisation has been put under severe financial strain.  Complying with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards has taken more than &euro;350,000 out of its stretched budget.  No additional funding has been made available for the residential, respite care or transport service in the past eight years.  Many parents of adults with intellectual disabilities are ageing and finding it increasingly difficult to care for their adult children without the support of respite and residential care services.  They are also under increasing stress to provide the future care of their children owing to the decrease in the number of places available in full-time residential services.  I call on the Minister to reverse the savage cuts to a service that is vital for more than 600 children and 140 adults across west Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600026#Y00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1466085900,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Deputies Stephen S.

While we are discussing health services that need more funding urgently, I wish to raise a particular matter, that of Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, about which a constituent of mine contacted me in recent weeks.  She needs a hip replacement, is in severe pain and her condition is deteriorating.  She is on her way to being in a wheelchair, something I have had confirmed by her surgeon.  She was told that she would have to wait 15 months.<\/p>  <p>  When I looked further into what was happening at Cappagh hospital, what I discovered was disturbing.  If a general practitioner, GP, believes someone in the greater Dublin area needs orthopaedic surgery, or if anyone in the country needs complex orthopaedic surgery, it will take 15 months to see a consultant.  It will take a further 15 months to get into an operating theatre.  As such, it takes two and a half years to get from a GP to the operating theatre.  In the United Kingdom it takes four months and i New Zealand, three.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken to surgeons in this field.  To say they are demoralised, frustrated and angry would be a gross understatement.  Anyone who attends a GP and needs orthopaedic work, be it on a hip or a knee, is typically already in serious pain.  In the two and a half years someone will wait for surgery, the pain will escalate, the person's condition will deteriorates and the complexity, cost and recovery time of the operation will move in the wrong direction, as will the clinical outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  I will explain what is happening in Cappagh hospital and why people in Ireland are waiting two and a half years for a hip operation.  By the way, if someone needs the other hip or knee to be operated on, he or she must go back to the start of the list.  Compare this with the figure of 12 weeks in New Zealand and 16 across the water in the United Kingdom.  In 2014 Cappagh hospital suffered a serious cut in Government funding, which meant that it needed to reduce the number of procedures it could carry out that year by 700.  It let staff go and scaled down.  In 2015 the situation was so bad that the Government increased its funding.  Last year Cappagh hospital started to scale up again, but it incurred higher costs by hiring agency staff because it did not want to have to fire anyone again.  At the start of this year the HSE could not tell the hospital how much money it would be given for the year.  For the first three months it operated on the understanding that it would have the same budget as last year.  After the first quarter, however, it discovered that it would suffer a further cut in funding.  It must let staff go and scale back again.<\/p>  <p>  There are six operating theatres in Cappagh hospital, only three of which are being used.  Typically, an orthopaedic surgeon can perform five procedures in an operating theatre on a given day.  The surgeons in Cappagh hospital have been instructed to stop after three.  The State is paying all of the hospital's fixed costs - for the six operating theatres, the wards, the beds that are not being used, the theatre staff and the surgeons - but the hospital no longer has money for implants which typically cost between &euro;1,500 and &euro;3,000 each.  For a complex operation, it might cost up to &euro;6,000 and, obviously, the cost increases.  I told the patients that, were my relative affected, I would borrow the money to buy an implant on eBay and bring it to the hospital, but when I asked them about doing this, they said they were not allowed to do so.  When I asked the surgeons what they did after performing the three procedures, they told me that they went home or into private practice where they could actually treat patients.<\/p><p> Since the Minister, Deputy Harris, had to leave the Chamber, I ask the Ministers of State who are present, Deputies Helen McEntee and Finian McGrath, to raise as a matter of urgency the fact that, owing to Government cuts, Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital has not got the money for the implants needed for patients who have been waiting for two and a half years for orthopaedic surgery.  However, the problem is even worse because, as I found out, the target of being admitted to an operating theatre within 15 months of meeting a consultant is a HSE target.  Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital will now miss the targets.  The HSE will, therefore, fine it and it will have less money for implants.  The waiting lists will get longer and the HSE will fine the hospital again.  That is happening right now in our national orthopaedic hospital.  If we are to have a conversation about a budget of &euro;13.7 billion and additional expenditure this year of &euro;500 million, the Minister should, as a matter of urgency, engage with Cappagh hospital.  It needs approximately &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million for the rest of the year.<\/p> <p> Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital also needs multi-annual funding.  I cannot understand why this is not made available.  Imagine a hospital not knowing in the first three months of the year how much funding it will have for the year.  Other organisations just do not operate like that.  The hospital needs funding for this year, and it needs multi-annual funding.  It needs more ambitious targets.  It is unacceptable that the HSE target for orthopaedics is 15 months.  This period needs to be reduced.<\/p> <p> There is no load balancing across the hospitals.  Thus, the waiting lists in Limerick are much smaller than in Dublin.  There is no national patient database.  There is no co-ordinating function whereby one would be asked whether, on the basis that one must wait 15 months in Dublin, one would be willing to wait six months on a list in Limerick.  There is no load balancing in this regard at all.  I will send the Minister the notes on this.  Will he please consider providing a low number of millions of euro to Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital?  I will be more than happy to send him all the details.<\/p> <p> What is happening in Cappagh, including the mismanagement by the health care system of the funding for the hospital and the results for patients and the medical staff, is symptomatic of a Health Service Executive that clearly does not know how to run budgets.  The Government is asking the D&aacute;il to sanction an additional &euro;500 million.  To put that in perspective, that is more than half the total fiscal space we will be debating in October for the entire budget for next year.  An extra &euro;0.5 billion &mdash; over half the entire budgetary space for next year &mdash; is being sought by the Government.  I apologise if the analysis is unavailable.  I have tried to obtain it.  We have contacted the Minister&rsquo;s office and looked at the website of the Department of Health but I cannot find any breakdown of the &euro;500 million.  I have read through the Minister&rsquo;s speech and have found explanations for allocations of &euro;40 million here, &euro;50 million there and &euro;15 million in other places.<\/p> <p> I have to hand the revised book of Estimates.  It gives the revised budget for this year, &euro;13.69 billion, but nowhere is it explained where the extra &euro;500 million has come from.  There are references to some allocations in the Minister's speech but I cannot find a table indicating how the &euro;500 million breaks down.  There is &euro;200 million for additional services and &euro;300 million for overruns.  It ought to be stated that the &euro;200 million for additional services is going to listed places based on certain cost&ndash;benefit analyses.<\/p> <p> The D&aacute;il voting through an extra &euro;0.5 billion is a massive undertaking but we are not being provided with the kind of analysis one would expect to see if asked to sign a cheque for &euro;0.5 billion unexpectedly.  I apologise if we were provided with it.  This debate is about whether the D&aacute;il is willing to sign a cheque for the HSE of an additional &euro;500 million.  Now that the committees are being formed, surely the Minister should offer an explanation of the allocation and the overruns to the health committee, finance committee or the new budgetary committee.<\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned in his speech the new accountability framework that the HSE is putting together.  It is very welcome to see an accountability framework coming together.  If in my pre-politics world people said they had overspent by &euro;0.5 billion, there would have been serious accountability.  I am not talking about the Minister as he is new in the job; I am talking about the HSE.  Has anyone been fired?  Has anyone been demoted?  Someone, somewhere, has overspent by hundreds of millions of euro.  Will the accountability framework actually hold anyone to account for over-expenditure of hundreds of millions of euro?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600026#Y00600","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466086500,"counter":161,"content":"<p>This is a useful debate.  Our most significant budgetary categories are social welfare, health and education.  They reflect the three big Departments where the money goes.  Our history over the past 15 or 20 years, including in the lead-up to the crash, shows that most of the money went into these categories.  Expenditure on health increased dramatically in the period.  Obviously, we have experienced a particularly harsh and difficult time in the past seven or eight years as the budgets came down again.  They are starting to expand, which is welcome, because our economy is starting to grow but we should be careful to avoid the trap into which we fell in the early 2000s when we were just putting money into a system without getting value for it.  We must be razor sharp and clinical in assessing the benefits of our health expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that the Minister has a task ahead of him in conjunction with the rest of us in the Parliament as we are running our health system, or changing the entire system.  I am very glad a joint Oireachtas committee is now examining how we can, in mid-flight, change some of the engines of our system to move towards a single-tier system.  I do not see any of that set out in Estimates.  This relates to one of the questions I was asking during Leaders' Questions earlier today.  There is a need for detailed work in the committees whereby the Minister would outline, through his budgetary provisions for 2017 rather than through what we are discussing today, how he wants to make the desired shifts.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of other shifts I do not see in the spending priorities and on which I want to reflect and comment.  Various Members have raised concerns about using specific examples to outline the problems at large.  I am concerned that we are not allocating enough money for ICT.  We are spending approximately 1%.  When we invest in ICT systems &mdash; be it PPARS, electronic voting machines or Eircode &mdash; and the investment does not work out as originally planned, it becomes a big story.  I fear that this freezes the public service such that it is afraid to take a risk or change the way it does business.  Officials do not want to risk their career by suggesting some innovative ICT approach.  We are not spending enough on ICT.  The Green Party&rsquo;s assessment of health policy is that we radically need to increase ICT expenditure because it may result in productivity in all the other areas where we are spending the money.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the comments of Deputy Stephen Donnelly on where the money is going.  Parsing the figures as best I can, I believe the money is being spent on wages and staff primarily.  Are staff being used to best effect?  By investing in ICT, we can ensure our health and emergency systems and some of the processing in that regard are carried out in a more careful, creative and humane way.  We could direct patients to where resources are under-used.<\/p>  <p>  ICT investment would allow us to treat patients at home.  It would allow us to change fundamentally the structure of the health system and the means of providing services, including through remote sensory systems, remote diagnostic tools and remote delivery of medicines.  This is all available.  We have most of the leading companies in this country that are interested in this space and which are good at what they do in this area.  We should be using their expertise.  We are not budgeting sufficiently in this space.  I flag that for the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to give a personal example.  We have all used personal examples.  One of my strongest memories concerning the health system is that I was once invited to an event by the great Riste&aacute;rd Mulcahy, the professor of medicine in UCD and cardiologist in St. Vincent&rsquo;s.  I was once very proud to be involved with him on a cycling campaign.  This is a very important example of preventive activity in the area of health in which we need to invest.  Creating a healthy environment will actually cut the budget more than anything else.  Professor Mulcahy brought me to the preventive centre in St. Vincent's.  It may have changed since my visit was a number of years ago.  I will always remember walking through long corridors with massive machines and considerable resources only to finally arrive at the centre of preventive health in the hospital.  It was a broom cupboard.  That is the only way to describe it.  We now have the opportunity not only to put funding back into the health service but to reform it.<\/p><p>The Minister should push preventive medicine, the use of information and communications technology, residential care and community design systems.  I do not see this being done and it is the Minister's job to change it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600027#Z00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466087100,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Revised Estimate with reference to disability services in this important debate.  I listened with great interest to the views and concerns expressed by Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly.  Ministers had an important meeting on the health service this morning, at which we addressed the issues of accountability and proper management in the health service.  We are listening to Deputies' views and pushing the accountability agenda.  I am specifically demanding investment in disability services, reform and accountability.  My aim is to empower people with disabilities to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports they require to meet their needs and plan their lives.  In this context, I am particularly pleased that the &euro;30 million in additional funding secured last week will support the programme for Government commitment to ensure all 18 year old school leavers with disabilities will have access to supports and services which meet their needs at this crucial point in their lives.  Service providers must also be able to respond effectively and sensitively when people experience crises in their lives and require immediate support.  The additional funding secured will also cover costs incurred in meeting compliance with national residential standards, services provided to meet the changing needs of people with disabilities and emergency residential places already provided.  It is important to get that message across. <\/p>  <p>  Deputies should note that funding of &euro;1.56 billion was allocated by the Health Service Executive for disability services in the national service plan 2016.  Together with the additional &euro;31 million I managed to secure last week, the total allocation for disability services now stands at &euro;1.59 billion.

In particular, I welcome the additional funding provided for home care services.  In recent weeks I have engaged with numerous advocacy groups, officials from the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive and, most importantly, individuals who use home care services.  Older people have consistently stated they want to stay in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  Home care services are key to achieving this objective.  In 2016 the HSE has a core provision of &euro;324 million for home care services.  Notwithstanding the significant improvements in the overall economic position, pressures continue to apply and demand for home care services is rising with an ageing and growing population.  People want to be supported at home rather than in hospitals or nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  Without a shadow of doubt, home care services need more resources than are available.  For this reason, the programme for Government commits to increasing funding for home care packages and home helps year on year in the coming period.  Of the additional funding of &euro;40 million provided for this area, &euro;20 million will be allocated to ensure the services provided in 2015 are maintained; &euro;10 million will be used to ensure the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months, while &euro;10 million has been ring-fenced for home care services as part of the new winter initiative.  While there is always scope to do more, Deputies will agree that this is a step in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  Long-term care is one of the most challenging issues facing older people.  Many reports, reviews and other documents have been written in the past 20 years, all of which ask the same question, namely, \"How can we make Ireland a great place for older people to live in?\"  For the most part, the answer is the same - older people will live longer, healthier and happier lives if they live in a family or home setting.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Michael Harty correctly stated, we need to change the current approach and move away from secondary to primary care services.  It is my intention to set out a clear plan for how we can progress that vision.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, I welcome the reinstatement of &euro;12 million to the development budget.  Just this week, I conveyed sanction to the HSE for the spending of &euro;18 million in 2016.  In addition, sanction has been given to spend &euro;4 million, on a once-off basis, on minor capital works.  A further &euro;6.55 million will be spent in significant service areas, including in providing additional bed capacity, peer support services, to meet the additional cost of private placement of complex cases and additional posts to provide for improved patient safety in certain areas.  Some &euro;11.37 million will be spent on new developments outlined in the HSE national service plan.  These include the development of early intervention and counselling services in primary care, further expansion of Jigsaw services in three cities, opening new acute care units and high observation units and the provision of funding for the child and adolescent eating disorder service, the homeless and the mentally ill.  A sum of &euro;80,000 will be spent in meeting other commitments commenced in previous years.  I am engaged in discussions with the Health Service Executive and other Departments on the figure of &euro;12 million and will revert to Deputies on the matter as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600028#AA00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1466087100,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I wish the new Minister and Ministers of State the best of luck in their portfolios.  I welcome the allocation of an extra &euro;500 million for health services.<\/p><p>As a representative of County Tipperary which no longer has a Government Deputy or Senator, I will focus on the lack of mental health facilities in the county.  With a population of 160,000, County Tipperary does not have psychiatric beds, while the clinic in Thurles is under-resourced.  For example, it does not have an occupational therapist; a psychiatric counselling service is not available and it is only open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days each week.  This means taht people from the north of the county must travel to Ennis to avail of care, while people living in the south must travel to Kilkenny.  This issue must be addressed and I look forward to the Government making proposals in that regard.<\/p><p>The Minister did not provide detail on how much funding is being provided for home care services and home care packages.  Two completely different policies on managing home help hours are applied in north and south Tipperary, respectively.  The service in south Tipperary uses its entire allocation of hours with HSE staff and thereafter employs agencies, whereas the service in north Tipperary uses a combination of HSE staff and agencies throughout the year.  A consistent approach is required because the use of different approaches in the same county is preventing the system from operating efficiently.  In any case, the service requires more funding if an adequate service is to be provided for those who need it most.<\/p><p>The HSE practice of offering home help hours in half-hour segments must be addressed as it is not an efficient use of resources.  It is certainly not satisfactory for the service user and employees of the service.  <\/p><p>I would like to know if any of the additional funding will be used to tackle the ever-increasing numbers on waiting lists.  The numbers on the inpatient and day case lists have increased by almost 50% in the past two years.Figures for May this year show that 509,994 patients are either waiting for an operation or an outpatient appointment.  The number waiting for an outpatient appointment has increased from 407,257 to 415,584 in the space of one month, while more than 62,000 of these individuals have been waiting for more than one year.  In addition, the backlog of patients who need surgery increased from 74,274 to 74,986, having stood at 50,000 in 2014.  This is an increase of approximately 50%.  Last year&rsquo;s targets are being missed, with more than 5,000 waiting for surgery for more than 15 months in May.  This is a significant jump when one compares it with the figure of 4,603 who were enduring the same delay in April.<\/p><p>The figures also show that the number waiting in excess of 18 months for an outpatient appointment to see a specialist increased from 8,570 in April to 13,095 in May.  Of those waiting for surgery, 4,704 are children, 58 of whom have been waiting for more than a year and a half.  More than 60,000 people, including more than 4,500 children, have been waiting for more than one year for an outpatient appointment.<\/p><p>As a first-time Deputy, I find that the annual merry-go-round of health budget overruns followed by the introduction of a Revised Estimate smacks of poor planning.  It appears that the HSE runs the service until its budget runs out before being bailed out by the Government.  Surely a budget should be presented for a 12-month period.  In every year since 2011 the HSE has required a substantial supplementary budget.  Given the <i>ad hoc<\/i>approach to health planning and changing demographics, does the Minister agree that we are storing up major problems for the future?  The population grew by 23% in the past 15 years and is set to grow by a further 30% in the next 25.<\/p><p>The 65 to 74 age group is set to grow by over 33% and the 75 years plus age group is set to grow by an incredible 82%.<\/p> <p> We need careful planning to ensure the health service, which has come in for extensive criticism in recent years, does not run into even more trouble in the coming years.  Deputy Healy referred specifically to South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel.  Some things could be done in Tipperary which would not cost a great deal to the HSE budget.  Our Lady's County and Surgical Hospital, Cashel, is fully furnished but its doors are closed.  It must be re-opened as a set-down facility.  The Dean Maxwell facility in Roscrea, a residential home for elderly people, urgently needs investment and more beds are required.  Mount Sion in Tipperary must be kept open as a residential home for people with mental illness and the Community Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles also needs more investment and capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600028#AA00400","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466087700,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I wish to begin by thanking everyone for their contributions.  We have had a constructive debate.  There is significant merit in much of what has been said on all sides of the House.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say that today is a good day for the Irish health service.  Any day when those of us in the Oireachtas decide to spend an additional &euro;500 million on the Irish public health service can only be described as a good day.  It is evidence that we are putting the fruits of our functioning economy to work for the public services that our citizens rightly demand.<\/p>  <p>  This Revised Estimate does five things.  First, it puts the health service on a stable footing.  These are not my words; they are the words of the director general of the HSE.  It is now up to him and his managers throughout the service to manage and live within their budgets.  That is what they are paid to do and that is the job they must do.<\/p>  <p>  It also does four other things.  It allows us to have money for a winter initiative larger than the winter initiative last year.  A total of &euro;40 million is included to ensure we can put additional supports into our emergency departments for the winter period, a time when they come under particular pressure.  It allows us to restore the mental health budget to &euro;35 million, as outlined by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee.  The Minister of State will be getting on with drawing up plans to spend that money.  It allows us to increase home help hours and home care packages rather than simply keep the levels we had in 2015.  It allows us to have more home care packages and home help hours this year than last year, a welcome development.  As outlined by my colleague, the Minister State, Deputy McGrath, it has allowed him to increase the disability budget by &euro;31 million, including &euro;3 million specifically for the important issue of school leavers.<\/p>  <p>  This debate has been constructive in the sense that there has been recognition on all sides from all speakers that we cannot do things the way we used to do them in budgeting for the health service or in debating the health service.  We need to try to find consensus, where possible, on the general direction of travel for the Irish public health service.  That is why I have undertaken to co-operate and work with the establishment of the special committee to develop a single vision for our health service for the next decade.  I am a supporter of the committee.  Ministers of Health come and go.  It is not fair that every time a new Minister arrives the health service gets tinkered with but there is no continuity in direction.  I do not underestimate the challenge being put up to this committee, but I am certainly looking forward to working with Members in this regard.  Reference was made to a short timeframe of six months and I agree, although that was the timeframe put forward in the motion.  It is now a matter for that committee to do its work and see how it gets on in that timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  Today, we published the national health care quality report.  I wish to make a point for our front-line staff.  There are major challenges in our health service.  We have discussed the challenges and problems as we always discuss problems - that is our job.  I urge our front-line staff to read the report.  It is available on my Department's website.  It shows the progress we have made.  When I say \"we\" I am not referring to the Government, but \"we\" as in the Irish public health service.  It will show the progress through successive Governments and improvements in outcomes in our health service.  It is important that front-line people working in our health service today have that acknowledged by Members and by the media as well.  Good things are happening in the health service every day.<\/p>  <p>  There are still significant challenges, some of which have been referenced today.  I take the point Deputy Kelleher makes about people talking about primary care since the time Dr. Rory O'Hanlon was Minister for Health in the 1980s.  He is right.  We must show significant progress.  I agree that we cannot simply measure progress in terms of the number of primary care centres built.  We must consider what happens in primary care centres and how many services and facilities can be provided in the community which, previously, had to be provided in acute hospitals.  I have strong views about this.  A crucial element of this is the new general practitioner contract.  We have not had a new GP contract in 44 years.  The patient values the relationship with the GP and the State must value that relationship as well.  We will get the negotiation for a new GP contract under way.  We also need to look at the provision of diagnostic equipment in the community.  The programme for Government refers to incentivising health care professionals who purchase and place diagnostic equipment in the community in order that patients can get a scan or X-ray in primary care centres or GP centres rather than having to go to the emergency department.<\/p>  <p>  I am keen to debunk some myths.  I am all in favour of constructive politics, but I get frustrated when people try to say that I represent something that I absolutely do not represent.  Deputy Louise O'Reilly is very constructive and I enjoy my engagements with her, but she referred to a charter of privatisation.  That is nonsense.  She referred to cuts to the overall health budget.  There are none.  We are giving an extra &euro;500 million today.  She referred to this representing bad news.  If we are going to have an honest debate, then let us have an honest debate.  This Government and I are committed to the development of the Irish public health service and to a singular vision for the development of that public health service in which access to services is based on need and not ability to pay.  That is what I want to work towards with this Oireachtas.  This Oireachtas is diverse but we need not necessarily be divided on all these issues.<\/p>  <p>  We have significant challenges but I believe that putting the additional funding into our health service today - provided the Oireachtas chooses to pass this Estimate - will enable the HSE to get on with the job of providing the services that people need and will enable us to make the necessary service improvements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600029#BB00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1466087700,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Rent Certainty Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1466088300,"counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600030#CC00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1466088300,"counter":170,"content":"<p>A division was claimed on Tuesday, 14 June 2016 on the question that the Rent Certainty Bill 2016 be now read a Second Time.
