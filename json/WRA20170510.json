While I acknowledge there is no one available body perfectly suited to fulfilling this function, the Irish Aviation Authority is considered to be best placed to perform this important regulatory role.  This is particularly relevant to the on-going requirement for aircraft noise assessment at the airport.  The second essential reform is to clarify the collaborative working and public consultation arrangements that have to be applied in this area.  It is important that there is clarity about how the legitimate concerns of residents about aircraft noise at the airport will be taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  Insofar as the question of primary legislation is concerned, deliberations are still ongoing with the Attorney General's Office regarding any elements that may necessitate primary legislation.  I hope you can appreciate that until concrete clarification in this area is achieved, I cannot give absolute information at this stage.  As you will now be keenly aware, officials in my Department are engaging in long and careful consideration of all advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  The immediate focus remains on the completion of the Statutory Instrument and any further issues which may need to be clarified by way of primary legislation will follow in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000070#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Tolls","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000070#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[22129\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000070#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will report on the way the &euro;100 million of VAT on tolls collected by the National Roads Authority and then Transport Infrastructure Ireland will be spent; the plans the agency has for these funds; and the implication this may have for his Department and the funding of transport projects over the coming period.","asker":"1367","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>\u200bThe statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into agreements relating to tolls on national roads is vested in Transport Infrastructure Ireland under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 as amended.<\/p><p>The background to the toll VAT issue is a ruling made by the Revenue Commissioners in May 2010, that the M50 and Dublin Port Tunnel tolls were to be subject to VAT from 1<sup>st<\/sup>July 2010.  Both the Toll Scheme and the Toll Bye-laws for the M50 and the Dublin Port Tunnel provide that the stated toll amounts are <i>&quot;inclusive of VAT if applicable<\/i>&quot;.  The toll was not, therefore, increased to take account of the Revenue ruling.  Rather 21% (subsequently increased in 2012 to 23%) of the toll received was deemed to be VAT and remitted to Revenue.  The cost of the VAT ruling was, therefore, absorbed by TII.  This in turn meant that TII had less funding available for the maintenance and improvement of the national road network.<\/p><p>TII appealed the Revenue VAT ruling which resulted in a referral to the European Court of Justice.  In its decision in January this year, the European Court of Justice concluded that VAT should not apply to tolls on the M50 and the Dublin Port Tunnel.  Following on from that decision, Revenue is considering its position in relation to the close out of the appeal process but has confirmed that TII is not a taxable person in relation to tolling.  Therefore VAT is not applicable to toll charges on the M50 and the Dublin Port Tunnel.  As a result TII is no longer remitting 23% of the toll charge to Revenue since April.<\/p><p>TII has informed me that, with the revenues now available to it again as a result of the Court decision, its board has decided to go ahead with the construction of a number of safety projects this year.

Rosslare Port and the Dublin to Rosslare rail line form part of the Comprehensive Network but are not on the Core Network.<\/p>  <p> \u00a0TEN-T is established under EU Regulation 1315\/2013.  The TEN-T network comprises the Comprehensive and Core Network, with the latter being the most strategic elements of the Comprehensive Network.  On the Island of Ireland, the Core Network comprises the\u00a0routes between Belfast, Dublin and Cork with a spur to Limerick and Shannon Foynes Port.  In Dublin and Cork, the Core Network includes ports and airports.\u00a0\u00a0The Core Network is essentially the transport links between core nodes.  In the case of Ireland, these nodes are the cities of Dublin, Cork and the maritime node of Shannon Foynes Port.  In Northern Ireland, the only node on the Core Network is Belfast.  To be a core port under the TEN-T Regulations, a port would need to meet criteria specified in European Commission planning methodology guidelines, including having 1% of European passenger or freight transhipment volumes per year.  Rosslare does not meet this threshold.  The Regulations provide that where a port meets the threshold after the coming into effect of the Regulations, the port can be\u00a0considered for designation as a port on the Core Network.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit offers many challenges to the port and logistics sectors.  In stakeholder consultations, the implications for the UK landbridge route was identified due to the significent portion of goods that transit the UK to EU and wider markets.  The possibility of enhanced or alternative direct maritime routes to the EU and wider international markets has been raised.\u00a0 As a result, a study is being planned to assess the implications for Irish trade of the UK Landbridge route and the current transport routes to EU and wider markets.

This will require primary legislation as well as\u00a0a Statutory Instrument under the European Communities Act 1972.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000073#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000073#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[21966\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000073#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason for selecting a device (details supplied) as the roadside kit for drug testing drivers; if there are restrictions on the use of this kit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>\u200bThe statutory responsibility for testing, approval and supply of devices for preliminary drug testing rests with the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.\u00a0 I have therefore referred the Question to the Bureau for direct reply.\u00a0 I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000073#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":119,"content":"<p>Question No. 79 answered with Question No. 66.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Improvement Schemes","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000073#WRE01050"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[21969\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000073#WRE01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to address the impact the lack of a local improvement scheme is having on the roads and laneways in rural areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) remains in place this year.\u00a0 This Scheme provides funding for private roads and laneways, the maintenance and improvement of which is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.\u00a0 While the LIS does not have a ring-fenced allocation in 2017, local authorities may use a proportion of State grant funding (15% of the Discretionary Grant) \u00a0for LIS should they wish to do so.\u00a0 All available grant funding for this year has\u00a0been allocated.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility.  I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard.  Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. <\/p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors.  This has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  The Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country,  as soon as possible, and on a phased basis.  This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date. <\/p>  <p>  Revaluation is an important instrument in addressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area.  The general outcome of revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances.  The current phase of the national revaluation programme, \"REVAL 2017\", covers revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century.  It also includes the second revaluation of South Dublin County Council area.  Revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards.<\/p>  <p>  Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation.  A dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the proposed valuation certificate.  The Valuation Office will consider any such representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.  If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to property used in the equine industry, I am advised by the Valuation Office that there has been some apparent confusion as to the ratability of certain elements of the industry.  The Valuation Act 2001 (Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b)) provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, are rateable.  The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's specific question, I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that no re-classification of properties from rateable status to exempt status has occurred within the general equine industry since the Valuation Act 2001 came into force on 2 May 2002.  The only element of the equine industry which satisfies the exemption provisions in Schedule 4 is the breeding of horses.  Buildings used for breeding of horses are classified as being of agricultural use and are \"farm buildings\" as defined in the Act.  Therefore these buildings are exempted from the payment of rates under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4.  On the other hand, buildings used for the training of racehorses, recreational equestrian purposes or livery premises are rateable under the Act because they are considered to be part of a commercial enterprise.  Such buildings would typically include stables for horses, covered riding arenas, tack rooms and ancillary buildings used to support the enterprise.  While acknowledging the important contribution which all elements of the equine industry make to the economy, there are no plans to reclassify these as exempt from rates.  To do so would be at variance with the provisions in the Valuation Acts which maintains the long-standing position that all property occupied and used for commercial enterprises are liable for rates.  Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other equally important services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist.  This could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000074#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000075#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[22191\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000075#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the expected reconfiguration of the traffic corps will be in place; if alcohol breath tests are still being undertaken and recorded on the PULSE system; if so, when this data will be made available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":155,"content":"<p>I have requested a Garda report on the matter referred to in the Deputy's question and will contact the Deputy directly on receipt of a Garda report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000075#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000075#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[22196\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000075#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Republican prisoners on remand in E Wing in Portlaoise; the length of time in each case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that as of Monday 8 May 2017, there were a total of 39 subversive prisoners in custody in Portlaoise.

This represented a strong year-on-year increase of 4.4 per cent (&euro;810 million).\u00a0 <\/p><p>In relation to the first quarter of 2017, the position is that income tax has performed steadily with annual growth of 1.4 per cent or &euro;62 million recorded in the year-to-end-March.

The shortfall against target is attributable across a range of income tax components contained within the\u00a0overall heading. <\/p><p>It is important to point out that income tax encompasses a broad range of elements, some of which are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments.  These include Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Life Assurance Exit Tax, Dividend Withholding\u00a0Tax, Professional Services Withholding\u00a0Tax and Back Duty.These payments can be 'lumpy' in nature and the timing of payments can vary from year to year.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of these specific components are having a drag on overall income tax receipts in the first quarter of 2017.<\/p><p>In relation to PAYE, the most\u00a0significant\u00a0component of overall income tax, closed quarter 1 of 2017, broadly in line with profile down just 2% (&euro;49 million), but up 6% (&euro;187 million) in year-on-year terms.<\/p><p>However,\u00a0the PAYE component\u00a0of USC came in 7% (&euro;63 million)\u00a0below\u00a0Revenue profile, which represents a year-on-year decrease of 12 per cent (&euro;107 million).  The Deputy will appreciate that a reduction in USC was expected in 2017 given the measures I introduced in Budget 2017.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is important to point out that in the last three budgets, I have introduced income tax measures with a full year cost of c. &euro;2.2 billion, of which &euro;1.8 billion related to USC changes, which were designed to encourage and reward work.

These include the distribution of a CD of the National Children's Choir signing our national anthem to every school some years ago, and the Taoiseach's launch of the Gael Linn 'Gaelbhratach' initiative earlier in 2015.

These flags were designed for internal display, or to be flown externally as best suited individual school circumstances and preferences.

In restoring capitation payments, where schools have introduced these cost effective principles, they will receive a premium capitation payment. <\/p><p>I believe that full transparency in relation to the use of any voluntary contributions is important information for parents to have.  The Parent and Student Charter will require every school to set out a financial statement, which will include information on how any voluntary contributions are used.<\/p><p>This is part of a suite of measures I am introducing, including the School Admissions Bill which will reform information and procedures around the process of school enrolment, and the commencement of Fitness to Teach, which allow a complaint to be made about a registered teacher to the Teaching to Council for the first time.<\/p><p>Circular letter 32\/2017 &lsquo;Measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs&rsquo; was published at the end of April and is available on my Departments website.<\/p><p>Following the implementation of the circular, school authorities will be required to adopt the following principles of cost-effective practice which will put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs:<\/p><p>-  All elements of a school uniform should be purchasable from various stores;<\/p><p>-  Only iron on or sew on crests should be used;<\/p><p>-  Wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.);<\/p><p>-  Provide parents with a list of all required items and indicate the likely costs of these required items at best value stores;<\/p><p>-  Provide a book rental scheme;<\/p><p>-  Phase out, between now and September 2018, the use of workbooks which cannot be reused;<\/p><p>-  Where an exclusive supply arrangement applies, it should be tendered for regularly and<\/p><p>-  The Board of Management in each school will have to review the cost of items which they require parents to purchase and to make this information available to the school community.<\/p><p>Schools will consult with parents on their views and ask for suggestions on cost reduction initiatives.  Parents will be asked for their views about school uniform costs, and other costs, through a questionnaire.<\/p><p>The Circular advises that all elements of a school uniform should be purchasable from various stores.  The Circular also advises that schools should consult with parents on their views and suggestions on cost reduction initiatives.  It is to be expected that in some schools there will be a divergence of opinions on what type of school uniform students should wear.  To ensure that the views of all parents are catered for, the Circular is requesting that schools provide parents with the option to purchase all elements of a school uniform from various stores.<\/p><p>Each of the main education partners where consulted during the preparation of this Circular.  As part of their submission, the National Parents Council &ndash; Primary included the findings of a survey they had conducted in 2016 with almost 5,000 parents.  The survey found that 81% of parents at primary level preferred a uniform that could be purchased in many shops rather than a uniform that is only available from a limited number of shops.<\/p><p>Looking at back to school costs, the Barnardos Schools Costs Survey for 2016 found that the average back to schools costs for a primary student in 4<sup>th<\/sup>class was &euro;395, and the equivalent figure for a 1<sup>st<\/sup>year post-primary student was &euro;775.  These figures include the cost of clothing, footwear, school books, classroom resources and voluntary contributions.<\/p><p>A 2016 survey by the Irish League of Credit Unions which looked at back to school costs found that:<\/p><p>-  81% of parents of school going children feel that the costs of sending their kids back to school is a significant financial burden and<\/p><p>-  31% of parents tend to get themselves into debt to cover this cost. <\/p><p>In relation to workbooks, the Circular advises that schools should phase out, between now and September 2018, the use of workbooks which cannot be reused.  The Circular does not ban the use of workbooks.<\/p><p>My Department is very aware of the appropriate contribution that well-designed learning activities can make in the classroom.  Resources that align well with the learning objectives of the curriculum (including workbook tasks) and which foster development of key skills and concepts are an important support for classroom learning and teaching and can help to consolidate students&rsquo; understanding. <\/p><p>Used skilfully, such activities can provide the teacher with valuable opportunities to promote independent learning; and for learners they can facilitate completion of differentiated activities or tasks at a number of levels.  When these kinds of activities are integrated well into classroom teaching and learning, they can provide rich learning opportunities especially when combined with focussed classroom talk and discussion.  By contrast, the negative uses of workbooks have also been highlighted in inspection reports, and appropriate recommendations made, in that regard, to schools and teachers. <\/p><p>My Department is committed to working with the Irish Educational Publisher&rsquo;s Association to ensure that progress can be made on developing workbooks that can be reused.<\/p><p>The Circular provides a period, between now and September 2018, for the phasing out of workbooks which cannot be reused.<\/p><p>My Department supports for the provision of school books are dealt with through the school book rental scheme.\u00a0 My Department provides funding of &euro;16m annually to schools to support the operation of school book rental schemes for students in all recognised Primary and Post-Primary schools within the Free Education Scheme.  The arrangements in relation to this scheme are set out in Circular 0046\/2013 which is published on my Department's website at: <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>In relation to capitation, the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented over the 3 year period 2016 to 2019 which include restoring capitation as resources permit. <\/p><p>Budget 2017 represents the start of a major programme of reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.<\/p><p>In relation to capitation funding this commitment remains a priority for me to address during the lifetime of the Action Plan.\u00a0<\/p><p>Primary schools are permitted to regard the capitation and ancillary grant as a combined grant.\u00a0 The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016 and &euro;5 in 2017 in order to enable primary schools implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.\u00a0 A similar type approach in relation to improvements in grant funding was applied, as appropriate, at post-primary level. \u00a0<\/p><p>Subject to the availability of funding, the Minor Works Grant is issued from the School Building Unit of my Department to all primary schools for use on the physical infrastructure of schools or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use including IT related equipment.  The schedule of grants captures all grants issued by Central Funds Unit and does not include the infrastructure-related grants issued by the Schools Building Unit.<\/p><p>In addition, I also wish to bring to the attention of the Deputy my announcement last week in relation to a further major investment in the summer works scheme (2016-2017). \u00a0This investment will see the allocation of &euro;47million for vital school projects which aim to upgrade mechanical, sanitation and roofs in school buildings.\u00a0 329 of the schools which will benefit from this round of funding are primary schools, while 109 are post primary schools.\u00a0 The Planning and Building Unit in my Department will be in contact shortly with all schools approved for grant aid under this year's Summer Works Scheme with further details and instructions on how to proceed. <\/p><p>The Action Plan for Education, which aims to make the Irish education and training service the best in Europe within a decade, puts a big priority on investment in school educational infrastructure.\u00a0 This announcement confirms the Government&rsquo;s continuing prioritisation of capital funding for school buildings which will enhance the learning and working environment for pupils and teachers.  In 2017, my Department will invest almost half a billion euro in school infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000078#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000079#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[22299\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000079#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason his Department has delayed for over 12 months in carrying out the road safety audit which is required for Cork County Council's roads department to install a pedestrian crossing for a school (details supplied); when this audit will be carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>The school to which the Deputy refers was\u00a0delivered under a Public Works Design &amp;amp; Build Contract which places the responsibility on the Contractor to submit the final compliance documents to the local authority. <\/p><p>Stage 1\u00a0and stage\u00a02 Road Safety Audits were undertaken\u00a0as part of the planning process. <\/p><p>My officials have sought\u00a0clarification from the Contractors design team\u00a0on the status of the Stage 3 Road Safety Audit.

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014.<\/p>  <p>  In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.<\/p>  <p>  Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are provided specifically to assist recognised schools to cater for pupils with disabilities, who have additional and significant care needs, in an educational context and where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in medical and other professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require additional adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education<\/p>  <p>  Once allocated, the deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All schools, including newly established schools\u00a0were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2017\/18 school year by 6th\u00a0April 2017.

A great deal of thought was put into the development of the junior cycle specifications in order to meet the needs of students.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, when developing the new Junior Cycle language specifications, has consulted with a wide range of stakeholders, including at a number of stakeholder consultation events.  The specifications were developed by a subject development group whose membership\u00a0included a number of practising teachers as well as other stakeholders.  They are designed to build on best practices in the system and to support the further development of effective teaching, learning and assessment practices.<\/p>  <p>  When studying Junior Cycle Irish, the aim is that students will be assisted to consolidate and deepen their understanding of the language and that they\u00a0will be encouraged to use the language effectively and confidently, both personally and in communicating with other users in the language.  They will also be encouraged to have an appreciation and respect for literature in Irish so that they may enjoy literature and benefit from it.  In this way Junior Cycle Irish seeks to\u00a0strengthen and develop the skills students bring to post-primary school and to provide a very effective link to learning in the language at Leaving Certificate.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the Junior Cycle, students will acquire and enhance their proficiency in the eight key skills of Junior Cycle, including the skills of communicating and being literate.  These skills are key to learning in every area of junior cycle and beyond.  They are closely linked to the skills required at senior cycle and those already developed for early childhood and primary education.<\/p>  <p>  A dual approach to assessment is presented.  The Junior Cycle will be underpinned by the further integration of formative assessment as a normal part of teaching and learning in classrooms, reflecting the effective practice that is already evident in many classrooms.  The introduction of Classroom-Based Assessments will emphasise the importance of formative assessment in supporting teaching and learning.  There will also be a final written examination.  In this way lesson content and format in the new Junior Cycle will facilitate deeper learning.  The implementation of the new Junior Cycle will bring a renewed focus on ensuring that all students are engaged and making progress in accordance with their potential. <\/p>  <p>  A review of senior cycle is planned to ensure that students will have the opportunity to build on the skills and learning that they have acquired in their studies in junior cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000079#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000080#WRM00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000080#WRM00150"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[22312\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000080#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has satisfied himself that current regulations and guidelines for wind energy development are fit for purpose; his plans to revise the current guidelines and regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":268,"content":"<p>Since May 2016, I have been liaising closely with my colleague, Minister Naughten, having regard to his responsibility for renewable energy policy, on the review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines relating to noise,\u00a0setback distance and shadow flicker, recognising the need to bring the review to a close\u00a0and provide\u00a0certainty on the matter to all stakeholders, local authorities, the energy sector and the wider community.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to finalise the Guidelines and on-going policy and legal developments in this area, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, is continuing to advance work on the Guidelines and related matters in order to bring the various issues to a conclusion as early as possible. <\/p>  <p>  I expect to be in a position to make a statement on the matter in the coming weeks, outlining the proposed revisions to the Guidelines and the timelines for implementation of the various elements shortly.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that as part of the overall review, and having regard to a recent ECJ Judgement on the Belgian\/Wallonian wind energy guidelines, it is proposed to undertake a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of the proposed revisions to the 2006 Guidelines before they come into effect.

This information was collated by the NDFEM resulting in the generation of the Report on the Programme to Review and Enhance Fire Safety in Local Authority Provided Traveller Accommodation, published on 21 September 2016. A copy of the report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>This report describes fire safety work which was undertaken in Local Authority provided Traveller accommodation across the country up to 1 July 2016.  In addition to the physical works, the report describes a parallel programme of community fire safety which has been undertaken incorporating training for key workers and engagement with community groups on fire safety awareness. <\/p><p>Recognising that what has been done is a first stage in a process which needs to be mainstreamed into on-going work programmes, the report made a number of recommendations to clarify recommended approaches and to embed the issue of fire safety in Traveller accommodation into future work programmes.  One of the key recommendations in the report is that, in order to mainstream fire safety as an on-going item, it should be included as a standing item at all Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee meetings (LTACC).  At the same time, it is recommended that oversight of the LTACCs&rsquo; role in relation to fire safety in Traveller accommodation be added to the brief of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC); the NTACC will seek regular updates that LTACCs are meeting this requirement.<\/p><p>Information regarding the details of the fire safety appraisals and the remedial work undertaken as part of the process, as well as information regarding any further fire safety enhancements carried out since 1 July 2016 and the fire and safety training that has taken place in Traveller accommodation units or with Traveller organisations, can be obtained directly from the relevant local authorities.  My Department is committed to providing funding for fire safety works carried out by the local authorities in adherence with the recommendations in the Report published in September 2016. <\/p><p>The capital allocation in respect of Traveller-specific accommodation for 2017 is &euro;9 million.  As part of the allocation process, my Department issued a Circular to Local Authorities requesting details of their proposed programme of works and specifically to include details of any fire safety works that will be undertaken in 2017, as a result of the Fire Safety Review conducted by local authorities.  Priority in terms of allocations is being given to all these works and local authorities will be notified shortly of their allocations.<\/p><p>Generally, in terms of the non-drawdown of funding, this is due to a range of issues associated with the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation projects.  Local authorities have cited a number of reasons including Traveller families refusing offers of accommodation, families only willing to live in certain areas where housing availability may be an issue, difficulties in obtaining Traveller agreement locally, planning and legal problems, difficulties in obtaining site access and anti-social behaviour.  These issues are closely monitored by my Department and the NTACC.  Local authorities are requested to submit quarterly profiles of their expenditure under the Traveller Accommodation Programme and this expenditure will be closely monitored against the profiles during the year.  Where expenditure does not meet the profiled amount, and where my Department is not informed of any reason for this non-drawdown of their allocation, funding will be reallocated to other schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000081#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Funding","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000081#WRN01100"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[22374\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000081#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 422 of 21 March 2017, if the pre-2014 figures include spending by local authorities from their own revenues on capital housing projects; and if not, the estimated amount each local authority spent from their own resources on capital housing projects for each year.","asker":"1217","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>The data provided in response to Question No. 422 of 21 March 2017\u00a0in respect of the period\u00a02004 to 2014, relates to direct exchequer funding by my Department to local authorities.\u00a0 The data for 2015 and 2016 also includes amounts self-funded by certain local authorities from surplus Local Property Tax (LPT) receipts.<\/p>  <p>  Local retention of LPT\u00a0commenced in 2015.\u00a0 Some local authorities received higher levels of funding in 2015 and 2016 from the Local Government Fund as a result of local retention of 80% of LPT when compared to the level of funding they previously received from General Purpose Grants.\u00a0 The Government decided that these local authorities would use this surplus funding in two ways, with a portion available for their own discretionary purposes and the remainder, if any, to fund some local services in the Housing and Roads areas for which they previously received Central Government funding.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities may also decide to fund certain capital projects from within their own resources, in line with\u00a0the authority's\u00a0agreed budget.\u00a0 The amounts expended annually are primarily a matter for the local authority concerned and that particular data is not readily available within my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000081#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000081#WRN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[22375\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000081#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of new apartments and apartment buildings that have been completed and the number for which planning permission has been sought since the introduction of the new national apartment planning guidelines reducing the cost of apartment building; and if his Department or a body under its aegis has undertaken a review of the impact of these new guidelines on reducing costs and accelerating apartment development.","asker":"1217","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>The document &ldquo;Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments &ndash; Guidelines for Planning Authorities&rdquo; was published in December 2015 and had legislative and policy effect from January 2016.

The purpose of the insolvency payments scheme is to pay outstanding wage-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.<\/p><p>The total expenditure on the redundancy and insolvency payments schemes, including payments for insolvent companies, for the years 2014 to 2016 is outlined in the table below.  Expenditure fell from &euro;88.2 million in 2014 to &euro;38.3 million in 2016.<\/p><p>When a payment is made from the redundancy and insolvency payments schemes from the Social Insurance Fund a debt is raised against the employer, which is reported in the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) financial accounts.  The total employer debt to the Social Insurance Fund at 31 December, 2016 stood at &euro;459 million.  Almost two-thirds of the debt originated during the recession years of 2008 to 2013 and three-quarters of current outstanding employer debt is in respect of insolvent companies &ndash; companies who are no longer trading.<\/p><p>Debt relating to insolvent companies is unlikely to be recoverable as the reason that the Department stepped in to pay the redundancy payments to employees is that the employer did not have the means itself to cover these payments.  Once a business enters the liquidation process the Department&rsquo;s recourse is then with the liquidator.  Notwithstanding that at best only a partial recovery of the debt can be expected as any assets are liquidated the full debt remains on the books of the Department until the winding-up process is completed, which on average will take six or seven years.<\/p><p>The Department has a dedicated debt management unit in the redundancy and insolvency section which has responsibility for managing employer debt in line with the Department&rsquo;s debt management policy.  The debt is managed through the department&rsquo;s Debt Recovery and Accounting System (DRAS), which issues automated reminders and annual statements on outstanding debt.<\/p><p>In most cases recovery of debt is pursued with liquidators through the liquidation process.  In cases where employers are not insolvent and are still trading the Department engages directly with the employers concerned.  In these cases the Department is mindful that an overly aggressive process in pursuing debt with companies that are still trading, but are nevertheless in a financially precarious position, might result in those companies being pushed into an insolvency situation which could result in further job losses.  Accordingly the unit engages with employers to establish the situation on a case by case basis and seeks to recover debt on a mutually agreed basis, including setting up repayment by instalment where appropriate.  The unit has a staff of six and the total cost of running the unit (including management costs) is c &euro;310,000 per annum.

Processing claims by leave commencement date order ensures that those whose maternity leave is impending or has already started receive priority. <\/p>  <p>  The delays have been caused by a combination of staffing and operational issues.  The Department has recently experienced a turnover of staff in the Buncrana office which processes maternity claims.  They have also experienced challenges in recruiting replacement staff and once recruited it takes time for staff to be fully trained.  In relation to the operational issues, a new IT system has recently been introduced and has taken time to bed in fully.<\/p>  <p>  To alleviate delays, additional staff  have been assigned and staff are working overtime.  I want to assure customers that every effort is being made to ensure all claims are processed as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Once a claim has been awarded, and where the leave has already commenced, payment issues on the following Monday and this payment will also include any arrears due to the customer at that point.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department also facilitates online applications for maternity benefit and an automated decision is made where the customer submits all necessary information and where the detail provided can be validated.  I would ask the Deputy to encourage women who are planning maternity leave to use this channel, if possible, as it provides the most effective method of applying for maternity benefit.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000083#WRP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Relocation","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000083#WRP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[22223\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000083#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 178 of 6 April 2017, the training times for administrative staff up to grade 5; his views on the appropriate timeframe to train these persons; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that temporary grade 3 staff are being employed in positions in which permanent staff members should be reallocated.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my response to PQ No. 178 of 6 April where I advised him that there is no definitive time period associated with the training of new staff as it is very much dependent on the area of work and the training needs associated with same.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question in relation to Grade 5 and temporary Grade 3 staff, I wish to advise the Deputy that there are no such grades in the civil service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000083#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000083#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[22224\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000083#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision in respect of an appeal will issue in the case of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all of the available evidence including that adduced at the oral hearing, has decided to disallow the appeal of the person concerned.

It is used in North America and, increasingly, in Europe as a diagnosis for patients with persistent pain, neurocognitive symptoms, fatigue, or all of these symptoms, with or without clinical or serologic evidence of previous early or late Lyme disease.<\/p>  <p>  Chronic Lyme disease lacks an accepted clinical definition, and in practice the term has been applied to a wide variety of patients.

","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":464,"content":"<p>As I stated in my previous response, there is no scientific evidence that the HPV vaccine causes any long-term illness.  The safety of all medicines, including vaccines, is not a trivial matter and there are robust regulatory and monitoring systems in place at both EU and national level to ensure that the medicines we use are safe and effective.   <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, with healthcare professionals and patients encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.    <\/p>  <p>  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the WHO and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies.  The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the medicine has caused the observed effect, which may have also been caused by the disease being treated, a new disease the patient developed, or by another medicine that the patient is taking.  Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of monitoring the safety of medicines, new information on a possible risk is called a signal.  Signals may arise from various data sources, including spontaneous reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies.  Once a signal has been identified, investigations are undertaken to consider the likelihood that a medicine may have caused or contributed to the effect, try to identify risk factors and estimate the frequency of occurrence.  Following the assessment, a decision on the most appropriate regulatory action is taken by the competent authorities.  The regulatory action is communicated to healthcare professionals, patients and the general public through established channels, and timelines reflect the degree of urgency.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet).  Vaccination related events, occurring at the time of vaccine administration, such as syncope (faints) has been among the most commonly reported effects.  Other commonly reported symptoms include gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.<\/p>  <p>  There is no indication or signal of a causal link between the symptoms suffered by the young women and administration of the HPV vaccine.  However, this does not mean that their symptoms do not have a physical basis and it is important that any conditions they may have are properly diagnosed and receive appropriate treatment.  The families of any girls suffering symptoms following HPV vaccination are advised to should seek medical advice from their family doctor in the normal manner and be referred to consultants familiar with these syndromes for diagnosis and management.  <\/p>  <p>  More than 80 million girls and women worldwide have now received these vaccines, and in some European countries they have been given to 90% of the age group recommended for vaccination.  Use of these vaccines is expected to prevent many cases of cervical cancer (cancer of the neck of the womb, which is responsible for over 20,000 deaths in Europe each year) and various other cancers and conditions caused by HPV. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the false claims have led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine from 87% in 2014\/15 to 72% in 2015\/16.  This means that a large cohort of girls is now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000088#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Access","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000088#WRU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[22254\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000088#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the healthcare facilities that are providing access to diagnostic services for GMS patients in Munster; the reason some facilities have been approved to provide diagnostic services while other general practices that have the facilities to do so have not been approved to offer such services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000088#WRU02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000089#WRV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[22261\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000089#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal can expect to receive an appointment at Letterkenny University Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":471,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The terms of the agreement, which has now been published, provides for the establishment of a new company - The National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC (limited by shares)&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  The new company will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.  This independence will be assured by the reserved powers which are set out in the agreement and will be copperfastened by the golden share which will be held by the Minister for Health of the day.  These reserved powers can only be amended with the unanimous written approval of the Directors and with the approval of the Minister for Health.  <\/p>  <p>  The Board of the new NMH will comprise 9 directors; four nominated by SVHG, four by NMH, including the Master, and one will be an international expert in obstetrics and gynaecology.  The international expert will be chosen from a list of candidates drawn up by SVHG and the NMH Trust.  They will be assessed by a Selection Committee, chaired by the SVHG Clinical Director, and the other members will include the SVHG CEO and a representative from the NMH Trust.  Any proposed nominee will be appointed by the Selection Committee after consultation with the SVHG Nominations Committee, and the NMH Directors on the Board of NMH at Elm Park DAC (limited by shares).<\/p>  <p>  Already, there are existing dual staff appointment arrangements between the two hospitals and I expect that such arrangements will continue following the relocation of the NMH. <\/p>  <p>  The agreement ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the new NMH without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  In that regard, I welcome the confirmation by the Board of St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group that any medical procedure, which is in accordance with the laws of this State, will be carried out at the new hospital.  <\/p>  <p>  Now that the planning application for the development has been submitted we must now turn our focus to the legal mechanisms necessary to complete the project.  The hospital will be publicly funded, built on lands in the ownership of the St. Vincent&rsquo;s and operated by the new company.  Over the next few weeks I will meet with both hospitals and will consider further the legal mechanisms necessary to absolutely protect the State's considerable investment in the hospital, including the issue of ownership of the new facility.  I have indicated that, prior to the HSE entering into any construction contract, I will formally sanction the necessary arrangements to ensure that the facilities are legally secured on an on-going basis for the delivery of publicly funded maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services commitments.  I should add that over the years we have made very significant capital investment in voluntary hospitals, and such facilities have always continued to be used for the delivery of publicly funded healthcare as intended. <\/p>  <p>  I intend to report to Government on this project at the end of May.  At that stage I expect to have further details on the legal and other arrangements envisaged and will make this information available publicly.  This will allow for the necessary clarity well in advance of contractual or other commitments being entered into in respect of this project.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like reaffirm my commitment to this hugely important project.  The facilities at Holles St are no longer fit for purpose.  It is also acknowledged that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services.  I look forward to working with all stakeholders to deliver the new National Maternity Hospital which is so badly needed to provide women and infants with modern healthcare facilities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000090#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services Provision","counter":503,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000090#WRW01050"},{"type":"question","counter":504,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[22323\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000090#WRW01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to introduce supports for persons in County Longford who are suffering from Parkinson's disease.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":505,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.  In this context it was not possible to include a range of projects in the Plan given the overall funding envelope available.  As regards the possibility of additional funding within the Plan period, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has started the Capital Plan review and has indicated that the additional capital funding for allocation totals &euro;2.6billion.  My Department is seeking additional funding for a package of measures, including the development of a project pipeline for road schemes.  While there is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector, there are a multitude of possible national, regional and local projects around the country, the cost of which far exceed available funding and unfortunately, this means that only a limited number can be put forward for funding.  The final decisions on allocations are, however, matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Government as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000096#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Services Provision","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000096#WRCC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[22382\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000096#WRCC00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if consideration has been given to enhancing the capacity of the commuter rail network with particular reference to the need to ensure the availability of convenient and rapid commuter transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":620,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[22383\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000096#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he has examined the rail services network in County Kildare with particular reference to the need to increase capacity at various rail stations thereby alleviating road traffic congestion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":621,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.<\/p><p>The issues raised are matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in conjunction with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and I have forwarded the Deputy's questions to the NTA for direct reply.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. As a result new terms and conditions were introduced for enlisted personnel enlisting after 1994.  Arising from a claim by PDFORRA, a new set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<\/p><p>The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis.  Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:- <\/p><p>-  Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.<\/p><p>-  Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<\/p><p>-  Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six. <\/p><p>The first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, was felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks in 2015. <\/p><p>A claim was received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.
