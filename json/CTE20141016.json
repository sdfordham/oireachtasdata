No.<\/p><p>  Turning to correspondence received since our meeting on 9 October 2014.  Item  3B.1 is correspondence from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on correspondence from Carmel Thornton regarding Eirgrid to be noted and published.  Item 3B.2 is correspondence received from Mr. Michael Murphy, Westport, Co. Mayo on Mayo Greenway  to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have already received correspondence regarding Greenway development, so perhaps we could ask the Department to come back with a coordinated response.<\/p><p>  Item 3B.3 is correspondence dated 8 October 2014 from Mr. Tom Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on matters relating to Mr. John Shine.  This is a matter to be noted.  This matter is directly connected with the issue of today's proceedings and legal proceedings against Mr. Shine, who has been in correspondence with the PAC, have been initiated by the State and therefore are precluded from today's meeting.<\/p><p>  Item 3B.4 is correspondence received from Mr. Jack Harvey on misuse of state moneys to be noted.  The matters raised in the correspondence are not for the PAC and Mr. Harvey will be informed accordingly.  3B.5 is correspondence received from Ms Majella Kavanagh, Horsecare Ireland, on a proposal for identification and deselection of equine to be noted.  This is a policy matter in the first instance and we will seek a note from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the operation of the current policy to deal with unwanted horses.

Six centres have been designated under the Act - Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveal and Killybegs.  Overall responsibility for management operation of the centres rests with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Its responsibilities under the 1968 Act include the production of annual accounts.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General is required under the 1968 Act to audit and report on the accounts of the centres.  The 2010 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Accounts of the Public Services outlined difficulties in invoicing harbour centre income that had arisen in the period from October 2007 to April 2008.  This occurred while responsibility for managing the centres was being transferred from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The invoicing problems led to long delays in the preparation of the 2007 draft accounts, which required amendment to take account of the amounts invoiced late.  The audit opinion on the 2007 annual accounts of the centres reported that there were inadequacies in the books of account and accounting records maintained by the Department and outlined other difficulties encountered by the audit.<\/p><p>  Significant further delays arose in the preparation by the Department of annual accounts of the centres for the period 2008 to 2011.<\/p> <p>The audits of those accounts were completed in March 2014.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was satisfied that the final accounts were properly presented in accordance with the stated accounting policies and principles.  However, his opinion was qualified because proper books of account were not kept during those years.  Accounting entries in the books were not made in a timely manner, with the result that the books and records would not have enabled the financial position of the centres to be determined with reasonable accuracy throughout the period, and the books and records did not enable the annual accounts to be readily and properly audited.<\/p><p> In addition to delays in accounts production for the years 2007 to 2011, and the late billing of income, the special report identified a number of other shortcomings in the financial management of the harbour centres, including the following: Of the &euro;1. 2 million in harbours dues billed in arrears, approximately &euro;0.5 million remained to be recovered at the report date, with half of this amount owed by one customer which is the subject of a Supreme Court appeal.  Delays led to &euro;210,000 in harbour dues not being billed and deemed irrecoverable by the Department.  A flat charge was applied for landings by some foreign vessels rather than the various charges set out in the legislation - based on a review of a sample of vessels, it is estimated that an additional &euro;100,000 could have been billed had the official charge rates been applied.  Substantial amounts of rent continued to be billed in arrears up to 2012 - in one case, a tenant had not been billed for eight years leading to the build up of arrears of &euro;264,000.  There was a failure to bill for rent on a property which was the subject of a sales process that commenced in 1993 - a sales price of &euro;317,000 was agreed and a deposit of 50% was received at that time, but the sale had not been completed at the time of the report.  There has been a substantial build-up in the amount owed to centres &ndash; this came to just over &euro;5 million at the end of June 2013.  There have been difficulties in generating a return from the use of car parking facilities in some centres.<\/p><p> The report also highlights particular accounting principles adopted in the preparation of the accounts which do not accord with up-to-date accounting practice, such as the recognition of capital assets and depreciation.  It sets out a number of recommendations in regard to the format and content of the accounts, the governance arrangements for the centres, improving controls and monitoring procedures and the setting of targets to reduce the extent of arrears.  The Accounting Officer will be in a position to update the committee on the progress in implementing these recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600004#F02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Harkness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413451200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harkness.

I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which contains a number of very valuable recommendations, some of which relate to historical issues that had already been proactively addressed by the Department.<br\/>The fishery harbour centres were established as a necklace of harbours around the coast of Ireland to promote and develop fishing activities.  The waters around Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU.  On average, an estimated 1.3 million tonnes of fish are taken by the fishing fleets of EU member states from the waters around Ireland each year.<br\/>The fishery harbour centres were and are being developed to reflect the need for this State to facilitate larger Irish and foreign vessels fishing in deeper waters to land into and operate out of Ireland.  They are also developed to meet the standards expected of a modern seafood producing and processing industry.  The Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968 sets down parameters and the framework for the fishery harbour centres but since 1968 there have been many developments in public administration and these have also have been incorporated into the management, development and operation of the harbours.<br\/>The then Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food took responsibility for a number of marine functions, including the fishery harbour centres, on 19 October 2007.  To facilitate an orderly transfer of functions, the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources retained responsibility for certain financial aspects in the harbours, including invoicing, up until April 2008.  A report was commissioned to further develop a coherent strategy for development, management and modernisation of the harbours. The Burke-McIver &quot;Business Plans for the Development of the Fishery Harbour Centres&quot; report, which provided an assessment of the harbours and a development path to be followed over a five-year period, was published on 25 February 2009.  All of the recommendations in the report that were implementable in the prevailing economic climate were subsequently introduced.<br\/>It is true to say that a number of fishery harbour centre legacy issues, particularly a High Court case challenging the rates and charges order, some property cases and a staffing issue in one harbour, have, following due process, taken longer than anticipated to bring to conclusion.  Since 2007, a number of reports have been produced by management in the relevant division of my Department and by the Department's internal audit unit, which precipitated a very significant programme of change that has been implemented in the fishery harbour centres in the intervening years.  The sea fisheries administration division, based in Clonakilty, was configured into four specialist units to target the specific areas of debt management, property management, operational management and capital development programmes.<br\/>Specific measures pursued by the property unit included the establishment of a detailed database of the property portfolio, the appointment, following tender, of an outsourced property valuation service to carry out legally required rent reviews and new valuations together with the establishment of a dedicated legal resource within the Office of the Chief State Solicitor working exclusively on the backlog of legacy property issues in the harbours.<br\/>On the financial management front, a new rates and charges order was introduced in 2012.  The order was previously revised in 2003 but for a number of reasons, not least the legal challenge to the Minister's <i>vires<\/i>mentioned earlier, the introduction of a new order was delayed.  The new order modernised the charging regime in the harbours and addressed some anomalies.<br\/>The Department resourced the dedicated debt recovery unit to address the increasing debt profile that had developed in the harbours and a robust debt recovery policy with a toolbox of measures, some specific to fishery harbour centre customers, was approved and continues to be implemented with success by the debt recovery unit.  Income generated in the harbours increased by in excess of &euro;1.2 million in 2013 compared with 2007, an increase of 30%.  In the same period, the level of debt has remained static despite the economic climate and a period of serious financial pressure for our customer base.  Importantly, the age profile of our debt now suggests, in general, a preponderance of late payers rather than non-payers.<br\/>In the period 2010 to 2013, the number of fish landings by foreign vessel at the fishery harbour centres has increased, from 1,048 in 2010 to 1,305 in 2013, while in the same period the number of fish landings by vessels on the Irish sea-fishing boat register has increased, from 5,086 in 2010 to 5,216 in 2013.  The total value of fish landed, by Irish and foreign vessels, has increasing, from &euro;137 million to &euro;229 million, over the same period.  New systems and procedures were implemented to strengthen the cross-checking of invoicing for services in the harbours.  Initially, an interim manual system was introduced followed by a bespoke computer application developed specifically to mitigate risk of error in generating invoices.<br\/>Staffing resources, which had diminished to unsustainable levels, were addressed by the appointment of new harbour masters to vacant posts while also assigning at least one clerical support person to each harbour to assist the harbour master and provide a separation of financial roles in accordance with best practice.  This was managed against the backdrop of the public service recruitment embargo.<br\/>Following the resourcing at harbour level, a significant change in the management structure of harbours was drawn up and approved by our Department's management advisory committee, MAC.  This changed management structure resulted in the achievement of significant efficiencies, particularly by eliminating a traditional dual reporting stream and the closer alignment of operational management, harbour development and health and safety and risk management.  Following the restructuring, each harbour is now managed at local level by a Department engineer, who, working with the harbour master and staff in the harbour, is responsible for the operational and billing management and development of the harbour, while strategic management, debt recovery, audit and executive support are provided centrally to all the harbours from the marine unit in our Clonakilty offices.  A fishery harbour centre management committee of senior officials is responsible for integrated management on an ongoing basis.<br\/>The harbour users forums, which were created by the Department after taking over the running of the harbours, meet on a regular basis in each harbour.  These harbour users forums provide an excellent platform for sharing ideas with our customers and users and obtaining stakeholder feedback.<br\/>As I am sure the Chairman will agree, the management of the fishery harbour centres has been enhanced progressively in the years since the Department took over.  My management team continues to review our policies, procedures, structures and systems and in this context, I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which provides us with some further opportunities to enhance the service delivery model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600005#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1413451800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran.

I thank Mr. Moran for the statement.<\/p><p>  I understand the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took over responsibility for the fishery harbour centres in 2007 from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We have two documents before us, namely, a statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Buckley, relating to the audit for 2007, and Special Report 82 relating to the period 2008 to 2011.  It appears from reading both the report and the statement that the Comptroller and Auditor General is very critical in both instances in what he finds.  Mr. Buckley has indicated in the first instance that in his opinion proper books of account were not kept during the year, that is, 2007.  Effectively, that is the same response we get in 2014 with regard to the period from 2008 to 2011, namely, that proper books of account were not kept.  There is a litany of failures outlined.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Harkness from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office already detailed many of the inadequacies including the billing that took place retrospectively amounting to &euro;1.2 million; the &euro;2 million in rent that was also billed retrospectively; and the &euro;5 million that was owed to the centres in June 2013.  The parking fees, which were to be a stream of income both in Rossaveal and in Howth in particular, materialised in a limited fashion.  The result is that 75% of all the income coming from the State and the amount of income for current running costs was very limited coming from the actual harbour dues, charges, rental income and parking fees.<\/p><p>  Considering how critical the Comptroller and Auditor General was of his predecessor Department with regard to the accounts for 2007, and that there were proposals for a variety of mechanisms to be put in place to ensure this was dealt with afterwards, why is the situation so bad in regard to the report before us today?  Why was there such a delay in producing audited accounts for 2008 to 2011?  It is 2014 before we have anything in that regard.  Previously, it was 2011 before we had the figures for 2007.  When are we likely to get statements for 2012 and 2013?  Are there still flaws in the process?  How can we be guaranteed that in regard to what have been identified as serious flaws in the operation of the six centres under Mr. Moran's jurisdiction and for which he has responsibility for the financial statements in the last analysis, proper oversight is being exercised by his Department?  Can he confirm that we will not see a Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2012 and 2013 that is damning of that oversight and with regard to the mechanism in operation not being satisfactory to deal with the problems that were encountered and the difficulties identified in 2011 by Mr. Buckley in his report, and those identified in Mr. McCarthy's report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600006#H00400","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413451800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy's questions, and there is a lot of validity to them.

I thought it was switched off.<\/p><p>  The reports covered the period of the transfer of responsibility for the fisheries harbours from one Department to another.  I am confident that based on our response to our own internal audit reports and to our restructuring of the way we dealt with them, and bearing in mind the very useful contribution of the Comptroller and Auditor General, in the period as we go on there will be a dramatic improvement and, I hope, an elimination of any of the difficulties and the flaws that were being identified.<\/p><p>  The management of the fishery harbours is a difficult enough area.  That is not to say that any of the shortcomings in the past can be excused, but acting on each of the recommendations in the report, as we have done - I agree with many of them, if not all - we have moved on that process quite considerably.  I will give one example which illustrates that.  In terms of the way in which retrospective billing would have arisen, a new system was put in place and a new approach taken to measuring the landings of fish.  That was done after we took it over.  Arising from that we were in a position to discover discrepancies and were able to bill backwards in regard to fish that had been landed.  That gave rise to a certain number of the retrospective bills.<\/p><p>  On the property side, one of the valid recommendations is that there would be an up-to-date valuation and property register, and that is in hand.  We have incorporated into our system automatic billing for rents and so on.  That means it is happening on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>  In terms of the way in which it has developed over the period, and the submission of the reports was delayed for all these reasons, if we look at the structural improvements that have taken place in the handling of this process, I am confident this issue will not arise in future reports on the fishery harbours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600006#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1413451800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Moran tell me when we can expect the 2012 and 2013 statements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600006#H00800","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413451800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>The accounts for 2012 will be on an accruals basis.

The total value of fish landed, by Irish and foreign vessels, has increasing <i>sic<\/i> from &euro;137m to &euro;229m over the same period.<\/blockquote>There are many vessels using the ports.  There has been under-billing in many cases.  A flat informal charge was used instead of the statutory charge.  Yesterday I read in the newspaper about a skipper from Rossaveal in Galway landing his catch in Killybegs, another of the centres mentioned here, who has been convicted of under-billing, under-declaring his catch to a considerable degree.  A &euro;40,000 penalty was imposed on him.<br\/>With all those vessels entering the ports and an inadequate, lax system of billing and of charging dues in the ports, there is potential for the loss of a significant amount of funding due to the State.  What mechanisms has the Department put in place to deal with that?  What mechanisms does it have in place to ensure that vessels coming into the port carry fish and are not trafficking people or drugs etc., if there is such a lax system for dealing with foreign and Irish vessels? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600007#J01100","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413452400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>There are some very interesting points and questions there.  The billing for harbour services and the counting of fish are two very important aspects of control of fisheries.  They are absolutely integrated and linked.  The whole EU quota system by which we place such great store is based on accurate counting of fish that is landed and the proper implementation of the quotas.  When there are breaches of that it must be, and is, taken very seriously.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to the recent case reported today in the newspapers.  That related to 2003-4.  In 2007 the SFPA was set up specifically to control the landing of fish, count the fish and ensure there is nothing over quota or illegally landed, and it is doing its job.<\/p><p>  In taking over the fishery harbours we set up a system whereby we could computerise and have seamless transfer of the fish counting mechanism to the harbour charging mechanism.  One pays on the basis of one&rsquo;s landings.  In the past that was done manually.  We are confident that there is a seamless transfer of that information.  The Deputy is absolutely right, this is right from a quota fish-counting point of view when one thinks of the value to local economies and at national level.  It is also crucial for revenue raising by the State and the use of these valuable harbours and the services provided in them. <\/p><p>  The Deputy asked how we deal with foreign vessels.  A separate arrangement applied to them from, I think, 2003.<\/p> <p>If a foreign vessel came in and it was a couple of weeks before the actual landing was counted and so on, that boat would be gone and it would be very hard to ensure that the service would be properly paid for, although the fish might be counted.   Bills would end up being sent to boats that are here, there and everywhere.  The decision was taken back then to apply a flat charge of &euro;250 originally.  That was outside the structure of the rates and charges order that was then in place.  At the time, it was decided that was a fair, equitable and pragmatic way of dealing with it.  When the order was last renewed, this flat charge was incorporated but at a higher rate, in what was again probably a balanced reflection of the cost.  The charge has now gone up to &euro;400.<\/p><p> This is at the kernel of fish control and of charging - Deputy Costello is right.  The Department and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority pay huge attention to it.  As I said, it relates to the counting of fish, which is absolutely fundamental to the operation of the common fisheries policy and particularly to enhancing the value and quantity of landings here.  It is also the basis on which we charge for use of the harbours, and these charges go into the fund to develop the harbours and so on.  We pay great attention to that and I am pleased that the link between the landings and the charges is seamless because that is the only way that it can be controlled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600007#J01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413453000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>The question is, though, if there is a statutory charge, how can one not impose it?

They claimed they could not operate on the basis of the 2003 order because they wanted to pay their bill when they arrived - sell their fish, pay the bill and leave.  The actual way in which the 2003 order operated was that the landed amount was returned in the logbook.  It would be about a month or six weeks before that would be collated in the system, and then the bill would be generated.  At this point they would be back in Spain, Norway, France or wherever.  They said that they were no longer going to land into Ireland.  That would be a loss of business and employment to the country.  It was and remains a national policy desire to increase the number of foreign landings into Ireland; perhaps 75% of the fish that is caught in proximity to Ireland is not landed into Ireland.

The 2003 order would have been reviewed but there was an ongoing legal challenge to it on a different matter relating to the vires of the Minister's power to set up and charge in the harbours. This matter is now going before the Supreme Court.  It was envisaged that the 2003 order would be changed but this was not done until 2012 because of the legal challenge.  An arrangement was arrived at in order to keep this business in the country, which was to charge the flat rate of &euro;250, as had been done previously in Dingle.  When the order was changed, the flat rate was raised to &euro;400 and made available to all vessels on a non-discriminatory basis.  It is a single-point charge with higher payment compliance than any other form of charge and it is open to Irish and foreign vessels, but is only taken up by the foreign vessels.  The Irish vessels use the annual arrangement.  There would have been a decline in revenue had this not been available; these vessels would not have been coming and the downstream employment would have been lost consequentially.<\/p><p>  When the opportunity came to re-format the statutory instrument the charge was raised, but it has remained as a single entry point charge.  It has been used since and the number of vessels coming in has continued to increase.  The focus on a loss of revenue is a very narrow picture.  In fact, the business was retained and it has been possible to increase the charge since.  The volume of business has grown in parallel with it and compliance is very high.  <\/p><p>  It has to do with the way in which a vessel operates a fishing trip.  The crew and the expenses are taken out of the catch when it is sold on the quayside.  Therefore the expenses include the harbour dues; they are deducted out of the catch and ultimately the crew gets paid a division of what is left.  For a fishing vessel to operate, it needs to know what its charges and costs are going to be in order to divvy up the outcome of the trip.  These Spanish, French and other vessels were not willing to come in to Ireland and pay a month or six weeks later for something that had occurred on the trip.  We have to take into account the nature of the business we were trying to attract and retain and grow, and put that charge into the wider context.  It was an awkward situation, and it was not possible to change the order instantly because of the legal challenge.  The charge is now higher, it is paid and the business is growing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600008#K01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cecil Beamish"},{"type":"speech","time":1413453000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I wanted to ask one other question.

That division in 2006 and 2007 was restaffed and decentralised and the decentralised staff subsequently in 2007 were transferred into the Department of Agriculture.  The accounts section of the DCMNR, which was in Castlebar, did not transfer, not did any other central support, valuation, legal or any of those sections transfer to the Department of Agriculture.  That all stayed in the DCMNR and the accounts and billing part of the DCMNR, which was in Castlebar, retained that function until the middle of April 2008.  The reason it retained that function was that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, as it was at the time, was run on an Agresso system while the Department of Agriculture was run on a SAP system.  The section could not be moved one day from an Agresso to a SAP system, they had to build into the SAP system an ability to take over the accounting.  In parallel, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, as it was then, transferred its accounts section, which was in Castlebar, to Cavan during the same time.

I will go back 14 years and refer to the studies and reports that were done in conjunction with Mr. Moran's Department and other Departments over that time span.  In many cases, Mr. Moran and his officials will have been aware of reports, recommendations and findings but it is useful to go back and list recommendations and findings to show the lack of activity.<\/p><p>  In 2000, KPMG drew up a consulting report - a technical and socio-economic review of infrastructural requirements in Dunmore East and the significant need for development of the harbour.  This was followed in 2003 by a Kirk McClure Morton report, which was commissioned by the Department then dealing with this - it dealt with preliminary designs and an environmental impact assessment was planned.  It was found that the existing harbour was too small and did not permit proper development so the report was, effectively, a reiteration of the previous one.  In 2004, a public consultation process commenced and planning permission for the fishery harbour centre was granted in 2005.  In 2006, some &euro;300,000 was provided for design and another &euro;300,000 was provided for site investigation.  The first phase was to begin in 2008 but then the economy collapsed, as we all know.<\/p><p>  In 2007, Poseidon Aquatic Resource Management Limited was commissioned to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and found a number of weaknesses.  The harbour was deemed to be very old and in need of a significant upgrade.  No significant dredging had taken place for many years at that stage and it is now 22 years since such dredging.  Most of the large vessels had to steam to Cork or Howth to dock and there was no safe access to the shore for yachts.  These findings are from 2007.<\/p><p>  The five-year business plan for Dunmore East was proposed to increase fish landings to 9,100 tonnes and grow harbour dues and revenue to &euro;267,500 by 2013.  As the witnesses know, on 20 March 2014 the Department sanctioned maintenance dredging in Dunmore East.  Consulting engineers finalised tender documents and a completed tender package was advertised on 24 May.  The tender submission stage ended on 7 July 2014 but we have now learned there is a delay.  The &euro;4 million involved in this relates only to the dredging of the inner basin - the idea of overall harbour redevelopment is unmentioned.  In 2013, some &euro;827,000 was made available and &euro;450,000 of that was to widen and extend the slipway at the west wharf.  Some &euro;220,000 was for the extension of the fishery harbour building.<\/p><p>  The Chairman spoke of legacy issues and if one goes back over the past 14 years on the Dunmore East issue, there is a legacy of bitter disappointment when it comes to what the Government promised and what it actually delivered, or not delivered.  Dredging was announced earlier this year but what is the situation on the tender process?  When will dredging commence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600014#Q01900","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413456600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and the Chairman.

I understand the Deputy's point on historical investment levels but between 2006 and 2013 some &euro;5.4 million was invested in Dunmore East.  It is a fine harbour but the Deputy is absolutely correct that there is a dredging issue.  He is also correct that we intended to spend money on dredging in 2014 and allocated &euro;4 million in the capital programme for that purpose.<\/p> <p>We ran into a difficulty with the tender in relation to that on the issue of value for money.

Further sampling and analysis is being done and in greater detail on all the sediments; one of the issues is the level of contamination in some of the sediment areas.  We are trying to see if we can more precisely define in the tender documentation the extent of the contamination and the appropriate treatments that would be requirements for different elements of the dredging.  In that way, we hope to achieve more cost-efficient tender bids that can be advanced and proceeded with.

If I went to the other five ports and fishery harbour centres, I would probably find that the equivalent amount went into them.  That is fine.  When it came to the slipway in the west wharf, the level of effort and lobbying I had to do to get that money, &euro;450,000, to extend the slipway was incredible.

There is a litany of reports but no action was taken as a result, which is absolutely incredible.<br\/>I am going to chase the officials on this project for as long as it takes to get the dredging done.

I have encountered several cases.  They are not relevant to this morning's meeting but to another meeting.  I have met a considerable number of people who have expressed reservations about the manner in which the Department takes legal action.  In fact, Judge Reynolds made a statement in a particular case, although we will not go into it this morning.  It seem there are serious question marks over the costs involved in all of this.  Therefore, I wonder about the whole process within the Department, leading the Department to take action against an individual, even though it is in the interests of the taxpayer.  Question marks have arisen in these cases because the Department has been wrong.<\/p><p>  The Department must be spending a fortune on trying to put together leases that were never in place.  I question the whole approach of the Department in respect of the legal process and I am not on my own on the matter.  I have referred to Judge Reynolds already and there are other cases in which I have set about to meet the individuals concerned to get an understanding.  The stories I have heard, Mr. Moran, are horrific.  This shambles before us this morning is explained away, not by you, but explained away generally, by virtue of the fact that certain sections within Departments moved from one place to another, staff moved or changed and that the corporate knowledge needed to deal with the issues and the Department's understanding of the matters are suspect in terms of the continuation.  The only thing we can rely on is the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  Mr. Kelly from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has acknowledged that there is an anomaly in the 1968 Act.<\/p><p>  You said this morning that you had a very effective audit system, but I am not inclined to agree with you and I will tell you why.  It has taken an extraordinary length of time to deal with these issues.  It is not small money.  This is not lose change we are dealing with; it is not a matter of nickels and dimes.  There is a litany of figures: &euro;1.2 million, &euro;2 million, &euro;5 million and the write-off or bad debt provision of &euro;3 million.  Car parks that were to be developed were not developed.  Expectations from car parking fees were never realised.  It is not me saying this; the Comptroller and Auditor General has said it.  I have examined the various notes on the matter and it seems the Department was seriously remiss.  It is incredible.  The position on leases and the debt is shocking.  I imagine anyone reading the report prepared not by us, but by the Comptroller and Auditor General, would have to agree.<\/p><p>  I asked a question of the Department on the cost of legal fees.  I was told they were borne by the Chief State Solicitor's office and that it would be acting on behalf of the Department.  Now, I am told that there is a legal division in the Department and that a solicitor is employed there.  I am unsure what are the other qualifications.  I will come back to this in the context of the special investigation; it is not for this morning.<\/p><p> Will you outline your response in writing in respect of all of this?

Rossaveal provides an example of an area where there was no transition period and where the previous administration was not in charge.  It was entirely within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  No parking fees were imposed there in 2008 or 2009.  Then the Department decided to carry out an upgrade in 2011 at a cost of &euro;340,000.  There had been ample time at that stage for the Department to have put all the mechanisms in place in terms of auditing and decision making.  The upgrade took place and 276 car parking spaces were installed.  The estimated or projected annual income was &euro;580,000 but the amount that actually accrued in 2012 and 2013 was &euro;11,000.  How in God's name could there be such a variance between the projected and actual dividend on the back of the expenditure of &euro;340,000?  How was the decision made?  It is hardly sufficient to say that someone subsequently provided another car park down the road.  One must have a business plan and that plan must carefully look at all the options and possibilities, both the downside and the upside.  It seems that in this particular case, there was no business plan.  What did the audit unit do in response to the request from the Comptroller and Auditor General for information on the matter?  It does not seem to have provided any details to his office.  I am raising this example because it is at the heart of the Department's administration and responsibility.  The decision to do the upgrade was made in 2011.  Prior to 2011 no funds accrued from the car park.<\/p> <p>Simultaneously, the State was obliged to invest &euro;56.2 million in Exchequer funding in the six centres.  That amount constitutes some 75% of the total cost of running the centres and capital expenditure.  Obviously, there was a huge degree of negligence and laxity in terms of the manner in which the centres collected dues and under-billed fees which should have been properly declared and invoiced in the first instance, dealt with undeclared funding which should have been fully declared and did not impose the statutory requirement relating to fees which should have been imposed.  The Department made the decision in respect of this matter and there does not appear to be any paper trail whatsoever which would indicate how said decision was made, what was the business plan, how the protected income was arrived at or what was happening in the vicinity.<\/p><p> As the Chairman stated, the committee should be supplied with a full statement on this matter.  However, I am of the view that we should also be provided with an explanation now as to how the Department could have had oversight and supervision in respect of this matter and the decision-making process relating to it and yet achieved such a poor return from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600017#T03200","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413459000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I take the point with regard to Rossaveal falling within the remit of the Department at that time.

Surely, some of the difficulties that would arise could have been foreseen before this vast expenditure was made.  Where did the &euro;340,000 for the upgrade originate?

The difficulty in the past was that all of the ferries tied up at the same time and people climbed all over them.  This led to falls, trips, slips and claims.  The Department and the Minister of the day decided to invest in constructing a purpose-built ferry terminal in Rossaveal.  A harbour had to be dredged out of rock in order to facilitate this.  Since the facility was completed, the ferries now float up and down with the tide at their moorings and people can walk straight on and off on a level surface.

It was invested in so that there would be a safe and modern access and egress to and from the Aran Islands for the 170,000 passengers.  The parking arrangement that was in place prior to the terminal being built was a roughly-surfaced, pot-holed area of ground.  Parking was free and 170,000 people used it.  In the context of the construction of a safe ferry terminal for those 170,000 customers, the decision was taken to also build a safe, modern car park.  The decision was taken to redevelop and resurface the car park in conjunction with the ferry terminal as part of the overall modernisation of that service and to impose a charge on people who wished to park their cars.  Two things happened thereafter.  The first of these was that we were moving away from a free facility and whenever one moves from that to one where charges apply, issues arise.  The first issue which arose was that the islanders took the view that they had previously had free car parking and through their public representatives they made a very strong case to the effect that they wanted to retain this.  Ultimately, a free parking facility was provided for the islanders.<\/p><p>  The second issue was that once the State moved to improve its parking facilities and charge for them, the major ferry operating company opened an alternative car park much closer to where the traffic enters the harbour.  It also employed people outside the boundaries of the harbour - which is not something the State can do or say or do anything about - to direct ferry passengers to park in the new facility, where its ticket office is also located.  So two elements took away what was the original usage of the harbour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600018#U00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish"},{"type":"speech","time":1413459000,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Does the ferry company in question provide free parking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014101600018#U00700","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413459000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>It does not provide free parking but it has first access to everyone who enters the harbour with the intent of visiting the islands.

There were concerns that if the car park had been left in its original condition, claims would have been made against the State.  This happens very frequently in respect of any State facility which is not kept up to scratch.  That is the context in which all of this happened.  I accept that there was a competitive offering made available in a much better location at which it was possible to divert traffic on its way into the harbour.

On behalf of the Irish Delegation to the Committee of the Regions, the CoR, may I thank the committee for inviting us to make this presentation which follows up on related appearances and submissions by our members earlier this year. We wish to record our appreciation for the interest that this committee has shown in our work.  I would like to specifically thank the Chairman.  This is about the fourth time he has met the Committee of the Regions in the past 12 months and it shows his level of interest in us.  I would like to record the apologies of my colleagues unable to be present today.  I am sharing this introduction with my colleague, Councillor Maria Byrne from Limerick.<\/p><p>  We in the Irish CoR Delegation see this mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy as an opportunity to take a more coherent approach to its delivery, not just at EU and member state levels but also at local and regional levels.  The Irish delegation considers that the Europe 2020 strategy has the potential to improve the policy-making process both in Ireland and across the EU as it provides a long-term policy framework to address weaknesses in economic performance and promote investment in smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  In short, we welcome the process of target setting, co-ordination of policy and assessment, but we have concerns as to how this is implemented.<\/p><p>  The assessment by the European Commission of progress in reaching the strategy objectives shows a very mixed picture, in terms of a growing gap between the best and least well performing member states and the widening gap between regions within member states.  We suggest that the unsatisfactory rate of progress towards the Europe 2020 targets is not only due to the economic crisis but also to some shortcomings in the strategy itself. These shortcomings need to be addressed during the current mid-term assessment and that is why we are here today.<\/p><p>  In our submission, we have included statistics which show some of the widening regional gaps in Ireland, which in our view prompt the need for a re-think as to whether a &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; approach is best.  Therefore, we make two simple proposals.  First, we suggest that Europe 2020 is a strategy in need of a territorial dimension, rather than it being a purely sectoral strategy.  Second, the strategy needs a stronger partnership approach in the programming, implementation and assessment phases. <\/p><p>  In calling for a territorial dimension to the Europe 2020 strategy, we in the CoR have been aware that pursuing a strategy that has a sectoral focus only, with little or no consideration of its impact other than the achievement of purely national targets, is something which is going to result in some regions doing well and others less so. This was also a fundamental weakness of the previous Lisbon strategy and the assessment by the European Commission of the current strategy supports this view.<\/p><p>  Some member states have made attempts to give a spatial aspect to their sectoral targets under the Europe 2020 Strategy through their national reform programmes. Earlier this year, 16 of the country-specific recommendations from the European Commission also made explicit reference to the spatial dimension and, as appropriate, made recommendations to address regional disparities between and within member states.  We would be very strong on regional disparities.<\/p> <p>We are heartened that the European Commission now recognises that the growing regional inequalities require specific attention.  However, we suggest that this territorial dimension needs to be specifically built into the Europe 2020 strategy to give it a compulsory aspect and we consider that the mid-term review provides an opportunity to do this.<\/p><p> While the country-specific recommendations for Ireland did not include any recommendation on regional disparities, the strong view of our delegation is that it should have, and we suggest that the European Commission must address the issue of regional disparities in all country specific recommendations after this mid-term review.  We ask that the joint committee also give consideration to the regional disparity issue when it gets an opportunity to consider the draft country specific recommendations in the House.<\/p><p> As we indicated in previous submissions, both to this committee and to the Department of the Taoiseach, Ireland's national reform programme is spatially blind and the concept of balanced regional development, which seems to have disappeared as a national policy objective.  The one-size-fits-all approach has reinforced the regional development gaps within the State and as the committee will see from the tables on pages 5 and 10 of the submission the statistics on regional GDP illustrate the different impacts that the regions have experienced, both before and as a result of the economic crisis.  The BMW region was one of the EU regions with the highest levels of GDP decline and has a number of structural weaknesses, which require more tailored interventions.  That said, the gap in GDP levels between NUTS III regions is even more pronounced, with the south east, midlands and Border lagging behind.  Broadband penetration is one example in that regard.<\/p><p> To strengthen our case for a regional dimension, we have analysed the data that has been used by the European Commission in the production of its sixth cohesion report, which was published in July, and have included some of this in the appendix to our submission to demonstrate the clear regional differences that exist across the island of Ireland.  When we call for a territorial dimension to the Europe 2020 strategy, what we are really saying is that there needs to be a clear recognition of the key regional challenges facing Ireland and member states across the EU, and the specific competitiveness challenges facing the weaker regions in meeting Europe 2020 targets; there needs to be a set of regional macroeconomic indicators to describe the differing territorial realities across the Irish region; and there needs to be some regional targets to help galvanise a coherent response and drive implementation.<\/p><p> This leads onto the second proposal, which is our call for a stronger partnership approach in all aspects of the Europe 2020 strategy.  I will hand over to my colleague, Councillor Maria Byrne, to elaborate on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Councillor John Sheehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413465000,"counter":432,"content":"<p>In essence, our message is that the lessons from the previous Lisbon strategy have not been learned and that Europe 2020 will fail to deliver, if it remains a purely top-down and non-inclusive process.  We suggest that the mid-term review must result in a stronger commitment to the partnership principle and that the European Commission should take a firmer line in assessing the nature and extent of the involvement of stakeholders in national reform programmes of member states.<\/p><p>  In an Irish context, the approach to Europe 2020 and the national reform programme process has plenty of room for improvement.  As we see it, discussion on national targets is mainly confined within a number of Departments, with measures selected largely from existing national policy documents to achieve them.  Ireland is not alone in this regard but the centralised and closed nature of the process is particularly acute.<\/p><p>  Our call for a more open and collaborative approach comes at a time when many of the reforms of the local government system, at local and regional levels, are taking effect.  As the committee will be aware, the 2014 Local Government Reform Act provides the legislative basis for an enhanced role for local authorities in economic development.  In addition to the creation of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, since April, the Act requires that each local authority establish a dedicated strategic policy committee for economic development which is required to guide and support economic and enterprise development at county level, including through the preparation and delivery of the economic elements of the new local economic and community plans, LECPs.  Furthermore, the establishment of the local community development committees, LCDCs, within the local authority structure and their role in preparing and overseeing implementation of the community elements of the LECPs and their management of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, means that they will have a direct impact on the achievement of the national Europe 2020 targets.<\/p><p>  At regional level, the establishment of three new regional assemblies on 1 January 2015 has been described recently by the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, as an \"opportunity for Ireland to implement meaningful policies and to frame new governance institutions to counteract unbalanced development and promote regional recovery\".  The key function of these new regional assemblies will be to deliver regional planning and economic development through new regional spatial and economic strategies to be developed from 2016 onwards.  These strategies will be underpinned to ensure that all relevant public sector bodies with responsibility for economic development and enterprise promotion follow through on implementation.  The Minister of State indicated that all relevant agencies will be accountable to the regional assemblies as regards the progress being made towards the achievement of the objectives of the new regional strategies, with a further role for the national oversight and audit commission in this regard.  The legislation on these new regional assemblies and their functions will issue shortly, as will a new national planning framework, which will require a whole-of-government view of the national development priorities.<\/p><p>  This is what we are proposing when it comes to the Europe 2020 strategy and how its targets can be achieved effectively  - a whole-of-government approach which includes national, regional and local government as well as other agencies and key stakeholders.  The national reform programme must be compatible with and explicitly reflect, as well as inform, the priorities of the regional spatial and economic strategies, which, in turn, provide a framework for the local community and economic plans. There is now a clear role for local government generally in economic development and we consider that the setting of national Europe 2020 targets and, where necessary, regional targets and the delivery roles required to achieve them needs to reflect this.  In this context, we would, therefore, like to see the Department of the Taoiseach provide a roadmap for a more structured, continuous and constructive engagement with stakeholders in this process after the mid-term review.  I will leave it at that, but we are happy to respond to any questions and comments that committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Councillor Maria Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1413465000,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank Councillor Byrne.

I am joined here today by my colleagues: Mr. Joseph Bishop and Ms Hayley O'Donnell.  Unfortunately, our executive director, Ms Noelle O'Connell, is in Brussels today, but she has asked me to convey her apologies to the meeting.<\/p><p>  As many of the members will be aware, European Movement Ireland is an independent not-for-profit membership-based organisation founded in 1954.  We aim to provide a robust, fair and reasoned voice on European matters in Ireland through increasing awareness and understanding of European issues.  We are also fortunate to be part of a wide network of over 40 organisations within the European Movement International family.  Membership of this network has allowed us to broaden our analysis when it came to our submission on the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  We are grateful to our partners in European Movement International for providing us with their input.<\/p><p>  The Europe 2020 strategy's aim of improving the EU's competitiveness while maintaining its social market economy model and improving its resource efficiency is vital for the future of the EU and for the future of Ireland.  Now is an excellent time for civil society to reflect on the strategy and to see how successful its implementation has been.  However, any reflection must take into account that this strategy was launched against the backdrop of an extremely volatile financial climate, a backdrop that has played no small part in limiting the initial impact of the strategy.  In a paper about the strategy for policy review, Ms Heather Roy notes the development of economic and fiscal policy, such as the two pack, six pack, etc., has pushed the Europe 2020 strategy to the background and along with it, any real commitment to inclusive growth.<\/p><p>  The European Commission report on stock-taking of the Europe 2020 strategy, published in March 2014, reveals that the EU 2020 goals will remain out of reach if EU member states do not strive beyond incremental improvements.  Furthermore, the report shows that investment is slow, unemployment has reached unsustainable levels and, ultimately, there is an urgent need for more forward looking European policies.<\/p><p>  According to the report, progress on reaching the key Europe 2020 strategy targets is mixed.<\/p> <p>The EU is on course to meet or come close to its targets on education, climate and energy, but not employment, research and development or poverty reduction.  European Movement Ireland believes that part of the difficulty in reaching the targets is the lack of a sense of ownership in member states of the Europe 2020 strategy.  It is perhaps too top-down in its approach.  By having more publicity and encouraging the sharing of responsibility for national reform plans, our approach is designed to raise the profile and, therefore, the importance of the strategy in the eyes of the national political and economic leaders.  These have yet to be executed properly.<\/p><p> In the 2010 guidance for member states provided by the European Commission upon the adoption of Europe 2020, it was said that the strategy should be developed in close partnership with all national, regional and local authorities, and with continued interaction with stakeholders and interested parties.  The Commission does not provide implementation plans on how to attain these objectives.  That is the role of the member states.  Although the flagship initiatives and the country-specific recommendations indicate the broad directions, they often remain very wide-ranging and do not specify concrete measures, leaving a lot of discretion to member states.<\/p><p> As regards the current progress on the Europe 2020 targets, the Council stated on the occasion of its spring European Council in March 2012 that efforts undertaken to date remain insufficient to meet most of these targets.  The Commission stresses that there is not yet full ownership at national level of the radical changes which have been decided in terms of future economic governance and that, even at EU level, there is an implementation gap.  We believe the solution to this problem lies in firmly establishing the nature and extent of the involvement of stakeholders and providing a clear and concise outline of what is expected of each national reform programme stakeholder.<\/p><p> Looking forward to the second half of the strategy, European Movement Ireland contends that the partnership approach envisaged is a priority.  Europe 2020 will fail to deliver if it remains a purely top-down and non-inclusive process.  More active consultation and integration within the national reform programme is required to achieve this.  Another solution to the lack of engagement at this stage is to increase awareness of the programme.  A greater effort needs to be made to reach out to potential stakeholders.  Constructive and meaningful engagement with stakeholders is necessary for the strategy to flourish and for its ambitious targets to be met at national and EU level.<\/p><p> As an aside, ease of access for making submissions to the European Commission has been an issue highlighted by European Movement Ireland repeatedly in our annual accountability report.  We look forward to presenting to the committee the findings of the 2013 report next month.  Ultimately, the main challenge for the EU remains to increase the ownership of the Europe 2020 strategy by better involving the European public in the process.  Given the absence of incentives to co-operate, it is up to national Governments to be seen as willing to act in compliance with the EU's agenda in an enthusiastic way.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, notwithstanding the efforts of this committee, there are so far no major initiatives aimed at increasing participation and engagement at the citizen level.  The period up to 2020 offers great opportunities for transformation, but only if the right steps are taken.  European Movement Ireland believes that the mid-term review is an opportunity for a more ambitious policy since governance reforms are on track and economies are recovering.  Indeed, it is a necessity since the ongoing review has revealed that without strategy change, the EU 2020 goals for employment, research, poverty reduction and energy efficiency will simply be missed.<\/p><p> The incoming College of Commissioners will need to consider the mid-term review results and we hope it will propose a way forward which involves clarity and strengthens engagement.  Investment in inclusive growth in a smart and sustainable way must be prioritised in Europe 2020 for the well-being of the people and the new college.  Related Commission services must ensure inclusive growth is reinstated as a key driver of EU policy over the next few years.  I thank the committee and look forward to answering any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Councillor Neale Redomnd","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413465600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the joint committee for inviting us to share some of our thoughts and reflections on the Europe 2020 strategy in connection with the mid-term review.  Eurofound is a tripartite European agency financed from the European budget.  We provide knowledge to assist in the development of social and work related policies.  We are not directly involved in policy-making.  We provide evidence from comparative research to support better informed policies.<\/p><p>  I will start with a general and political statement.  European integration is under threat because many European citizens today see Europe as part of the problem and not the solution.  Deteriorating living standards, growing inequalities within and between member states, which Councillor Sheehan mentioned, competition in a Single Market which is not always regarded as fair, and the mobility of workers which is seen as an attack on national welfare systems and not as a right to be cherished and exercised are just some of the key issues in the public debate.  A strategy which ignores these facts cannot be successful.<\/p><p>  I will comment on some elements of the Europe 2020 strategy, the current targets, adapting to a post-crisis strategy and the new challenges which need to be addressed.  There seems to be consensus, and it is the view of Eurofound, that the targets are relevant for measuring progress towards the strategy's objectives of fostering growth and jobs.  It is very important, however, to complement these rather numerical targets with additional indicators which have a more qualitative dimension.  I will illustrate what I mean with the employment target.<\/p><p>  To have at least 75% of people between the ages of 20 and 64 in employment requires good quality jobs.  According to our research, 20% of jobs in Europe today are poor quality jobs which are badly paid, provide few prospects and score very low when it comes to physical and social work environment and quality of work intensity.  These jobs are associated, therefore, with poor health outcomes and low levels of well-being of the jobholder.  That is a clear indiction for early exit from the labour market being quite probable.  Not only is it difficult to keep those in poor quality jobs in employment longer, which is what we need to do if we want to reach the 75% target, low quality jobs are also unlikely to be suitable or attractive to many people who are unemployed or inactive.<\/p><p>  Many of those who could participate, and who need to participate if we want to move from the current employment level of 68% to 75%, do not do so because the characteristics of the jobs which are available do not match their level of availability in terms of care responsibilities, qualifications, mobility and health issues.  Improving job quality is, therefore, a prerequisite for reaching the EU 2020 employment target and ensuring employment levels stay at the envisaged high level.  We need job quality indicators which could be introduced as part of the joint assessment framework or the social scoreboard to help monitor progress in that respect.<\/p><p>  Increasing the sustainability of work over a lifetime is one of the key challenges that needs to be addressed in the post-crisis growth strategy.  With low quality jobs not likely to disappear from one day to the next, we need to think about ways to compensate for the negative effects and think more about transitions between jobs making career paths towards higher quality jobs possible, between education and the labour market and between periods of inactivity or unemployment and participation.  <\/p><p>  Both parts of the education target are relevant.  This is confirmed by data we have on shifts in employment from the European jobs monitor which clearly shows growth in jobs which need the highest level of education for the jobholder.  The current target, however, can do little to monitor whether the skills obtained actually match the requirements of the labour market.  Our European company survey points to a skills gap which is detrimental to growth and jobs and that may not necessarily be closed by increasing the number of people holding third level diplomas, which is the target.  In a survey we conducted in 2013, almost 40% of European companies reported difficulties in finding employees with the required skills, in the face of high unemployment rates.<\/p> <p>That points clearly to a qualitative assessment.  Are the skills that young people acquire through third level education the skills the labour market needs?<br\/>The second part of the target is to reduce school drop-out rates to below 10%.  That points to the most important strategic, long-term issue for Europe, that is, the welfare of children and ensuring their future productivity as adults.  Europe's economic success depends on it.  Achieving real social inclusion depends on it.  Living up to the responsibility a society has <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>its children depends on it, and therefore we would argue that in the review and the post-crisis strategy, investment in early childhood education and care, and tackling educational disadvantage, is one of the key goals that must be pursued.<br\/>On the adequacy of the poverty target, it is an achievement in itself to have a poverty target in the strategy.  However, the at risk of poverty and exclusion indicator is complex and multidimensional but it does not provide direct evidence of the experience of social exclusion.  In the European quality of life survey, we ask about perceived social exclusion and how people feel integrated in society.  In doing that we get important information on the reason people feel excluded, whether the situation has improved or worsened, and the groups that are particularly affected.  We need a better understanding of the reasons for social exclusion in order to design better targeted, personalised approaches.<br\/>Targeting income and poverty, and inclusion through employment, is important but in our outlook on future challenges we suggest that we must also consider what we like to call a plan B, namely, inclusion through other means than employment, for example, through involvement in civil society and social engagement.  <br\/>I think I have exhausted my time.  The members have our input and I am happy to answer any questions they may want to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Gerstenberger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413466200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gerstenberger.

Eurofound representatives are due to come before the committee next month to speak about the work done by the organisation.<\/p><p>  I will begin by raising an issue raised by most of our speakers, namely, the regional disparities that exist.  In his submission, Councillor Sheehan provides figures on what that disparity means in Ireland.  In terms of GDP across Ireland, in the southern and eastern region we are at 145% of the European average but in the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region it is 86%.  The difference between the south and east region, therefore, and the BMW region is almost 60%.  That is a huge difference in terms of GDP.  Councillor Neale Richmond refers to that in the submission and that it could be because the one size fits all approach is not working.<\/p><p>  As part of our submission on this work, it is important that we put forward suggestions as to how we can make improvements.

To take agriculture, we take a one size fits all approach in that sector but micro-management and macro-management is part of that.

I thank them for their presentations.  I subscribe to their objectives, which I will develop later, but I begin by asking about the reference to a territorial approach to the management and in terms of the Europe 2020 objectives.  Councillor Richmond stated that the Border, midlands and west region, which my constituency is within, was one of the EU regions with the highest level of GDP decline and has a number of structural weaknesses which require more tailored interventions, and that gap is very clear.  This was something the Chairman homed in on also.  It is a serious gap in terms of the income levels of the area I represent, other parts of the country and other parts of Europe.  That arises from a number of historical matters, which we do not need to repeat here, but they include the conflict in Northern Ireland and other in-built disadvantages.  That is a very serious matter.<\/p><p>  On a good note, and I have some questions for the witnesses, I was pleased to hear the announcement in the budget that &euro;1.2 billion of Structural Funds are to be spent in Ireland in the period 2014 to 2020.  That is a great achievement by the Government.  I am also very happy, and I am interested to know if the witnesses see it as a positive move and whether it fits some of their objectives, that we have secured an allocation of an additional &euro;100 million for the Border and midlands region, which is the area I represent.<\/p><p>  I am very interested to hear the witnesses' analysis, having highlighted what I know about my own area which is that we suffer huge disadvantages that Government and Europe should be working to correct.  I acknowledge the great success of our Government in achieving an additional &euro;100 million in Structural Funds for the Border region.<\/p><p>  I agree strongly with the witnesses on the need for a territorial dimension.  Would they agree that an area such as the one I represent, and it is typical of the many areas that suffer disadvantage, needs special allocations and additional moneys for investment in high speed broadband?  Do they agree that is crucial infrastructure to attract industry and inward investment and bring us to a level with the rest of the country, which we have a difficulty doing?  Do they see that as a major territorial objective?<\/p><p>  Would the witnesses accept that in the absence of a rail network in our area there should be positive discrimination towards us in terms of the road network?<\/p> <p>Something like the east-west link connecting Dundalk to Sligo is crucial infrastructure.  Do the witnesses consider that should be a priority in a territorial approach?<\/p><p> Do the witnesses accept, as I have experienced in my area, that a great many people were displaced from the construction industry during the recession?  Very often they are young men who went into construction when it was booming, took up low-paid positions and were left unemployed when construction ceased.  They need re-education and the Youth Guarantee scheme should focus on that group.  In sum, do witnesses feel territorial initiatives are necessary for my region and regions like it and do they see that being delivered by their objectives?<\/p><p> The witnesses stated that they believe we should have a partnership approach at local level.  I completely agree.  I spent more than 25 years in local government myself and had the honour of chairing my local authority.  I have a great affinity with local authorities.  Do the witnesses consider that the role of local enterprise offices, LEOs, will widen?  They are now under the control of the local authorities but should they have a wider remit?<\/p><p> We cannot possibly deliver the 2020 objectives without the approach suggested by the witnesses.  The witnesses are correct to say it should have a spatial, territorial dimension.  Areas like Cavan-Monaghan need positive discrimination which we cannot deliver without the involvement of all levels, which includes local authorities and, very specifically, the witnesses' organisation.  I am interested specifically in the witnesses' response to my specific points and in their view on the role of LEOs.  What most interests me - and I make no apology for it given that it is why I was elected - is that my area suffers hugely by comparison with other areas in terms of family income and opportunity.

I welcome our friends who have come to give us very useful information.  The involvement of Councillors John Sheehan and Maria Byrne is particularly important because they provide representation via their attendance at the regional assembly of the European Union.  There is a real disconnection between Europe and Ireland particularly as evidenced in relation to special areas of conservation.  There is no feeling that there is an appeal to Europe to say that something is not working and we must find a solution.  It was very evident in our recent by-election in Roscommon where people were so genuinely affected by this issue that they took people power.  I met a farmer from Leitrim whose farm is surrounded by bog.  He feels he will be squeezed out of a livelihood if the European Union has its way.  This is real life and he campaigned day and night - 17 hours a day - to elect a representative to the Houses.  I congratulate that representative who will be able to articulate the problems that come to his attention.<\/p><p>  I have another example of the disconnect.  As a Member of the Seanad, I was debating with the last Government, particularly its Green element.  People do not realise in regard to the former Green Party Minister, Eamon Ryan, that of the 28 countries in the EU, only Ireland has a 90-year ban on eel fishing.  His Ministers of State were Conor Lenihan and Se&aacute;n Power.  We could not get this through to them.  The North of Ireland allows eel fishing on Lough Neagh where it is a very good industry.  On our side, eels are protected for a possible 99 years.  I would like to see that appealed as it is outrageous.  In our area, there are people making a livelihood in eel fishing and the ESB has an involvement in it down at Ardnacrusha.  That is an example of how this affects ordinary people.<\/p><p>  There is a feeling that there is a lack of power to do something about these issues.  The Leader of the Seanad, Senator Maurice Cummins, called a small meeting recently and we decided at it that the Seanad will take on a scrutiny role in regard to European legislation to look at specific controversial areas where we can have a view and refer matters back to Europe where we are not satisfied with the Commission's proposals.  It is a good initiative because the Seanad has that extra time.  We used to have such a scrutiny role in here the joint committee and it was a very effective way to do things.  I have not heard much about scrutiny since.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600007#G00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1413466800,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Following mainstreaming, the respective committees undertake it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600007#G00300","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1413466800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Possibly, but the Seanad will have a particularly important view.<\/p><p>  I ask for the views of witnesses on the local community development committees.

I have a number of questions to pose.<\/p><p>  The Lisbon strategy was deemed to have missed its targets, but that was not disclosed or discovered, unfortunately, until almost the end of its period of operation.  To what extent has the 2020 strategy been achieved in terms of interim targets thus far?  In what areas are the most obvious defaults in that regard?  To what extent have the European institutions, including the Commission and the Council, co-operated with member state Governments to address the issues that may have caused a slow-down or failure to meet targets?  I have previously suggested an annual review.  To what extent could it be done as an internal component of a mid-term review to alert the institutions to failures or delays in achieving specific targets on an annual basis?  Instead of waiting until 2020 or 2019, why not have an annual review which becomes part of the final report?  That should identify deficiencies at an earlier stage in order to remedy them.<\/p><p>  To what extent have the witnesses in their capacity as members of the Committee of the Regions and Eurofound identified the deficiencies in infrastructure which might be contributing to delay or failure in the achievement of the targets?  There are several deficiencies, including in relation to energy, telecommunications infrastructure and broadband.  What have we achieved to provide adequate infrastructure in those areas to enable a relaunch of the European economies, individually and collectively within and outside the EU?  Various commentators say from day to day what the ills of Europe are and I suggest strongly that infrastructural deficiency is a major one.<\/p> <p>That is particularly relevant for member states on the periphery of Europe, because the geographical position suggests that in the natural order of things, the centre will obviously be the centre of power and authority.  That is the way things work.  All roads lead to Rome was once a particular phrase.  People might now suggest that all roads lead to Brussels, or somewhere similar.  The question that arises is to what extent there is co-operation between European governments and the Committee of the Regions on identifying and remedying those deficiencies.  What is happening to co-ordinate efforts to remedy them?  For instance, a debate is taking place on the issue of energy, something my colleague brought up at the previous meeting, and whether we should go nuclear or whether we should go for natural energy.  We should choose natural, renewable energy.  I am uneasy about nuclear energy and that is the feeling across Europe, or certainly in some major countries in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600007#G00800","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413467400,"counter":451,"content":"<p>We need both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600008#H00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1413467400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>We will see.  My view on clean, renewable energy is that it will stand the test of time.  To what extent is it recognised across Europe that we cannot depend indefinitely on energy supplies of an increasing volume, nature and variety?  We cannot depend on that indefinitely.  It will not happen.  This is especially the case as climate change issues emerge, converge and impact on our European policy, because we will be expected to be self-sufficient in energy, or to get as near to that as possible.  To what extent are the European institutions co-operating with national governments and with the regions to identify and support the concept of providing and addressing?<\/p><p>  What have the witnesses seen as possible obstructions to achieving equal distribution of resources and investment across the Continent of Europe, within the European Union, eurozone and non-eurozone?  Have they identified the deficiencies in their areas as they see them, for example, obstacles to youth employment, addressing long-term unemployment, and so forth?  Have they come to a conclusion on why Ireland should recover more quickly than some other countries that have far greater resources in terms of economic recovery and achieving economic growth?  What has been done to address those issues throughout Europe with a view to putting in place measures that will electrify European performance, which is certainly in need of that?<\/p><p>  Ms Gerstenberger referred to the fact it is not always possible for European industry to obtain the required educational skills to fill positions.  Is that true in its entirety?  For example, is the possibility of relocating to China or south-east Asia in general, thereby availing of far lower wage costs, not an influencing factor?  We have heard much in recent times about the double Irish, the double Dutch, and so on, which can be an unfair advantage for some European countries.  It can also be an unfair advantage for major multinational corporations to relocate to low-wage economies, for example, China, to avail of all the benefits that can accrue from that, which are at least as significant as the so-called double Irish.  It should also be borne in mind that such companies export their products to the 500 million population on the Continent of Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600008#H00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1413467400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses and applaud their work.  It was very interesting listening to their presentations.  I find it interesting that there is a commonality in certain sections of the three contributions, for example, the need to increase involvement by civil society in the Europe 2020 programme.  Someone - I think a representative of European Movement Ireland - suggested that one weakness is the lack of ownership of the project by member states.  This brings me back to the contribution from the representative of Eurofound in which she stated that an increasing number of people are arguing that Europe is part of the problem and not part of the solution.  There is a disconnect somewhere.  I am delighted Councillor John Sheehan has highlighted many aspects pertinent to him and the regions and the role played by the regions.  He makes a strong point that the Commission must address: the issue of regional disparities in all country-specific recommendations.<\/p><p>  What catches my attention, and the issue on which I ask for a more detailed explanation from the presenters, is the report from the European Union which says there is an urgent need for more forward-looking European policies.  What exactly would the witnesses define as a forward-looking European policy to meet the 2020 targets?<\/p><p>  I found the presentation on jobs, job satisfaction and good versus poor quality jobs both fascinating and disturbing.  Could someone make sense of the fact that 47% of those who emigrated during the depression were in good, well-paid employment and were essentially third level educated?  I cannot get my head around this.  I asked the IBEC representatives how this is the case, whether it is the romantic notion that the Irish are a wandering race and if it is the case that it is the aim of every graduate or qualified tradesperson - I have done it myself - or every nurse who qualifies to get out of the country.  I do not believe that is quite it.  There is a fundamental problem as to why so many people in employment in the middle of a recession would want to leave the country.  Has it to do with the question of job quality?  One might argue they seem to be going away to get greater opportunities, and one must compliment them on that, but I am not satisfied that we have the proper response from industry as to how we can generate good quality jobs.<\/p><p>  How do we define a good quality job?  I think the figure given was that one fifth of jobs are not of good quality and therefore we will not retain those people in employment.  They will drop out of the labour market as soon as conditions change.  How do we deal with this problem?  A suggestion was made about a job quality framework in order that we can have defined for us what is good, bad and middling and set ourselves targets.  I found this fascinating.  We will hear industry representatives argue there is a 40% disparity between their requirements from the labour force and the training they receive and that third level institutions are not linking in with industry to the extent they should.  Industry may be looking for too much from the university sector.  Perhaps they should empower their companies to create the necessary climate or even internal mechanisms for promotion or upskilling their workforce.  That is the only question I will ask about the skills gap.  How would the witnesses see a job quality framework being structured and under what Department?  How would one go about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600008#H00400","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1413468000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for their comprehensive presentations and the work they are doing in this area.  I have a question in regard to the presentation by Councillor Richmond on the lack of engagement.  He said there needs to be a greater effort to reach out to potential stakeholders and to construct a municipal engagement with stakeholders in order for the strategy to flourish. What particular area would he prioritise and can we make major efforts over the next 12 to 18 months to get that engagement with those important stakeholders in this programme?<\/p><p>  My second question relates to the presentation made by Ms. Gerstenberger on the area of educational disadvantage.  Is there a particular area that should be prioritised?  There are a number of educational programmes in place at the moment at local level in various areas around the country.  In my constituency, there is a programme involving young people and their parents.  We are doing this over 20 years.  In 1996, we spoke of breaking the cycle and reducing the pupil-teacher ratio.  In terms of educational disadvantage, what area in particular could be prioritised in the knowledge that doing so we would achieve an end result within the fastest possible time frame?

A lot has been said and trying to cover it all will not be easy.  It comes down to two different things.  The common theme is the disconnect and how we get a proper connection between what people hear on the ground about Europe and what they want to contribute to Europe.  Sometimes, we have been guilty as a member state of using derogations and hiding behind Europe as the dictator of the bad policy that we have to implement at local level.  In response to Senator Leyden,  I come from an area that is in a Special Protection Area, SPA also.  There are land restrictions.  There is a man who canvassed for 17 hours a day for Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice and I congratulate the Deputy on his election to the D&aacute;il.  The man did that because he felt European directives were taking away his livelihood.  We have that on our side of the world also; the area is protected because of a bird - the hen harrier.  The lands cannot be reclaimed which is in total contradiction to the Food Harvest 2020 policy which one arm of the State, the Department of Agriculture, is trying to implement.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the National Parks and Wildlife Service dictate another policy.  There is no interconnection.  The one thing they will do is state that European policy on an agricultural basis globally is good but they will want to blame Europe for the designations of the restricted areas. That is where the disconnect occurs and causes angst about what Europe is doing.  We have to turn the mirror on ourselves - as a member state - to identify how we get the message from Brussels to the people.  That is a very important point.<\/p><p>  Deputies O'Reilly and Durkan mentioned our network and our infrastructures.  We did quite a lot when we had a few bob to do it.  In fairness to all previous Governments, we nearly got there on the orbital routes of our motorways.  There are currently some motorways going nowhere and we need to construct orbital routes - connecting Limerick to Cork and Dundalk to Sligo and then continuing on to Galway - when we have the money.  When those are in place, the infrastructure will be there.  It is all about lifestyle choice.  That may refer back to what Deputy Byrne spoke on, some of our youth wanting to leave.  They are highly educated but they decided - some by choice - to move.  We are after going through a period of austerity and they possibly felt that this was not the place to be at the moment if they were to move up along the ladder and that there were better opportunities elsewhere.  We need to create an Ireland to which they can return.<\/p><p>  It is probably about lifestyle choice.  Not everyone wants to live in the cauldron of the city, in particular the cauldron of Dublin given the expense and so forth involved.  Even some of the companies bringing foreign direct investment, FDIs are looking at our regional cities to see if all their requirements - education and other matters - can be met to set up business.  We have benefitted from that in Limerick city.  If it can be brought to the regions and the regional cities, it would be possible to branch out into the services industry which could locate in some of our regional towns.  Then we could start to pick up the jobs we do not seem to be able to hold.  There is a cohort of people in jobs that might not want to reskill.  The horse will not always drink the water.  Some people do not want to participate in reskilling opportunities.  We have to find a way to get those jobs nearer to these people in the regions because they are not able to come to the cauldrons of the bigger populations to get those jobs.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned energy.  It is one example of where we got it wrong in Ireland on competition law.  We had a fine utility company, the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, which supplies us with power at a cost a lot less than for what it is being supplied to other people throughout Europe.  We decided under competition law which was brought to us, that we had to raise the price of energy to make it competitive for somebody else to come in to the market.  We now have a utility company called Irish Water.  I hope we do not go down the road of having to raise the bar for somebody from Spain or somewhere else to come in and run our water for us.  We did things that were not right.  This is an opportunity to put it into the Europe 2020 strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Councillor John Sheehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1413468000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I wish to intervene.  What you say is true but was there not an obvious deficiency in the infrastructure as it existed at the time?  I have been tabling D&aacute;il questions for at least 25 years asking when there would be a fundamental reappraisal of the water requirements in the country, as one piece of that infrastructure.  When were we going to have adequate storage, adequate and reliable transmission and adequate supply?  How could we utilise and harvest the water that is flooding the land in the Shannon basin and bring it to an area where it could be redistributed?  That was never done.  Whatever we may say about Irish Water, the system was in tatters.  I am afraid that many of our infrastructural supply lines are in an equally vulnerable position.  We must remember that in 15 years from now, almost all motor cars will be driven by electricity in this country.

It is the aspect I was trying to hone in on, that we wouldn't lose the grasp of that again.<\/p> <p>Someone else may wish to comment on the remainder.<\/p><p> Senator Burke raised the matter of education.  Our universities are doing Trojan work for us.  We have great graduates and so on but there is a cohort in society that has dropped out of school early and their parents dropped out of school early as well.  We need to formulate a plan for people in socially deprived areas.  We need to bring the parent and child back to school together.  We should remember that the parent is probably only late teens or early 20s when the child is starting to go to school.

The first thing we need to do is recognise the fact that there are challenges.  This was mentioned in many of the presentations.  Certainly, we need to address them and examine them regionally and collectively.  Recently we saw the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for a rural economic development and rural transport and that is positive because it is about creating balanced regional development.  We need to examine that area.  I come from what is predominantly an urban area but I have a small rural area in terms of my electorate as well and I can definitely see the difference between the two.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to making a case to the Minister and his Department and what they will deliver.  For each region it is important to have a city that is driving the entire area.  If we can target some of our key cities and key areas then, in turn, they can target the region.  It can be a big boost to a region to have a flourishing city.  That is one thing I am keen to see realised.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Reilly raised the matter of broadband.  Even within urban areas there are problems with broadband.  I acknowledge it is not as bad as in rural areas but it is something in respect of which we need major investment.<\/p><p>  My colleague referred to education.  I have been a member of an education and training board for the past 15 years.  We have a successful youth reach programme - it is in place in many areas - to address early dropouts.  It is about encouraging people, especially if they have left school early, to go back to school.  There should be more emphasis on encouraging adult education.  It is great to see people going back to sit the junior certificate and leaving certificate regardless of their age.  It is all about lifelong learning.  We should keep that philosophy at the back of our minds.<\/p><p>  The local enterprise offices were mentioned by several people.  I was a member of what was the city enterprise board.  Now we have local enterprise offices.  There should be encouragement of private business influence to encourage people and we have started to do that in Limerick.  We have started encouraging people from businesses to come in and make presentations on how they see things developing locally and in the region.  We have had people in from the tourism industry, small businesses and SMEs.  This is important and something that should be rolled out throughout the country.  Many of the other issues have been covered so I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Councillor Maria Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413468600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>A range of issues have been raised and I will not go through each issue but I will try to get them all together in a couple of collective points.  If I do not get to them all committee members can always come back to me.  Deputy Durkan raised the matter of targets, the failings in the Lisbon strategy and the matter of identifying targets that were missed.  This feeds in to why this meeting and other recent meetings here are so important.  This is a mid-term review and therefore it is a chance, halfway through the process, to pull up the Commission and, by default, member state Governments, to point out where the direction is off course.  The review is important to identify this.<\/p><p>  European Movement Ireland would welcome the opportunity to do that on an annual basis, but whether that is practical I am unsure.  I will leave that the hands of the committee and the European Commission to decide.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the areas where the strategy is on-target and off-target.  My colleague from Eurofound will go into more detail on the matter.  The strategy is close to the targets on education, climate change and energy, but not in respect of employment, research and development and poverty reduction.  These are the three areas where there needs to be an increased focus.<\/p><p>  Senator Burke raised the question of where to prioritise.  We need to prioritise the relationship between those in research and development and those looking to employ people who are coming out of research and development to try to get things aligned.  I realise this is discussed as part of a range of issues.  We need people to be doing certain courses at third level.  Then they can go into the jobs that will provide the services that people need and that people will use to get the economy thriving.  It is no different to this strategy.  The type of outreach we strongly advocate involves going out to the chambers of commerce, large multinationals, SMEs working in Ireland and all member states as well as the third level and second level institutions to which Councillor Sheahan referred.  They are often neglected but they are very much a part of this as well.  The individuals involved are vital too.  It is difficult to reach out to all 4.2 million people in Ireland, let alone 500 million in the European Union, but a representative aim would be ideal.<\/p><p>  I am pleased that the one region-specific question came from Deputy O'Reilly.  My late mother was from Cootehill and I have a little knowledge of Cavan.  As Councillor Byrne said, the implementation of broadband is absolutely vital.  I come from Dublin and the standard in Dublin is not up to scratch internationally, but outside Dublin it is completely sub-par.  That should be at the forefront especially for small economies like Ireland that are reliant on the technology sector and light industries.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the path to recovery and why we need to be more forward-looking.  Much of the first five years of the strategy has been set against the backdrop of the fiscal crisis or the years of austerity, as Councillor Sheahan put it.  We need to move on from that.  People have announced in various ways that Ireland has reached the end of the austerity road and that the country is in recovery mode.  That is not necessarily true for the rest of the European Union or specific member states but that is the footing we need to be on.  We need to look beyond that.  We will not always be in a fiscal crisis or if we are going to be perpetually in a fiscal crisis then things are going to get far more difficult for everyone.  We need to look beyond this and decide on the strategy we need regardless of the financial backdrop.  We need to decide on the key building blocks for it.<\/p><p>  We welcome the additional scrutiny role the Seanad is planning.  Senator Leyden referred to this.  One of the strong points in the programme for Government in 2011 was the onus on the various Oireachtas committees to examine all legislative measures emerging which are important to each committee.  European Movement Ireland is a little concerned about the lack of discourse between various Oireachtas committees and Ministers when it comes to summits and Council meetings.  We believe the amount of pre-summit and post-summit briefings are not necessarily up to scratch in other committees although they are very good in this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600010#K00300","nonspeaker":"Councillor Neale Richmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1413468600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I think we are rather good in this committee.

I have no intention of entering the debate on nuclear power here but one thing we strongly welcome is the announcement that there will be a European Commission vice president with responsibility for energy union.  While the individual Commissioner-designate has changed in the past week we believe the fact that the portfolio is being maintained and prioritised as one of the five key areas by President-designate, Mr. Junker, is to be welcomed and we hope to see some movement in that area.<\/p><p>  I will conclude on a general comment on disconnection.  This has been raised by all speakers.  European Movement Ireland commissioned a poll produced by RED C.  I realise everyone in this room knows RED C well and often they live by its monthly analysis in certain newspapers.  We know the abilities of RED C on polling data.  We presented the results before this committee during the middle of the EU Presidency.  Some 86% of people are still in favour of Ireland's continuing membership of the European Union and 83% of people are positively disposed towards Ireland's continuing role within the European Union and Ireland's relationship with the EU.

I will not be able to comment on all of them, given the time constraints, but in my response I will focus on job quality, the skills gap and the priorities for education.<\/p><p>  We can certainly have a framework and indicator for job quality.  We know perfectly well, and not just in Eurofound, what a good job is all about.  Pay is an important element but prospects are important, and that may be the reason so many young Irish people who had a job left the country.  The physical strains and risks associated with work are important as well as psychosocial risks associated with work which are becoming increasingly important.  For example, nurses, teachers and so on are under a very different kind of stress from those who do more physical work.  There is also the issue of the intensity of the work and the level of autonomy people have in the workplace.  Lack of autonomy could be a reason young people leave what looks like a perfectly good job, because they do not feel they can develop in that job.  Last but not least, working time is the fourth key aspect of a good quality job.  The working time should not be too long.  Length plays a role but the other important aspect is discretion over working time, the degree of flexibility in the working time and how the person can adapt the working day to his or her non-work commitments.  Researchers will give slightly different weighting to the aspects of a job, but in principle we know what makes a good job and what makes it risky.  An indicator can be developed and then we can measure whether we are moving towards better quality jobs or in the other direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014101600011#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Gerstenberger"},{"type":"speech","time":1413469200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Whose job is it to create the environment that is attractive to those well-educated workers who are unhappy at work and emigrate?

If one compares the rates of youth unemployment in member states, one will find that the countries with the lowest rate of youth unemployment have a dual apprenticeship systems.  What are they characterised by?  The company is doing part of the education of the future worker and at the same time the young person goes to school.  It is a dual system of school and work at the same time.  An increasing number of universities in these countries adopt the same approach.  Part of the time is spent in the lecture room and then weeks and months in one stretch are spent in a company that also educates future employees.  A very close link between the company and the education system is important.<\/p><p>  Denmark has a very different approach.  They have sectoral skills councils and hold regular and intense meetings between the social partners to discuss what companies need and what kind of education can deliver that result.<\/p><p>  My last point, and this relates to construction workers losing their jobs, is that a low level of skill is required for relatively well-paid work.

I will respond to the point on the priorities for early childhood development and education.  What we can see from the research we have reviewed is that the main point is that the earlier the education starts, the better.  It starts with educating parents on how to educate children as well as giving them the opportunity to have their children cared for by skilled and well-trained carers and promoting and supporting development in that area.  By the time a child is three or four years old and shows up in preschool, an enormous opportunity already has been lost.

I also thank Deputy Sandra McLellan.  Over the past three years I have been in and out of Leinster House, so to get to this point is amazing for me.  First and foremost, I am a bereaved dad.  I want to outline my story to give the committee an insight into my world and why I think that this day is so important and why it should be ratified in Ireland.<br\/>In January 2006, we finally got the news that we wanted and had awaited for so long.  We had already one child, Lynn, who was then six, just the right age to become a big sister.  In February, we had the first scan at 12 weeks.  Everything seemed fine but the baby was a bit small so they asked us to come back again in a few weeks.  On 13 March, we went for this scan and brought Lynn along with us.  After about ten minutes of scanning, we were asked to put Lynn outside.  We were told something was not quite right and to come back in an hour to see a specialist. <br\/>We were told first that we were having two babies, and in the next breath that they were conjoined, both sharing a single heart.  Our world just fell apart.  We were told that nothing looked good at this stage and that nature would probably take its course.  Due to the rarity of conjoined twins, we were advised not to tell anyone.  A week later we got an appointment to see two consultants and were given a bit more detail about our children.  They were joined at the upper chest, sharing a single heart and a pair of lungs.  The chances of progressing past 16 weeks were very low.  However, they continued to grow and after 18 weeks, Liz could finally feel them move.  At 20 weeks, we found out that it was two girls.  We named them Lucy, twin one on the left, and Ellen, twin two on the right.<br\/>By now we had told everyone that Liz was expecting twins.  Even though we knew what the outcome was going to be, and the heartbreak that lay ahead, it was still our good news that we had two daughters.  These girls were fighters; they were beating all odds and jumping over every hurdle that they came up against.  We were up every two weeks for a scan and could not wait to see their tiny heart beating and to see the girls getting bigger and bigger.  One week we would be told that fluid was developing around Lucy&rsquo;s brain, which could be the beginning of the end, but the following week it would be gone.  At 22 weeks, Liz had an MRI scan to get more detail and a team from Great Ormond Street hospital in London got involved, but the outcome was still going to be the same.<br\/>Once the magical 24 weeks was reached, scans became a weekly event.  This was a week we were never supposed to reach.  Lucy and Ellen always put on a show for their mum and dad.  Even one time you could see Lucy slap her sister in the face.  We brought Lynn up a few times and she was delighted to see them move.  We told her that they were a bit sick but left it at that.  How could we explain the truth to her when we could not grasp it ourselves?  Over the next few weeks we continued leading double lives because to the outside world everything was fine but we knew what heartache lay ahead.<br\/>As Ellen and Lucy grew bigger, we made our memories of their lives.  They used to love dance music on the TV and having a bath, when you could always hear Lynn laughing all over the house at the sight of legs and hands sticking out at all angles.  Lucy was always the first to wake and within a few minutes would have her sister awake.  They were surpassing all odds and determined to say hello to us.  We were told that they might live for five minutes or an hour; we just did not know.<br\/>On 3 August, at 33 weeks, the girls decided to say hello to us.  They were due to be delivered on 14 August but - as throughout this pregnancy - they did everything their own way.  Our girls were born weighing just over 7lb 2oz.  Ellen had officially been first but Lucy got her say in too because her hand was on Ellen&rsquo;s face.  We had them christened, then anointed, and 35 minutes later they passed away in their mum and dad's arms.  Our girls had lived their lives.<br\/>Liz was in hospital for six days.  Over those days, Lynn was able to hold her sisters, doing &quot;ring a ring a rosy&quot; on their hands and playing &quot;this little piggy went to the market&quot; with their toes.  We took tons of photos.  We brought them home in Lynn&rsquo;s Moses basket and kept them at home for two nights before saying goodbye.  Lynn drew pictures for them and we all placed gifts in with them.  We had a private Mass at home and then to the graveyard.  Lynn released two pink balloons.  They were not tied together, but they floated off side-by-side, just as our girls had been for their lives.<br\/>Our two girls - even though their lives were so short - showed us so much courage and strength and put up such a fight for life that any parent would be so proud to have them as their daughters.  With all the sorrow, they gave us so much joy.  Later the following year, we had two subsequent miscarriages but as a couple we were strong and never gave up hope.  In November 2008, our daughter Abbie was born.<br\/>As a parent, one of the most unimaginable things that can happen is the loss of a child.  There are no words to describe that feeling inside and the emptiness one feels.  I am a dad to six children, four of whom have passed.  In the early stages after losing our daughters in particular, two things had me in a major panic.  One was that I would forget them - how they looked, their smell, that sense of holding them.  I remember meeting a couple in their late 70s at a remembrance service.  It struck me how they comforted each other, remembering their loss from so many years ago.  Strangely enough, I got great comfort from that, knowing I would never forget my children, no matter how many years passed.  The second was the feeling that we were alone in this journey, even knowing our family and friends were around us.  In my mind, this had never happened to anyone else; it was just us.  However, 15 October quickly showed us we were not alone.  This day and the act of lighting a candle showed us that there was worldwide support for families, which was openly acknowledged by this one simple event.  This day allows bereaved parents and families to unite in remembrance of their loved ones and also allows non-family members to show their support.<br\/>The benefits of acknowledging 15 October as pregnancy and infant loss remembrance day in Ireland would be far-reaching.  It would allow us to come together as a country to celebrate the lives of our children.  It would be a platform for breaking the silence on pregnancy loss and the isolation that families feel at the loss of a child.  It would also give those who were bereaved many years ago an opportunity to openly express the loss that for so long may never have been dealt with.  As a dad, I fully believe things happen to us for a reason and that our children choose us.  For that reason alone, I am so proud that I was chosen to be their dad and that they came into our family, albeit too briefly.  Getting 15 October designated here in Ireland as pregnancy and infant loss day would be an ever-lasting legacy not alone for our children, but for all other families and their children.  <br\/>I asked the parents for a quote and they gave me this: <blockquote>When our little girl died, it was so unexpected and sudden that sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t feel real.  It is so important to us to keep her memory alive, to acknowledge her life, albeit brief, in whatever way we can.  Lighting a candle on October 15th means we can keep her memory alive forever and give our little girl the recognition and respect she deserves.  It also makes it acceptable for people to talk about the loss of a baby and be supported in that loss.<\/blockquote>That was from Paddy and Maria Cahill.  Another dad said: &quot;The loss of a child is horrific, but the loss of a baby sometimes feels worse, as if you're confronted by a wall of silence and you feel you are unable to mourn the passing of your child.&quot;  It is a taboo subject that people do not want to talk about or discuss.  The date of 15 October is the only day parents feel they are able to step forward and talk about their beautiful baby.  It is a day when it is OK to remember, a day when we can discuss the devastation of losing a baby and the shockingly high number of people it happens to.  It has already been passed in the United States, Canada, and in New South Wales in Australia, although they are working to get it passed in all of Australia.  <br\/>To conclude, I am just an ordinary dad, sitting before the committee, who, because of the loss of his children, is campaigning for something that I truly believe will make a difference not only for the healing process of families, but also for our children, so that they will never be forgotten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Roche"},{"type":"speech","time":1413448500,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Roche for sharing his personal story.

As well as the campaign Mr. Roche is spearheading to get official recognition for 15 October, we have other campaigns.  To explain how F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in started, we were a number of bereaved parents who met through various organisations, including the International Stillbirth Organisation.  We noticed a gap in services in Ireland.  Everything was changing in our demographic profile - mothers, like myself, were older coming to pregnancy.<\/p> <p>My children were in their 20s when I fell pregnant with Liliana as she was an unplanned pregnancy.  The day before she was due she died.  As Mr. Roche has said, the impact on a family is incredible.  The loneliest sight one will ever see is an empty scan.  There was very little support when I had Liliana and her brother a year later.  The impact on my own family, including birth children, foster children and adopted children - a rainbow family - was immense.  As a result we set about setting up F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in to see what other organisations were doing and what other countries were doing to support families.<\/p><p> F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in is big into evidence-based work and wants to see what is and is not working as there are a lot of myths about stillbirth and neonatal death, and about loss in general.  We formed in 2009 and registered as a charity in 2010.  We were very mindful of the charities legislation that is coming in.  There was a lot in the media at the time on how to set up probity of accounts and all that.  I remember we had to deconstruct a lot of the language but we did and set up an organisation of which we are very proud.<\/p><p> I will outline the services available from F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in.  The main service is the memory box that we offer to all the neonatal and early pregnancy units and maternity hospitals.  I have a handout available which states how many have been given out.  Last year 800 were handed out and 50 were given to hospitals.  This year the number has reached 865 but we do not know what that is about.<\/p><p> There are 500 stillbirths in Ireland every year.  The hospitals, we think, are giving the memory boxes to mothers and fathers whose babies have died aged 20 weeks and more, which we welcome.  The cut-off categorisation of a stillbirth in many countries is 20 weeks.  F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in, as an organisation, hopes that we in Ireland can look at that to see if we can bring down the categorisation of a stillbirth to at least 22 weeks.<\/p><p> I will show the memory box to the committee.  As Members can see, it is designed to give parents some bit of comfort at the worst time in their lives.  The boxes are given free of charge to the hospitals.  F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in receives no funding and is completely funded by its bereaved parents.  The main part of the memory box is a blanket which is hand-knitted by our bereaved parents.  In a lot of instances when one goes into hospital, one never expects one's baby to die.  At least the memory box ensures one has some beautiful garments from F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in in which to wrap one's baby.<\/p><p> There are also two little teddy bears in the box.  One teddy bear stays with the baby, the other stays with the parents and they are swapped over just before burial.  Many parents have told us that the teddy is the most precious thing they will own for the rest of their lives.<\/p><p> The box also contains a print kit so that parents can take handprints and footprints of their little child.  Any of the three members of the delegation present can tell the committee that if our houses went on fire the first thing we would grab are our mementos - the lock of hair and the little things such as the one photograph of our children that we were lucky to get.<\/p><p> There is also a card handmade by the bereaved parents.  We make the cards in our workshops.  The card allows parents to write a note to their child or record details.  There is also a candle included in the box which is a gift from F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in.  It is not allowed to be lit in many hospitals but parents can take it home.<\/p><p> A suite of literature is also included in the box which helps to explain how they will feel from the start.  When the family opens, the box the first thing they will see is a leaflet on the memory box because we want them to read it.  The last thing the bereaved want after their baby has died is a box.  When they open the memory box, they will learn that it is from bereaved parents who have been through the same experience.  We convey to them that it is from us who know what they are going through.  They will find a set of leaflets that will help them through the next weeks and months.  There are leaflets explaining port mortems, how to arrange a funeral for a baby, information on the coroner and other things like that.<\/p><p> F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in provides support meetings which are located in 20 centres throughout the country.  We hold meetings twice a month in Dublin.  One of the meetings provides support for the newly bereaved.  We also hold a craft workshop for people who move on in grief.  Those come later because people might feel hurt by the new stories of loss which remind them too much of their own story but they want to stay connected to the charity, so we make cards, Christmas cards, leaded glass and other stuff like that at the craft meetings.  The workshops are open to anyone affected by the death of a baby so people can bring along their parents or other children.<\/p><p> F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in provides a telephone listening service.  We also have online support which is huge at the moment.  We have more than 6,500 followers on our Facebook page.  We also hold remembrance services in four centres.  We hold craft workshops and provide counselling and psychotherapy.  We also have an advocacy unit which is a social work service.  For example, we can help people to access their files if they gave birth during the 1960s, find out how and where their baby was buried and inform them on how to name their baby.<\/p><p> We also offer training to professionals and students.  At the moment we are trying to get our training accepted by An Bord Altranais so that the nurses will get continuing professional development, CPD, points.<\/p><p> We also provide cuddle cots.  A unit helps to cool a baby's body so that parents can take their baby home prior to burial, if they need to do so.  In Ireland we do burial and bereavement well except for infant burial.  In such instances, people do not know what to do.  They do not know what to say and do not know whether to have a private funeral.  By us offering them the cuddle cot, which is a very discreet unit that cools the little baby's body, it means the baby will get a night at home with his or her family and everyone has memories of the baby.  Families can choose what follows, maybe not a wake but something around that.<\/p><p> Our services are parent-led.  We have professionals who are parents and bereaved parents as well.  That is what we offer.<\/p><p> Research is a huge part of our work.  We are heavily involved with the International Stillbirth Alliance.  One of our campaigns we hope to scope and maybe launch next year is on why so many babies die of unexplained stillbirth.  Babies do not die for no reason.  They die for reasons we do not understand.  We are part of the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre and we are the parent representative on its parent network.<\/p><p> We are involved with Patients for Patient Safety Champions.  We also help other organisations as well.  HIQA and HSE lead programmes come to us for advice.<\/p><p> I know I have very little time left so I will refer to our campaigns.  At the moment one can register a stillbirth from 24 weeks or 500g.  We hope the register will be open with an opt-out clause for people who do not want their details in the public domain.  I will explain the reason behind the initiative.  We are not ashamed of our children and wonder why they are hidden in a closed register.  In two generations no one will know my two children ever existed because they will be hidden in the register.  If my great-grandchildren want to find their family, I want my children, Liliana and James, counted and included.<\/p><p> We are translating our support material into more languages.  The Polish version has just been launched and we are looking at translating it into other languages.<\/p><p> Next year we hope to start mapping the cill&iacute;n&iacute; around the country.  Teagasc, Macra na Feirme, local history organisations and the ICA have shown great interest in the project so it will not be a very onerous but an interesting one.  The project will honour and bring children who were left on the margin of society back into our consciousness.<\/p><p> We also hope there will be an increased awareness among professional staff of reduced foetal movement in late pregnancy.  Reduced movement is a red flag indicator that a baby is going to die.  There is a myth that babies get quiet before birth and many women have been told a baby calms down before birth.  That is not true.  International research shows that reduced movement indicates the placenta might be failing and, therefore, needs to be checked out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairie Cregan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413449100,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cregan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600005#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413449100,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us here.

One of our supporters, a bereaved parent himself, who owns a number of camera shops has kindly donated two highly specified digital cameras to the maternity hospitals.  That means digital photographs can be taken, uploaded and returned to the families.

It is a very sensitive and emotional issue that affects many families in the country.  I thank Mr. Roche for sharing his personal story, which includes considerable detail.  The witnesses also gave an extremely comprehensive presentation which included considerable detail about how baby loss awareness day came about in America, Canada and Australia, which will be very useful to us.  The presentation included considerable supporting letters from many organisations, including the Cork University Hospital maternity unit in Cork.<\/p><p>  Obviously, through Mr. Roche, I got to know more of what F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in does.  I was not aware, however, that it also offers support for survivors of symphysiotomy and support for women whose babies died in mother and baby homes.

I ask the witnesses to go through the cuddle cot again and explain it as I only caught it briefly.<\/p><p>  I believe the baby loss awareness day is very important to families because they miss out on all their babies' milestones along the years such as first Holy Communion, first day at school, confirmation, graduation, wedding and grandchildren.  It is useful to have that day to mark it.  I am sure it is very important to families who have lost babies.<\/p><p>  I have a question specifically for Mr. Roche.

I am very aware of their organisation and know of the great work it does.  I have had friends and family members who have, unfortunately, been recipients of memory boxes.  I know of some local photographers at home in Dungarvan - the witnesses may be aware of them - who have been very active in supporting the organisation.  She does a great amount of work with the public at home to highlight the work it does.<\/p><p>  I thank Mr. Roche in particular for sharing his very personal story.  I commend him and his family on the work they have done in highlighting the issue.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan tapped on the issue I was going to focus on.  My child, who is now 12, was sick when she was born.  One of the most treasured things I had was a Polaroid photograph of her in an incubator because I could not be with her because she was so unwell at the time.  It is very important to have those memories and have those photographs available to parents.  The witnesses are right in saying we need to find out how we can rectify the situation and make that camera available.  She is 12 now, so that was in 2002.  The nurses in Waterford Regional Hospital had a Polaroid camera and were taking photographs of sick babies for parents, which is a hugely powerful thing.  One particular midwife used to send one up to me every couple of hours because babies change so quickly.  I think we need to solve that.<\/p><p>  From attending the clinics, we all know the other expectant mothers in our community, and when one sees that mother bring her child to his or her first day at school, of course it is there in one's head.  It would be very powerful for those families to have a day.  It is not just the couple but also includes the extended family.  I attended a F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in service, a Mass, in Cork with a family member.  I believe there was a quilt or a memory wall.  I cannot remember exactly as it was a couple of years ago.  It was a hugely powerful thing for someone who lost a baby a long time ago.  It does not go away.<\/p><p>  I again thank the witnesses.  They mentioned the stillbirth register.  I ask them to explain that because I do not believe people are familiar with it.  I know a Bill on registrations is going through the House at the moment.  Has F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in had any input into that?

Is it accurate to say we are only at the beginning of a cultural change when it comes to openness and acknowledgement of pregnancy and infant deaths?  I recently spoke to a lady who in the 1970s lost an infant in the first days of life.  When the baby died, the baby was taken from the mother and was buried - \"discreetly\" was the word that was used but \"secretly\" is probably a better word to use.  The mother never saw that child again and was not even offered the opportunity to attend the funeral.  She was deeply traumatised by that experience and remains so to this day.  Does F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in offer support to people in those circumstances?  Do many people approach the organisation from that perspective?<\/p><p>  I am not sure if I heard Ms Cregan right.

I was on social media last night.  Through the loss of my children I have made many friends in Australia, America and throughout the world.  There was such a warming sense of comfort from each other as we came to 7 p.m.  The International Stillbirth Alliance suggests that at 7 p.m. in each time zone people light a candle and keep it lit for an hour.<\/p> <p>In essence, they say there is a virtual lighting of candles around the world.  As each hour passed, my friends and I posted photographs of candles and put our children's names up.  My Facebook wall was full of candles at one stage last night.  It gave comfort to me and to my wife who was looking at it also.  We are all on a journey and support is there for each one of us.  It was an opportunity for people to acknowledge their children, their names and to show they are and will always be part of the family.  The national day on 15 October provides an opportunity for people who were bereaved long ago who never had a chance to openly acknowledge their child or their loss.  I know of one woman who lost a child 40 years ago who lit a candle.  I met her recently and she said last year was the first time she publicly acknowledged the loss of her child by lighting a candle on 15 October.  That is what it means to us.  It is cost neutral to run the event.  Whatever we do on the day such as balloon releases is for us, the parents.  We are not looking for the Government to pay for anything we organise.  Coming up on the train this morning I showed my mother photos of two big hotels in Las Vegas that turned the inside of their fires pink and blue in recognition of the day.<\/p><p> A question was asked about counselling.  When we were on this journey with our girls, we received counselling from the start.  We had counselling throughout the pregnancy.  We did not receive bereavement counselling until afterwards.  We did not know when they would pass and neither Liz nor I wanted to deal with the loss until it happened.  We had to make as many memories as we could for as long as we had them with us.  We did get bereavement counselling afterwards and without it we would not have got as far as we are today.<\/p><p> Reference was made to first days at school and birthdays.  My then five-year old daughter, Lynn, was starting back to school in high infants in September after we had lost the girls in August.  That summer, four of the other mothers were due to have babies.  We met the teacher and explained the situation.  The teacher called us after Lynn's first day and said that when she asked for news, our daughter was the first girl to put up her hand.  She said she had two baby sisters who are gone to heaven.  She said she was as proud as punch.  Nothing held her back.  That showed me we had done a good job.  Her sisters are part of her family.  Her younger sister, Abbie, is five now and she knows her sisters are part of her family and always will be.  They are always spoken about.  It is not a taboo subject.  Last night, when we were lighting the candles, each of us lit a candle.  We lit four candles and we lit one for our friends as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Roche","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413450300,"counter":515,"content":"<p>For me, the loss of awareness is huge because as bereaved parents all we want is for our babies to be acknowledged.  We carried them and gave birth to them.  They are part of our families and it is priceless for someone to acknowledge our babies.  One cannot buy that.  Often, people move on and forget and it is hurtful when one&rsquo;s baby&rsquo;s name is not mentioned.  My daughter Katie is now 20 but I nearly crashed the car when she said to me when she was 16 that she would never be an aunt.  I had never thought of the situation from the point of view of a sibling.<\/p><p>  I have two Polaroid photographs from Galway.  My infant daughter, Sara, died 14 years ago from a chromosome abnormality that was never detected throughout the pregnancy.  As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I knew something was wrong.  It was a mother&rsquo;s instinct and I kept saying something was wrong but it was not taken on board.  That is one thing we must get across to professionals, namely, the need to start listening to parents.  My daughter was born at 38 weeks and lived for just more than a day.  The hospital and the community were fantastic but it was the weeks and months later that were so isolating.  I would not wish that on anybody.  I was sitting at the kitchen table and there was nobody whom I could pick up the phone and ring.  I thought I was losing my reason.  I remember going around a roundabout and I did not know which exit to get off, but I was afraid to say that.  One day I was within inches of digging up my daughter.  I was afraid to say that to anyone for about ten years.  However, it is something we hear from parents all the time at support meetings and during support phone calls.  We provide a facility for parents to tell us what is happening for them.  We normalise it and can say that is okay, that is what it is about.  I did not receive counselling at the time but I went for personal therapy years later because I was stuck in my grief.  It is one of the most traumatic of losses and it is not acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacinta Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413450300,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Ms Murphy has described what we now know all about.  I used to work in mental health services and I am now an adoption social worker and a lecturer in UCC on this subject.  The grieving process is traumatic.  One can see fancy names in research books but does not understand it until one has experienced it and one realises that one cannot say what one is thinking for fear of being carted off.  At the time when Liliana died I was working on a suicide prevention team but I was thinking that if I could have found a way out without anybody knowing, I would probably have taken it.  I notice that a great deal among the women I work with.  People do not understand how one can be so attached to a child that never opened his or her eyes.  I have reared approximately 45 children though fostering, many of them on a long-term basis.  I have two adopted children and six other birth children but the children I think most about are the ones who died.  The only people who understand that are people who have gone through it themselves.  That is why the baby loss awareness day is huge for us.<br\/>My second child got to 16 weeks gestation.  He was a perfect little boy but his heart stopped beating for whatever reason.  I was 46 at the time so that might have been a factor.  He would have been delivered seven years ago today because they were going to bring me in two days early, so it is fortuitous that we are attending today&rsquo;s meeting.<br\/>I hope I have made a note of all the questions as there were a lot of them.  Somebody asked me about statistics.  Three sets of statistics are available for 2012.  The Central Statistics Office figures are not available yet but the ESRI figures have been published.  The National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre figures reveal there were 71,755 births from 24 weeks gestation.  Of that, there were 304 stillbirths.  The total for early neonatal death, which is babies who completed a seventh day of life, was 141, and 40 babies died between seven and 28 days.  That is a lot.<br\/>A question was asked about funding.  All our funding comes from bereaved parents, which is a bit of a conundrum for us.  Many people get their memory box and there is a great connection to one&rsquo;s baby if one is involved with an organisation.  After Liliana died, I just wanted to hang around the Erinville maternity hospital, which is the hospital where she was born.  People could not understand why I wanted to be there but that was all I had of her.  Of course one moves on from that stage in one&rsquo;s grief, but that is why people are connected to F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in.  They want to do something to thank the organisation for the gift, which came from other bereaved parents, but also to feel connected with their baby.  When they want to do fund-raising, we ask them if it is too soon.  We say they should not put pressure on themselves and that their job is to look after themselves.  Many of them tell us they find it a very healing process.<br\/>We have one staff member, Ms Jacinta Murphy, and a part-time psychotherapist.  I do the social work service one day a week <i>pro bono<\/i>, and I have two social workers working with me who give of their time free.  We have an office that costs us &euro;20,000 a year.  The office organises everything; all the support people need to carry out fund-raising and that also includes postage costs and the transport of the memory boxes as well as the cuddle cots, which I will speak about in a moment.  We also organise craft days for items made by bereaved parents.  They usually put their baby&rsquo;s name on a plate as well.  We also have classes on how to make the crochet and knitted goods for hospitals.  I got my second baby back in a Petri dish, whereas now mothers get their baby back in a beautiful garment that has been made by a bereaved parent.  All of that is provided for &euro;20,000.<br\/>Our memory boxes cost us &euro;40,000 a year.  They are &euro;40 each by the time we put everything in them, including Vaseline.<\/p> <p>We do the training for free.  We come in at approximately &euro;80,000 per year, which we raise ourselves.<\/p><p> Deputy McLellan asked me about the Killeen project.  We are getting the local and oral history groups involved as well as Macra na Feirme, Teagasc, the Irish Countrywomen&rsquo;s Association, ICA, and others.  We are trying to get people in involved in the project and there is great interest in it.  Everybody knows somebody affected.  The Deputy mentioned a baby being \"secretly\" buried.  We would say \"furtively\" buried.  It was as if there was shame and stigma.<\/p><p> Somebody asked about the work we do with the long-ago bereaved.  It is significant.  They come to us through other people or are referred by professionals they might be seeing through mental health services or community primary care services.  Usually, we just chat.  Sometimes we help them name their babies.  A person might have had a baby in his or her head for years but never named the child.  We give them a candle with the baby&rsquo;s name on it and it takes pride of place in their houses.  The candles are hand made by one of our members.  The cuddle cot is a device that looks like an ordinary Moses basket but has a cool and very flat sheet that goes under the baby&rsquo;s blanket and will keep the baby&rsquo;s core temperature at a level such that the baby can remain with the family for a few days and even up to a couple of weeks, for example if a family member is coming home from Australia.<\/p><p> We are very rarely consulted by outside people who do not know us.  Many of the HSE leads come to us because I have been working with Tusla and the HSE and I never shut up about F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in.  Officially, we are consulted only now and then.  We were not consulted over the Portlaoise report or mentioned in the support section, which is a very significant deficit because we are the biggest stillbirth support organisation in the country.  We have not been involved in the register, but we hope to rectify this now that we know about it.  Our latest support is for the siblings.  Our little teddy bears have a T-shirt printed with, &ldquo;for my big brother&rdquo; or &ldquo;for my big sister&rdquo;.  This is to help the older children in a family to understand what has happened with their little brother or sister.  Many families ask advice on how to tell the other children the baby has died.  People are expecting a baby and, as they are told, get an angel instead.  We will not go into that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairie Cregan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413450900,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Could you elaborate on the stillbirth register issue and the measurement of the gestational age for registration?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600008#G00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413450900,"counter":519,"content":"<p>A baby who either weighs more than 500g or was more than 24 weeks in gestation is entitled to a stillbirth registration certificate.

I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  As a mother and grandmother, I could feel Mr. Roche&rsquo;s loss, love and most of all, his compassion for other people in a similar position.  I live near the Coombe hospital and there is a mass there every year.  Attendance has grown over the years rather than subsiding and more people are coming to the mass who are a long time bereaved.  My sister lost her baby more than 40 years ago.  He was stillborn.  There is a huge sense of loss for the parents, family and extended family.  Members of our family and I found it very difficult even to talk to my sister and her husband about their loss.  It was not due to a lack of concern but inability to find the niche.  F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in has helped people to move into this area and openly talk about a deceased child.  Before I left home this morning, I had the privilege of feeding my new granddaughter.  She is five weeks old and a beauty and it is difficult to imagine our house without her presence and the love and warmth we all feel for her.  She lives in Ashbourne but visits us on occasion, so I am privileged to hold her for a few minutes early in the morning.<\/p><p>  Many of my questions have already been asked.  Members of my family have lost babies at certain stages of their lives.  I often go to Glasnevin with my sister because that is where her little child was buried.  If she could replay it, she would have buried her son herself.  My mother had twins and lost one of them.  The surviving twin, my brother, is 65, and I remember my mother speaking about the deceased baby in the sense that she did not know where he was.  At the time it was normal practice that the child would be taken from the parents, and this lived with her up to her own death at the age of 89.<\/p><p>  Moving on from any bereavement is a very difficult road, but moving on from the loss of a child, whether the child was 18 weeks, 24 weeks, two days old or any age, is one of the biggest hurdles a parent can go through.  It leaves a hole in their lives that they find very difficult.  The constant reminder that somebody has entered into one's life, albeit for a short time, leaves that sense of loss.  I congratulate the witnesses on their efforts and what they are doing here this morning.  It is very important, not only for them but for the hundreds, and probably thousands we do not know about, of parents who are still lost and do not know where they should go.  I hope things work out and as a member of the health committee I will support their appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600008#G00400","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1413450900,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the group.  I have heard Ms Cregan talking about the organisation previously.  Almost 20 years ago, I was very involved in the debate about the register of stillbirths and I learned much about bereavement from international literature.  At the time, people did not recognise it as a bereavement.  If one compares the bereavement of a stillbirth or an infant death, there is no funeral, sympathy or coffin.  People do not line up and sympathise with the parents.  They do not meet up with them a week later and tell them how sad they feel for their loss or ask them how they are coping.  They do not talk about the child.  Up to then, the child did not even have a name.  The register gave the child a name, if the mother and father wanted it.<\/p> <p>At that time there was a tendency to ignore the fathers in this situation.  I hope that has changed.  Having read F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in's literature, it has changed.  In the past there was an issue around recognising the father as a bereaved parent as well.  There was some recognition, albeit very little, of the mother's trauma of bereavement, but that has changed.  It is on the continuum of change.  I believe as a society we have a long way to go to understand and recognise the death of a child.<\/p><p> My elder brother died at birth.  He was born around Christmas and the nurse baptised him quickly and called him Noel.  My mother spoke to us about her loss of Noel all through her life.  His name is on the family headstone.  One can see from my appearance, that this was at a different time.  Our family responded in that way to his neonatal death.<\/p><p> F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in has asked that 15 October would be recognised as a remembrance day of Baby Loss Awareness.  How does one campaign to have official recognition of 15 October as Baby Loss Awareness Day?  What do we as members of this committee need to do to have it recognised?  What are the mechanics of the campaign?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600008#G00500","speaker":"1056","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413451500,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I join with colleagues in welcoming Mr. Brian Roche, Ms Jacinta Murphy and Ms Mairie Cregan to this meeting.  It is very difficult to know how to respond to the witnesses from F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in except to use two simple word, thank you.  Their testimonies this morning have impacted not only with the members of the committee but on those watching these proceedings.  I hope that through the media that awareness of stillbirth loss will grow across the land.  I believe they have achieved that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Neville's question is pertinent and I wish to comment on it.  It is about showing leadership.  F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in has shown unparalleled leadership.  I empathise entirely and am fortunate that I have not had the same experience, but that does not mean that it is beyond my comprehension because it is a major concern when we become parents.  <\/p><p>  I do not think there are mechanics to get official recognition, but it is about the will of people to emulate the example of the witnesses.  I have a suggestion, and that is all it is, it may not be feasible or practical, but it would show leadership that could spark off an example across the land.  The remembrance day should not only be in the homes of those who have been bereaved in this way, as it is something we could all do.  Leinster House is our parliamentary building and with the leadership of the Chairman, who will still be in place as I have no doubt they would not have blown the whistle yet for the off - but I expect it would be close - a single candle could be lit in front of the window in the lobby area.  This would be an inexpensive but significant representative gesture.  Perhaps the Chairman, the secretariat and the committee could be involved in that exercise on the morning of 15 October.  This would be a national statement and I think it is worth considering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600009#H00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1413451500,"counter":524,"content":"<p>This has been the most emotional presentation that I have ever been present for.  I am struck by the level of healing that F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in is offering people at a time of grief when, as Deputy Neville said, there is no other outward sign of the acknowledgment of the parents' huge loss.<\/p><p>  We do funerals well in Ireland.  We go through a process which helps people deal with their bereavement.  I see that F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in is trying to offer that acknowledgement to the parents of the stillbirth or neonatal death.  Chairman, we have many problems but I think that together we should be able to resolve this one easily.  It is about will, as others have said.  I would be supportive of the Baby Loss Awareness Day and the remembrance day on 15 October.<\/p><p>  I am struck by the numbers of people that F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in helps.  It states that 500 babies die around the time of birth every year, and that affects a great many people.  This is a very real issue in many people's lives.  F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in mentioned that it provides support for the survivors of symphysiotomy.  This committee has heard presentations from parents who have received a diagnosis of a foetus with fatal foetal abnormality.  I wondered if such parents have come to F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in.<\/p><p>  There is a strong lobby growing for perinatal care and the provision of a perinatal hospice, not so much a place but as a way of caring for the pregnant mother, the father and the family with dignity and compassion.  What are the views of the witnesses on that because the lobbying is for State support for those parents?<\/p><p>  The issue of closed registration was raised.  I think we have an opportunity to help on this issue.  As Deputy Conway said, the Civil Registration Bill (Amendment) Bill 2014 is going through the D&aacute;il at present.  There is a glitch around the closed register for adoption.  In 2010, the Adoption Act was passed.  Up to that time the parents of a child who was adopted would get a birth certificate from the adopted child's register.  However, under the provisions of the Adoption Act 2010, the adoption of the child is now hidden.  Let me explain.  I am an adoptive parent and the birth certificate of an adopted child since the enactment of the recent Act would look such that the adoptive parent is the natural parent of the child.  I and others would not agree with that.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection is putting this aspect out to a consultation process.  I think it would be opportune to submit a case to the Minister on the issue of the consultation process for the registration of births and stillbirths.  There might be an opening to deal with it in the Bill at present.  I am not  fully sure but it would be worthwhile to pursue aspect.<\/p><p>  I compliment the witnesses from F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in and ask them to respond to some of these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600009#H00300","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413451500,"counter":525,"content":"<p>A question was asked in respect of the parents who have received a diagnosis of foetal abnormality.

We find that on occasion mothers would feel they are being rushed into a decision but we give them space.  We do not judge but we listen.  We have no policy on fatal foetal abnormalities.  That is our strategy and the reason is that we do not want anybody to come to F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in thinking that we are on one side or another of the debate.  Everyone present has a view on termination for medical reasons but probably diametrically opposed views.  We do not discuss this issue.  We want to give a family member that is coming to F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in the opportunity to speak and be listened to and we will bracket our own views.  We are getting more and more people who around the time of the 20 week scan for anomalies find themselves in this awful situation.<\/p> <p>This will be a growing issue in the areas of stillbirth and neonatal support.

I am joined by Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer; Ms Darina O'Flanagan, the director of Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC; Mr. Michael Smith, from the health protection unit of the Department; and Mr. Gavin Maguire from the HSE.  In this statement, I propose to discuss high level arrangements that are in place to deal with public health threats and the major elements of our Ebola preparedness.  We will be happy to take any questions the committee may have.<\/p><p>  As of Monday, there were 4,033 confirmed deaths from Ebola and 8,399 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in seven countries, although widespread transmission is confirmed to three - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.  The number is doubling every three to four weeks and the UN has declared the outbreak to be an international public health emergency.  As President Obama stated yesterday, the most effective thing we can do is to halt the rise of the diseases in west Africa.  This is the single most effective thing we can do to prevent the spread of the disease to Europe and Ireland.  That is why I publicly commend the volunteers, staff and aid agencies working on the ground in west Africa.<\/p><p>  Ireland has pledged over &euro;2.5 million to the effort of the International Medical Corps, IMC, Concern, GOAL, World Vision, International Rescue Committee and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Liberia.  We have also provided 42 tonnes of equipment, including blankets, tarpaulin, tents, nets, soap and water tanks.  My Department has deployed two public health specialists to work with the World Health Organization, WHO, in Liberia and Nigeria.<\/p><p>  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, in its latest risk assessment on 13 October, concluded that the risk of a case in the EU remains low.  However, the increase in cases in the affected countries means that the risk of a case being imported into Europe has increased.<\/p><p>  Environmental conditions in Ireland do not support the natural reservoirs or vectors of any of the viruses that cause viral haemorrhagic fever, VHF.  Given appropriate infection control, the risk of transmission of Ebola in Ireland is considered very low.  Should a case occur, it is likely that the case will be somebody who has been evacuated into Ireland.  There may be one or two cases and in those circumstances, they can be handled in the national isolation unit in the Mater hospital.  There is no reason to believe that emergency departments will be swamped or services overwhelmed.  This has not happened to date in any Western country, and indeed, in more developed African countries, such as Nigeria, where an outbreak was successfully contained.  That is not a reason to say that there will not be several suspect cases and we need to be prepared for them and learn from experiences emerging in other countries.  As everyone will appreciated, this is very much an evolving situation and our response, and the level of our response, must evolve as the situation does.<\/p><p>  The committee will be aware that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in his capacity as Minister for Defence, chairs the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning which comprises Ministers and senior officials of Government Departments and public authorities, senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, and officials of other key public authorities which have a lead or support role in Government emergency planning.  The Government task force is the top-level structure which gives policy and direction, and which co-ordinates and oversees the emergency planning activities of all Departments and public authorities.  It promotes the best possible use of resources and compatibility among different planning requirements.<\/p><p>  Preparedness for major public health emergencies is a critical function of the health service and of the whole of Government.  Emergency planning in Ireland is structured around the \"lead Government Department\" principle.  There are currently 41 emergency types, each with a lead Department set out in annex A of the strategic emergency planning guidance.  The Department that is responsible for an activity in normal conditions retains that responsibility during a major emergency.  In accordance with established procedures as agreed by Government, the lead Department is responsible for co-ordinating the whole of Government response to a particular emergency and chairs the national co-ordination group in relation to that emergency.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health is the lead Department for two types of emergency: pandemic influenza and other public health emergencies; and biological incidents, where incident is primarily a public health incident.  A good example of this is the swine flu, where the response was managed and led by the Department of Health with input, where necessary, from others.  Ebola virus disease is another example.  The national response can be divided into two components: first, the health service response which will be the main subject of my opening statement; and, second, other specific elements of preparedness that are the responsibility of other line Ministers.  Let me firstly deal with the latter.<\/p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has lead responsibility for emergencies abroad involving Irish citizens.  His Department has issued detailed travel advice for the affected countries and continues to work actively with my Department, the European Union and international partners on contingency plans should an Irish citizens become infected abroad.  In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, through Irish Aid, has been managing Ireland's development and humanitarian response to the crisis, and has been out to visit the region.<\/p><p>  In relation to ports and airports, the port health group, in its role as medical officers of health, has had regular meetings with port authorities in its jurisdiction.  Updates on the Ebola outbreak in 2014 have been sent to the environmental port health officers.  Protocols are in place for viral haemorrhagic fever risk assessment by ambulance personnel at airports and shipping ports.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has specific responsibility for ports and has assisted in ensuring that information requirements at both sea and airports are in place in line with the international advice provided.<\/p><p>  The health service response is the major element of Ireland's national Ebola preparedness.  First, it provides the expert advice and guidance to other Departments.  Second, it puts in place the specific arrangements for an appropriate public health and clinical response to any case that might arise in this country.<\/p><p>  It may be helpful for me to go through the major elements of our Ebola preparedness.  Firstly, the epidemiological situation is assessed on a continuing basis using international data from ECDC and from the WHO.  This information helps to inform both the international risk assessments conducted by ECDC and also the national level risk assessments that are specific to Ireland.<\/p><p>  The EU decision on serious cross-border threats to health, agreed under the Irish Presidency, came into force in November 2013.  The decision provides a coherent framework for tackling all serious cross-border public health threats by addressing three main areas: first, preparedness and response planning; second, risk monitoring and assessment; and, third, risk management and crisis communication.  Ireland is represented on the EU Health Security Committee, which was set up to co-ordinate health threats at EU level, by officials from the Department of Health.  This is chaired by the EU Commission and all 28 member states are represented.  Teleconferences have been held regularly on Ebola since April 2014, with the latest held on 14 October.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive Emerging Viral Threats Group and the Ebola Scientific Advisory Group have met recently to review the situation and approve national guidance for Ebola and other emerging viral threats to health.  Late last week, the CMO chaired a meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to discuss the issue.  In addition, the office of the CMO has been in regular communication with colleagues in Northern Ireland and Britain to discuss national and international developments.<\/p><p>  The matter was also discussed in Milan last month at the informal Council of Ministers meeting, which I attended.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has issued guidance to hospitals and GPs, including an algorithm for the assessment of VHFs and clinical assessment forms and advice for health care workers.  These include humanitarian aid workers, returning or coming to Ireland following travel from an area affected by the Ebola virus.<\/p><p>  Extensive information has been provided for hospital clinicians, general practitioners and other health care workers to enable rapid identification of suspected Ebola patients in other settings, and their urgent management by the HPSC.  Health care staff in the national isolation unit and hospitals around the country have received information and advice on identification and management of Ebola.<\/p><p>  There is also extensive guidance relating to infection prevention and control which clearly describes the steps that staff must take to ensure that they protect themselves and other patients in the event of the presentation of a case or suspected case of Ebola.  The HSE has distributed personal protective equipment packs to GP practices, out-of-hours services and ambulances, and many will have them anyway from previous threats.<\/p><p>  The HSE has been active in informing the public about the disease.  It has produced specific information for travellers and those who have returned recently from affected areas and information posters are on display in airports.  Advice has also been distributed to airports and ports and to educational settings.<\/p><p>  The issue of airport screening has been raised.  This has been the subject of extensive discussion at EU and international level.  At the most recent meeting of the EU Health Security Committee, a number of options for inward screening at airports for Ebola were discussed.  It remains the view, based on advice from ECDC and the World Health Organization, that it is far more effective to support the implementation of exit screening in affected countries.  However, it was noted that the provision of clear information to passengers from affected countries, particularly on symptoms and how to access health care, are important measures in preventing the spread of the disease.<\/p> <p> I would specifically like to address the concerns raised by unions in recent days.  It is reasonable that health care workers would be concerned about the risk of transmission to them of infections as virulent as Ebola, and although it is unlikely, it is possible.  We have seen a number of health care workers being infected in Spain and in Texas.  For this reason, we need to step up our preparedness.  This will involve training, in particular at hospital level, dry runs and the provision of further equipment.<\/p><p> It is also vital we have the co-operation and commitment of our front-line health care professionals to enable us to respond appropriately.  Meetings have been arranged with the HSE.  In fact, a meeting took place yesterday.   It is hoped the concerns can be allayed and further actions taken and we can all reassure the public that Ireland is prepared.<\/p><p> Considerable public health planning is under way with a range of bodies and professionals about the implications of the Ebola emergency in west Africa.  My Department will continue to work closely with the HSE, other Departments, EU member states and the World Health Organization to co-ordinate measures to tackle the Ebola epidemic and to protect Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600012#L00100","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413453300,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Has the task force met at ministerial level to discuss this issue and outline the contingency plans that would be in place in the event of a suspected case or a live case arriving on our shores?  Have there been any suspected cases of Ebola to date in this country?  If so, did the response follow through as if it was an actual case?<\/p><p>  Concerns have been raised by health care professional representative groups, including the IMO and others, in regard to the preparedness of Ireland in the event of a case in this country.  The Minister alluded to the risks to health care professionals.  The level of contraction of the disease by health care professionals in west Africa is quite alarming.  We saw the transmission of the disease in Texas and Spain.  There are legitimate concerns among health care professionals.  Is the Minister satisfied everything is being done to address the concerns raised by union representatives and individuals who have expressed concerns about our preparedness?<\/p><p>  Two issues strike me as a lay person.  If a person is suspected of having Ebola, he or she should present himself or herself at a GP surgery.  I am a little confused as to why that is the place to go.  Should there not be a more formalised place to which he or she could present himself or herself?<\/p><p>  I refer to the national isolation unit in the Mater hospital.  I know we have the best equipment and isolation units in place and we have negative pressurised chambers and so on, but at the same time, should we not learn from others that taking people who have Ebola to high density places is not the best practice?  Is that not something that should be looked at, not only in the context of Ebola but other diseases which may arrive on these shores from time to time?<\/p><p>  I do not want to be overtly political on this but the health care professionals have legitimate concerns.  I do not know whether they are playing politics with this, to which the Minister alluded, but I know one thing for sure and that is that two health care professionals in Texas and a nurse in Spain contracted Ebola and the priest who brought it to Spain died.  The very localised nature of this indicates that the health care professionals are the ones most likely to contract Ebola.  They have legitimate concerns.  Rather than having megaphone diplomacy or otherwise on this, we should have real engagement to ensure their concerns are alleviated and addressed.  Some GPs have informed me that the pack being sent may not be sufficient in terms of information and the protocols to be put in place to transfer a suspected case onwards to the national isolation unit.  The equipment itself, in terms of gowns, masks and gloves, could be expanded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600013#M00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1413453300,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions.  Only a couple of days ago, one of the national newspapers highlighted commentary from the IMO - I know a meeting was held with the IMO yesterday - which indicated some GPs had still not received the safety suit and goggles.  Will the Minister indicate he is 100% certain all GP practices, out-of-hours services and the presentation areas within our hospital sites have not only received the protective equipment but have actually had instruction on its use?  In the first instance, I would think how the protective equipment is put on is hugely important but, in the context of a case presenting, its removal would be of great importance also.  Will the Minister elaborate on this?<\/p><p>  I note that the medical director and head of the emergency department in St. James's Hospital has confirmed that it has carried out several practice runs to prepare for a potential Ebola patient presenting.  Is that practice in train across all of the sites where it should take place?<\/p><p>  Other than the situation in regard to doctors in GP settings and hospital settings, what about nursing staff and other staff, including GP and hospital reception staff?  Are we ensuring all those who could be - I emphasise \"could be\" - exposed to a case presenting are being properly advised and given the essential training as to how to deal with it?  Will the Minister elaborate on the capacity of the Mater hospital isolation unit, its current utilisation, if any, and its preparedness?<\/p><p>  In the course of my recent priority question to the Minister, where this matter was first addressed in an exchange between us in the D&aacute;il Chamber a number of weeks back, I asked him about advances in terms of treatment and I queried the whole situation in regard to ZMapp.  Does the Minister have an update on developments on treatment for Ebola?  What is his Department's most up-to-date information in regard to the speculated medical response to cases presenting?<\/p><p>  The IMO issued a statement following yesterday's meeting in which it highlighted a number outstanding concerns.  It is questioning the wisdom of advising patients displaying Ebola symptoms to visit GP surgeries.  It does not believe that is an appropriate setting.  There is also the issue of robust protocols in terms of emergency department settings in our hospital sites.  Again, these are very legitimate concerns which members and the wider public have.<\/p><p>  I mention the imperative of training sufficient numbers of hospital staff, which goes to the wider aspect of this, to which I referred, the shortage of public health doctors in general, and the critical need for agreed arrangements to deal with circumstances where medical staff must deal with a patient displaying symptoms of Ebola.<\/p><p>  I have a specific question which I am not at liberty to pose in a public engagement with the Minister, but I would like to ask about any concerns in regard to people arriving on our shores, or coming back here, having visited any of the countries where cases have presented.<\/p> <p>The advice is simple and understandable but there are real concerns within cohorts around any such given presentation.  Does the Minister consider that is enough?  Does he really believe that self monitoring is sufficient in that instance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600013#M00600","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413453900,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome the Minister.  It is very likely that all the reassurance we are getting is entirely correct.  It is most unlikely we are going to see any kind of apocalyptic scenario such as has been portrayed by Hollywood with respect to newly emerging viral illnesses.  However, it is very plausible that we will get a few cases.  It does not require any kind of conspiracy theory or apocalyptic bent to imagine that happening.  I do think it makes sense because of the potential catastrophe that arises with respect to this infection that we prepare for a scenario somewhat worse than is likely.  It may not necessarily be a question of preparing for the worst but we should prepare for something which is a little worse than is likely.  Merely preparing for the likely is not enough.<\/p><p>  We are hearing a lot of the word &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; but this has moved very quickly.  There were no infections in western health care workers two weeks ago, and now there have been three and they have occurred in very sophisticated medical scenarios, not in places where people did not realise they were looking after somebody who potentially had Ebola, but in places where they did.  We have already seen the most sophisticated and very successful international infection control organisation, the CDC, being somewhat flat-footed and finding itself behaving two days ago a little bit like a deer caught in headlights and suggesting there must have been a breach of protocols when somebody became infected and then understanding that it was quite possible that the protocols themselves were adhered to but were inadequate.  We have not got clarity on the issue yet, but what we do know is that the CDC itself has ramped up the level of scrutiny and the level of intervention it is carrying out.  Its &ldquo;hit squads&rdquo; will go around the country and are now advising a higher level of personal protection.  We must understand without being alarmist that there is a possibility that the situation will be somewhat worse than it was.<\/p><p>  I have a number of specific questions for the Minister, one which was mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  We need clarity on the advice given to GPs because it looks like the original advice was to visit and that has now been downgraded to contact.  If someone does contact his or her GP, what is the specific instruction the GP will be given if an issue arises?  Could the Minister please tell me how many doctors we have employed in the specialty of public health in Ireland, a rough idea of how that compares to international standards, and how many of them are doing front-line public health jobs and how many are in administrative roles?<\/p><p>  I could get emotional talking about the medical experts dealing with the crisis.  To date, 10% of the deaths have been among doctors and nurses.  That has never happened before.  There has never been such a disease in modern times, where the people who get the sickest are the most infectious; that the people who need health care most pose the greatest threat to the nurses and doctors who treat them.  They are great people.  How many Irish nurses, doctors, missionary workers and aid workers are involved who are potentially going to get infected?  Do we have a policy?  Will the routine policy be that people will be repatriated?  If they wish to be repatriated, will we have the facility to repatriate?  Do we have the facilities in place for safe containment?  I am fully supportive of any Irish person who gets the illness being repatriated.<\/p><p>  Amplifying a little on the questions Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked, what is the containment level and what is the personal protection level we are using in the Mater hospital unit at the moment?  Is it level 4?  From what is coming out of the CDC it looks like it is a moving target right now.  The CDC is ramping up its own recommendations.  Do we have pressure suits and, if so, how many?<\/p><p>  With the current staffing and equipment level, how many simultaneous cases of Ebola can be handled in the Mater hospital unit?  Do we have provision for staffing to recant from the buddy system everybody is recommending right now, which is effectively double staffing on an hour on and hour off basis?  Can we cope with that?  Do we have the ICU beds?  What level of training has been given and what is the specific plan to increase the level of training?  This is a very important undertaking.  I hope it is an example of something we will never need to use but we might, and we need to be ready.<\/p><p>  Another scary element is that a vastly larger number of people is infected with the virus right now than has ever occurred previously.  The number of virus particles in humans right now is probably ten or 20 logs higher than it ever has been before.  As the capacity for a mutation is possibly greater than it has been before we do need to keep ahead of this one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600014#N00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1413453900,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation this morning.

I will not be able to answer them all but I will answer as many as I can and then I will hand over to Dr. Holohan.  The task force has met at ministerial level.  We met about two weeks ago.  At the time we decided not to issue a statement or hold a press conference as we did not want to unnecessarily heighten concern.  The task force expects to meet again at ministerial level.<\/p><p>  I was asked about having a suspect case, which we have.  Members will be aware of a person who died in Donegal over the summer who had been to the region and had to be tested for Ebola post mortem.  The person did not have Ebola.  One or two people have presented in usual scenarios claiming they have Ebola but they have never been to the region or been in contact with anyone from the region.  None the less, one cannot dismiss such cases and they must be taken seriously.  There have been approximately a dozen cases, only one of which could possibly have been Ebola, in the sense that the person concerned was in the region or was in contact with someone from the region.  My colleagues might provide more information on the case.<\/p><p>  It is important to point out that there is a difference in what we can learn from West Africa to what we can learn from Texas and Spain.  Speaking to people on the ground, including the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, it appears that health services are virtually non-existent in that part of Africa.  We often hear people talk flippantly about the Irish health service being \"Third World\", but it certainly is not.  Liberia has the same population as the island of Ireland and a total of 60 doctors.  That is what people are dealing with.  They do not have proper hospitals even in the capital city.  Not too far away in Nigeria, which is a much more developed country, there was an outbreak of Ebola.  There were 20 cases which resulted in eight deaths but no deaths have occurred in recent weeks.  The situation has been contained there.  In between those West African countries and Nigeria is C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Ivory Coast, which has had no case at all.  It is important to point out that what is happening in West Africa is first related to the fact that they are war-torn countries with effectively no health care infrastructure and they are countries in which the virus thrives because of the environmental conditions.<\/p><p>  We can learn a lot from Texas and Spain.  If Ebola does appear in Ireland it is much more likely to be along the lines of what happened in those places, namely, affecting somebody who has been repatriated or has come back independently and ends up in an isolation unit.  We are still learning.  What seems to have happened in Spain and Texas where health care workers got infected has been around the degowning procedures.  They are now recommending that people should be observed as they degown and gown.  We would not have known that a few weeks ago.<\/p> <p>The situation is evolving and we need to learn from what is happening and adapt to it.  I am satisfied that we are ready but the situation is escalating and we need to escalate our response to it from now on.  We must also be ready to de-escalate it should the outbreak be contained in west Africa.  If somebody who is being repatriated is taken to the national isolation unit, he or she will be taken in a sealed pod.  Dr. Holohan will elaborate on that later.<\/p><p> I was asked to respond to some of the concerns that have been raised about staff.  The concerns that have been raised by trade unions about their members and staff are entirely reasonable and legitimate.  I should point out that any staff infected in the western world have been isolation unit staff, and not routine or emergency department hospital staff or GPs, but it is still a matter of concern.  Concerns like that are best addressed through the regular meeting that we have.  It is very important that we support the front-line health care professionals and that we use their networks to get the message out to health care professionals, some of whom might be a little sanguine about this and are only waking up to it in the past couple of days as it developed as a media story.  By and large, I would prefer that when it comes to a public health emergency of any sort that we set aside normal politics and that applies to all of us around this table and our different political parties and it applies to everyone in the health sector as well.  When it comes to a major public health emergency or the risk of a major public health emergency, we should set aside normal concerns about normal politics and normal debates and get behind the effort that must be taken.  <\/p><p> I have not read the IMO statement but my understanding is that the advice is not to go to the GP's surgery but to call a GP.  A GP or a well trained practice nurse would be able to triage a patient.  One cannot expect patients to know about Ebola but GPs and practice nurses would be able to identify very quickly as to whether there is any possibility that the person could have Ebola.  They would be able to triage a patient and then deal with it from that case.  There will be people who have a high temperature and be concerned that they have Ebola, even though they have never been to the region or never been in contact with anyone who had Ebola.<\/p><p> When it comes to aid workers and people returning from that region, they are well briefed and well trained on what they should and should not do.  They are asked to contact the public health department on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC website, which is very good.  It is worth looking at all the algorithms and protocols on it.  There are telephone numbers as to whom a concerned GP can contact, as well as telephone number that a person coming home from the region can contact and get advice from a public health specialist so that the person is directed to the right place.  One thing we may have to consider and which we are already considering, is putting together a team that can move in and go into a hospital if there is a suspected case and help the hospital to deal with it, if the staff of the hospital are not able to do it themselves.  When it comes to practice runs, they have happened in some hospitals, but I know for a fact that they have not happened in other hospitals.  We need to ensure that dry runs and practice runs happen in every hospital.  That has to be led by the infection control and emergency staff on the ground, but we will be doing texts to ensure that has been done.<\/p><p> I cannot say for certain that every practice and out-of-hours service has got the equipment but I know that 5,000 packs have been issued and there are not 5,000 GPs and out-of-hours services in the country.  If anyone does not have them, they need to let the HSE know and we will ensure they get them.<\/p><p> On the national isolation unit, NIU, I have all the details on the number of beds.  I am not sure if members want me to go through the figures as it will take time to go through the details.  I will leave that to my colleagues.<\/p><p> There is no vaccine for Ebola.  The drug ZMapp is an experimental medicine and is only made as it is requested.  We do not know if it works.  The treatment for Ebola is supportive measures and also very tight infective control around it.  I do not know off the top of my head the number of public health doctors in the country but I can get the figures for members.<\/p><p> I do not know the exact number of Irish aid workers specifically on the ground but there are 54 Irish citizens in those three countries and they are accounted for and registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  To the best of my knowledge it is not correct to say that 10% of the deaths from Ebola are doctors and nurses, it is about 5%.  When it comes to the repatriation of an Irish person overseas, that is something that will have to be considered at the time.  Ireland does not have the capacity to repatriate somebody from west Africa, most small European countries do not, and what is happening at foreign affairs level is that efforts are being made to put together something on a European level, which is of particular interest to smaller European countries that do not have a big airforce and are not able to do what the British, French or the Italians could do.<\/p><p> If there is an Irish citizen overseas, consideration will have to be given to the scenario.  One will have to consider if the patients is well enough to be transported, as sometimes they are not.  Consideration has to be given as to whether they can be treated on the ground in theatre.  If they can be treated well on the ground that would make more sense that taking the risk of repatriating them.  We need to bear in mind that by its nature, evacuating somebody into Ireland does bring the disease into Ireland.  It is a difficult to think about out but it is true, the only reason that the Spanish and American health care workers have been infected is because people were evacuated to America and Spain.  From a very heartless epidemiological point of view one is helping to spread the virus through repatriation.  At the same time I cannot possibly countenance the idea that we would leave an Irish citizen without care in the theatre.  That is an issue we will have to consider on an individual case basis, should it arise.  The NHS is trying to establish its own hospital in the region to help treat aid workers should they become infected.<\/p><p> Senator Burke asked a pertinent question about the different aid agencies certainly M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF and the International Medical Corps are well used to dealing with situations like this - I cannot say for certain about the others - aid agencies can help in different ways.  They would not all be treating patients, some of them would be proving logistical support and other things that are often just as important, helping out the governments on the ground and the general government that barely exists in west Africa.  People who criticise democracy and politics and everything else can see what the alternative to government and politics is.  This is very evident now in west Africa.<\/p><p> I will ask Dr. Holohan to fill in some of the gaps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600014#N00400","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413454500,"counter":549,"content":"<p>The gaps are few but I will clarify from my information that the number of people in whom suspicions have arisen and where testing has taken place is 14 and about 23 tests done in the 14 people.

The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, CIDRAP, at the University of Minnesota has just advised the CDC and the World Health Organization, WHO, that the aerosol transmission of small or large particles is possible.  The WHO has stated that face masks should be worn and the Department has sent those to GPs.  During the 1998 situation, however, the WHO called for the use of respirators, in particular powered air purifying respirators.  We know of some definite means of transmission, but we do not know them all.  Increasingly, CIDRAP's research is showing that aerosol transmission is possible.  Have we powered air purifying respirators?  How many do we have?  Where are they?  If we have none, how much are they and should we be buying some?  CIDRAP has advised the US Government to make resources available immediately so that such respirators can be on hand.  The WHO has stated on its website that standard masks are okay when dealing with viral haemorrhagic fevers, but it also recommends the use of respirators.<\/p> <p>I accept that we are somewhat prepared for the unlikely event of an infection happening here.  If it did, how prepared are we in terms of respirators and other things?  Let us say this has evolved from the Zaire strain which was the first, through the Congo and now we have today - call it what one will - the Liberia strain.  Has it evolved to the extent that it is much more infectious from aerosol?  For example, sneezing or even flushing a toilet can put pathogen-laden aerosols into the air.<\/p><p> While I do not want to go into crude detail, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy suggests that a health professional without a respirator attending an infected patient who has had an episode of diarrhoea is not safe.

I will answer the ones I can and then hand back to Dr. Holohan and Dr. O'Flanagan.<\/p><p>  Exit screening is in place in the airports of the three most affected countries.  Of course it is never possible to be sure that it is 100% up to scratch; that is the nature of these things.  So far the only airport in Europe that has decided to carry out entry screening is Heathrow, which has direct and connecting flights to the region.  However, it is something we need to keep under consideration.<\/p><p>  The general WHO advice is not to do it on the basis that people who are asymptomatic - a person is asymptomatic for 21 days by and large - will not show up.  What will show up are many people with coughs and colds and other illnesses, who have a temperature, but not Ebola.  The only real benefit in it might be contact tracing.  We need to keep it under consideration.  To date, the advice is not to do it and to assist with the exit screening rather than doing entry screening in other airports.  Even in the UK, although it is being done at Heathrow, it is not being done at any other airport.  For the ports there is a protocol and I can send on those details.<\/p><p>  The advice for the public is important.  The HPSC website is very useful in this regard.  The aid workers have all been told to register with their local public health department and all the numbers are there.  They are told how to monitor in the first 21 days.  For other people, the website states, \"If you have had no contact with Ebola patients or articles potentially contaminated by them then you do not need to take any precautions as you are not at risk\".  However, if a person has been in contact with Ebola patients and in contact with potentially contaminated items, the website recommends that a person becoming ill within 21 days of return from the region \"should contact your doctor for assessment and let him\/her know of your recent travel history\".  What is envisaged in the guidelines is that a person would contact, presumably by telephone, his or her doctor who can then follow the protocol and assess if the person needs further action.<\/p><p>  The IMO statement, which is in front of me, questions the wisdom of advising patients displaying Ebola symptoms to visit their GP.  The guidelines do not state \"visit\", but state \"contact\".  However, that may need to be made more clear lest there be a misunderstanding there.  I can clarify that the guidelines do not suggest that people visit their GP.  They suggest the circumstances under which they should make contact with the public health doctors or their GP.<\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about specialised units outside a general hospital.  I do not fully know the answer to that question, but I imagine the reason they are in a major hospital is that they would need close access to other hospital facilities, such as ICU, radiology and laboratories.  Without that there would be all the risk of transferring a patient and his or her samples to and from a hospital.<\/p><p>  Deputy Conway's question related to the disposal of garments.  That certainly could arise if we had a confirmed case.  That relates to the issue of category A waste.  I might let the CMO speak on that because he has been doing some work on that today.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher asked about other parts of the country.  We will be asking hospitals to identify which isolation bed they will use if they suspect a case.  All the acute hospitals would have isolation facilities.  To the best of my knowledge, none of them would be up to the level of the national isolation unit, but that is the nature of a national isolation unit; it is at a different level.  It is the kind of thing of which each country - or each state in a large country - would have only one.<\/p><p>  I will also ask the CMO to speak on the issue of aerosol transmission.  GPs obviously would not be doing aerosolising procedures in their surgeries, but there are other ways to create aerosols as the Senator pointed out.<\/p><p>  Deputy Healy asked about the different patient scenarios.  There are many different scenarios.  When we had the emergency task force meeting two weeks ago, we started to come up with different scenarios.  All sorts of scenarios could arise and we have gone through some of them.  Again, I might ask my colleagues to comment on them further.  There is obviously a huge difference between somebody who we know has a confirmed case of Ebola who is brought into the country and a suspected case that may just turn up somewhere.<\/p> <p>We have had a couple of them already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600017#Q00800","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413456300,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Conway's questions on the disposal of the waste.  The waste is termed \"category A waste\".  It is highly infectious and there needs to be specific arrangements in place for its disposal.  It is generated largely through the secretion of bodily fluids which, unfortunately, are secreted in copious amounts by individuals when they are symptomatic.  Obviously, all the materials used form part of that waste so, in the first instance, it has to be handled appropriately and, in the second instance, it has to be disposed of appropriately.  The arrangements the Deputy referenced in the US, in terms of industrial autoclaves and so on, are the kinds of appropriate arrangements, including things like incineration, to dispose of that waste.<\/p><p>  There is an ongoing discussion on arrangements for that.  There are two potential methodologies.  We are in discussion with the Environmental Protection Agency, through the HSE, around the licensing of an appropriate facility to provide for disposal of that waste in this country, should the need arise and, in the interim, to provide for a mechanism, should it be necessary, for it to be disposed of through international agreements - essentially, its exportation out of the country through channels that are appropriate to handle that form of waste.  It is an important consideration in the context of the handling of these issues.<\/p><p>  To go back to Senator Crown's question, I think his information is correct in terms of the current designation of those beds but again I stress the point that this is a dynamic situation and I go back to swine flu, for example.  We had a static capacity in terms of ICU.  It became clear, in the context of that particular epidemic, that it was not sufficient and a plan was put in place to ramp up that capacity very quickly.  Extra machines, ventilators and so on were required and new areas were identified within our hospitals to allow them to ramp up that capacity quite quickly.  On that basis, similar discussions are beginning to happen with the Mater hospital about what would be the eventualities if there was pressure on that existing static capacity.  How would it ramp up that procedure?  How would it commission and bring into effect other areas that could operate to the same standard of isolation?  That is a discussion that is going on between the HSE and the people in that particular unit.  We would not sit here and say this is the static capacity and it will always be sufficient for any given scenario.  We have to be able to adapt, based on what we get.<\/p><p>  I will also go back to the discussion around repatriation.  When we have a question that may arise, in the context of repatriation, there will, in spite of our need to have in place agreements and mechanisms to repatriate individuals when that need might arise, still have to be an assessment on the basis of the clinical status of that particular individual as well as all the considerations like, for example, capacity, which I mentioned, around the repatriation of that individual at that point in time.  This is important in terms of people who might be making decisions about going to these areas and potentially becoming involved in activity which involves high risk.  We would not for a moment say that people should not do that.  It is a very appropriate and worthwhile thing for people to do, but they should do it in an informed way.  Some of the information we have provided, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the aid agencies, deals with some of this and reminds people of the importance of understanding that even if they do not pick up Ebola but become ill in some other way or injured and find themselves using health care facilities in these affected countries, they will become exposed to these viruses.  That is a specific risk of which they need to be aware.  The repatriation of those individuals in those situations could be challenging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600018#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1413456300,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Do we have any plans or procedures in place for aid workers returning home from these affected areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600018#R00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413456300,"counter":585,"content":"<p>We have specific information which is directed and supplied to them as to their understanding of the nature of the risk and their ability to be able to self-monitor and report or, if necessary, participate in active surveillance when they come back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600018#R00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413456300,"counter":586,"content":"<p>On the question on respirators and the evidence of airborne transmission, the only studies that have shown airborne transmission were done in animal testing.  There has never been any evidence of airborne transmission of Ebola between humans.  Previous studies have looked at family members and at who got it and who did not and it is the people who have direct contact with the bodies and bodily fluids.  All the evidence points to direct contact.<br\/>The only time we are worried about aerosol is, as Dr. Holohan said, in relation to aerosolising procedures, like intubating the patient.  Those procedures are not done in general practice.  Respirators and FFP3 masks are available in hospitals where there is the potential for aerosolising procedures.  The FFP3 masks stop aerosols just as much as powered hoods.  Staff have FFP3 masks.  If they wish to use a powered hood, that is possible, but is not necessary according to guidance from CDC, the WHO, etc.  Obviously, the transmission in the recent cases in Texas and in Spain has caused concerns among health care workers, so CDC is very carefully looking at where there was potential breakdown in regard to personal protective equipment, PPE.  These issues will be fully examined and lessons will be learned, but the initial information coming out is that it may have been more a problem when people were taking off the PPE rather than the effect of the PPE when they were actually wearing it.  The most dangerous time for a health care worker is actually taking off PPE.<br\/>The other thing I would like to stress is that patients become more infectious the more the disease progresses.  When patients present to GPs or in emergency departments, they do not have the same viral load they have when the disease progresses and they are extremely ill.  The greatest risk to health care workers is when caring for cases <i>in extremis<\/i>.  People have to be aware of that.  I can understand the concerns of health care workers but where we need to make sure people have this right is in terms of health care workers who are handling the extremely ill patients who, as Dr. Holohan said, are producing copious amounts of bodily fluids.  That is the time when they are most infectious.<br\/>As was said, people are using the buddy system and are making sure that when they take off the PPE, they are doing so appropriately.  Those systems are being practised and are being put in place for those who will handle the really critically ill patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600018#R00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Darina O'Flanagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1413456300,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Are we training paramedics who may be put in that position?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600018#R00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413456300,"counter":588,"content":"<p>The national ambulance service has training.

As part of our plans, we provide training on an ongoing basis, but the engagement of people with training has to be greater as we get closer and as the risk changes.  As we become more concerned, the level of understanding, but also concern, rises.  It would be challenging for us to run training programmes for GPs if there was no Ebola.  The likelihood is that we would get very little in the way of attendance from individuals who did not perceive that there was some risk.  There is always a point in time at which it is appropriate to step up arrangements, including training arrangements, and so on and that is one of the things we are doing, as Mr. Maguire said.<\/p><p>  The principles behind a lot of what it is we do is that we have good and clear governance around how we make our decisions and how we assess our evidence.  It is based on good information, good surveillance, good practice and dry runs of our procedures and arrangements. <\/p><p>  I think Deputy Healy asked for a walk through from the point at which a person presents through to the Mater hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600018#R00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1413456900,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Simulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600019#S00100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413456900,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. O'Flanagan to take that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014101600019#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413456900,"counter":593,"content":"<p>The questions were how a patient might present and how they would be referred.  A patient can present in two ways.  As we have said, if a patient returns, they can see on the posters that if they have recently come back from an affected area, they should phone their GP.  If they do so their GP will take their history, see what the symptoms are and decide either that they are at high risk or they are not.  If they are at high risk, the GP will telephone the hospital to arrange a referral and he or she will be told where the patient is to be sent.<\/p><p>  Next the patient goes for an assessment in the hospital.  There is a risk assessment form they complete within the hospital to assess if they are high risk.  Then they get a lab test taken which is sent to the National Virus Reference Laboratory.  If the test is positive, the clinician phones the national isolation unit to discuss transfer to it and the national isolation unit contacts the National Ambulance Service to arrange the appropriate transfer. <\/p><p>  The other issue raised was what happens if a case arises abroad but is repatriated.
