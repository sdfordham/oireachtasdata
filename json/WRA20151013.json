This requires the CSO to define the scope of the public sector (which includes the General Government Sector) in Ireland. This classification process is governed by legally binding accounting rules which must be used by all EU countries.  The public sector includes all bodies which are directly or indirectly controlled by government.  The general government sector comprises public sector bodies which are classified as 'non-market', i.e. not operating on a commercial basis.  The borrowings of this latter group are included in general government debt as reported under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP).<\/p><p>The CSO maintain and publish  the Register of Public Sector Bodies (including General Government Bodies) in Ireland.  The current version of the register (reference year 2014) is available at.  The composition of this register is not static.  Government controlled bodies are established, closed and merged over time.  Also the market\/non-market status of bodies must be continually reviewed.  Consequently the Register of Public Sector Bodies is reviewed and up-dated periodically (at least annually).  Recently the CSO and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform established and carried out a survey of central government departments to routinise the updating of the register.  Preliminary results of this survey are reflected in the latest version of the register, which lists the non-market agencies which are classified to the general government sector, by Department.  This information is available in Table 1.1.2 of the register which is also reproduced below.  A separate table in the Register provides a listing of Departments of State, Additional Votes and Extra-budgetary funds.<\/p><p>While all of the bodies listed above can potentially contribute to government debt not all of them will necessarily have borrowings in a given year. The composition of general government debt and the contribution of different parts of government to debt in recent years are shown in Tables 7 and 9 of the CSO's annual Government Finance Statistics

The Central Bank had briefed industry representatives a number of weeks ago that it was proposing significant increases in those\u00a0levies in 2015. The proposed increases were\u00a0driven by a proliferation of legislative regulation and corresponding regulatory activity, a need to meet a shortfall from 2014's levies\u00a0and an increase in staff pension costs arising from Financial Reporting Standard 17, coupled with\u00a0prevailing low yields on the bond market.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank's original proposals have since been revised to partially mitigate those increases as per a statement of 30th September 2015 published on the Central Bank's website. The revised proposals significantly reduced the increase in pension costs charged to the regulated sector in 2015\u00a0which is instead spread over coming years thereby easing the burden on\u00a0financial services sector firms this year.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that a robust regulatory environment benefits the financial services industry by promoting stability, a level playing field and facilitating prudent development and innovation. A well regulated financial services sector also benefits\u00a0consumers, industry, and the economy at large.\u00a0In order to ensure a well regulated financial services sector the\u00a0Central Bank must be sufficiently resourced, particularly in terms of\u00a0staff who are key to an effective regulatory regime.\u00a0Pensions are a standard component in financial regulation costs\u00a0given their link to staff costs.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 32D of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank is required to seek my approval for the Regulations prescribing industry levies. Following the publication of the Central Bank's revised proposals, which significantly\u00a0reduced the pension element of the 2015 levies, I approved the Regulations prescribing the 2015 levies on 7 October last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300055#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rebates","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300055#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[35203\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300055#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No.79 of 30 September 2015, if the individual concerned, as a citizen of the European Union, may make a claim for a value added tax refund from the Revenue Commissioners, or equivalent agency, in the European Union state in which the appliance was purchased, given that the mobility appliance in question is not available for purchase in this State; if not, his plans to legislate in regard to this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Following that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies.  <\/p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner. This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that any required processes or procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.<\/p>  <p>  My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. <\/p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank\u00a0is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. <\/p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles,\u00a0it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and myself, as Minister for Finance are working together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in\u00a0Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced\u00a0at end December 2015. \u00a0It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.\u00a0 These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.\u00a0 I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.\u00a0 The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.\u00a0 It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period.

However, the Deputy will no doubt be aware that\u00a0borrowers whose loans are sold are now protected by the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 which was enacted on 8\u00a0July this year. The purpose of the Act is to ensure that consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loan. The Act\u00a0requires entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct. Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, need to be authorised by the Central Bank. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm.<\/p><p>All consumer and relevant SME loans sold by regulated financial institutions are covered by this Act. Borrowers are\u00a0therefore restored to the protections they previously had, such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises. Borrowers who previously had access to the Financial Services Ombudsman also have this right restored by this legislation. These borrowers, including those whose loans are owned by Cerberus, can complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman if they are unable to resolve the complaint with the firm.<\/p><p>The Central Bank is the competent authority in Ireland for the purposes of the Act and will implement a regulatory framework for credit servicing firms.

For the 2013 half-year the payment date was 1 July 2013 and is 1 January for all subsequent years, for example payment for 2014 was due on 1 January 2014, payment for 2015 was due on 1 January 2015 and payment for 2016 will become due on 1 January 2016. However, where a property owner chooses to use either the Single Debit Authority or Annual Debit Authority payment option to meet his\/her LPT liability, Revenue will not deduct the amount until 21 March in the due year, for example the payment due on 1 January 2016 will not be deducted until 21 March 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue also provides for payment of LPT on a phased basis beyond the statutory 1 January due date to assist people in meeting their liabilities in a manner that best suits their individual circumstances. Where property owners wish to avail of such an arrangement, having paid in a single payment the previous year, it is very important that they confirm their phased payment method preference to Revenue by the end of the preceding November so that the required arrangements can be put in place from the beginning of the due year.<\/p>  <p>  Where a property owner is already availing of a phased arrangement via direct debit from a bank account or through deduction at source from salary or pension there is no need to make any contact with Revenue as the payments automatically roll over from one year to the next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300055#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300055#WRC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[35413\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300055#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the payment of taxes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1206","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the\u00a0administration of\u00a0tax system is under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.\u00a0<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue\u00a0that it adopts a risk-based approach\u00a0to the\u00a0deployment of resources\u00a0in supporting and enforcing, through a range of compliance interventions, a strong compliance culture across all business sectors including the\u00a0restaurant and fast food sector. \u00a0In 2014 2,656 compliance interventions were carried out in the sector giving rise to a yield of &euro;8.4m in tax, interest and penalties.<\/p><p>If the person concerned\u00a0has any information of specific instances of suspected tax evasion in this sector, he\u00a0may provide such information through Revenue's\u00a0dedicated\u00a0on-line Reporting Form\u00a0for the shadow economy\u00a0available on their website at or\u00a0submit\u00a0directly to his\u00a0local\u00a0Revenue office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300055#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Renovation Incentive Scheme","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300055#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[35421\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300055#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"given the the success of the home renovation scheme, if a provision will be made for home owners who have no tax liability to gain a refund of the value added tax content of the cost of the renovation job; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

When the outline design has been completed and an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared the OPW will formally exhibit the proposals over a four week period in the City which is expected to take place in the Spring of 2016. The detailed design will be commenced after the Exhibition. Once the detailed design is complete, the Scheme will be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for Confirmation or approval as required by the Arterial Drainage Acts. <\/p>  <p>  Subject to the Scheme being Confirmed the OPW will aim to appoint a civil works contractor and commence construction within a short period thereafter. Due to the likely scale of the proposed Scheme, it is possible that the Scheme will be undertaken on a phased basis under a number of contracts. The design consultants have commenced work on a Phasing Report which will assist a structured implementation of the Scheme. This will be a very significant scheme with commensurate costs and it is anticipated that the works will take at least 4-5 years to complete. <\/p>  <p>  It was indicated by the OPW in the early stages of this project that should there be delays to the main City Scheme then every effort would be made to progress the Blackpool element of the project. Progress has been made in relation to the identification of a preferred scheme for Blackpool and this has now been separated from the main Scheme and has become a Scheme in its own right.  It is intended to bring the preferred Scheme in Blackpool forward to public Exhibition before the end of November this year. Detailed design will then be undertaken as early as possible with a procurement process expected to be undertaken in the first half of 2016 which would coincide with the Confirmation process.

Local Authorities and other stakeholders are involved in the Programme, in partnership with OPW, on Steering Groups and Progress Groups across six regional studies.  The Programme, which is focusing on 300, mainly urban, potentially significant flood risk areas, involves the production of predictive flood risk and hazard mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans.  The Plans will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences.  An OPW website, cfram.ie, provides information and updates on the CFRAM Programme.<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with a national public consultation on the draft predictive flood maps scheduled for late 2015, the draft flood maps will be made available to the county councils for their consideration following which each county council may provide observations on the maps.  The county councils will not be asked to approve the maps.  The flood maps, when finalised following this consultation process, are vital to inform the development of prioritised plans for both the structural and non structural solutions to manage flood risks.  The maps will assist the emergency response authorities with regard to responding effectively to flood events.  The maps will also be available for use as an information source for sustainable planning.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW has no role or function in relation to the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry or of insurance matters generally. The provision of insurance cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers.

The draft Flood Maps scheduled to be published later in 2015 for public consultation purposes cannot be relied upon for commercial or other decision making purposes.<\/p>  <p>  When the maps are finalised, the OPW's Flood Risk Maps will provide an analysis of the number of properties, business and other public amenities that are at risk from a predictive assessment of flood risk.

The stated aim of negotiations on investment is to secure the highest levels of liberalisation and highest standards of protection that both sides have negotiated to date.<\/p>  <p>  The mandate makes it clear that the inclusion of investment protection will depend on EU interests being met and on the final balance of the Agreement.  Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of EU and the Member States to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives in a non-discriminatory manner.<\/p>  <p>  There is an awareness of the need to reform investment arbitration systems and to that end the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for an investment court system published on 16th September set out the context for these proposed improvements.  This proposal builds on the progress achieved in the EU investment agreement negotiated with Canada and sets out four areas for further improvement: Governments&rsquo; right to regulate, establishment and functioning of tribunals, relationship between national judicial systems and an investment protection system, and an appellate mechanism.  These improvements represent a move away from privately conducted arbitration to a familiar public justice system that is accountable, transparent and subject to democratic principles.<\/p>  <p>  This means that the type of investment arbitration system under the EU US Free Trade Agreement will be a clear improvement on investment protection in existing Bilateral Investment Treaties, some of which date back to the 1950&rsquo;s.  Ireland already provides the highest protection for investors by virtue of Article 43 of our Constitution, so the policy intention of the Commission in these negotiations is not new to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome these improvements and the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to follow up on the views expressed by Member States, the European Parliament and other stakeholders through the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation process.  I have consistently reinforced the message with the Commission that the investment protection model included in any final agreement between the EU and the US must be in the interests of EU Member States.  I am of the view that the inclusion of this acceptable model of investment protection would provide a common floor of protection across the 28 EU Member States and at federal and state level in the US.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300057#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300057#WRE02650"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[35536\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300057#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when the recently completed study by the University of Limerick on the subject of zero-hour contracts will be published; if he will provide a comprehensive list of the stakeholders to be consulted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As part of the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs we launched the process for developing Action Plans for every region and the work on the preparation of the Dublin Action Plan for Jobs is currently commencing.  Two areas of particular focus will be how we can generate future entrepreneurship and investment in manufacturing and services sectors of the economy.<\/p><p><b>Table shows the total number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to County Dublin since 2011 to the end of June 2015.<\/b><table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Dublin <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>150<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>196<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>180<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>205<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015 (to end of June)<\/td><td>96<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300057#WRE03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300058#WRF00175"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[35788\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300058#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide, by county, the number of jobs supported by Enterprise Ireland at the end of Quarter 3, 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s mission is to partner with entrepreneurs, Irish business and the research and investment communities to develop Ireland&rsquo;s international trade, innovation, leadership, and competitiveness.

This review led to several significant changes at operational level. As the volume of discrepancies had decreased and there was, following the DVO operational management review, an increased capacity among local office staff to carry out such work, it was decided to discontinue the CMMS unit and to re-deploy the CMMS Unit staff to other areas of my Department where vacancies existed. In Sept 2010, my Department met with the staff side&rsquo;s representatives to discuss the redeployment of the staff that had been assigned to the CMMS unit. Following the announcement of the proposed transfers, the eleven staff of the CMMS Unit, in the period Sept-Oct 2011, lodged similar individual complaints regarding work issues against line management under the Civil Service Grievance Procedure. Mediation efforts were made on 2 occasions, namely July 2012 and Oct 2014. In the former case, the mediator withdrew from the process as he was of the view that the issues raised were not appropriate to the grievance procedure.

Vessels qualified for either of the Tiers on the basis of having caught more than 35% of the mackerel allocated to them in an average of 2 of the reference years. In order to qualify for Tier 1 allocations, a vessel had to have landed more than an average of 275 tonnes of mackerel per year. To qualify for a Tier 2 allocation, a vessel had to have landed more than 25 tonnes of mackerel per year. These quantities were chosen so as to ensure that there is no general loss of fishing opportunities to vessels with qualifying track record, based on fishing in the period 2007-2009.<\/p>  <p>  Given the long and detailed consultation process which went into development of the mackerel policy in recent years, I consider this policy settled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300058#WRF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Applications","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300058#WRF02650"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[35303\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300058#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an application for a disadvantaged areas scheme payment by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The US is one of our leading trading partners, and we have a large and growing agri-food trade surplus with them (exports of &euro;570m last year, compared to imports of &euro;268m). The drinks industry currently accounts for over 60% of the value of exports.  We have significant offensive interests in the TTIP negotiations. For example, we see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can remove some regulatory barriers. Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.   <\/p>  <p>  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests. In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry. That was confirmed by a number of recent studies and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission. Admittedly, adverse effects look much less likely at present, as US prices are currently at historic highs. But it does mean that we have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any quota offered to the US. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, we should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement. Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000 tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis. This is mainly filled by Latin American countries. When we get access for manufacturing beef - which I hope will be soon - we would stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US and this can only be achieved through TTIP.<\/p>  <p>  A number of key issues in these negotiations arise in relation to hormone treated beef, food standards, GMOs and Geographical indicators. All of these arose in the Canadian negotiations and were resolved and I believe they can also be resolved in TTIP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300059#WRG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300059#WRG01550"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[35438\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300059#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Sligo will receive a payment under the disadvantaged areas scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>An application under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme was received from the person named on 13 April 2015.

The aim of this initiative was to create 250 cross sectoral jobs in the Killybegs area by 2014. Seafood processing was just one of the areas identified as having the potential to create additional employment.<\/p><p>To drive forward the initiative, I established a High Level Group on Job Creation in the Killybegs Region and requested that the Group identify the potential actions required to deliver job creation in the following five key areas, that is; promoting seafood value added activity; enhancing ancillary services; developing offshore supports; promoting tourism and marine leisure; and promoting the green economy and renewable energy.<\/p><p>The High Level Group comprised representatives of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation (who chaired the Group), Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Donegal County Council, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Enterprise Ireland, local industry and from my Department. BIM provided secretariat services to assist the chair.<\/p><p>The High Level Group finished its work in 2011 and its Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <\/p><p>Since 2012, a local implementation group reporting to Donegal County Council has taken on responsibility for driving forward the initiative. Bord Iascaigh Mhara provide advice to the Group as requested on any aspects relevant to the responsibilities of my Department. Donegal County Council may assist the Deputy with the specific details requested. <\/p><p>I am informed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara that by the end of 2014, 89 jobs had been created in seafood processing companies in the Killybegs area. I do not have information available to me on jobs created in areas outside of my area of responsibility.<\/p><p>It is clear that the future is very promising for the seafood industry generally and Killybegs is central to that growth story. While the Killybegs Jobs Initiative was important in terms of fostering a diversified blue economy in Killybegs, seafood will continue to be the driver of economic growth for Killybegs in the years to come.<\/p><p>The seafood sector continues to be a high-growth area of the economy and indeed of our food industry. Exports have grown 70% since 2009 and the sector is now worth &euro;850 million in sales. Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Bia are working with seafood companies in Killybegs and elsewhere around our coast to grow the sector to &euro;1 billion in the next few years. This will be driven by our seafood processing sector adding value to commodity products, innovating and developing new consumer seafood products, with the assistance of BIM&rsquo;s Seafood Development Centres in Clonakilty and Killybegs, and winning new markets for Ireland&rsquo;s top quality seafood. <\/p><p>Earlier this year, I announced a new &euro;241 million Seafood Development Operational Programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. This new Programme will double the level of supports for the sustainable development of the seafood sector over the coming years. I expect that the new Programme will be adopted by the European Commission by December. My Department is working with Bord Iascaigh Mhara to have a range of supports ready to launch from the start of 2016 to support and promote the sustainable growth of the processing, aquaculture and fishing sectors through that Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300059#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300059#WRG03550"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[35584\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300059#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a payment under the disadvantaged areas scheme will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>An application under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme was received from the person named on 28 April 2015.

An essential element required to achieve this overall goal is a robust and reliable replacement index built to suit Irish animals and production systems on which farmers can make informed breeding decisions.  In order to achieve this, it is imperative that the index is developed using the most accurate information available to us and that is why genotyping is such a major part of the BDGP. The genotyping requirement within the BDGP reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified. Genotyping greatly improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and of course ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of 4 &amp;amp; 5 star females required by BDGP herds.<\/p>  <p>  Inevitably while improving the index there will be minor fluctuations in some individual animals&rsquo; ratings due to the addition of new information on that animal. This of course will further improve the reliability of that animal&rsquo;s rating. Similarly, the collection of additional information across the entire herd, including the genomic data, will result in more accurate &euro;uro-Star evaluations. Some animals will end up moving to lower star ratings while others will increase their rating reciprocally, but with these changes the index becomes more accurate and a more useful tool for suckler farmers across the country. The cattle breeding industry in Ireland is very accustomed to genetic evaluations moving over time, as more data accumulates.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the female replacement requirements that must be fulf illed by a farmer under the BDGP are focused on ensuring that a percentage of their heifers\/eligible suckler cows (rounded to the nearest animal), in the years 2018 and 2020 are genotyped animals that are:<\/p>  <p>(i) 4 or 5 stars on the replacement index;<\/p>  <p>(ii) at least 16 months old and;<\/p>  <p>(iii) born in 2013 or later.<\/p>  <p>  I have subsequently clarified to the scheme participants on point (iii) above that a female animal born before 2013 will be considered eligible if it was present in the herd before 5th June 2015 and also meets the requirements of parts (i) and (ii) above. In addition the scheme also allows animals to count as eligible even if their rating is subsequently downgraded from 4 and 5 stars provided that the animal is genotyped 4 or 5 star at the time of purchase.<\/p>  <p>  The focus now on the BDGP has moved to engagement with scheme participants. My priority now is to work closely with ICBF and individual scheme participants to ensuring that implementation of the BDGP continues to deliver for Irish suckler farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300060#WRH03600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300060#WRH03800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300060#WRH03700"},{"type":"question","counter":413,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[35606\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300060#WRH03800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will ensure a disability army pension is granted and paid to a person (details supplied) without further delay.","asker":"1065","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":414,"content":"<p>The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established to investigate applications for disability pensions, allowances and gratuities under the Army Pensions Acts and report their findings to the Minister.

Submissions received as part of that process informed the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan which was published in July 2013. As part of the follow-up to that initiative, the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language on 28 November 2013.  This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the inclusion of actions for the Strategy in this regard. The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language, including in service provision, and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of interaction with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities. This report was submitted to the then Minister of State Kathleen Lynch for consideration in May 2014 and was then circulated to Departments in November 2014 for their observations. The intention now is that the recommendations from this report will be reflected as appropriate in the new Disability Inclusion Strategy to take effect as from 1 January 2016, through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and time lines.  Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the monitoring process for the overall Inclusion Strategy.

The vehicle for this programmatic reform is the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 which is being delivered on foot of the commitment of the Programme of the Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 to &ndash; &ldquo;establish independent regulation of the legal profession to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&rdquo;.  Though initiated under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Programme of 2010, the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the Bill is reflected in the fact that it continues to be a component of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015and of the Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020while also being part of the National Reform Programme 2015.<\/p><p>The Legal Services Regulation Bill completed its D&aacute;il Stages on 22<sup>nd<\/sup>April 2015. Since then, I have commenced its passage through the Seanad where it completed Second Stage on 13th May 2015. Preparations are, therefore, ongoing for Seanad Committee Stage which I would anticipate taking place in the coming weeks.  It is the Government's continued intention that the Bill be completed by the end of this year so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority can come into operation at the start of 2016. Work on the Bill continues on that basis including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel. This legislative work is taking place alongside the practical planning that is necessary for the accommodation, staffing and functioning of the new  Regulatory Authority.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>An allocation of &euro;500,000 has been made under my Department's Vote this year to support the start-up of the new Authority.<\/p><p>I would remind the Deputy that the Bill and the historical reforms which it contains have not stood still since the Bill's initial publication. Indeed, the Bill is now much advanced and developed and comprises 158 sections spread over 13 Parts. During its passage through the D&aacute;il over 235 enhancing amendments were made. These included a series of amendments which reinforced the independence of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority in its appointment, which is to be done through nominating bodies, and in the discharge of its statutory functions. I would, therefore,  point the Deputy to the four main levers of change and reform now contained in the reinforced Bill.<\/p><p>Firstly, the Bill provides for a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers. While the Law Society has historically discharged the function of regulator under the Solicitors' Acts up to now, barristers have not, in the past, been subject to similar legislation.<\/p><p>Secondly, the Bill provides for an independent complaints system to deal with public complaints including those relating to professional misconduct. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions thereby replacing the two separately operated Tribunals that exist at the moment. The public will now make their complaints directly to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and not through the professional bodies as happens at present. In addition to the Bill's formal misconduct procedures, I have now made additional provision by Government amendment for the informal resolution of more minor, consumer-type complaints such as those relating to inadequate services.<\/p><p>Thirdly, the Bill provides for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to legal costs in how they are charged and disclosed to clients and this regime will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors. I would point out that the Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles (Schedule 1 of the Bill refers). The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will replace the existing Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office will have a modernised and  efficient business structures, will deal with disputes about legal costs, will prepare Guidelines and maintain a public Register of its legal costs determinations. I have also made a range of technical enhancements  to the legal costs provisions of the Bill taking account of expert views received. These measures complement those cuts and savings in legal costs made across the board by State Bodies who are, in combination, the largest consumer of legal services.<\/p><p>Fourthly,  the Bill provides a framework for Alternative Business Models.  It facilitates new forms of legal services provision such as Legal Partnerships and, in due course, Multi-Disciplinary Practices. These take account of the emergent new business models in other common law jurisdictions and the huge advances made in business and on-line technology which might otherwise leave Ireland at a continuing competitive disadvantage. The new models will operate, by choice, alongside the existing modes of business used by legal practitioners, including small solicitors&rsquo; firms and, for barristers, the Law Library. The Deputy will wish to be aware that there were three main elements to the changes which I introduced at D&aacute;il Report Stage in relation to these new business models which are now embedded in the Bill, namely,<\/p><p>- A series of new provisions to strengthen the regulatory powers of the new Authority and to make additional prudential provision for any future participation in Legal Partnerships and Multi-Disciplinary Practices. These business models will also be subject to periodic review.<\/p><p>- Legal Partnerships, that is to say partnerships between barristers and solicitors or between barristers themselves, will be subject to a public consultation process to be completed within six months of the establishment of the new Regulatory Authority and are then to be introduced within six months of those consultations being completed.<\/p><p>- Multi-Disciplinary Practices, that is to say practices in which legal practitioners provide their services alongside other non-legal service providers, will now be supported by detailed research. This will focus on the likely effects which their introduction may have on competition, on the Irish legal services market and in relation to the legal professions. The findings of this research on MDPs will then inform the six-month public consultation process already envisaged under the Bill and will also be laid before the Houses. The commencement of the provisions governing Multi-Disciplinary Practices will then become a matter for the Minister following these processes and on foot of their outcomes and recommendations.<\/p><p>As we approach Seanad Committee Stage, I consider the Legal Services Regulation Bill to be at a very advanced stage of development having taken on board a whole range of concerns and improvements in the furtherance of legal services reform.We have, in this key piece of legislation, the wherewithal to realise the desired reforms which lie at the root of the Deputy's Question and I look forward to working with him and the Members of both Houses in the weeks ahead to bring them to early finalisation and enactment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300061#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Judicial Appointments","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300061#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[35232\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300061#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to end the political appointment of judges; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>The judiciary and the courts which are at the heart of the justice system are constitutionally independent in their operation.

Under section 16 of the Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the Advisory Board submits to me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, the names of the persons recommended for appointment.  I then bring the names to Government which decides on the person(s) to nominate to the President for appointment.  This system has operated, in accordance with the Constitution, under successive Governments since 1995, and our independent judiciary has served the country extremely well.<\/p><p>In this regard I was pleased to note the conclusions in the Council of Europe's Group of States against corruption  Fourth Round Evaluation report on Ireland which found the Judiciary to be among the most trusted public institutions in the country.  It is significant  that the principle of judicial independence should be recognised by an international evaluation team such as GRECO and that the independence and professionalism of our judges is undisputed.<\/p><p>The need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence was a significant factor in the consultations process on the system of judicial appointments carried out last year.  Another factor was that, while the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process was a model of best practice in its day, almost 20 years from its establishment it was considered worthwhile to review the operation of the entire judicial appointments system to ensure it reflects current best practice, that it is open, transparent and accountable and that it promotes diversity.<\/p><p>There was a significant response to the call for submissions with substantive and wide-ranging views received about the legislative framework that provides for eligibility for judicial appointment and for the actual process of appointment. Arising from the consultations process, draft legislative provisions to reform and update judicial appointment procedures are being prepared by my Department and such legislation is part of the Agreed Programme for Government.  The review and reform of this area which is of critical importance to the functioning of our system of justice provides an opportunity to determine what system can best respond to the expectations and needs of a modern State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300061#WRJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300061#WRJ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[35233\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300061#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will address the rising costs of legal services; the lack of any independent regulatory mechanism to decrease these costs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>The Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which was passed by the D&aacute;il in April and is now before the Seanad where it will commence Committee Stage in the coming weeks, gives legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to \"establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints\". The Legal Services Regulation Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to bring greater transparency to legal costs and to reduce their burden on consumers and enterprise. Historically, legal costs matters have been obscured in legal rules, jurisprudence and practice notes which were largely out of sight to the consumer and, for that matter, to many legal practitioners. The Bill is set to codify and open up the legal costs regime to greater scrutiny while also achieving greater balance and transparency in relation to how such costs arise and are made known to the consumer.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime. Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 123 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.<\/p>  <p>  An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the taxation of disputed legal costs by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs. The Bill also provides for the establishment of a public Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicator.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also contains other measures that are intended to bring greater competition in relation to legal costs. For example, the Bill facilitates the introduction of Legal Partnerships, that is to say partnerships between barristers and solicitors or between barristers themselves and, in due course, of  Multi-Disciplinary Practices, that is to say practices in which legal practitioners provide their services alongside other non-legal service providers. The intention is that these new legal service models, which are already available in a number of other common law jurisdictions,  will be available alongside the Law Library and other traditional legal service structures. These new practice options will facilitate legal practitioners by removing current restrictions on the way they can deliver their services. They will facilitate consumers by providing more choice, better access and, in due course, lower costs, and they will facilitate the removal of a number of barriers to competition previously identified by the Competition Authority. They will also complement the availability of alternative dispute resolution frameworks such as those contained in existing arbitration legislation or in the proposed Mediation Bill which provide more affordable alternatives to the pursuit of court or other litigious proceedings. In a parallel reform initiative I will also be introducing legislative measures to support the introduction of pre-action protocols in relation to medical negligence cases and of periodic payment orders in relation to which draft legislation is at present under scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  Other direct measures have been taken by the Government to reduce legal costs. This has included a series of cuts and savings in legal costs that were made across the board by State Bodies who are, in combination, the largest consumer of legal services. The range of reductions made has included,<\/p>  <p>  - an 8% reduction to all legal fees with effect from 1 March 2009 applied to legal counsel fees in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office; Brief and Refresher fees in the Director of Public Prosecution&rsquo;s Office; Payment of Witness Expenses; Criminal and Civil Legal Aid fees including barrister, private practitioner, medical and legal fees; and Tribunal fees,<\/p>  <p>  - a further 8% reduction with effect from 1 January 2010 applied to legal counsel fees in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office; Brief and Refresher fees in the Director of Public Prosecution&rsquo;s Office; and Criminal and Civil Legal Aid fees,<\/p>  <p>  - a fee reduction of 10% on Criminal Legal Aid fees was applied with effect from 13 July 2011 and 1 October 2011 for District, and Circuit and Higher Courts, respectively,<\/p>  <p>  - a reduction of 50% in the rate paid in respect of travel and subsistence and a reduction of 50% in the rate paid for sentence fees in respect of adjourned sentence hearings in the Circuit and higher courts was applied,<\/p>  <p>  - in October 2011, a further 10% reduction was applied to brief and refresher fees paid by the Director of Public Prosecutions Office to reduce the level of fees in parallel with the reductions applied to fees payable under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, and<\/p>  <p>  - a further 10% reduction was applied to Tribunal fees on 1 March 2012.<\/p>  <p>  By way of a centralised Government approach to legal costs, the Deputy will also wish to be aware that, in conjunction with the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer for the Public Service, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a circular in July 2013 on \"The Procurement of Legal Services and Managing Legal Costs\" which outlines the appropriate competitive procedures that can be used in the engagement of legal services and sets out a number of approaches and tools for public bodies to use in managing legal costs.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding some evidence of an initial time lag when compared, for example, to accountants, there is an amount of statistical and anecdotal evidence pointing to downward pressures having been exerted on legal costs during the recent recession. At the same time, the National Competitiveness Council, in its \"Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2014\" report, has highlighted the continued need to embed structural reform in the legal services and other sectors if we are to achieve sustained economic recovery. The Council observes that, \"looking to the future, further structural or policy induced changes are necessary to ensure that prices do not escalate and erode competitiveness as the Irish economy returns to stronger rates of growth\".  With this in mind, I would expect that, along with those other cost reduction measures that have and continue to be introduced by the Government, the Legal Services Regulation Bill will support greater competition and choice in the provision and pricing of legal services while also supporting our future economic growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300061#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coroners Service","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300061#WRJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[35239\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300061#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 323 of 17 February 2015, if she will provide an update on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na review which was nearing completion in March 2015; if it has been completed; if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have arranged to meet with the family in question; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>I refer to my response to D&aacute;il Question No. 323 of 17 February 2015 in this matter.<\/p><p>I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have now completed their review and the solicitor representing the family has been notified accordingly.

The Personal Insolvency Practitioner has important statutory responsibilities and duties under the 2012 Act, in examining a debtor&rsquo;s financial situation, providing expert independent advice  on available options, drawing up a proposal for a PIA, and negotiating it with creditors.  The PIA itself is designed to provide a fair balance between the rights of creditors and of borrowers, and includes a number of important protections for the debtor, such as legal enforceability, statutory priority for protecting the debtor staying in the family home where that is possible, protection for reasonable living expenses, and, under the Personal Insolvency Amendment Act 2015, the option of seeking review by the courts if creditors refuse  a reasonable proposal.<\/p>  <p>  It is where a Personal Insolvency Arrangement has been approved by the courts and has entered into force, that a creditor is restrained by the Personal Insolvency Act from seeking  to dispose of or take possession of, a property covered by the Arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  It is of course always possible for the owner of a principal private residence to formulate a proposal to the lender outside the scope of the Personal Insolvency Acts, and without the help of a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, if they choose to do so.

The latest figures from FRONTEX indicate that over 700,000 illegal border crossings have taken place this year though the Eastern and Central Mediterranean and Western Balkans routes.  We have all seen what this means for the lives of the people involved.  In response to the escalating crisis the European Council first met in April 2015 to set out broad guidelines on the immediate steps necessary to respond to the situation. The EU Commission brought forward proposals for implementation of a package of measures under the European Agenda on Migration in May.  This package of measures included a proposal for relocation (to alleviate pressure on the frontline States of Italy and Greece) as well as a recommendation on resettlement, proposals to strengthen FRONTEX operations in the Mediterranean, Common Security Defence  Policy (CSDP) mission and broader strategy to tackle the criminal dimension of the smuggling networks, enhanced cooperation with third countries and humanitarian and developmental aid to address the root causes.<\/p><p>  The European Council met again in June where the main discussion point was the Commission&rsquo;s relocation proposals. Overall the Council endorsed a three-stranded comprehensive approach to migration based on the principles of solidarity and responsibility. The first strand relates to resettlement and relocation of refugees and asylum seekers as an expression of solidarity. The second strand involves a return and readmission policy involving safe countries of origin, whereby migrants who have entered the EU illegally are returned to their country.  The third element relates to improved management of borders and enhanced cooperation with third countries<b>.<\/b><\/p><p>In July the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council agreed in principle to relocate, on a temporary and exceptional basis, up to 40,000 persons from Italy and Greece over two years and this proposal was adopted at the JHA Council on 14 September.  <\/p><p>A second implementation package was published by the European Commission in September. The principal proposals were to amend the Dublin Regulation to provide for a permanent relocation mechanism;  a further  temporary relocation proposal (bringing the total number of persons being relocated over the next two years to 160,000) and a proposal to amend the Asylum Procedures Directive to establish a list of safe countries of origin.  Other aspects of the package looked at the external dimension, including a Communication on this topic and the proposal for an EU Trust Fund for Africa, with a budget of &euro;1.8 billion of EU funding.<\/p><p>A further two extraordinary JHA Councils were held on 14<sup>th<\/sup>and 22<sup>nd<\/sup>September with agreement reached on the emergency relocation measures of a further 120,000 persons by Qualified Majority Vote (QMV). To take account of the rapidly evolving situation, 66,000 places will be allocated initially for relocation from Greece and Italy with an option to relocate the balance of 54,000 from other Member States as they come under pressure. In contrast to the position adopted on the first relocation proposal the distribution among Member States under the later proposal is mandatory.<\/p><p>Following the Extraordinary JHA Council, the European Council met in an informal configuration on 23 September to discuss the migration crisis again. The meeting reaffirmed the important principles underpinning EU mobility, including; the Schengen Acquis and Dublin Convention.  The Council also agreed to pledge &euro;1 billion to support refugees displaced within the region; to increase dialogue and cooperation with key transit countries such as Turkey and the Western Balkan countries and to provide additional resources for the EU agencies engaged with the crisis &ndash; FRONTEX, EASO and Europol.<\/p><p>I am committed to continue to work with my EU colleagues to find solutions to this crisis.

Since their introduction on 28th September, 2015, the following arrangements are now in place to improve throughput and relieve the congestion in the public office that occurs at this time of the year as demand for registration increases as students return to their studies. The measures have been successful by reducing the number of persons who are required to call to the office to a minimum and on a par with the number who call at all other times of the year where no significant issues with queuing arise.<\/p><p>One of the key measures is that persons who are students of the colleges listed below and who are registering for the first time or seeking to renew their registrations are not required to<b><\/b>attend at the Public Office.  Separate arrangements are being put in place to register students of these colleges. The colleges concerned have been contacted and the arrangements communicated directly to the colleges and students involved. Students from these colleges are already being registered under the new arrangements which will see periods set aside to deal with students by arrangement. There is no need for students of these colleges to queue at Burgh Quay and no person will lose residence status or continuity of permission to remain by the application of these arrangements.  The colleges concerned are:<\/p><p>- Dublin City University (DCU),<\/p><p>- Dublin Institute of Technology and constituent colleges (DIT)<\/p><p>- Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland (RCSI),<\/p><p>- Dublin University (Trinity College),<\/p><p>- University College Dublin (UCD).<\/p><p>From 30th September, all new registrations are being be dealt with on Monday and Tuesday of each week.  Wednesday to Friday is reserved for renewal of registrations i.e. for those who have an existing GNIB registration certificate.  In addition to these measures, extra staff resources are being deployed to the GNIB to assist with the registration process.  The Public Office will operate on every Saturday in October and November; the remaining Saturday openings will be by prior arrangement only and in most cases confined to students of the above colleges. The arrangements will be kept under constant review and changed or added to as required to address the demands on the office in this peak period.<\/p><p>The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  For the purpose of the efficient processing of the registration of up to five hundred people who are dealt with in the peak period at this registration office every day, GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at the office; priority is given in the early morning period for particular categories including those coming here to work or conduct business.  This is to minimise the amount of time persons at work are required to be away from their jobs.  In addition, the GNIB with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has recently established a Garda website notification system for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.  On three separate occasions during each day an announcement  is posted on the Garda Website alerting customers to the number of available tickets remaining at the Burgh Quay public office for that day.  Furthermore, those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return later in the day, if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each person on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation required for registration, so that unnecessary delays are avoided.<\/p><p>In common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at my offices.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  For the majority of customers the Garda National Immigration Bureau provides a <i>&lsquo;<\/i>same day service<i>&rsquo;<\/i>at its Burgh Quay office.  Currently, this office handles all registrations in the Dublin area.  At times of high demand, it is not possible, currently, to send this demand elsewhere, it has to be accommodated within the capacity of the Burgh Quay office where the necessary technical infrastructure for registration card recording, generation of registration certificates and fingerprinting exists.  Use of other buildings for this purpose is not an option because the biometric equipment and elaborate smart card production systems are not mobile and in any event has to be linked up in real-time to the Garda IT systems.<\/p><p>Work is underway to transfer the registration function to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  As part of that work new systems are being developed with the aim of reducing footfall and random arrivals to the public office by use of on-line systems and to undertake registrations renewals off-site.<\/p><p>I would like to acknowledge the work of the staff in the public office who diligently perform a very important function for the State.  It is one of the busiest public offices in the State dealing with, in the region of, 100,000 people every year.  The new arrangements outlined above mean that queuing is not necessary and these arrangements will be strictly enforced to ensure that they are implemented as effectively as possible.  The new arrangements are already proving effective in addressing queue times and in improving the service experience for customers in this busy period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300062#WRK02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":519,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300062#WRK02950"},{"type":"question","counter":520,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[35648\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300062#WRK03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to set out her views on a television report (details supplied) which outlined shortcomings in the behaviour of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in respect of some citizens.","asker":"1011","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":521,"content":"<p>The television report to which the Deputy refers related to a number of cases which were referred to the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na target organised criminal groupings with all available resources. This includes operating at local and community level as well as national and international level in partnership with other policing agencies.

I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that it is continuing to reduce the capacity of our prisons to align with the Inspector of Prisons recommended bed capacity of 3,982 in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  Significant decreases in prison numbers have taken place over recent years.  The overall daily average number in custody for 2014 was 3,915 compared to 4,390 in 2011, a decrease of 10.8%. The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23rd February 2011. On the 9th October 2015, there were 928 less prisoners in custody, a decrease of 20%. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government outlines the commitment of this Government to finding alternatives to custody as a means of reducing overcrowding.  We continue to ensure that violent offenders and other serious offenders serve appropriate prison sentences while at the same time switching away from prison sentences and towards less costly non-custodial options for non-violent and less serious offenders.<\/p>  <p>  Alternatives to custody continue to be pursued and legislation has already been passed. This includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered. <\/p>  <p>  The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances. It further provides, inter alia, that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date, the Court may make an attachment order to earnings as a means of recovering the unpaid fine. As a result of this legislation, it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prisons on short sentences.<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has continued the national roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which carefully selected offenders can be granted structured temporary release in return for supervised community service. In addition to this programme, Community Support Schemes have been set up in Cork Prison, Mountjoy Campus, West Dublin Campus and Limerick Prisons, the aim of which is to reduce recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release.  <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with efforts to reduce the numbers in custody, huge improvements have been made to prison conditions in recent years. Overcrowding has been eliminated in Mountjoy Prison and priority has been given to addressing capacity issues in Cork, Limerick and the D&oacute;chas Centre. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service Strategy Statement 2012\/2015 identified the elimination of slopping out in the prison estate as a priority. A new accommodation block was opened in the Midlands Prison in December 2012. The opening of this new accommodation allowed the Prison Service to reduce the capacity of both Cork and Limerick Prison resulting in the closure of the antiquated B wing of Limerick Prison. The closure of the B wing effectively halved the number of prisoners who do not have in cell sanitation in Limerick Prison.<\/p>  <p>  The IPS capital programme has identified the replacement of B Division as a priority and plans are being advanced in this regard. The building programme for the Prison on completion, will replace both the A &amp;amp; B Wings with a 150 cell block and will end the practice of slopping out in Limerick Prison.<\/p>  <p>  All of the wings in Mountjoy Prison have been completely refurbished thereby facilitating the elimination of the practice of slopping out in the prison.  A completely new replacement prison in Cork is almost complete and will be operational in early 2016. The enabling works for the redevelopment of Limerick Prison are scheduled to begin in 2016 with the main construction phase to start in early 2017.  Significant building and refurbishment projects are also scheduled for 2016 in Castlerea Prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300064#WRM01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Assets Bureau","counter":568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300064#WRM01450"},{"type":"question","counter":569,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[35729\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300064#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which adequate resources remain available to the Criminal Assets Bureau; the bureau continues to combat organised crime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":570,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the Criminal Assets Bureau currently has 71 staff members.

These studies will allow the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service access to a comprehensive bank of data in relation to the rate of recidivism among ex-prisoners and offenders. This will help to inform future policy on the management of offenders and will facilitate the formulation of strategies aimed at reducing recidivism. The next recidivism studies are expected to be published by the end of this year.<\/p><p>The issue of recidivism is dealt with in the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group which I published in September 2014. The Report proposes the adoption of a penal policy with the dual purposes of punishment and rehabilitation both in the imposition and management of criminal sanctions. It identified rehabilitation and reintegration as a core principle and significant factor in reducing crime. It considers that such aims are best achieved in a non-custodial environment as far as possible. In my view, prison is not the only sanction when it comes to those convicted of lesser non-violent offences. Re-offending can also be tackled head on by imposing a supervised community sanction, with appropriate supports, which could see punishment being served, but which would also lead, not only to rehabilitation, but to a reduced risk of re-offending.<\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that both the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service work through a variety of programmes to address offending behaviour and to promote desistance from future criminal activity. Community Return is a scheme where carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work. The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups. The scheme represents a move away from releasing prisoners in an unstructured way. There has been a steady increase in the numbers of offenders participating in the scheme as outlined in the table beneath.<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Numbers participating<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011 (introduced in October)<\/td><td>66<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>299<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>396<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>461<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Compliance rates operate at about 90% with the remainder being returned to custody to serve out their sentences in full. The scheme forms a core element of the Joint Probation Service and Probation Service Strategic Plan for 2015 to 2017. As well as allowing prisoners complete their sentence by way of performing an unpaid service to the community it has helped them to successfully reintegrate back into their community.<\/p><p>Tackling recidivist and prolific offending is a key focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the criminal justice system generally. Garda operations such as Operation Fiacla identify and target prolific offenders, including members of gangs, and arrangements are in place for the case management of such offenders so that all relevant information is co-ordinated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and available when such persons come before the courts.<\/p><p>The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 addresses issues relating to bail and sentencing for repeat burglars of dwellings. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this Bill will be enacted during the Autumn D&aacute;il session. The Bill emerged from a review of the criminal justice system&rsquo;s response to the problem of burglaries, which I initiated earlier this year. The review highlighted that many burglaries are committed by serial offenders. The Bill targets this cohort of repeat offenders and has the potential to significantly reduce the number of burglaries being committed.<\/p><p>The review identified two key problems which can be tackled by legislation. One relates to repeat offenders who are granted bail despite being charged with multiple burglaries and who often commit further burglaries while on bail. The other relates to the fact that relatively short sentences can be imposed by the courts when multiple burglary offences are taken into account.<\/p><p>The Bill will amend the Bail Act 1997 to provide that for the purposes of bail applications, previous convictions for domestic burglary coupled with pending charges or recent convictions shall be considered as evidence that an accused person is likely to commit further domestic burglaries. The Bill will also amend the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 to require a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple burglary offences committed within a 12 month window, to impose such sentences consecutively. The District Court will be empowered to impose aggregate sentences of up to 2 years in such circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300064#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid","counter":580,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300064#WRM02250"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[35733\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300064#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which legal aid for those accused of crimes continues to be reviewed, with a view to ensuring the system remains cost effective; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.

The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the \"gravity of the charge\" or \"exceptional circumstances\", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  The nature of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme is that it is demand led, driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and the prosecution of cases through the courts system. <\/p>  <p>  In seeking to reduce the expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, the rates of fees paid to the legal practitioners were reduced by 8% in March 2009 and by a further 8% in April, 2010. There was also a reduction of 10% in July 2011 in the fees payable in the District Court. Fees payable in the Circuit and higher courts were also decreased by 10% in October 2011 following the reduction in the fees payable by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecution practitioners. A reduction of 50% was also applied to payments in respect of adjourned sentence hearings and travel and subsistence payments from 2011.

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.<\/p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.

The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not.<\/p>  <p>  Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.<\/p>  <p>  At international level, the question of how best to deal with participation in and\/or directing a criminal organisation through the criminal law has been the subject of debate in the development of common international standards.

Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the ETBs and the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning. The partnership endeavours to meet the needs of students through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release. A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University. There is an increasing focus on QQI accreditation as the modular structure best meets the needs of students in prison. <\/p>  <p>  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.

Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  Work Training Officers have recently been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.

It is a feature of offending behaviour that recidivism rates decrease as the offender age increases. Research on desistance from offending has found that there are different paths to change and desistance from offending that can be prompted, implemented and supported. The community return scheme is a good example of how a structured programme of release for offenders can assist them to change by providing the opportunity to pay back to the community in the form of unpaid productive work and by providing the necessary individual supports.<\/p>  <p>  There is evidence to show that the right interventions at the right points of time can successfully lead to a reduction in the offending rate among young adults. Therefore the Probation Service and Irish Prison Service together with the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) have adopted a distinct policy for 18-21 year olds.  The Garda Youth Diversion programme is a successful example of diverting young people away from crime. <\/p>  <p>  I published the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group in early September 2014. The report proposes the adoption of a penal policy with the dual purposes of punishment and rehabilitation both in the imposition and management of criminal sanctions.

These studies, along with the implementation of the recommendations of the Penal Policy Review Group, will help to inform future policy on the management of offenders and will facilitate the formulation of strategies aimed at reducing recidivism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300064#WRM03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Missing Persons Data","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300064#WRM03350"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[35739\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300064#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons listed as missing; the extent to which their cases are the subject of ongoing investigation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receive an estimated 8,000 reports of missing persons a year, the majority are located within a short period of time.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. <\/p><p>Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  The vaccine is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p><p>In Ireland school based immunisation has been used successfully to vaccinate\u00a0primary school children for over 30 years to protect children from vaccine preventable diseases and is now reaching the 95% vaccination rate recommended by the World Health Organisation.  Vaccinations programmes\u00a0were extended to second level schools since the introduction of the human papillomavirus vaccination programme in 2010 and uptake rates have exceeded the target of 80% for a three dose course in first year girls. <\/p><p>The National Immunisation Office (NIO) provides and updates Guidelines annually for staff who work in the School Immunisation Programme.\u00a0\u00a0The NIO continually liaises with the Department of Education in the implementation of the school vaccination programmes and the local HSE vaccination teams\u00a0work very closely with the school management and staff to minimise disruption.  The school based service also provides an additional clinic service where parents can attend with children if there are difficulties with school vaccination.<\/p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  The procedure timelines were not fast-tracked (a US term) or accelerated (the EU term).  The procedure started on 28 December 2005, a positive opinion was issued by the EMA's scientific committee on 7 July 2006, and a marketing authorisation was issued by the Commission on 20 September 2006.  Allowing for the time period taken by the applicant for responses, the time between start of the procedure and the scientific committee's opinion was 190 days.<\/p><p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.<\/p><p>Up to the 11 September 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 901 reports of suspected adverse reactions\/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>899 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>2). The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA regarding both Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix vaccines to date have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information. Vaccination related events, occurring at the time of vaccine administration, such as syncope (faints) has been among the most commonly reported effects.  Other commonly reported symptoms include gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  Reports of allergic-type reactions including skin rashes, urticaria and flushing have also been received, including isolated reports of more severe hypersensitivity-type reactions.<\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting ().  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  All reports received through the online reporting options receive an acknowledgement and case record number on successful submission of a report.  Further information is provided to reporters in respect of any questions\/concerns reflected in their reports, in the context of report follow up.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the World Health Organisation and to the marketing authorisation (i.e. licence) holder for the medicine.<\/p><p>The EMA has commenced a review of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine &quot;<i>to further clarify aspects of their safety profile<\/i>,&quot; although the agency points out that this review &quot;<i>does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks<\/i>.&quot;  The review is specifically focusing on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  Recommendations from the first stage of this review are expected in November.  The agency also notes that while the review is being carried out, no change in the use of these products is recommended.<\/p><p>In addition the EMA is currently evaluating data from a on the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  The study conducted jointly by the French medicines agency (ANSM) and the French national health insurance fund (CNAMTS) compared the incidence of autoimmune conditions in girls given HPV vaccines with the incidence in girls not given the vaccines.  In the meantime, the EMA have advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of these vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>in accordance with the current product information.<\/p><p>It has been confirmed by the Danish authorities that they continue to offer HPV vaccination to 12 year old girls as part of the Danish child immunisation programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300065#WRN03200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disease Classification","counter":646,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300065#WRN03250"},{"type":"question","counter":647,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[35191\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300065#WRN03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the implementation of recommendations for dementia patients.

When first authorised for use in Ireland in 1983, Roaccutane was authorised for the management of cystic or conglobate forms of acne vulgaris, or for use in cases of severe acne which have failed to respond to adequate courses of accepted therapy. <\/p>  <p>  Information is not collected in relation to the clinical condition for which a drug is prescribed in individual cases.  In relation to Roaccutane the only available information relates to the number of prescriptions dispensed under the GMS and Community Drugs Schemes.  This information was provided to the Deputy by the HSE in response to a previous parliamentary question (Ref no. 33338\/15).<\/p>  <p>  The information breakdown held by the HPRA that the Deputy refers to is the breakdown of reported adverse reactions notified to the HPRA and I understand that the HPRA has provided this breakdown directly to the Deputy.  Of the five cases where Roaccutane was used for an unknown indication, the HPRA made efforts to obtain this information from the person reporting the adverse reaction but such information was not forthcoming.<\/p>  <p>  European and Irish legislation provides for ongoing monitoring of the benefits and risks of medicines through a system known as pharmacovigilance.   This monitoring includes review and evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports at National and EU level.  The national regulatory medicines authorities (in Ireland the HPRA) in each EU Member State are responsible for gathering and evaluating national adverse reaction reports and in turn submitting these reports to the European Medicines Agency, which is responsible for the overall co-ordination of pharmacovigilance activities across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with European and national legislation, marketing authorisation holders (manufacturers) are legally obliged to notify all suspected serious adverse reactions in Ireland (reported either by a healthcare professional or a patient) to the HPRA within 15 days of first notification of the company.  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions by health professionals and patients is undertaken on a voluntary basis across the EU with all health professionals strongly encouraged to report any suspected adverse reaction.  International data indicates that Ireland has a high rate of reporting and the HPRA regularly reminds health care professionals about reporting in its Drugs Safety Newsletter. <\/p>  <p>  In previous replies to the Deputy I have provided detailed information on the authorisation process for a medicine and the safety monitoring process once the medicine is placed on the market.  Before it can be made available to patients a medicine must meet predefined standards of quality, safety and efficacy and approval is given on the basis of a favourable benefit versus risk balance for a specific indication. <\/p>  <p>  There is in addition extensive pharmacovigilance legislation which monitors the medicine&rsquo;s safety once it is in use to ensure that risks can be promptly identified and managed so that harm is prevented.  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions is only one of a number of ways of identifying new adverse reactions.  However individual reports of suspected adverse reactions alone are rarely sufficient to confirm that a certain reaction is caused by the medicine in question.  Other factors such as the extent and conditions of use of the medicine, the nature of the reaction, the condition being treated, any new conditions arising and other medicines taken by the patient have all to be taken into account. Further data is usually required, including worldwide spontaneous case reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies, to confirm the reactions and help determine their significance. <\/p>  <p>  A review of Roacccutane across the EU took place in 2011 when further warnings regarding skin reactions were added to the product information for patients and their doctors.  The risk of depression associated with Roaccutane was also reviewed at that time.  However it was concluded on the basis of all the available evidence that the existing monitoring requirements provided on the product information is sufficient.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion therefore no medicine is without risk but the extensive authorisation and monitoring process in place across the EU ensures that risks are identified and managed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will have previously received from the HPRA a copy of the current product information.  I am arranging to forward the Deputy a copy of the original product authorisation from 1983. Following authorisation any change (e.g. new indications, updated safety information, product changes) require approval on foot of a formal application to vary the authorisation and the submission of relevant supporting data. In practice product information changes frequently.  Information relating to all these the changes is not readily available in the HPRA and will entail detailed searches through archived material.<\/p>  <p>  However the HPRA is happy to meet the Deputy to discuss his information requirements further and will be communicating directly with the Deputy in coming days to arrange a meeting. <\/p>  <p>  Since it was first authorised for use in Ireland, Roaccutane has been contraindicated in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  An EU wide Pregnancy Prevention Plan (PPP) was introduced in October 2003 to further reduce the potential risk of pregnancy in women. The Plan consists of key educational information on the risks of treatment and specific criteria for managing therapy in women of child-bearing potential.  I am arranging to send the Deputy copies of material distributed by the marketing authorisation holder for use by prescribing doctors, pharmacists, other relevant healthcare professionals and patients, including a checklist for prescribing to female patients. <\/p>  <p>  In addition the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 were amended in 2005 to introduce restrictions on certain medicines containing Isotretinoin.  Regulation 7(9) of the Regulations provides that the prescription of a medicine containing Isotretinoin which is intended for the treatment of a woman of childbearing potential, shall not be dispensed later than seven days after the date on the prescription and the treatment shall not exceed a period of thirty days.<\/p>  <p>  While the legislation does not restrict the type of medical practitioner that can prescribe Isotretinoin, the product&rsquo;s product information (SmPC) requires that the product should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300066#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":677,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300066#WRO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[35342\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300066#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal will receive an appointment for an operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

These include homes that provide a 24\/7, 365 days a year service and community based models which are staffed for certain parts of the evening, night and weekends.  Residential services are provided by over 60 agencies.   Residential settings vary in size from large congregated settings defined as 10 or more bedded facilities to community group homes to supported independent living.  <\/p>  <p>  In community group homes, the model of care is based on providing a family type residence with a house parent who sleeps over in the house but is very rarely required to be active during the night.   The rate of payment for the sleepover has been determined by the Labour Court Recommendation 20837 which states that &lsquo;Having regard to all the circumstances currently prevailing, the Court recommends that, with effect from the date of this Recommendation, staff should be paid an hourly rate in respect of each hour spent on sleepover in excess of 39 hours equal to the national minimum hourly rate.&rsquo;<\/p>  <p>  The European Working Time Directive (EWTD) provides that workers shall not be required to work in excess of 48 hours per week.

Using the results of the data collection exercise, the HSE will draw up an EWTD compliance plan for the disability sector for approval by my Department.

This includes but is not limited to water, health, social services, social security systems and education, to ensure that national authorities retain the right to introduce, adopt, maintain or repeal any measures with regards to the commissioning, organisation, funding and provision of public services as provided in the Treaties as well as in the EU's negotiating mandate.

Additional funding of &euro;12 million, was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to meet the needs of around 1,400 young people who require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training this year, of which &euro;6 million has been made available to provide services from September.<\/p>  <p>  Finding the resources and the physical capacity to meet the needs of a growing number of new service users every year is a challenging task.  When this year&rsquo;s support requirements were identified, the cost of meeting those needs in full exceeded the amount available, therefore, an additional &euro;1.5 million was added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs available to meet those needs.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2015, a National Project Group was established by the HSE to develop and oversee a national process to responding to the needs of these young people and to ensure a consistent approach is taken across the country to meeting those needs.  This initially involved identifying all individuals who would require a day service in 2015.  Once individuals were identified and their individualised needs were assessed, the capacity of the existing services to meet those needs was determined.  It was not until this process was completed that the number, location and type of additional support needs and resources could be finalised.  <\/p>  <p>  The approach adopted by the National Project Group from the outset was that a cost banding structure would be developed to inform the allocation of the available funds.  The costing bands were then applied to the identified need in each of the county&rsquo;s nine regions so that a nationally consistent approach would be applied, which was needs-based as opposed to population-based.  Based on this cost-band structure, five support levels were identified and the following amounts were allocated for new placements at each support level: intensive support (&euro;34,000); high (&euro;16,000); moderate (&euro;11,000); low (&euro;7,000) and minimum (&euro;5,000).  Most of the placements for those who had applied to attend Gheel Autism Services are in the intensive support category.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that most young people have been offered a placement from September which meets their needs.  Only a small minority of placements remain to be finalised.  In relation to the individuals that had applied to Gheel Autism Services, the HSE indicated that there would be an allocation of &euro;708,000 made available to Gheel to provide the model of day service that they had developed and once off capital funding of &euro;80,000.  However, following extensive negotiations with Gheel, it was established that the placements for these individuals cannot be delivered by Gheel within this allocation.  The HSE has initiated discussions with two alternative service providers who already provide quality day services to young people with autism and these providers have agreed to develop appropriate service responses for these young people.<\/p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks the HSE will continue to actively work with these service providers and families until placements are finalised for all young people at this important transition point in their lives and they will ensure that resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most effective manner possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300071#WRT00800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":917,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300071#WRT00900"},{"type":"question","counter":918,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[35762\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300071#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the endoscopy suite at Roscommon County Hospital will be opened; the reason for the delay in sanctioning the posts to operate the suite; the number and grades involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":919,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.

The more violent conflicts elsewhere in the region have somewhat masked the continual rise in tension and in localized violence in East Jerusalem over more than a year.  The main factors are the operation of policies on the ground intended to push Palestinians out of Jerusalem in favour of settlers, the absence of any political process or perspective which might promise an end to this situation, and among Palestinians the consequent loss of authority by political leaders and belief in a political path.  To this has been added in recent months a reckless and provocative challenge by minority elements in Israel to the long respected status quo of the holy places in Jerusalem.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very dangerous combination of negative factors, and the issue of the holy places has caused deep offence and concern also in the wider Arab world.<\/p>  <p>  In common with others, I deplore any resort to violent attacks on civilians, be they prompted by despair or revenge.

I launched a special anniversary exhibition on Ireland&rsquo;s First Years at the United Nations (1955-1957), which then went on display at UNHQ and will be officially launched in Dublin in December.

Given the importance of trade promotion,<i><\/i>on 29 September I addressed an audience of 150 international financial services professionals at a joint Enterprise Ireland\/BNY Mellon showcase event.<\/p><p>Six Irish companies took part in the event, which allowed them to interact with the key influencers, investors and buyers of payment technology in the North American market, while also helping to create awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in this sector. <\/p><p>In Washington on 30 September, I met with key Democratic and Republican contacts on Capitol Hill, including Congressmen Joseph Kennedy III, Paul Ryan, James Sensenbrenner, Richard Neal and other members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland group, and also with Senator Patrick Leahy.  The main focus of our discussions was on developments on the Northern Ireland peace process and on the prospects for immigration reform.  On foot of these meetings, a Bill has now been tabled by Congressman Sensenbrenner in the US House of Representatives, which aims to provide access to several thousand E3 visas for Irish citizens.  I warmly welcome this positive step towards meeting the desire of many Irish people to live and work in the US for a time, but would also point out that there is a great deal of work to be done in both Houses of Congress before this Bill might become law.  I am also aware that while this particular measure would help with our objective of securing improved legal migration channels, it would not address the concerns of undocumented citizens currently in the US.  These remain a key priority for this government and continue to be the subject of our ongoing contacts with the US authorities. <\/p><p>At a lunch hosted by Ambassador Anderson I had a productive exchange on Northern Ireland with a number of Irish-Americans and friends of Ireland with a long-standing interest and involvement in the peace process. I also met with a senior representative of Vice President Biden&rsquo;s staff and later that day addressed a special event on Capitol Hill to highlight the work of the International Fund for Ireland (IFI).<\/p><p>Back in New York, on 1 October, I met over a working breakfast with leading figures from the Irish-American community in New York.  I briefed them on the latest developments in Northern Ireland, the prospects for U.S. immigration reform, developments on the Irish economy and the upcoming 2016 commemorations.<\/p><p>There was a lively and useful exchange on some of these topics.After the breakfast, I presented the inaugural W.B. Yeats Emerging Playwright Competition award and launched the inaugural Frank McCourt Scholarship, both initiatives supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which are designed to recognise and celebrate Irish culture in the United States.  I then met with some of the Board of the New York Irish Arts Centre to be briefed on progress on their major redevelopment project, which will see a new state of the art facility developed as a showcase for Irish culture in New York.  Ireland has provided $4.65 million towards the expected capital costs of the project of $62 million.<\/p><p>Finally I had a meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Ms. Victoria Nuland, to discuss developments in Northern Ireland.

In June, the Foreign Affairs Council extended the duration of the economic sanctions until 31 January 2016.In response to Western sanctions, President Putin signed an order in August 2014 banning the import of a range of food and agricultural products from the EU, Norway, Australia, Canada and US.  The Presidential ban was initially fixed for one year. However, in June it was extended for a further year to August 2016.    In 2014, the value of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral trade with Russia stood at &euro;948 million, comprising exports of &euro;722 million and imports of &euro;226 million.  This was an increase of &euro;169 million on the previous year. However, the figure for exports in 2014 included a once-off order for fertilizer products valued at over &euro;150 million and this had the effect of distorting the overall exports performance for the year.    <\/p>  <p>  In the first seven months of 2015, bilateral trade with Russia has fallen significantly.  Between January and July, the value of exports to Russia reduced from &euro;508 million to &euro;217 million compared to the same period last year.  This represents a drop of 57%.  At the same time, imports from Russia fell from &euro;155 million to &euro;119 million, a drop of 23% on the corresponding period in 2014. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons for the sharp drop in bilateral trade with Russia in the year to date. EU sanctions and, in particular, Russian retaliatory measures are clearly having a negative impact on trade flows. However, this does not capture the full picture as there are a number of other factors which have contributed in no small way to the current reduction in trade.  These include the dramatic decline in the value of the rouble, the fall in oil prices, the economic downturn in Russia, negative investor sentiment towards the Russian market and a ban on pork products from the EU following an outbreak of African Swine Fever in a number of  EU states in Eastern Europe.  The decline in the value of the rouble is particularly striking, resulting in the cost of imports to Russia almost doubling in the past year.       <\/p>  <p>  Despite the challenging environment, the Embassy in Moscow, together with the state agencies, remains focused on raising awareness of Ireland as an attractive investment location and continues to support Irish companies present in Russia and those seeking to explore new market opportunities there.       <\/p>  <p>  The EU sanctions were imposed on Russia in response to its aggressive actions in Ukraine and with the clear aim of encouraging a change in its behaviour towards its neighbour.  They are clearly having an effect on Russia&rsquo;s economy and they remain a key element of the EU&rsquo;s approach to the conflict in Ukraine.  The measures can be strengthened or eased in light of developments on the ground and progress made towards the objectives set by the EU when they were put in place. <\/p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the restrictive measures against Russia, coupled with open dialogue and continued political and diplomatic engagement with the various sides involved in the conflict, offer the best way of creating the conditions for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300072#WRU04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":1009,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300073#WRV00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Site Acquisitions","counter":1008,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300073#WRV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1009,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[35202\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300073#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide a progress report from her Department on the efforts to secure a site of adequate dimensions in Buncrana in County Donegal, to facilitate a three-school campus for schools (details supplied); and if she will allocate the necessary funding for this project to proceed.","asker":"998","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1010,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware a technical inspection of a significant number of potential site options for the school accommodation to which he refers has been conducted by officials from my Department working with officials from Donegal County Council.<\/p>  <p>  My officials are currently considering the findings of this assessment and, with the assistance of the Local Authority, are clarifying technical issues raised with a view to ensuring that a preferred site option can be advanced as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate the importance of a thorough appraisal of site options in order to ensure the achievement of value for money.

The bulk of this increase has been at first level and it is now feeding through to second level. Enrolment levels are still rising annually at both levels and an estimated 55,000 additional places will be required nationally by 2022. Clearly, this level of additionality will require the provision of new schools. I cannot be precise though on the number of new schools that will be required as it will depend on the distribution of the increase within areas and the extent to which the increase can be met by existing schools or extensions to existing schools.<\/p>  <p>  The process for new school establishment was revised by my predecessor in June 2011 and full details of the process are published on my Department's website. New schools are established to meet demographic demand. Once the Department has identified the need for a new school, its location and projected enrolment level, a process is conducted to allow for different patrons\/bodies to be considered as the patron of the new school. The main criterion for the selection of the patron body is the extent to which a school under its patronage would extend or strengthen diversity of provision in the area, having regard to the views of parents. Since the revised process was announced in June 2011, the patronage of 44 schools has been determined under the revised procedures (19 primary schools and 25 post-primary schools). In addition, 8 primary schools have opened under the patronage divesting process.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the Department's policy is to integrate children with special educational needs into the mainstream primary school system wherever possible. Many of our new schools have special education units included within them. However, special schools are also necessary to meet the educational needs of pupils whose needs cannot be adequately catered for in a mainstream primary school. The need to establish a new special school would be identified by the National Council for Special Education in conjunction with the Department. The necessity would arise where there is a specific and quantified need that could not reasonably be met through existing provision. Any process to establish a new special school would have to take account of the views of parents who are the key stakeholders with regard to their child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300074#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300074#WRW01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1080,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[35459\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300074#WRW01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will confirm receipt of an application for additional accommodation at a school (details supplied) in County Cork, which is necessary to facilitate the enrolment of a child with a disability; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1081,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my Department is in receipt of an application for additional accommodation from the school referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>The application is currently being considered and my Department will be in direct contact with the school authorities concerned as soon as the assessment process has been concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300074#WRW01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":1082,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300074#WRW01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1083,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[35502\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300074#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide free school transport for a child (details supplied) In County Longford.","asker":"1065","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1084,"content":"<p>Under the terms of my Department's Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school.<\/p><p>The child referred to by the Deputy is not eligible for school transport as she is not attending her nearest national school.<\/p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only which is subject to a number of conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge.<\/p><p>However, Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the child cannot be accommodated on the existing service as this service is operating to capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300074#WRW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"question","counter":1086,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[35563\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101300074#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if full home status was awarded to students attending secondary schools in County Limerick in circumstances where the school attended is not the school closest to their home; the criteria under which these awards were made; when this new assessment process commenced; when it ceased; if the criteria changed nationally, or just for Limerick schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1087,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be aware that a Common Application System (CAS) was agreed between the post-primary schools in the Limerick area.
