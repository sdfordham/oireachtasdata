My Department and SOLAS\u00a0are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector. <\/p>  <p>  The range of apprenticeships on offer is also being expanded to meet the identified skill needs of the sector.

These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs identified by the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to apprenticeship provision, almost 7,000\u00a0beneficiaries\u00a0participated in SOLAS-funded construction related further education and training (FET) programmes\u00a0provided by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) under the &lsquo;Built Environment&rsquo; skills cluster during 2017.\u00a0 Examples of these programmes include programmes in concreting, ground work, scaffolding and sustainable construction. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Separately,\u00a0following a series of discussions with the CIF, SOLAS identified the following semi-skilled occupations as priority areas for the ETBs: <\/p>  <p>  - Form\u00a0worker <\/p>  <p>  - Steel-fixer <\/p>  <p>  - Curtain\u00a0waller\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Programmes have been put in place to produce approximately 100 form workers, 100 steel-fixers and 50 curtain wallers per year.\u00a0 SOLAS will continue to engage with the\u00a0ETBs to expand provision to meet needs in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400078#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Contractors","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400078#WRC01800"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[29370\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400078#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if guarantees will be sought from the remaining partners of an organisation (details supplied) that it will pay subcontractors for work already carried out on the schools bundle 5 PPP project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[29369\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400078#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has met unpaid subcontractors involved in constructing the schools bundle 5 PPP project; his plans to ensure they are paid for the work they have carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[29106\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400078#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the NDFA or his Department has an estimation of the number of subcontractors owed money for works carried out on the schools bundle 5 PPP project following the collapse of companies (details supplied); if there is an overall estimation of all outstanding moneys owed to these subcontractors; if the NDFA will engage with these subcontractors for work carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 100 and 131 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Schools Bundle 5 Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme comprises five school buildings and one further education college across four sites in Bray, Wexford, Carlow and Kells. This programme has been affected by the liquidations referred to by the Deputy.  It is recognised that these liquidations came as a particular blow to their employees and sub-contractors.  <\/p>  <p>  Like other major construction projects, school building projects involve a complex arrangement of contractual relationships between the client, the main contractor and various sub-contractors and suppliers.  In general, all sub-contractors and suppliers engaged on education sector building projects are employed directly by the main contractor, or indirectly by the main contractor through other sub-contractors.  The Department of Education and Skills does not have visibility of the detail of the relationship between the companies referred to by the Deputy and its sub-contractors.

However, an assessment, or diagnosis, will no longer be needed to access additional teaching support in schools. <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools.  This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that following on from an increase allowed in the 2017 Budget that the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist stands at 184 whole-time equivalents of which some 179 w.t.e. posts are currently filled leaving 5 posts vacant due to on-going retirements and resignations, etc. within the Service.\u00a0 Even at this current level this represents the highest number of psychologists to be employed within NEPS since the inception of the service in 2000.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally the Deputy may be aware that under the provisions of Budget 2018 I was pleased to announce that NEPS psychologist numbers will expand by a further her 10 posts from the start of the new academic year. <\/p>  <p>  A national recruitment competition is currently in operation by the Public Appointments Service in conjunction with my Department to replenish NEPS Regional Recruitment Panels to allow for both the filling of the abovementioned \u00a05 vacancies and the expansion of NEPS number by a further 10 posts.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.  I am not aware of any particular delays in the process.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400078#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":117,"content":"<p>Question No. 100 answered with Question No. 96.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400078#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[29129\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400078#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps he will take to assist teaching principals in primary schools who are struggling to absorb the stress and reported work overload associated with their positions; if the possibility and feasibility of allocating one administration day per week to teaching principals will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>Recently published Circular -\u00a040\/2018\u00a0is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, which outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.

The first and most essential requirement for examiners is subject competence.  The SEC has a strict policy when it comes to the recruitment of examiners which requires that personnel appointed to mark the state examinations are appropriately qualified.  This is non-negotiable. <\/p><p>When appointing examiners, the Commission advises that:<\/p><p>- Examiners appointed by it are selected on the basis of their academic qualifications, their teaching experience and their examining experience.<\/p><p>- All examiners are appropriately qualified for the work.<\/p><p>- Most of them are experienced serving and retired teachers.<\/p><p>- A large number of experienced examiners are reappointed each year<\/p><p>- When making new appointments, priority is given to teachers<\/p><p>- All appointments are overseen by the Chief Examiner<\/p><p>The procedures and criteria used for the appointment of examiners in 2018 are the same as in previous years. This year, as in every year, the SEC has prioritised qualified teachers to correct the exams but every year there are a small portion of examiners who are qualified in the subject area they are correcting but who are not qualified teachers. In 2017, a very small proportion (20 or 1.9% of all Junior Cycle examiners and 2 or 0.1% of all Leaving Certificate Examiners) held a qualification in the relevant subject but did not have a teaching qualification. The 2018 figures are still being finalised but the SEC do not have any reason to believe that the figures are substantially much different on previous years.  However, it is important to emphasise that all examiners go through rigorous training and instruction and their work is monitored by an experienced and senior member of the examining team who samples their work on an ongoing basis throughout the marking process.

Acknowledgement in the Council Conclusions of the voluntary nature of actions taken by Member States as part of military mobility initiatives is very much welcome.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  One of the concrete actions identified in the Action Plan is the\u00a0development of the Military Requirements which reflect the needs of the EU and its Member States,\u00a0establishing geographical\u00a0 parameters, planning needs for movement and transport, training and security needs and access to transport resources, including private and State transport infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0Technical specifications on transport infrastructure and loads\u00a0is expected by July 2018, and\u00a0the identification of infrastructure deemed ready is to be validated by the third quarter of 2018. A first progress report on the implementation of this Action Plan will be presented to the Member States by summer 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The actions in the area of Transport Infrastructure relate to the infrastructure needs to accommodate military vehicles and suggests the identification and assessment of needs of militaries to be able to transport military vehicles &ndash; both the routes and technical requirements for the infrastructure.  Member States are now invited to establish, as soon as possible, a single point of contact for information on access to transport infrastructure for military purposes and to consistently take military requirements into account when building transport infrastructure. My Department has been liaising with\u00a0the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in progressing this and with regard to establishing a single point of contact. <\/p>  <p>  As you will recognise, the actions requested of Ireland in order to implement the Action Plan on Military Mobility are not restricted to the Defence area alone but affect many more Departments and agencies, such as Departments of Transport, Revenue Commissioners and Foreign Affairs and Trade. As such, any national discussions in relation to Military Mobility requires a whole of Government approach and cannot be resolved solely within my Department. Therefore,\u00a0my Department is liaising with\u00a0all relevant Government Departments\u00a0and has highlighted the various responsibilities and will continue to co-ordinate the whole of Government position on Military Mobility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400083#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[29618\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400083#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the details of Ireland's involvement in the two projects on cross-border movement permission and on harmonising the military requirements related to customs as part of the framework of the European Defence Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>On 28 March 2018, the EU Commission issued its Action Plan on Military Mobility following on from a Joint Communication on military mobility issued in November 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission proposes that the Union enhance its strategic transport infrastructures to make them fit for military mobility.\u00a0 Some of the areas being examined for improvement under the Action Plan include streamlining procedures for diplomatic clearance, rationalising customs regulations, and reviewing transport of dangerous goods regulations and there is on-going work in the framework of the European Defence Agency (EDA) to support this.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, the EDA\u00a0has established two\u00a0Category A Projects, following a decision of its Steering Board, to bring forward proposals\/agreements in relation to (a) Cross Border Movement Permissions and (b) Common Customs arrangements for movement of Military Goods and Personnel across the EU.\u00a0EDA Category A Project proposals assume the participation of all member States with an option to opt-out at any stage, as opposed to Category B proposals whereby nations have to formally opt-in.\u00a0In Ireland's case, Government and D&aacute;il approval is required for participation in both Category A and B projects.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Two Ad Hoc Working Groups will be established within the European Defence Agency to discuss each Category A project and Ireland will be represented at the meetings of these groups during the development of the technical arrangements to ensure that no obligation is placed on member States and that national sovereignty and procedures are respected.\u00a0 The first meeting of the Group on the customs issues met yesterday,\u00a03 July and the first meeting of the Group on Movement Permissions will meet on 28 September.<\/p>  <p>  Following completion of the development of the technical arrangements by the working groups, Ireland will assess\u00a0its\u00a0position in relation to participation in the two Category A projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400083#WRH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":292,"content":"<p>Question No. 161 answered with Question No. 158.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Security and Defence Policy","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400083#WRH01600"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[29620\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400083#WRH01700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the details of the upcoming new joint declaration on EU-NATO co-operation in July 2018 and the obligations it will place on the EU; the involvement of Ireland in this co-operation; if it remains possible for member states to opt out of same on an individual basis; if he has expressed concerns on behalf of Ireland in the development and discussion of the joint declaration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>It is anticipated that the upcoming NATO Summit in July will include a new Joint Declaration regarding EU-NATO Cooperation.

I am advised that, arising from this process, very competitive fixed-fee rates were achieved relative to prevailing market norms.<\/p><p>I am advised that, in general, fees are not paid to receivers directly by NAMA but are instead paid out of the proceeds of assets under receivership or the management of these assets, pending realisation.  Fees for any particular insolvency are set by reference to the fees quoted by the insolvency practitioner as part of the public procurement process.\u00a0 All appointments are subject to on-going monitoring and evaluation and, in many cases, additional fee reductions are negotiated to ensure that fees are appropriate for the amount of work remaining on any given appointment.\u00a0 Typically fees reduce as the assignment progresses and the number of assets reduces by way of disposals or otherwise. \u00a0However, this depends on the complexity of the insolvency and the issues that may emerge during its course.<\/p><p>I would also refer the Deputy to Section 10 of the NAMA Act which obliges NAMA to obtain the best achievable return for the State. NAMA&rsquo;s preference is to work on a consensual basis with debtors so as to maximise the return from their assets. In instances where a receiver has been appointed over a debtor&rsquo;s assets, it is often due to the debtor&rsquo;s unwillingness to co-operate with NAMA. Upon appointment, a receiver takes control of the debtor&rsquo;s assets and any income produced by them. The receiver&rsquo;s legal obligation to maximise the return on the assets aligns well with NAMA&rsquo;s Section 10 requirements. <\/p><p>The fees approved by NAMA to receivers for their work on NAMA-secured assets from inception to end-June 2018 are outlined in the table attached. This includes fees approved to receivers who were appointed to assets prior to the acquisition of the related loans by NAMA.<\/p><p>Insolvency Practitioner fees approved from inception to 30 June 2018<\/p><p><table><tr><th><font face=\"Calibri\">Insolvency Practitioner<\/font><\/th><th><font face=\"Calibri\">IP Fees <br \/><br \/>2010                &euro;<\/font><\/th><th><font face=\"Calibri\">IP Fees <br \/><br \/>2011                 &euro;<\/font><\/th><th><font face=\"Calibri\">IP Fees <br \/><br \/>2012                 &euro;<\/font><\/th><th><font face=\"Calibri\">IP Fees <br \/><br \/>2013                 &euro;<\/font><\/th><th><font face=\"Calibri\">IP Fees <br \/><br \/>2014                 &euro;<\/font><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><font face=\"Calibri\">Alder King<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">                       -

As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.<\/p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.\u00a0 Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.\u00a0 I and my European counterparts have been working steadfastly since the financial crisis to bring about strengthened oversight and resolution regimes.  The entire financial services landscape has changed utterly, characterised by the presence of new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.<\/p><p>New European regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes.  The Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive, which came into force in 2014, brought about significant enhancements in the quality and quantity of capital that banks are required to hold and the setting of minimum liquidity requirements. <\/p><p>The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism have transformed the framework for dealing with failing banks and are designed to provide a financial safety net and a means for recovery and resolution with minimum disruption to the sovereign.  The overarching objective of the BRRD is to shift the cost of bank failure from taxpayers to shareholders and creditors of the institutions themselves. <\/p><p>The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks.  The central piece of the SSM supervisory process is the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) under which European Central Bank led joint supervisory teams inspect business models, internal governance, profitability and banking risks.<\/p><p>All of these new regulations and institutional arrangements have been designed to address the challenges of banking oversight and resolution at a European level and provide for a pro-active approach towards systemic and emergent risks at a European level.<\/p><p>Besides the introduction of new European and national regulations, the Central Bank too has increased its resources and has become more pro-active in addressing systemic risk.<\/p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations, I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations.  Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted.  Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted.  These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.<\/p><p><b>Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders - <\/b><\/p><p>In relation to this proposal, I remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform.  Representations are a valid part of the political process.  The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.<\/p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has advised in relation to the following recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal that:<\/p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners- <\/b><\/p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments.  This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.<\/p><p><b>Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements &ndash; <\/b><\/p><p>This recommendation has been considered.  These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission.  However, if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further.  The Deputy will appreciate that Revenue is not in a position to comment on matters relating to individuals for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400085#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400085#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[29574\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400085#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of times his Department has engaged polling companies and-or Irish market researchers to conduct research on its behalf in each of the past two years; the names of such companies; the costs associated with same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>The use of polling companies and\/or Irish market researchers to conduct research on behalf of my Department since June 2016 is outlined in the following table.\u00a0<table><tr><th>Company Name<\/th><th>Associated Costs<\/th><th>Year\u00a0<\/th><th>Detail<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Indecon International Economic Consultants<\/td><td>&euro;96,890.79 (&euro;78,773 plus VAT)<\/td><td>2018<\/td><td>A mini competition was run from December 2017 to January 2018 for research services to benchmark payments in Ireland.

Before this date taxpayers sent their appeals directly to Revenue who then transferred cases to the Appeal Commissioners when they were ready for a hearing.  Since that date, taxpayers send their appeals directly to the TAC which then notifies Revenue of the appeals.\u00a0 The TAC has full control over the processing and hearing of appeals.<\/p><p>I am advised by the TAC that the number of appeals before it can change frequently, depending on a number of factors, including the number of additional appeals received each day; the numbers closed each day; how many appeals are part-settled and how many that will settle based on the outcome of a &ldquo;leader-case&rdquo;.  The Commission can also be informed, by an appellant(s) or the Revenue Commissioners, that an appeal has settled or been withdrawn which might indicate a reduction in the number of appeals on hand; however, until this is confirmed by both parties, the TAC cannot deem the matter closed.<\/p><p>I am further advised by the TAC that it is not possible, for the most part, to provide the age of tax appeals before it, as many of them were transmitted to the Commission, in large tranches during 2016 by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  In relation to those &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; appeals, some were submitted by the appellant in 2016, to Revenue, but many had been with Revenue for some time before that.

For example, there may be time lags in the notification of new appeals by the TAC to Revenue and time lags in the closure of appeals by the TAC following settlement of an appeal by agreement between Revenue and the appellant.

As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.<\/p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.\u00a0 Poor supervision, an overly deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.\u00a0 I and my European counterparts have been working steadfastly since the financial crisis to bring about strengthened oversight and resolution regimes.  The entire financial services landscape has changed utterly, characterised by the presence of new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.<\/p><p>New European regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes.  The Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive, which came into force in 2014, brought about significant enhancements in the quality and quantity of capital that banks are required to hold and the setting of minimum liquidity requirements. <\/p><p>The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism have transformed the framework for dealing with failing banks and are designed to provide a financial safety net and a means for recovery and resolution with minimum disruption to the sovereign.  The overarching objective of the BRRD is to shift the cost of bank failure from taxpayers to shareholders and creditors of the institutions themselves. <\/p><p>The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks.  The central piece of the SSM supervisory process is the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) under which European Central Bank led joint supervisory teams inspect business models, internal governance, profitability and banking risks.<\/p><p>All of these new regulations and institutional arrangements have been designed to address the challenges of banking oversight and resolution at a European level and provide for a pro-active approach towards systemic and emergent risks at a European level.<\/p><p>Besides the introduction of new European and national regulations, the Central Bank too has increased its resources and has become more pro-active in addressing systemic risk.<\/p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations, I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief. The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations.  Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted.  Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted.

While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so.

It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. <\/p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to assist the administration of first aid or medicine.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2016, I requested the NCSE to lead a comprehensive review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme to identify and recommend\u00a0how, in the future, the additional care needs of students, over and above those needs that could be reasonably expected to be managed by teaching staff, should be met and to identify and recommend the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs who have additional care needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of medication and other such issues in schools, were raised with the NCSE as part of the consultation process of this review.<\/p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme was\u00a0published by the NCSE on 30 May 2018 and\u00a0my Department is developing proposals to implement the recommendations of the Review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400086#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400086#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[29606\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400086#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason for the lack of capital expenditure on the printing apprenticeship programme.","asker":"1266","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":367,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme which aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market.\u00a0 Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last number of years the number of employers registering apprentices to the craft of print media has significantly declined.

This is done through initial teacher education programmes, education centres and support services for teachers at primary and post-primary level.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.<\/p>  <p>  The Board of Management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the students in their school and care and safety should be at the centre of all policy and practices.  Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to provide training for teachers to ensure the safety and welfare of their pupils.<\/p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) advise that, by law, employers and those who control workplaces to any extent must identify hazards in the workplaces under their control and assess the risk presented by the hazards.<\/p>  <p>  Employers must write down the risks and what to do about them.  This is known as Risk Assessment.  The aim of Risk Assessment is to reduce the risk of injury and illness associated with work.  The Risk Assessment(s) will form part of\u00a0the employer's\u00a0Safety Statement.<\/p>  <p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 set out the First-Aid requirements for workplaces as follows: \"Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places at work where working conditions require it.  Depending on the size or specific hazard (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aiders must also be provided.  Apart from some exceptions, first-aid rooms must be provided where appropriate.  Information must also be provided to employees as regards the first-aid facilities and arrangements in place.\"<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any student attending.  Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children, to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, appropriate treatment is available.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisation representing school management at primary level.  While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so.  The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required, or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it, they should indemnify the school.<\/p>  <p>  My Department cannot direct any member of the Board of Management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment to pupils, action and procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses.<\/p>  <p>  The organisation of training in the administration of medicines is a matter for the Board of Management and my Department has no plans for future training programmes in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA.<\/p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enable the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner.

Following this evaluation I look forward to receiving the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations\u00a0which will assist in facilitating informed decision-making for the future direction of policy and funding for higher education.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the interim I am committed to investing in Higher Education through securing additional funding for the sector.  This commitment is reflected in Budget 2017 and 2018 announcements in which the higher education sector was prioritised.  In total, we will be investing more than &euro;100m in higher education in 2018 than in 2016.\u00a0 We will look to continue this commitment to investment in higher education in 2019 and beyond.  This additional funding will allow for targeted initiatives in higher education including skills programmes, performance and innovation funding, technological university development and apprenticeship costs in the sector.  It will also allow for places to be provided for 2,100 additional students in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore\u00a0as part of Budget 2018, the Government decided to raise the National Training Fund levy by 0.1% in 2018 to 0.8%, and by a further 0.1% in both 2019 and 2020 (subject to the reform of the NTF to make it more transparent and to afford employers greater opportunity to inform the NTF expenditure priorities).  The increase in funding from the National Training Fund is a key strategic element of the overall funding increase for higher and further education.  This measure will allow for an additional expenditure of &euro;47.5 million this year as part of the Exchequer-Employer Funding Mechanism, bringing the total allocation for 2018 to &euro;415m.  It is estimated that the proposed increases to the levy in 2019 and 2020 will create additional fiscal space of a cumulative &euro;104m in 2019 and &euro;165m in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are further reforming the model by which higher education funding is allocated.\u00a0 An independent Expert Panel was appointed by the HEA in 2016 to review the current allocation model for funding higher education and to make recommendations on the most appropriate funding model for the future.\u00a0\u00a0The Review of the Allocation Model for Funding Higher Education Institutions was published on 15th January 2018.  The reforms\u00a0will link funding of higher education institutions to the delivery of key national priorities including better alignment to skill needs of the economy, higher levels of\u00a0 performance and innovation, expansion of research; particularly with enterprise partners, the promotion of STEM provision, wider skills needs, and promoting access and lifelong learning.\u00a0 It provides a roadmap for transitioning towards a reformed funding model that is more transparent, consistent across higher education institutions, that incentivises actions in key strategic areas, and supports improved accountability while also respecting institutional autonomy.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  An\u00a0implementation group has been established\u00a0which is comprised of representatives from DES, HEA, DPER, THEA &amp;amp; IUA.  The Group are progressing a number of key priority recommendations for 2018 including the new Innovation and Performance Funds, the allocation of additional funding for HEIs with multi-campus provision\u00a0that meet specific criteria, and a proposed new financial penalty for serious governance breaches.  This comprehensive approach is being taken in order to contribute to the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the sector.\u00a0 As such, it will be important to build broad political and societal consensus on achieving the most appropriate future funding model and the Department will continue to work to that end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400090#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Services Staff","counter":457,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400090#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":458,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[29625\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400090#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the employment situation of school secretaries employed by boards of management will be examined with reference to their pay and conditions and pension entitlements.","asker":"1232","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":459,"content":"<p>To answer the Deputy, the majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services.

Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.<\/p><p>The Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is a multi-annual Scheme.  Over 1,650 schools, nearly 50% of schools, applied for inclusion under the current round of the scheme which reflects a very high demand.  <\/p><p>To date, almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the Scheme, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools,  for Gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works.

This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for 178 schools nationwide to be completed.  These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners in relation to giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the summer works scheme from 2019 onwards.

Changes to the Scheme will be subject to further consultations with the Office of the Attorney General and other relevant Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Scheme included a number of proposals that made provision for the protection of those who engage in gambling activities. \u00a0Among these proposals was the establishment of a centralised self-exclusion register that would be maintained by the regulatory body proposed under the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Allied to this work, and in the context of reviewing and updating the General Scheme in all necessary aspects,\u00a0a Working Group, chaired by myself, comprising all stakeholder Departments, relevant Offices and\u00a0the Office of the Attorney General has been meeting since February 2018.

As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.<\/p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.\u00a0 Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.\u00a0 I and my European counterparts have been working steadfastly since the financial crisis to bring about strengthened oversight and resolution regimes.  The entire financial services landscape has changed utterly, characterised by the presence of new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.<\/p><p>New European regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes.  The Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive, which came into force in 2014, brought about significant enhancements in the quality and quantity of capital that banks are required to hold and the setting of minimum liquidity requirements.<\/p><p>The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism have transformed the framework for dealing with failing banks and are designed to provide a financial safety net and a means for recovery and resolution with minimum disruption to the sovereign.  The overarching objective of the BRRD is to shift the cost of bank failure from taxpayers to shareholders and creditors of the institutions themselves.<\/p><p>The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks.  The central piece of the SSM supervisory process is the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) under which European Central Bank led joint supervisory teams inspect business models, internal governance, profitability and banking risks.<\/p><p>All of these new regulations and institutional arrangements have been designed to address the challenges of banking oversight and resolution at a European level and provide for a pro-active approach towards systemic and emergent risks at a European level.<\/p><p>Besides the introduction of new European and national regulations, the Central Bank too has increased its resources and has become more pro-active in addressing systemic risk.<\/p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations, I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations.  Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted.  Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted.

To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000\u00a0recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 76<b><\/b>members have been assigned to the Louth<b><\/b>Division.\u00a0 Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. \u00a0In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date.\u00a0 Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the\u00a0Louth Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.<\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.\u00a0 I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.\u00a0 To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  While not all Garda Stations are training stations it is important to note that\u00a0the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if\u00a0required, by the Divisional Officer.<\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in tabular form the number for Garda&iacute; assigned to the Louth Division by rank, on the 31 May 2018 the latest date for which figures are currently available and details of the Division&rsquo;s Garda Stations opening hours which are subject to the operational requirements of the Division. <\/p><p>STRENGTH OF THELOUTH DIVISION BY RANK 31 MAY 2018<table><tr><th>DISTRICT<\/th><th>STATION<\/th><th>GD<\/th><th>SG<\/th><th>IN<\/th><th>SU<\/th><th>CS<\/th><th>AC<\/th><th>TOTAL<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>ARDEE<\/td><td>ARDEE<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>5<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CASTLEBELLINGHAM<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>COLLON<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>LOUTH<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>7<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DROGHEDA<\/td><td>CLOUGHERHEAD<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DROGHEDA<\/td><td>89<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>105<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DUNLEER<\/td><td>5<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>95<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>112<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DUNDALK<\/td><td>BLACKROCK          \u00a0<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CARLINGFORD<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DRUMAD<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DUNDALK<\/td><td>124<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>145<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>HACKBALLSCROSS<\/td><td>4<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>OMEATH<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>142<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>166<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH   TOTAL<\/td><td><\/td><td>264<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>312<\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th>Louth Garda Station Opening Hours<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>Monday to Friday<\/td><td>Saturday<\/td><td>Sunday<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Drogheda<\/td><td>24 Hrs<\/td><td>24 Hrs<\/td><td>24Hrs<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dunleer<\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>12 pm to 1 pm<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clogherhead<\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>12 pm to 1 pm<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk<\/td><td>24 hrs<\/td><td>24 hrs <\/td><td>24 hrs<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blackrock<\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>12 pm to 1 pm<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Drumad<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Hackballscross<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Omeath<\/td><td>6 pm to 9 pm<\/td><td>6 pm to 9 pm<\/td><td>6 pm to 9 pm<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlingford<\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>12 pm to 1pm<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ardee (24 hr patrol)<\/td><td>12 pm to 5 pm &amp;amp; 9pm to 10 pm Mon, Tues &amp;amp; Wed. 3 pm   to 5 pm Thurs. 9 pm to 10 pm Fri.<\/td><td>9 pm to 10 pm<\/td><td>Closed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Collon<\/td><td><\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>12 pm to 1 pm<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth Village<\/td><td><\/td><td>10 am to 1 pm<\/td><td>12 pm to 1 pm<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlebellingham<\/td><td>No specific times.

For its part, the State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanisms to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.<\/p>  <p>  Under Irish law, as\u00a0established in\u00a0case law, it is not mandatory for employers to recognize\u00a0trade unions.

It should be noted that internal representative committees are not trade unions and as such are not required to hold a negotiating licence or to be registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.<\/p>  <p>  It has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to support the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.  An extensive range of statutory provisions have been put in place\u00a0 to provide the legislative support for such a framework.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent legislation to facilitate this is\u00a0the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 that came into effect on 1 August 2015.

The legislation\u00a0took account of relevant European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence, as well as the conclusions and recommendations of the ILO in its consideration of a complaint by the\u00a0Irish Congress of Trade Unions\u00a0against the\u00a0Government in the context of\u00a0ILO Convention 98 to\u00a0which\u00a0the deputy refers.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act\u00a0makes provision, in instances where\u00a0employers engage in collective bargaining with an &lsquo;internal excepted body&rsquo; as opposed to a trade union, for\u00a0a referral to be made to the\u00a0Labour Court to establish if\u00a0internal bargaining bodies\u00a0are genuinely independent of their employer.

Where a service is provided in Ireland but a patient wishes to access care in another EU\/EEA Member State, this can be possible by seeking treatment under the Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare, otherwise known as the Cross Border Directive (CBD).<\/p><p>The CBD provides rules for the reimbursements to patients of the cost of receiving treatment abroad, where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in their home Member State, and supplements the rights that patients already have at EU level.\u00a0 Patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of another Member State under the CBD. Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways, i.e. they must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.\u00a0It is important to note that reimbursement is confined to the costs of the care itself and that the rates of reimbursement cannot exceed the cost of provision of the care if it were provided in the Irish public health service.<\/p><p>Certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long term care, organ transplantation, etc. are excluded under the CBD.<\/p><p>The HSE operates the CBD in Ireland. Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians. In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the CBD on its website which can be accessed at:<\/p><p>hse.ie\/eng\/services\/list\/1\/schemes\/cbd<i><font color=\"#0000FF\">\/<\/font><\/i>and also by phone at 056 7784551. The HSE advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorization before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP.  <\/p><p>The HSE also operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation (EC) No. 883\/2004, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations (EC) No. 987\/2009. The TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE) where the treatment is: <\/p><p>- Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation;<\/p><p>- Not available in Ireland; and <\/p><p>- Not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease. <\/p><p>GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS. The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend.  <\/p><p>Each application is reviewed individually and a decision is made in accordance with the legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts.

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged.  <\/p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment.  In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.  <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400098#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400098#WRX00500"},{"type":"question","counter":643,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[29505\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400098#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the improvements he plans in the home care system; his views on whether substantial investment in the system is required to supply the level of home care necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":644,"content":"<p>In advancement of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to promote community-care so that people can continue to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible, the Department of Health is currently engaged in the development of a new, stand-alone statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-care services.  <\/p>  <p>  The new home-care scheme will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation.  It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner and will help to improve access to home-care services on an affordable and sustainable basis.  The introduction of a system of regulation for home-care will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided.  The new scheme will also be designed to support family\/unpaid carers and will complement and integrate effectively with other health and social-care services such as long-term residential care (including the Nursing Homes Support Scheme), primary and community services and hospital services.  <\/p>  <p>  The development of a statutory scheme for home-care is a complex process.  A significant amount of preparatory work remains to be undertaken before decisions are reached on the form of the scheme and the system of regulation. This is required if reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable. Every effort is being made to advance this work as quickly as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  While the new home-care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive are continuing efforts to improve existing home-care services.  In 2018 the HSE brought the funding for Home Help and Home Care Packages together into a single Home Support Service for older people.  As well as simplifying the application-process for home-care, the new service will be more responsive to service-users' changing needs.  More broadly the HSE will continue to encourage local integration of services and to build appropriate care-pathways, in particular for people with complex needs.  A consumer-directed approach to home-support provision will be introduced, giving service-users greater choice in relation to when they receive services and their selection of a service-provider.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government (2016) to increase funding for home-care annually, funding for Older Persons&rsquo; Services rose from &euro;763m in 2017 to &euro;811m in 2018, including approximately &euro;417m for the provision of home-support services.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2018 provides for a target of 17.094m home-support hours to be provided to 50,500 people, which compares with 16.34m hours delivered to 50,000 people in 2017.  A further 156,000 hours, relating to adverse weather funding, will be provided in 2018.  A target of 360,000 home-support hours for people with complex needs will be provided through 235 Intensive HCPs.  <\/p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service-provision, the demand for home-support continues to grow.  It is important to note that, although the funding for home-support across the system is significant, it is finite, restricting service-supply.  At end of March 6,458 people were waiting for new or additional supports following assessment.  All those waiting are provided with a service as soon as possible on the basis of their assessed needs, with priority given to those awaiting discharge from acute hospitals.  <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review 2018 outlines projections of demand and capacity requirements for a range of health services to 2031.  Accordingly, it forecasts that a 120% increase in home-care services will be required by 2031 if key reforms and productivity measures are implemented.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400098#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","counter":645,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400098#WRX00800"},{"type":"question","counter":646,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[29522\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070400098#WRX00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the services publicly available for children with autism in an area (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":647,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The National Screening Service (NSS) have advised that the primary screening tool for BowelScreen is the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), which operates on an automated testing  platform.  The FIT looks for blood in a stool sample which may indicate the presence of abnormal growths in the bowel which can become cancer.  It is important to note that the FIT test itself cannot screen for colon cancer. <\/p><p>The National Screening Service (NSS) have advised that all FIT tests are examined by MedLab  Pathology.  An abnormal FIT result suggests that  there may be bleeding within the gastrointestinal tract that requires further  investigation.  Those with an abnormal result are then invited for further testing via a colonoscopy at a hospital-based screening colonoscopy unit.  The colonoscopy units which currently provide colonoscopies on behalf of BowelScreen are based in 14 hospitals across the country.  They are:<\/p><p>1.  Clonmel Hospital;<\/p><p>2.

These were issues that were central to the recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report which was published in March 2011.  Ultimately, the 2012 Act comprehensively addressed these\u00a0core issues while also\u00a0having regard to\u00a0Government commitments at that time as well as recommendations from the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO) and the Standards in Public Office Commission\u00a0(SIPO) on other related matters.<\/p>  <p>\u00a0  The Tribunal recommended that all political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be reported and published.  Under the 2012 Act, which amended the Electoral Act 1997, the threshold at which donations must be declared by a political party to SIPO fell from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500.  The declaration threshold for a donation received by a candidate or an elected representative was reduced from &euro;634.87 to &euro;600.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, a limit of &euro;200 was placed on donations in cash.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The threshold for the receipt of anonymous donations was reduced to &euro;100.  The donation threshold amount that gives rise to the requirement to open a political donations account was also reduced to &euro;100.  Anonymous indirect donations were banned under the 2012 Act.  There was a reduction from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;200 in the threshold at which donations must be reported by companies, trade unions, societies and building societies in their annual reports or returns.  In addition,\u00a0the threshold for donors other than companies, trade unions, societies and building societies, in reporting donations to SIPO was reduced from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500 for aggregate donations given in the same year.<\/p>  <p>  The Moriarty Tribunal in its Report also noted that the desirability and feasibility of a complete ban on private political funding is pre-eminently a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas and for public debate and consideration, having regard to constitutional issues that might arise, and to the national financial exigencies.  With reference to this comment in the Tribunal Report, a noteworthy provision in the Act is the introduction of a ban on the acceptance of donations over &euro;200 for political purposes from a corporate donor unless the donor has registered with SIPO.  In this instance, the objective was to restrict the influence of corporate donors.  Such donations also need to be accompanied by a statement confirming that the donation has been approved by a general meeting of the members of the body, or by its trustees.\u00a0 By restricting corporate donations in this manner, the 2012 Act went beyond the recommendations made by the Tribunal.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 2012 Act provides for a reduction in the maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation by an individual from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.  This &euro;1,000 limit applies in respect of donations to a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament or a member of a local authority, as well as a candidate at a Presidential, D&aacute;il, Seanad, European Parliament or local election.
