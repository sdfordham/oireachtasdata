Firstly, I would like to say that I welcome this opportunity to share my experience in the roles I held in Anglo Irish Bank and IBRC with the members of the joint committee.  I look forward to answering, as best I can and to the extent possible, any questions you have in relation to my performance in those roles and wider matters relating to the bank both pre and post its nationalisation.<\/p> <p>  To enable best usage of the time allocated to this session, I have narrowed the focus of my opening statement to deal with what I believe are the key areas of my testimony.  By way of background, I have worked in financial services for a substantive part of my career to date, beginning in corporate treasury roles in First Active and KBC, followed then by a variety of roles within Anglo Irish Bank and, latterly, IBRC.  These roles in Anglo were performed over a 15-year period from 1998 to 2013.  From 1998 up to managing the sale of the credit ... under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act of the bank's deposits and NAMA bonds to Allied Irish Banks plc in February 2011, my main role was to raise customer deposits in order to fund the bank's balance sheet growth.  I performed that role as a corporate deposit manager up to 2001, as head of retail banking from 2001 to 2006, as director of corporate and retail treasury from 2006 to 2008 and as head of retail banking again from 2008 to 2011.  During this period, I reported to the head of corporate deposits, head of treasury, director of treasury, the managing director of Ireland and the head of operations in the bank, respectively.<\/p> <p>  I was appointed to the senior executive board or the SEB for a 12-month period from in and around the middle of 2006 to 2007.  This was a management level below the main board of the bank.  I also served on a number of management committees and subsidiary company boards at various times.  I did not, however, serve as an executive director or member of the board of Anglo Irish Bank or any of its sub-committees.<\/p><p>Following the appointment of Mike Aynsley as the new CEO in late 2009, I became a member of the new leadership team of the bank and worked in a number of significant post-nationalisation restructuring projects.  Finally, in early 2011, I was appointed as head of corporate treasury, or corporate affairs and communications, a role I held until my departure from IBRC in February 2013.  For the purpose of clarity, my responsibilities in all of the roles previously mentioned did not extend to lending to customers or involvement in the credit, risk, audit or compliance functions of the bank.<br\/><br\/>The primary role of the group treasury role of Anglo was to fund the bank's lending growth.  Both wholesale and customer funding were sourced for this purpose.  By 2008, a significant portion of the bank's balance sheet was funded with customer deposits from two main categories, namely, retail deposit customers and corporate deposit customers.  These deposits were the lifeblood of the bank and the business proposition was interest rate and customer service driven.  The marginal returns offered for surplus cash on deposit made it worthwhile for customers to switch banking relationships for this aspect of their business alone.  The corporate deposit customer profile ranged from SMEs to large corporate and institutional clients across practically every business sector.  Retail customers were predominantly older savers with lump sums to invest.<br\/><br\/>The centres for sourcing corporate deposits in Anglo Irish Bank grew from a small network of branches in Ireland and offshore in the '70s to a large group treasury centre in Dublin in the '80s, followed by an ... additional branches in the UK and another large treasury centre in London in the '90s.  From 2000 onwards, further centres in Austria, Dusseldorf, Jersey and Boston were used to source corporate deposits in line with asset growth.  As a result of this planned expansion, deposits from corporate customers in Anglo grew year-on-year to &euro;32 billion in 2008, accounting for 36% of the total funding position of the bank.  The strategic intent to broaden its funding base to include deposits from retail customers was established in 2001 in line with the introduction of the SSIA, or special savings incentive scheme, in Ireland.  Once established, the retail savings function in Ireland became successful very quickly and attracted significant positive media coverage and commentary due to the perceived lack of competitive offerings for savers in Ireland at that time.  <br\/><br\/>Following this success, a strategic decision was then taken in 2004 to launch a retail savings proposition in the United Kingdom.  While the UK savings market was, at the time, one of the most competitive in Europe, it was agreed to proceed and, following a test-and-learn period in early 2005, the bank began to enjoy considerable success with UK savers and growth was driven using high interest rates advertised in best-buy tables, in online and offline media and other comparator and aggregator sites such as <i>moneysupermarket.com<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>The remaining retail funding site of the bank was the Isle of Man.  This had been in operation for many years and attracted a limited but consistent level of savings from onshore and offshore high net worth savers.  While successful among its local peers in this space, the Isle of Man operation would always remain the smallest retail saving centre operated by the bank up to nationalisation.  As a result of this planned expansion from early 2001 to its peak in 2008, the volume of retail savings from those three markets alone grew to <i>circa<\/i>&euro;19 billion of funds entrusted.  Close to 50% of these funds had come from the UK market over a relatively short period of time, with the balance coming from Ireland and the Isle of Man.  Total deposits from retail customers in 2008 accounted for 22% of the overall funding position of the bank.  At its peak, therefore, Anglo Irish Bank had a total portfolio of &euro;51 billion of deposits, which accounted for 58% of the total funding sources of the bank.  Given the strong growth of the UK retail funding franchise, a full launch plan was developed and under consideration to enter the German savings market in 2009.  This was with a view to reducing the growing geographic concentration and significantly expanding the bank's future potential funding sources.  This plan, however, was never implemented following the nationalisation of the bank.  <br\/><br\/>The fast-growing concentration of UK-sourced retail funding was influenced by the increase in the Irish deposit protection scheme in Ireland and the subsequent introduction of the Government guarantee, as I have detailed in my witness statement.  The collapse of Northern Rock was the first event that weakened customer confidence in the security of their savings with Anglo Irish Bank.  The bank took thousands of calls per day from concerned customers who either wanted to withdraw funds or seek assurances that their deposits were safe.<\/p><p>While the UK retail centre of the bank was the main focus of calls from UK customers, Irish savers became equally nervous when queues formed outside the Northern Rock office in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>The collapse of Anglo's share price on 17 March was the second event to weaken customer confidence in the security of their savings.  The seriousness of this event was greatly inflated by the fact that the Anglo share price, alone among Irish banks, was being targeted by sellers and fell by <i>circa<\/i>15% on that day.  The outflows were significant and the bank ran a very real risk of not being able to handle the volume of inbound calls from concerned customers.  It also introduced the first real risk of the bank&rsquo;s branches in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway not being able to deal with the volume of customers calling to close their accounts.<br\/><br\/>The collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 was the third and final event that shook the confidence of customers in the safety of their savings.  It is my view that the bank experienced a full-blown run on customer deposits from that period up to 29 September 2008.  As the primary channel for both corporate and retail customers dealing with the bank, however, was via the telephone, this run never fully manifested itself in the public domain.  In Ireland in particular however, the word on the street was that Anglo was in serious trouble.  It was an incredibly stressful time for retail deposit customers in particular, many of whom still had all of their savings with the bank.  While having survived two material events of this nature, the events of September brought a new level of uncertainty for the staff and management of the bank and, with the share price now below 30 cent, I believe most of the senior staff honestly feared the bank might not recover.<br\/><br\/>Up to the start of the crisis in August 2007, Anglo Irish Bank was lauded on the stock market for its spectacular balance sheet growth and highly profitable business model.  This and Anglo&rsquo;s commentary from a multitude of market analysts and other commentators led to Anglo being put forward as an example to its competitors and peers.  In terms of the bank&rsquo;s chosen credit strategy therefore, as a predominantly property-based lender in the Irish, UK and North American markets, it was difficult to foresee that everybody internally and externally could be wrong.  The bank&rsquo;s loan default rates had remained very low for the previous decade and there remained a huge appetite for commercial property projects, in particular among investors and developers in the bank&rsquo;s chosen markets.  Existing clients of the bank who had experience and track record in that sector were on hand to meet the demand and the clients&rsquo; stated credit policy was to back and work with these types of clients where the property had strong tenants, where cashflows could be identified and secured and where personal guarantees were available as additional security.<br\/><br\/>Anglo was three monoline banking divisions in one financial institution, namely, lending, treasury and wealth management.  While all were successful in rapidly growing and diversifying their markets for their individual activities, each sold what could be broadly viewed as a single financial product into a highly targeted customer base, i.e., loans to borrowers in the real estate sector, deposits to interest-rate sensitive corporate and retail customers and predominantly real estate investment products often geared to high net worth individual clients.  While the global liquidity crisis affected nearly every bank worldwide to some degree in 2007 and 2008, the underlying structure of the bank, together with the pace at which it had grown in that structure, compounded the stress of that crisis in a much higher degree to other banks who had lower concentration of lending exposures, more diversified funding sources and fee income from a wider universal offering to a diverse and longer-established customer base.<br\/><br\/>While Anglo Irish Bank had ceased development lending to new clients and had no direct exposure to private mortgage lending, the monoline exposure to a highly mobile customer deposit base in particular hit Anglo hard and fast in late 2008, as the perceived liquidity issue quickly became an actual one for the bank.  Further complications arose for the bank out of the difficulty in reducing or stopping lending as the crisis worsened.  This was in part down to the contractual commitments to borrowers and also the risk that without further lending, some development projects would cease and result in immediate and significant loan default.  All of this took place in the face of unforeseen and therefore unanticipated risks, which included a total market dislocation and a practically simultaneous failure of each individual source of funding open to the bank over a period of less than 12 months.<br\/><br\/>I sincerely hope that my testimony today will be of benefit to the inquiry in fulfilling its mandate.<\/p><p>I would like to say that I fully accept responsibility for my roles as both corporate and director . . . corporate . . . as director of corporate and retail treasury and head of retail banking of Anglo Irish Bank for any part that I may have played in its failure and the consequences it had on the Irish State.  It is genuinely something that I will always regret.<\/p><p> Finally, I would like to highlight that at the time of writing and submitting my witness statement to this inquiry, I do not hold any documents or other memoranda such as minutes of meetings from my time in the bank and, therefore, its contents are solely based on my recollection of events at the time.

And we presented that to Donal O'Connor at the time.  And obviously the bank had been nationalised so it didn't go any further.  But there was certainly a strategic intent, to your point Deputy, that we were stretching our existing markets for too much funding and we needed to get into at least one or more ... to European markets on the retail side.

Okay, well, maybe just one minute of background: the sale of the Austrian private bank followed on from a strategy of the bank to divest of private banking businesses outside of Ireland and the UK, so there was a trust business in the Isle of Man which was sold in 2006, I think, a private bank in Geneva that was sold around the same time, a fledgling private banking operation in Dubai, which we closed very early on, and I was asked to lead the sale of the private bank in Austria following on from that.  That sale process started before the crisis.  To your point, we did pause halfway through that process as liquidity issues were hitting the bank to determine if we sell this bank we are also selling, I think, it was either &euro;575 million or &euro;600 million in deposits, so it was considered.  I had a discussion with the CEO and the finance director about it.  We decided to proceed for three reasons.  One was we had ... we were now fully engaged in a sale process and, obviously, stopping the sale of a private bank in particular is quite difficult in that you've got counterparties now actively doing due diligence etc., so we felt that pulling the sale would not just reduce the value significantly then but also any further time that we were to put it on the market.  That's number one.  Number two, our view was that the deposits at the time were a very small percentage of our overall customer funding business, so if you think about it we may have probably had about &euro;45 billion, I can't remember the number, of total customer deposits then and this was &euro;600 million.  I think the third was I don't think we genuinely believed that the liquidity stress that the bank was under would actually result in its total collapse.

If you look at the results, the presentation of the bank in 2008, it was for, you know, dislocation in the markets to last for another 12 months, maybe 18 months, and then we would regain traction.

On this board and indeed on any board that I've served, having spent a lot of my life in plc world, I'm very conscious of how businesses interact with the equity investment markets and my advice and views to any boards I've been on are basically contained in the principle that shareholder value, which is ultimately what plcs are required to deliver in the context of a number of other things, is only delivered on a sustainable basis if it's based on a business that has a sound business model, has achieved credibility over time by virtue of its delivery against that model and has a management team which in themselves have got credibility in the market.  And my request of the team at all times was to ensure that in articulating the business, the model and the reporting of results, etc., that those factors would be borne in mind, and the manner in which that that would be reflected in terms of outcomes would be that long-term value type holders would invest in the business.

Ironically, in the business I've run for 13 years as CEO and 17 years as an executive in the world of packaging, which is very far removed from banking, I accept, but we have a very narrow product range and the equity markets love it, because it's high-concentration expertise in a narrow area, deep and meaningful engagement.  The debt markets don't like it because obviously of the higher risk attached to it.  The way we dealt with it in my current business is we widened the geographic spread so that we actually got the portfolio effect of geography in terms of the de-risking of it.  In the Anglo case, again, the product range or the product area was narrow but there were significant moves afoot to widen the application of that both in terms of product and in terms of geography.

But, because we were in an escalating and hyper property inflated environment, that, by the time they moved to the next development, the value of the initial development had exceeded the loan-to-value and probably was in high positive equity, therefore that positive equity could be used as a deposit on the next development, which meant that there was no cash payment on the next loan.  What was there was a securitisation on what we subsequently found out was an overvalued development.  And this became compounded where a very small number of lenders with your institution found themselves getting massive cash loans, or getting massive loans, over a period of time, to accumulate more developments without ever spending a single cent in deposit terms.  I mean, this is the type of concentrations we're talking about.  And, when Anglo finally crashed, what we saw on its loan book was a very, very small number of people with huge debt exposure.

Chairman, members of the committee, since the beginning of 2009 I have co-operated with all the various lines of inquiry and investigations by State and other bodies and I welcome the opportunity to come before you this afternoon.  In addition to the detailed written submission which I furnished to the committee in early August 2015, I come here today before you to further assist the committee - as best I can - in the crucial work you are undertaking.<\/p> <p>  The failure of Anglo Irish Bank and the wider banking system in Ireland was a calamity for the Irish economy and for the many people associated with the banks, including staff, customers, investors and the Irish taxpayers.  Whilst I never served as a member of the board of directors of the bank or as an executive director, I was within the next layers of management, both before its nationalisation and afterwards.  Following nationalisation by the Minister for Finance in January 2009, the new Government-appointed board selected and appointed me as director of group finance.  I will endeavour to give the committee as clear a picture as I can of the circumstances of which I have knowledge surrounding the failure of the bank.<\/p> <p>  I joined the bank in late 2002.  Prior to that, on completion of my university studies, I spent some eight years as a financial consultant in London and New York, primarily in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. I had no lending experience and my role in Anglo was not on the lending side.  My brief was to support the group finance director, as required, and I carried out a variety of projects in this regard.  My expertise was in corporate finance activities such as mergers and acquisitions, equity raising, financial analysis, as well as special financial assignments.  Among the projects that I managed or had significant involvement in were: major share placings, raising almost &euro;1 billion in new equity capital for the bank; liaison with international investment analysts that were conducting independent analysis on the business; assessing acquisition opportunities; and completing the disposal of the bank&rsquo;s private banking business in Austria and also in Switzerland.<\/p><p>Within group finance, I was involved in restructuring management accounts reporting ... to enhance reporting standards, recruiting specialist accounting skills in each area of the Dublin-based finance team, overseeing the introduction of international financial reporting standards for the bank's accounts and in assisting the leadership of the treasury trading business to devise strategy and business plans. <\/p><p> In late 2004, I was given the title, chief financial officer, to assist my profile in representing the bank without any change of my role.  My investor relations function meant externally I became more widely known as an executive of the bank.  My work in these and other areas reflected well on the bank internationally and increased my standing internally.  I also had responsibility for managing the group finance Dublin function.  This function included the preparation of monthly management accounts, the preparation of regulatory returns on the direction of the group finance director, and liaising with the auditors on the conduct of the audit of the Irish operation of the bank and group consolidation.  During this period, the quality of the bank's internal and regulatory reporting were greatly improved. <\/p><p> Events since the banking crisis have shown that the risk position of the bank and that of all other financial institutions in Ireland deteriorated to an event ... to an extent not foreseen at that time.  The same happened across Europe and elsewhere.  There are well-documented external and internal reasons for this.  The external reasons have already been aired before the committee.  I don't propose to dwell on these, except to underline that they made life impossible for many financial and regulatory institutions, with fault lines being exposed across a wide spectrum.  There was little or no perception by forecasters or authorities of the severity of what lay ahead.  In addition, the bank had a distinctive external pressure arising through the Quinn investment and leveraged contracts for difference that were held through a multitude of investment banking and other broker counterparties internationally. <\/p><p> There were also significant internal issues within the bank, some of which are indicated in the core documents circulated by the committee in recent weeks.  These support the view outlined in my written submission to the committee that the lending function was excessively dominant in the bank and that the risk function controls were, ultimately, insufficient.  This is best captured in the decision to consolidate the leadership of the risk and finance functions under the group finance director in 2007 and the management reorganisation of the same year.  That reorganisation saw the senior executive board narrowed to just five people, including four lenders and one non-lender.  It was apparent from these and other events that the value attached to independent views had diminished.<\/p><p> Group finance Dublin did not have responsibility for lending by the bank.  Group finance Dublin did not have any responsibility in group risk management, which was the key control function in the conduct of the bank's lending business.  At all times since the late 1990s, risk and finance teams were entirely segregated with distinct areas of responsibility.  This continued to be the case even after the aforementioned change to leadership.<\/p><p> Management accounting and audit relied on the integrity of the data inputted by the lending divisions, regional operations and other departments in the bank.  This data was adjusted to account for impairments and provisions set out in a monthly report prepared independently by the risk management department based on its detailed assessment of loan risk.  As in almost all banking institutions, the interrogation and scrutiny of lending data and underlying risk was the responsibility of risk management.  Inadequate controls in this area was one of the factors in the subsequent difficulties that faced the bank. <\/p><p> From the second half of 2007, throughout the year 2008 and into 2009 the bank was in constant spasms of crisis.  Strenuous efforts were made to determine the extent of the bank's downside exposure to the ensuing financial turmoil, both within and outside of the bank.  My role throughout this time was primarily looking at capital opportunities for the bank in international capital markets.  The incessant downward spiral in each of the economies in which the bank lent money, but most particularly in Ireland, exacerbated the scale of losses in each half year.  None of these reviews by multiple parties from within and outside of the bank identified the scale of the potential losses.  In addition, none of them, from what is known to me, found defects in financial reporting in respect of lending impairment.  <\/p><p> Internal audit within the bank, which reported directly to the board audit committee and the chief executive, would have conducted its own reviews on processes and procedures.  The factors contributing to the failure of the bank were multifaceted and complex.  There were many actions, decisions, events and circumstances surrounding this and all viewed through a different lens than the one we use today.  <\/p><p> I would like to conclude by expressing my own sincere and deep regret for the great hardship that the failure of the bank and the wider banking system in general inflicted on so many.  Chairman, notwithstanding the constraints placed upon me, which the committee is aware, and the fact that I have not had access to potentially relevant materials pertaining to the bank from 2002 through to 2008 and thereafter, I will now endeavour to answer any questions you and other members of the committee have and seek to help you in relation to your lines of inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#KK00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Moran, for your opening statement and if I can invite Deputy Eoghan Murphy to commence questioning.

So the bank worked very significantly to manage liquidity in the period.  There were a number of issues, I think, which are worth highlighting.  Firstly, the bank was a monoline bank and businesses that are focused, niche players tend to do very well in strong economic environments.  Businesses that are focused, niche players, on the other hand, tend to do less well when economies are hit.  Now, I don't think anybody foresaw the scale of crisis that was going to come but that was a factor that the bank had to handle.<br\/><br\/>Secondly, the bank was single-A rated and, over time, it became <i>de facto<\/i>necessary to have a double-A rating to play in the markets.  Thirdly, we had a very particular issue in respect of the CFD holding in the bank and that manifested itself and became known to me towards the end of 200.  But I think the fact that that position was held by so many international counterparties, the market became aware of that and that undoubtedly, in my view, had an impact on liquidity within the bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>Were you involved with any of the attempts to get the NTMA to place deposits with the bank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM02700","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441234800,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>No, I don't believe so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>Okay, and did you have a view at the time as to why the NTMA was not placing money with Anglo?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM02900","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441234800,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I had little or no contact ever with the NTMA until after the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>But you weren't involved in discussions with senior management about what was happening with the NTMA or attempts to get deposits from them, or sources of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM03100","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441234800,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>I was aware, in the background, that there was an effort by the bank to seek funding from all sources.

Banks globally and in Europe were under siege.  The Irish banks suffered significantly and if you were a smaller bank, that was further amplified in terms of the pressure you felt in the market.  So throughout 2008 there were numerous areas of strategic work to raise capital for the bank, to secure the bank's position, to try and diversify the bank, which was obviously one of the potential benefits from ILP.  I had some involvement with the bank's advisers, Morgan Stanley, looking at various options.  There were options considered with Rabobank becoming an investor.  There were options being considered with a larger bank taking over the bank.  So I would say a multitude of options were considered, including doing a rights issue to bolster capital in the bank.  But most banks that had tried to do that during 2008, unless they were a global branded player, seemed to damage themselves in the market.  So the market read, if you went to raise capital you had an issue and, therefore, doubly punished you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#NN05300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>You're out of time, Deputy.

The fourth quarter of 2008 saw a significant downturn but that materialised later, and in '09 and '10 the collapse in the economies, in particular in Ireland, but also elsewhere where the bank was - they were all correlated if you will - led the bank to have a much worse position than the assumptions that were used to create this view.  So, fundamentally, risk did not believe that the bank would suffer this level of losses, and the other elements of the bank's model were positive contributors.  For example, it had a cost-to-income ratio that was very low, so it meant that for revenue generated in a period, a significant element of that would convert to profit, so it had some buffers.

Well, I've reviewed in detail the contents of the core books provided to me by the joint committee and while I hope to assist the committee in so far as possible, I would like it noted that much of the material provided to me in the core books relates to events which took place after my retirement from Permanent TSB, or from Irish Life and Permanent.  I hope and expect to be in a position to answer any questions the committee may have from 1998 up to my retirement at May 2007; however, I may be unable to comment on matters that occurred after my retirement for obvious reasons.<\/p> <p>  I will now comment on the lines of inquiry that you asked me.  First of all, the composition, skills and experience of the board members.  The merger of Irish Life and Irish Permanent in April 1999 was effected by the purchase of Irish Life by Irish Permanent.  Irish Permanent became the holding company for the new corporate group, as well as a licensed bank, and the merged board became not just the board of the bank but the group board of the enlarged entity.  I became group chief executive of ILP in 2000.  The bank chief executive became an executive director on the group board reporting directly to me.  The initial ... it was recognised that the initial composition of the board would require adjustment over a two to three-year period and over the years to 2006, a non-executive nominations committee reviewed the composition, increasingly with external assistance, and directors were appointed with a wide range of skills and experience.  There was always a majority of non-executive directors and my view is that we had a suitably skilled, inquisitive and challenging board, fully capable to supervise the business in a fully effective manner.  Board evaluation of performance was carried out regularly with external assistance.<\/p> <p>  Quality of the business model setting: following a strategic review of the business on my appointment in 1998, the board concluded that the acquisition of a banking customer base was a strategic imperative.  The merger with Irish Permanent plc followed and the opportunity arose to acquire the Trustee Savings Bank in 2001.  It increased customer numbers, had a substantial deposit base and permitted ILP to become a real participant in the current account market, regarded as a core product for bank assurers.  Strategic planning was carried out through a series of strategic plans, usually over three-year periods, covering a SWOT analysis review of the economic and competitive environment, potential acquisitions, costs, challenges, etc.  And a detailed annual budget focused on the operational implementation of the agreed strategy.  Discussion of both strategic plans and annual budgets considered the capital strength of the group and bank, with an overriding objective of maintaining at all times a buffer over minimum regulatory requirements.<\/p><p>The board was fully involved in the process and external expertise was used better to inform the process.<br\/><br\/>ILP developed a very clear &ldquo;Ireland First&rdquo; strategy aimed at becoming a leading provider of personal financial services in Ireland.  By the end of 2006 it consisted - with the exception of a relatively small centralised mortgage provider, CHL, in the UK - primarily on the provision of Irish house mortgages, both owner-occupier and buy-to-let, together with a significant car finance business and a commercial lending business.  We did not become involved in large development or speculative property lending nor lending on raw land, due to a combination of restrained risk appetite and skill deficits in respect of those types of lending.  The strategy focused on lower-risk, widely-spread portfolios of lending in an attractive home market where we had operated successfully for many years.  We did not anticipate the savage downturn and the damage it would do to the chosen business model, especially when combined with the complete breakdown of funding options.<br\/><br\/>Adequacy of board oversight over internal controls - board oversight over internal controls was comprehensive and some of the regular reports that the board received are listed in my witness statement, and I will not go into them further here.  There was a very detailed chief executive&rsquo;s report covering the performance of all business units of the group, together with the latest available financial information.  All of these reports were the subject of detailed discussion at board.<br\/><br\/>The appropriateness of property-related lending strategies and risk appetite - as I've said earlier, the lending strategy was focused around house mortgages, both for residential purposes and investment, and this accounted for the bulk of the loan portfolio, 88%.  In addition, about 5.5% of total lending was accounted for by commercial loans for the purchase of investment property, generally with the benefit of a long-term lease.  The objective was to build up a portfolio primarily consisting of a substantial number of relatively low ticket or small ... smallish residential loans, giving a wide spread of borrowers and locations with conservative loan-to-value ratios - average 71% at inception in 2006.  However, in the event, the extent of the decline in residential property prices did not protect the portfolio on the downside.<br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of credit policies, delegated authorities and exception management - credit policies were reviewed regularly and changes required approval of the board and were advised to the regulator.  LTV ratios were reasonable, averaging 71% for residential home loans, although first-time buyer loan-to-values reached 87% in 2006 following the introduction of 100% mortgages in 2005.  Borrowers were tested for repayment capacity, including a stressed 2% interest test.  Similar policies were applied to residential investment property loans, with both LTV and rental cover ratios for interest payments.  Commercial loans policies primarily consisted of loan-to-value ratios to a maximum of 75% to 80%.  Instalment credit loans were automatically credit scored using industry standard scorecards with suitable controls over exception approvals.  Delegated authorities were determined on a tiered basis depending on the experience of the holder.  Larger loans would require reference to a central credit unit under the supervision of a very experienced retail lender.  Loans in excess of this discretion were referred to a group credit committee consisting of a number of experienced lenders, including the chief risk officer, and chaired by the group finance director.  Exceptions to policy were approved on a case-by-case basis, generally on a &quot;next higher&quot; basis.  The board received monthly reports on all loans in excess of &euro;6.35 million and, in relation to loans approved as exceptions to policy, within the delegated discretion system.  Similar arrangements applied to our business in the UK - CHL.<br\/><br\/>The stress test required by the Central Bank in 2006 included a house price reduction of approximately 22% over two years, with a modest recovery in year three, together with increased unemployment rising to 9.7% over the three years of the test.  Housing completions were assumed at 50,000 per annum throughout.  While none of the scenarios modelled indicated serious threat to the solvency of the bank, it should be noted that the actual extent of the price declines and rise in unemployment subsequently vastly exceeded those set.  However, the most significant defect in these tests lay in the absence of tests involving stress on the funding side.  Perhaps this was because of the now proven to be unfounded belief in the strength and durability of the sources of funding available to banks in Ireland.  There were no specific warning signs and, indeed, global capital markets had come through many periods of severe stress over the past 20 to 30 years and at this time had never appeared so accommodating to reasonably rated borrowers.  However, the deterioration in sentiment towards Ireland and the Irish banks post-2006 demonstrated quite clearly that there is effectively only one counterparty in wholesale markets as Professor Nyberg perceptively remarked in his report of 2011.  Failure to anticipate this truth, in common with many others, remains, in my view, the single biggest error that was committed in our business plans.<br\/><br\/>Analysis of risk concentration in the base, adverse economic scenarios and the impact on capital structures - as I said earlier, the overall portfolio was very widely spread and remained largely unchanged in terms of concentration in the years 2001 to 2006, which underlined the consistency of our strategy.  I've previously referred to the results of the 2006 stress test, which appeared satisfactory in terms of a robust response to economic shocks which were considered severe at that time but clearly, with hindsight, absolutely inadequate to model the actual impacts of the recession of 2008-2010.<br\/><br\/>Adequacy of the incentive and remuneration arrangements to promote sound risk governance - all remuneration arrangements for senior executives, including myself, required the approval of the remuneration committee, consisting entirely of non-executive directors.  In the case of the senior executives - myself and those reporting directly to me - the package consisted of a base salary, a bonus opportunity up to 60% of salary, access to group share options up to a maximum multiple of salary and membership of various group defined benefit pension schemes.  I did not become a member of a defined benefit pension scheme as I joined Irish Life at age 51, with an anticipated retirement age of 60.<br\/><br\/>Overall remuneration terms were reviewed regularly with the advice of international remuneration consultants.  While at this remove total reward is substantial, it was not excessive relative to that scene in the Irish market.  However, it is clear that public perception of remuneration in financial services at this time is that it was excessive and it's clear that this perception is reality for financial services executives, including myself, and I fully accept that.  Bonus payments for those reporting directly to me were based on individually designed objectives agreed with the remuneration committee, reviewed at the half year, and performance overall was agreed at year end, with bonuses based on that performance.  Monthly business reviews were held with those executives.  I do not believe that the remuneration arrangements led to a culture of excessive risk taking, given the checks and balances within the overall credit approval system, including the group credit committee structure and the treasury policy, which I think you heard about this morning.<br\/><br\/>Impact of shareholder or lending relationships in promoting independent challenge by the board - ILP was a publicly quoted company with a very widely spread investor base, including a substantial retail element.  As such, we met regularly with institutional shareholders in Ireland and overseas.  These meetings involved exchanges of views on company performance, strategy, etc.  While on occasion our overall performance was regarded quite unfavourably in comparison to a number of our competitors, particularly in relation to our non-involvement in large-scale property lending or lending to the SME sector, we did not change our stance on this as we lacked both risk appetite and the skills to undertake that business.  We reported the feedback to the board and considered whether we should modify strategy to take account of these views.  But in general terms, we maintained over this period a very consistent approach to the business in strategic terms.  Because of our business model, we did not have lending relationships with borrowers of the nature that, I think, are ... is implied in this line of inquiry.<br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of the regulatory regime - the regulatory regime has been characterised as principles-based and light-touch.  However, I would characterise it more as unbalanced, with a substantial, relatively well-resourced and quite intrusive, self-confident consumer focus contrasting markedly with an under-resourced and tentative low key prudential activity.  This seemed to be confirmed by the <i>ex officio<\/i>directorship of the consumer director of the regulator in contrast to the position of the prudential director.<\/p><p>This misallocation led to an inability of the supervisor to analyse in a meaningful way the substantial flow of information that banks provided.  In addition, when on-site inspections took place - and that was rarely - there was substantial delay in furnishing reports and dealing with bank responses.  Responses to the submission of requested information on particular topics were also very slow.  <\/p><p> While there was contact between the regulator and ILP group at a variety of levels, my contact was mainly restricted to twice-yearly visits to the regulator and the prudential director to review half-yearly and annual accounts.  While these meetings were businesslike and professional, they contrasted markedly with meetings I had experienced elsewhere with other regulators.  Clearly, my interactions with the regulator or certainly ... I'm sorry ... Certainly, my interactions with the regulator bore no resemblance to the extremely thorough reviews with rating agencies.<\/p><p> The regulator appeared reluctant to use its power of moral suasion that I believed it possessed, preferring to take a very legalistic view of its power.  I recall contacting the regulator regarding the introduction of 100% mortgages, which I regarded as an unnecessary and unwelcome development, but it was made clear to me that the regulator regarded itself as powerless to intervene.  It's my view that the regulator failed to fulfil its prudential function.  It is, obviously, primarily a failure on the part of management and boards of banks that was responsible for the crisis that emerged.  However, as with all participants in the creation of the crisis, I'm sure that different decisions at different times by the regulator could have reduced the severity of events. <\/p><p> The nature and appropriateness of the relationship between the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and banking institutions: I have no direct knowledge of the relationship between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and, therefore, I don't consider it appropriate for me to speculate.  I can recall only a couple of occasions when I would personally have contacted the regulator on a matter of concern and only one semi-social event - an in-house lunch with my chairman at the offices of the regulator.  We were members of the Irish Bankers Federation and we tended to prefer interactions on industry issues to be conducted by them.  To the best of my knowledge, during this period I had no contact with the Minister for Finance, the Secretary General of the Department and other senior civil servants unless perhaps at industry gatherings - Institute of Bankers' functions, IBEC, etc.<\/p><p> Appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector: The committee has heard evidence from a number of witnesses in respect of these matters.  I have no direct experience of the nature or appropriateness of these relationships and, therefore, I do not believe I can usefully comment.  <\/p><p> Conclusion: In preparing for this appearance, I have reviewed thoroughly the last accounts for which I was responsible - 31 December 2006 -  together with the economic backdrop at the time in order to explain the subsequent outcomes which contributed to such negative outcomes for staff, customers, shareholders and, of course, the Irish State and its people, all of which I deeply regret.  While bank margins had declined over the period due to a combination of a very competitive mortgage market, including the introduction from the UK of tracker mortgages, together with an increased use of wholesale funding to fund customer lending, bank profits had more than doubled to &euro;202 million, while capital remained sound with a risk asset ratio at 10.4% comfortably meeting the objective of exceeding regulatory minima. <\/p><p> The two issues which I think best demonstrate the sharp contrast between the time of my leaving and subsequent events are the mortgage portfolio and liquidity on 31 December 2006.  Mortgage quality, which was 88% of the book on December 2006: aside from apparently healthy LTV ratios, which I have illustrated in some detail in my witness statement, the arrears position was healthy.  Since 2002, cases in arrears had halved, from 7.1% to 3.4% of the portfolio and case numbers had reduced despite the increase of mortgage accounts by approximately 20%.  The strong consensus of economic commentary, domestically and internationally, was that despite the rapid expansion of both credit and house prices the economy was fundamentally sound &ndash; the soft landing scenario. <\/p><p> We now know that in the period 2008 to 2010 the economy, partly from events abroad, encountered its worst recession ever, vastly exceeding the levels for which the regulator had stress tested in 2006, and, clearly, this was in the nature of the fabled 400-year flood.  The liquidity position on December 31 2006: at the end of 2006, the bank appeared to be well funded, with very easy access to a variety of apparently liquid capital market sources; long-term debt repayments were very widely spread; there was a relatively low use of securitisation; and there was a significant availability of secured repo and ECB eligible collateral together with approximately 35% customer deposits.  Long-term debt, securitisation and customer deposits together provided 65% of funding.  Moody's rating agency increased the financial ... the ratings strength of ILP to AAA in early 2007 while S and P maintained a rating of A+ at end 2007.  Events subsequently proved this funding model absolutely inadequate.  External events, together with negative views on Irish credit portfolios ensured that very rapidly all capital markets were closed to IL P with the disastrous effects that we now know.  The error here was clearly failing to recognise Professor Nyberg&rsquo;s point that in the capital markets there is only one counterparty and, hence, if one source closes to a borrower, all will close simultaneously.<\/p><p> In summary, Chairman, from my perspective Irish Life and Permanent was a sound and well-run business when I retired and I was shocked and disappointed at the impact of subsequent events.  I deeply regret the consequences for the staff, customers, shareholders of Irish Life and Permanent and, of course, for the Irish people.  I hope my statement will assist the committee in its task.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#YY00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Went","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1541,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Went, and thank you for taking us through your opening statement.

The problem with tracker mortgages is basis risk because, traditionally, mortgage products were lent on a ... on what you might call an \"administered rate\" basis, a standard variable rate basis.  So, therefore, if interest rates went up on the deposit side, the bank had the discretion to raise the interest rates on the asset side, so there could be a pretty much immediate re-pricing of both asset and liability.  However, in the UK, in particular, tracker mortgages had become a very significant feature of the market in the '80s - sorry, in the '90s - and these ... tracker mortgages are where you lend at a fixed margin over the official rate.  So that introduces another rate ... another element of risk, which is basis risk, where if you, for example, are lending at 1% over the ECB rate and the ECB rate goes up by 0.25%, well, that reduces your margin to 75 basis points, so that's not a good thing.<\/p> <p>  So the ... and what ... how we analyse that risk would have been to look back over the period.  I mean, we didn't have a very long period of euro rates, but we had a reasonably long period of Deutsche mark rates, which would have been a proxy for that.  And when you look back over the previous 20 to 25 years, you would have seen periods where official rates diverged from market rates for periods of extreme stress.  In 1987, Black Wednesday, when Gorbachev was ... or Yeltsin was kidnapped in Russia, like, there was a tremendous dislocation of markets.  So individual deposits ... market deposit rates spiked and official rates didn't.  But by and large, those periods were relatively short and if you had to sit and suffer, you know, a contraction of your margin over a period of time, it wasn't a bad thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#DDD00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Went"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1671,"content":"<p>So I'm not trying to cut you short ... but there was a discussion but you didn't really take any action, is that right?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#DDD00500","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441234800,"counter":1672,"content":"<p>No, there was a ... we would have been aware of the risk but ... and that would have been factored into our, you know, our overall review of our treasury policy, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#DDD00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Went"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1673,"content":"<p>I want to ask you about another product that you entered into, or the institution entered into, in March of 2007, shortly before you left, with Merrill Lynch - the Springboard mortgages, they were termed, to cater for individuals who were experiencing difficulties in securing lending from banks by traditional methods.

So, that's a general point.  The second point you make about SME lending ... I came from a background of running a retail bank, Ulster Bank, and I was fully aware of the extent to which the branch manager and the overall process by which people progress in the bank and become branch managers ... the overall point ... the overall way in which that happens and I concluded and I persuaded my colleagues on the board that it was really too big a stretch for us to, if you like, reverse engineer an SME lending capability into our branch network because I just did not believe we had the skills to do that and I believed that those - and I still believe that - that those skills were actually special skills.  You know, you started off by being a clerk to a lender and then you progressed your way up, you went into an advances department, you know, all of those sort of things.  I just concluded that we could not reverse engineer those without excessive risk into our branch network and, in particular, I knew from having run Ulster Bank that the clearing banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, National Irish Bank, actually were pretty good at doing that and we would have found it very difficult to compete in that market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#EEE02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Went"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1727,"content":"<p>So you decided to focus on what you thought was your-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#EEE02600","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441234800,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>Yes, we decided essentially to be, you know, a mortgage lender, a plain vanilla mortgage lender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#EEE02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Went"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1729,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#EEE02800","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1730,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

Okay.  Now, wait a second ...  yes, there was a ... excuse me for reading from this, potentially ... We introduced this ... an updated liquidity policy in October 2003 and this was based on the Basel committee on banking supervisions paper, Sound Practices for Managing Liquidity in Banking Organisations, and there were three ... essentially this was looking at contingency funding and there were three specific examples.  One was a moderate entity-specific crisis; in other words, this was a crisis just about us and you know, some money had gone astray or something like that.  Under that ...an unexpected cashflow problem only likely to last a few days.  It was presumed under this scenario that wholesale and retail deposits, short-term paper funding programmes would remain intact and that we'd sell off liquid assets to meet the thing.  A severe entity-specific crisis which affected our ratings and this would have been where we would have suffered a major downgrade - two notches on long term and one on short term - and it was assumed there that unsecured sources would be severely affected.  The scenario could take weeks to possibly three months to stabilise and it was anticipated that not only would we use our liquid assets, but we would use securitisation, you know, the eligible collateral to do that.  And the final one, then, was an industry-wide crisis where there are liquidity problems in the banking system as a whole causing widespread disruption to markets.  The best defence is described as maximising our ability to deal with stress under scenario two.  Under that scenario, we also assumed that the regulatory authorities would be aggressive in providing support to the system, making Central Bank borrowing effectively the swing factor in ensuring the survival of the institution.  We implemented ... we conducted those tests using the Basel requirements every month and they were submitted to ALCO, you know, to our asset liability committee, on a monthly basis.

So I worked in Irish Life and Permanent as treasurer from 2000 to early '09, effectively the period covered, obviously, by this inquiry.  And in that role I was responsible for all activities relating to treasury, counterparty credit exposures, market risk, funding and liquidity management.  The treasury function itself was physically located in the IFSC and my direct reporting line was to the group finance director.  I was a member of the senior management of the group at that time.  I was not a member of the board nor was I a member of the bank executive.  With regard to board-appointed committees, I was a member of the assets and liability committee; I was a member there since 1994.  I was also a member of the group risk committee, which was set up in 2007, and the group CEO had set up a new strategy team in early to mid-'07 and I was not a member of that group.<\/p> <p>  So given my role and the lines of inquiry that I've been asked to address, I'd just like to make a few brief comments regarding liquidity in the banking system and to make some specific comments in relation to Irish Life and Permanent's liquidity and, indeed, funding strategies.  So a fundamental function of the banking system is the provision of maturity transformation whereby banks fund longer-term assets with shorter-term liabilities.  This provides longer-term liabilities to households and corporates, which facilitates long-term capital investment with obvious economic benefit and social benefit, indeed.  The provision of maturity transformation creates liquidity risk for banks.  So the regulatory liquidity standards that banks are required to adhere to seeks to mitigate that risk and, in addition, Irish Life and Permanent's funding strategy sought to further mitigate that particular liquidity risk.  So Irish Life and Permanent's funding was broadly split into three thirds: long-term debt, customer accounts and short-term wholesale debt.  We also held and managed a liquidity portfolio, which provided a substantial buffer against any adverse movement in our short-term wholesale liabilities.  Irish Life and Permanent's balance sheet differed from the two main banks in that 85% of the assets comprised residential mortgages, which were highly liquid in normal market conditions.  Irish Life and Permanent was also a bank assurer which was created post the merger of Irish Life, the country's largest life assurer, and Irish Permanent in 1999.  The bank's credit rating and its ability to raise debt in capital markets benefitted from that particular group structure.  Despite extremely difficult market conditions in 2008, Irish Life and Permanent raised over &euro;3 billion of long-term debt through bilateral transactions.  Residential mortgages on top of that could also be used as collateral for drawings with the ECB.<\/p> <p>  So by 2008, Irish Life and Permanent had a loan-to-deposit ratio of 275%, which was significantly higher than that of the other Irish banks.  Irish Life and Permanent had, as I said, the backstop of being able to access ECB funding by using its less risky residential mortgages as collateral, a point which is acknowledged in the Nyberg report.<\/p><p>I would also say that, you know, a low loan-to-deposit ratio is not a panacea in itself.  The Turner report, which was commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK in October '08 and was published in March '09 ... and in that Lord Turner, the then chairperson of the FSA in the UK, was asked to review the causes of the crisis and to make recommendations on changes in regulation and supervisory approach to help create a more robust banking system.  The report provides a very clear and in-depth analysis of the root causes of the crisis and provides a very clear template for suggested changes to make to the banking system to make it more robust.  So, with regard to funding that particular report highlights the fact that Icelandic and Irish banks were active deposit takers in the UK market and these deposits, while they did reduce their loan-to-deposits ratios, as the crisis dragged on and deepened these deposits did not remain sticky and were ultimately not renewed, so-called \"sticky deposits\" obviously being less likely to be withdrawn in a crisis event.  <\/p><p> So Mervyn King, the then Governor of the Bank of England, made the point that the crisis revealed faultlines in global regulation and supervision, pointing out that global banking institutions are global in life but national in death, a point that we clearly saw.  So, Irish Life and Permanent's funding strategy was formulated with the intention of providing a sustainable, stable funding platform and this strategy was formulated against the conventional wisdom that a liquidity event would be very short-lived.  The banking system is susceptible to liquidity events.  I had first-hand experience of significant liquidity disruption in markets during the Russian debt crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.  Global markets also experienced a severe liquidity shock post the 11 September attacks and, in both those instances ,regulatory authorities acted very decisively to find a quick solution to the problems and that was actually achieved.  So the recent crisis, which was clearly systemic, its impact unprecedented, the duration of the disruption in markets was not anticipated and, inevitably I think, the regulatory liquidity requirements which were in place were not sufficient to withstand that particular shock.  So regulators, clearly, are revising capital and liquidity standards in order to strengthen the system and prevent a recurrence of recent events which, regretfully, have had such a devastating impact on Irish citizens.<\/p><p> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#NNN00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gantly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1949,"content":"<p>Thank you very much again Mr. Gantly.

That's where it saw itself being and the response to that, you know, was to actually go for higher volume, lower margin and there was a migration then of existing customers to the tracker product, okay.  So I think with the benefit of hindsight, I think that was not maybe the most perfect strategy to adopt but, as I say, that's with the benefit of hindsight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#PPP03400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gantly"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":2004,"content":"<p>ILP was downgraded by Standard and Poor's in June 2008 and placed on a negative outlook, and then Moody's also put it on a negative outlook in July.
