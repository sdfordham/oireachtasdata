Firstly, I would like to say that I welcome this opportunity to share my experience in the roles I held in Anglo Irish Bank and IBRC with the members of the joint committee.  I look forward to answering, as best I can and to the extent possible, any questions you have in relation to my performance in those roles and wider matters relating to the bank both pre and post its nationalisation.<\/p> <p>  To enable best usage of the time allocated to this session, I have narrowed the focus of my opening statement to deal with what I believe are the key areas of my testimony.  By way of background, I have worked in financial services for a substantive part of my career to date, beginning in corporate treasury roles in First Active and KBC, followed then by a variety of roles within Anglo Irish Bank and, latterly, IBRC.  These roles in Anglo were performed over a 15-year period from 1998 to 2013.  From 1998 up to managing the sale of the credit ... under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act of the bank's deposits and NAMA bonds to Allied Irish Banks plc in February 2011, my main role was to raise customer deposits in order to fund the bank's balance sheet growth.  I performed that role as a corporate deposit manager up to 2001, as head of retail banking from 2001 to 2006, as director of corporate and retail treasury from 2006 to 2008 and as head of retail banking again from 2008 to 2011.  During this period, I reported to the head of corporate deposits, head of treasury, director of treasury, the managing director of Ireland and the head of operations in the bank, respectively.<\/p> <p>  I was appointed to the senior executive board or the SEB for a 12-month period from in and around the middle of 2006 to 2007.  This was a management level below the main board of the bank.  I also served on a number of management committees and subsidiary company boards at various times.  I did not, however, serve as an executive director or member of the board of Anglo Irish Bank or any of its sub-committees.<\/p><p>Following the appointment of Mike Aynsley as the new CEO in late 2009, I became a member of the new leadership team of the bank and worked in a number of significant post-nationalisation restructuring projects.  Finally, in early 2011, I was appointed as head of corporate treasury, or corporate affairs and communications, a role I held until my departure from IBRC in February 2013.  For the purpose of clarity, my responsibilities in all of the roles previously mentioned did not extend to lending to customers or involvement in the credit, risk, audit or compliance functions of the bank.<br\/><br\/>The primary role of the group treasury role of Anglo was to fund the bank's lending growth.  Both wholesale and customer funding were sourced for this purpose.  By 2008, a significant portion of the bank's balance sheet was funded with customer deposits from two main categories, namely, retail deposit customers and corporate deposit customers.  These deposits were the lifeblood of the bank and the business proposition was interest rate and customer service driven.  The marginal returns offered for surplus cash on deposit made it worthwhile for customers to switch banking relationships for this aspect of their business alone.  The corporate deposit customer profile ranged from SMEs to large corporate and institutional clients across practically every business sector.  Retail customers were predominantly older savers with lump sums to invest.<br\/><br\/>The centres for sourcing corporate deposits in Anglo Irish Bank grew from a small network of branches in Ireland and offshore in the '70s to a large group treasury centre in Dublin in the '80s, followed by an ... additional branches in the UK and another large treasury centre in London in the '90s.  From 2000 onwards, further centres in Austria, Dusseldorf, Jersey and Boston were used to source corporate deposits in line with asset growth.  As a result of this planned expansion, deposits from corporate customers in Anglo grew year-on-year to &euro;32 billion in 2008, accounting for 36% of the total funding position of the bank.  The strategic intent to broaden its funding base to include deposits from retail customers was established in 2001 in line with the introduction of the SSIA, or special savings incentive scheme, in Ireland.  Once established, the retail savings function in Ireland became successful very quickly and attracted significant positive media coverage and commentary due to the perceived lack of competitive offerings for savers in Ireland at that time.  <br\/><br\/>Following this success, a strategic decision was then taken in 2004 to launch a retail savings proposition in the United Kingdom.  While the UK savings market was, at the time, one of the most competitive in Europe, it was agreed to proceed and, following a test-and-learn period in early 2005, the bank began to enjoy considerable success with UK savers and growth was driven using high interest rates advertised in best-buy tables, in online and offline media and other comparator and aggregator sites such as <i>moneysupermarket.com<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>The remaining retail funding site of the bank was the Isle of Man.  This had been in operation for many years and attracted a limited but consistent level of savings from onshore and offshore high net worth savers.  While successful among its local peers in this space, the Isle of Man operation would always remain the smallest retail saving centre operated by the bank up to nationalisation.  As a result of this planned expansion from early 2001 to its peak in 2008, the volume of retail savings from those three markets alone grew to circa &euro;19 billion of funds entrusted.  Close to 50% of these funds had come from the UK market over a relatively short period of time, with the balance coming from Ireland and the Isle of Man.  Total deposits from retail customers in 2008 accounted for 22% of the overall funding position of the bank.  At its peak, therefore, Anglo Irish Bank had a total portfolio of &euro;51 billion of deposits, which accounted for 58% of the total funding sources of the bank.  Given the strong growth of the UK retail funding franchise, a full launch plan was developed and under consideration to enter the German savings market in 2009.  This was with a view to reducing the growing geographic concentration and significantly expanding the bank's future potential funding sources.  This plan, however, was never implemented following the nationalisation of the bank.  <br\/><br\/>The fast-growing concentration of UK-sourced retail funding was influenced by the increase in the Irish deposit protection scheme in Ireland and the subsequent introduction of the Government guarantee, as I have detailed in my witness statement.  The collapse of Northern Rock was the first event that weakened customer confidence in the security of their savings with Anglo Irish Bank.  The bank took thousands of calls per day from concerned customers who either wanted to withdraw funds or seek assurances that their deposits were safe.<\/p><p>While the UK retail centre of the bank was the main focus of calls from UK customers, Irish savers became equally nervous when queues formed outside the Northern Rock office in Dublin.<\/p><p> The collapse of Anglo's share price on 17 March was the second event to weaken customer confidence in the security of their savings.  The seriousness of this event was greatly inflated by the fact that the Anglo share price, alone among Irish banks, was being targeted by sellers and fell by circa 15% on that day.  The outflows were significant and the bank ran a very real risk of not being able to handle the volume of inbound calls from concerned customers.  It also introduced the first real risk of the bank&rsquo;s branches in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway not being able to deal with the volume of customers calling to close their accounts.<\/p><p> The collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 was the third and final event that shook the confidence of customers in the safety of their savings.  It is my view that the bank experienced a full-blown run on customer deposits from that period up to 29 September 2008.  As the primary channel for both corporate and retail customers dealing with the bank, however, was via the telephone, this run never fully manifested itself in the public domain.  In Ireland in particular however, the word on the street was that Anglo was in serious trouble.  It was an incredibly stressful time for retail deposit customers in particular, many of whom still had all of their savings with the bank.  While having survived two material events of this nature, the events of September brought a new level of uncertainty for the staff and management of the bank and, with the share price now below 30 cent, I believe most of the senior staff honestly feared the bank might not recover.<\/p><p> Up to the start of the crisis in August 2007, Anglo Irish Bank was lauded on the stock market for its spectacular balance sheet growth and highly profitable business model.  This and Anglo&rsquo;s commentary from a multitude of market analysts and other commentators led to Anglo being put forward as an example to its competitors and peers.  In terms of the bank&rsquo;s chosen credit strategy therefore, as a predominantly property-based lender in the Irish, UK and North American markets, it was difficult to foresee that everybody internally and externally could be wrong.  The bank&rsquo;s loan default rates had remained very low for the previous decade and there remained a huge appetite for commercial property projects, in particular among investors and developers in the bank&rsquo;s chosen markets.  Existing clients of the bank who had experience and track record in that sector were on hand to meet the demand and the clients&rsquo; stated credit policy was to back and work with these types of clients where the property had strong tenants, where cashflows could be identified and secured and where personal guarantees were available as additional security.<\/p><p> Anglo was three monoline banking divisions in one financial institution, namely, lending, treasury and wealth management.  While all were successful in rapidly growing and diversifying their markets for their individual activities, each sold what could be broadly viewed as a single financial product into a highly targeted customer base, i.e., loans to borrowers in the real estate sector, deposits to interest-rate sensitive corporate and retail customers and predominantly real estate investment products often geared to high net worth individual clients.  While the global liquidity crisis affected nearly every bank worldwide to some degree in 2007 and 2008, the underlying structure of the bank, together with the pace at which it had grown in that structure, compounded the stress of that crisis in a much higher degree to other banks who had lower concentration of lending exposures, more diversified funding sources and fee income from a wider universal offering to a diverse and longer-established customer base.<\/p><p> While Anglo Irish Bank had ceased development lending to new clients and had no direct exposure to private mortgage lending, the monoline exposure to a highly mobile customer deposit base in particular hit Anglo hard and fast in late 2008, as the perceived liquidity issue quickly became an actual one for the bank.  Further complications arose for the bank out of the difficulty in reducing or stopping lending as the crisis worsened.  This was in part down to the contractual commitments to borrowers and also the risk that without further lending, some development projects would cease and result in immediate and significant loan default.  All of this took place in the face of unforeseen and therefore unanticipated risks, which included a total market dislocation and a practically simultaneous failure of each individual source of funding open to the bank over a period of less than 12 months.<\/p><p> I sincerely hope that my testimony today will be of benefit to the inquiry in fulfilling its mandate.<\/p><p>I would like to say that I fully accept responsibility for my roles as both corporate and director . . . corporate . . . as director of corporate and retail treasury and head of retail banking of Anglo Irish Bank for any part that I may have played in its failure and the consequences it had on the Irish State.  It is genuinely something that I will always regret.<\/p><p> Finally, I would like to highlight that at the time of writing and submitting my witness statement to this inquiry, I do not hold any documents or other memoranda such as minutes of meetings from my time in the bank and, therefore, its contents are solely based on my recollection of events at the time.

And we presented that to Donal O'Connor at the time.  And obviously the bank had been nationalised so it didn't go any further.  But there was certainly a strategic intent, to your point Deputy, that we were stretching our existing markets for too much funding and we needed to get into at least one or more ... to European markets on the retail side.

Okay, well, maybe just one minute of background: the sale of the Austrian private bank followed on from a strategy of the bank to divest of private banking businesses outside of Ireland and the UK, so there was a trust business in the Isle of Man which was sold in 2006, I think, a private bank in Geneva that was sold around the same time, a fledgling private banking operation in Dubai, which we closed very early on, and I was asked to lead the sale of the private bank in Austria following on from that.  That sale process started before the crisis.  To your point, we did pause halfway through that process as liquidity issues were hitting the bank to determine if we sell this bank we are also selling, I think, it was either &euro;575 million or &euro;600 million in deposits, so it was considered.  I had a discussion with the CEO and the finance director about it.  We decided to proceed for three reasons.  One was we had ... we were now fully engaged in a sale process and, obviously, stopping the sale of a private bank in particular is quite difficult in that you've got counterparties now actively doing due diligence etc., so we felt that pulling the sale would not just reduce the value significantly then but also any further time that we were to put it on the market.  That's number one.  Number two, our view was that the deposits at the time were a very small percentage of our overall customer funding business, so if you think about it we may have probably had about &euro;45 billion, I can't remember the number, of total customer deposits then and this was &euro;600 million.  I think the third was I don't think we genuinely believed that the liquidity stress that the bank was under would actually result in its total collapse.

If you look at the results, the presentation of the bank in 2008, it was for, you know, dislocation in the markets to last for another 12 months, maybe 18 months, and then we would regain traction.

And my request of the team at all times was to ensure that in articulating the business, the model and the reporting of results, etc., that those factors would be borne in mind, and the manner in which that that would be reflected in terms of outcomes would be that long-term value type holders would invest in the business.

Ironically, in the business I've run for 13 years as CEO and 17 years as an executive in the world of packaging, which is very far removed from banking, I accept, but we have a very narrow product range and the equity markets love it, because it's high-concentration expertise in a narrow area, deep and meaningful engagement.  The debt markets don't like it because obviously the higher risk attached to it.  The way we dealt with it in my current business is we widened the geographic spread so that we actually got the portfolio effect of geography in terms of the de-risking of it.  In the Anglo case, again, the product range or the product area was narrow but there were significant moves afoot to widen the application of that both in terms of product and in terms of geography.

But, because we were in an escalating and hyper property inflated environment, that, by the time they moved to the next development, the value of the initial development had exceeded the loan-to-value and probably was in high positive equity, therefore that positive equity could be used as a deposit on the next development, which meant that there was no cash payment on the next loan.  What was there was a securitisation on what we subsequently found out was an overvalued development.  And this became compounded where a very small number of lenders with your institution found themselves getting massive cash loans, or getting massive loans, over a period of time, to accumulate more developments without ever spending a single cent in deposit terms.  I mean, this is the type of concentrations we're talking about.  And, when Anglo finally crashed, what we saw on its loan book was a very, very small number of people with huge debt exposure.

The environment was extremely challenging.  Funding and liquidity was a serious issue.  There was a strong view that that environment that prevailed, that created the funding challenges, couldn't sustain long term.  I mean, we have to remember these were times when (a) banks wouldn't lend to banks; they'd lend to the central bank ... the European Central Bank rather than lend to one another, they had to go that circuitous route.  These were times when laterally you had UBS and Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York basically charging people to mind their money by putting it on deposit.  So we had very unusual and hard to believe long-term sustainable circumstances.  So against that backdrop there was a belief that a recapitalised Anglo could have a future but it would need (a) stronger funding sources and (b) probably a broader funding footprint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#DD04500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":816,"content":"<p>When did you realise that Anglo's future as an independent financial institution without any intervention or State support was longer tenable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#DD04600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441234800,"counter":817,"content":"<p>I don't think there was a point in time.

We'd obviously issues around property valuation and the asset side of the balance sheet to be addressed, probably with capital raising but Anglo Irish Bank had a very strong track record in capital raising.  In the first half of 2007 it had basically raised &euro;500 million at a 2% discount, which even in today's standards is a hell of a fund ... or an equity raising.

Chairman, members of the committee, since the beginning of 2009 I have co-operated with all the various lines of inquiry and investigations by State and other bodies and I welcome the opportunity to come before you this afternoon.  In addition to the detailed written submission which I furnished to the committee in early August 2015, I come here today before you to further assist the committee - as best I can - in the crucial work you are undertaking.<\/p> <p>  The failure of Anglo Irish Bank and the wider banking system in Ireland was a calamity for the Irish economy and for the many people associated with the banks, including staff, customers, investors and the Irish taxpayers.  Whilst I never served as a member of the board of directors of the bank or as an executive director, I was within the next layers of management, both before its nationalisation and afterwards.  Following nationalisation by the Minister for Finance in January 2009, the new Government-appointed board selected and appointed me as director of group finance.  I will endeavour to give the committee as clear a picture as I can of the circumstances of which I have knowledge surrounding the failure of the bank.<\/p> <p>  I joined the bank in late 2002.  Prior to that, on completion of my university studies, I spent some eight years as a financial consultant in London and New York, primarily in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. I had no lending experience and my role in Anglo was not on the lending side.  My brief was to support the group finance director, as required, and I carried out a variety of projects in this regard.  My expertise was in corporate finance activities such as mergers and acquisitions, equity raising, financial analysis, as well as special financial assignments.  Among the projects that I managed or had significant involvement in were: major share placings, raising almost &euro;1 billion in new equity capital for the bank; liaison with international investment analysts that were conducting independent analysis on the business; assessing acquisition opportunities; and completing the disposal of the bank&rsquo;s private banking business in Austria and also in Switzerland.<\/p><p>Within group finance, I was involved in restructuring management accounts reporting to enhance reporting standards, recruiting specialist accounting skills in each area of the Dublin-based finance team, overseeing the introduction of international financial reporting standards for the bank's accounts and in assisting the leadership of the treasury trading business to devise strategy and business plans. <\/p><p> In late 2004, I was given the title, chief financial officer, to assist my profile in representing the bank without any change of my role.  My investor relations function meant externally I became more widely known as an executive of the bank.  My work in these and other areas reflected well on the bank internationally and increased my standing internally.  I also had responsibility for managing the group finance Dublin function.  This function included the preparation of monthly management accounts, the preparation of regulatory returns on the direction of the group finance director, and liaising with the auditors on the conduct of the audit of the Irish operation of the bank and group consolidation.  During this period, the quality of the bank's internal and regulatory reporting were greatly improved. <\/p><p> Events since the banking crisis have shown that the risk position of the bank and that of all other financial institutions in Ireland deteriorated to an event ... to an extent not foreseen at that time.  The same happened across Europe and elsewhere.  There are well-documented external and internal reasons for this.  The external reasons have already been aired before the committee.  I don't propose to dwell on these, except to underline that they made life impossible for many financial and regulatory institutions, with fault lines being exposed across a wide spectrum.  There was little or no perception by forecasters or authorities of the severity of what lay ahead.  In addition, the bank had a distinctive external pressure arising through the Quinn investment and leveraged contracts for difference that were held through a multitude of investment banking and other broker counterparties internationally. <\/p><p> There were also significant internal issues within the bank, some of which are indicated in the core documents circulated by the committee in recent weeks.  These support the view outlined in my written submission to the committee that the lending function was excessively dominant in the bank and that the risk function controls were, ultimately, insufficient.  This is best captured in the decision to consolidate the leadership of the risk and finance functions under the group finance director in 2007 and the management reorganisation of the same year.  That reorganisation saw the senior executive board narrowed to just five people, including four lenders and one non-lender.  It was apparent from these and other events that the value attached to independent views had diminished.<\/p><p> Group finance Dublin did not have responsibility for lending by the bank.  Group finance Dublin did not have any responsibility in group risk management, which was the key control function in the conduct of the bank's lending business.  At all times since the late 1990s, risk and finance teams were entirely segregated with distinct areas of responsibility.  This continued to be the case even after the aforementioned change to leadership.<\/p><p> Management accounting and audit relied on the integrity of the data inputted by the lending divisions, regional operations and other departments in the bank.  This data was adjusted to account for impairments and provisions set out in a monthly report prepared independently by the risk management department based on its detailed assessment of loan risk.  As in almost all banking institutions, the interrogation and scrutiny of lending data and underlying risk was the responsibility of risk management.  Inadequate controls in this area was one of the factors in the subsequent difficulties that faced the bank. <\/p><p> From the second half of 2007, throughout the year 2008 and into 2009 the bank was in constant spasms of crisis.  Strenuous efforts were made to determine the extent of the bank's downside exposure to the ensuing financial turmoil, both within and outside of the bank.  My role throughout this time was primarily looking at capital opportunities for the bank in international capital markets.  The incessant downward spiral in each of the economies in which the bank lent money, but most particularly in Ireland, exacerbated the scale of losses in each half year.  None of these reviews by multiple parties from within and outside of the bank identified the scale of the potential losses.  In addition, none of them, from what is known to me, found defects in financial reporting in respect of lending impairment.  <\/p><p> Internal audit within the bank, which reported directly to the board audit committee and the chief executive, would have conducted its own reviews on processes and procedures.  The factors contributing to the failure of the bank were multifaceted and complex.  There were many actions, decisions, events and circumstances surrounding this and all viewed through a different lens than the one we use today.  <\/p><p> I would like to conclude by expressing my own sincere and deep regret for the great hardship that the failure of the bank and the wider banking system in general inflicted on so many.  Chairman, notwithstanding the constraints placed upon me, which the committee is aware, and the fact that I have not had access to potentially relevant materials pertaining to the bank from 2002 through to 2008 and thereafter, I will now endeavour to answer any questions you and other members of the committee have and seek to help you in relation to your lines of inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#KK00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Moran, for your opening statement and if I can invite Deputy Eoghan Murphy to commence questioning.

So the bank worked very significantly to manage liquidity in the period.  There were a number of issues, I think, which are worth highlighting.  Firstly, the bank was a monoline bank and businesses that are focused, niche players tend to do very well in strong economic environments.  Businesses that are focused, niche players, on the other hand, tend to do less well when economies are hit.  Now, I don't think anybody foresaw the scale of crisis that was going to come but that was a factor that the bank had to handle.<br\/><br\/>Secondly, the bank was single-A rated and, over time, it became <i>de facto<\/i>necessary to have a double-A rating to play in the markets.  Thirdly, we had a very particular issue in respect of the CFD holding in the bank and that manifested itself and became known to me towards the end of 200.  But I think the fact that that position was held by so many international counterparties, the market became aware of that and that undoubtedly, in my view, had an impact on liquidity within the bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>Were you involved with any of the attempts to get the NTMA to place deposits with the bank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM02700","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441234800,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>No, I don't believe so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>Okay, and did you have a view at the time as to why the NTMA was not placing money with Anglo?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM02900","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441234800,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I had little or no contact ever with the NTMA until after the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>But you weren't involved in discussions with senior management about what was happening with the NTMA or attempts to get deposits from them, or sources of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#MM03100","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441234800,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>I was aware, in the background, that there was an effort by the bank to seek funding from all sources.

Banks globally and in Europe were under siege.  The Irish banks suffered significantly and if you were a smaller bank, that was further amplified in terms of the pressure you felt in the market.  So throughout 2008 there were numerous areas of strategic work to raise capital for the bank, to secure the bank's position, to try and diversify the bank, which was obviously one of the potential benefits from ILP.  I had some involvement with the bank's advisers, Morgan Stanley, looking at various options.  There were options considered with Rabobank becoming an investor.  There were options being considered with a larger bank taking over the bank.  So I would say a multitude of options were considered, including doing a rights issue to bolster capital in the bank.  But most banks that had tried to do that during 2008, unless they were a global branded player, seemed to damage themselves in the market.  So the market read, if you went to raise capital you had an issue and, therefore, doubly punished you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090300002#NN05300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1441234800,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>You're out of time, Deputy.

The fourth quarter of 2008 saw a significant downturn but that materialised later, and in '09 and '10 the collapse in the economies, in particular in Ireland, but also elsewhere where the bank was - they were all correlated if you will - led the bank to have a much worse position than the assumptions that were used to create this view.  So, fundamentally, risk did not believe that the bank would suffer this level of losses, and the other elements of the bank's model were positive contributors.  For example, it had a cost-to-income ratio that was very low, so it meant that for revenue generated in a period, a significant element of that would convert to profit, so it had some buffers.
