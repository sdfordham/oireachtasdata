However, the current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand.  I would be concerned that raising rent limits is not the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students.  The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy with the aim of increasing housing supply generally. <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant.  A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014. <\/p><p>  In view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, almost 140 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.<\/p><p>  The Department's strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  HAP is being introduced to provide a more integrated system of housing supports and has been designed to allow any households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme.<\/p><p>   HAP was introduced in Cork County Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council on 15th September, 2014 and in South Dublin County Council, Kilkenny County Council, Monaghan County Council and Louth County Council on 1st October, 2014.  Department of Social Protection officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to support the implementation of HAP within the selected local authorities. <\/p><p>  In areas where HAP is in operation, rent supplement will continue to be paid to new clients who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short term income support in order to pay their rent.  Arrangements are also being made with the relevant local authorities to transfer existing customers, in receipt of rent supplement for periods of 18 months or more, to HAP.  These measures will return rent supplement to fulfilling its original intention of being a short term support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400050#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Recognition","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400050#WRA02800"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[39132\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400050#WRA02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when the legislation dealing with gender recognition legislation is expected to be finalised in the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>The Revised General Scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2014 was published on 17 June 2014.

The Government has provided &euro;31.3 million for the ENP scheme in 2014. <\/p><p>  A review of the guidelines on exceptional needs payments was carried out during 2012 by a working group of staff from the Department's community welfare service.  One of the recommendations emanating from this review was to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, to the payment of ENPs.  This review has been used as a basis for revised guidelines that issued to staff in 2012 and 2013, recommending maximum amounts payable under the scheme for a variety of household and personal items, to ensure consistency with regard to payment levels on a national basis including assistance in setting up home in local authority allocated housing.  A copy of these guidelines has been provided to the Deputy. <\/p><p>  Traditionally local authorities have provided social housing to tenants on an unfurnished basis and it was the responsibility of the tenant to furnish the property.  These units were by and large units either built or purchased by local authorities.  Where a tenant cannot furnish such a property from within his\/her own resources he\/she can apply for an exceptional needs payment to assist them in furnishing the property.  <\/p><p>  The provision of local authority housing has been refocused toward providing accommodation by way of leasing.  It is not considered appropriate that ENPs would be provided for furnishing local authority leased accommodation. <\/p><p>  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment or pre-determined amounts under the scheme.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. <\/p><p>  The guidelines assist Departmental staff and do not limit the discretionary powers available to officers administering the scheme to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.  Officials in the Department continue to review the issue of payments under the ENP scheme to ensure consistency and fairness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400050#WRA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Appeals","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400050#WRA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[38906\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400050#WRA03900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on a supplementary welfare allowance will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 24th September 2014, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400050#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":43,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 15 and 16 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Offices","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400050#WRA04200"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[38920\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400050#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when she expects the planned Intreo office to open in a town (details supplied) in County Cork; if it is planned to move the current social welfare office to the location of the Intreo service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>The roll-out of Intreo services in the town in question is targeted for Q1 2015 and will operate from two locations, with the Local Office remaining in its current location.

Section 1095 (3) provides that Revenue will issue a tax clearance certificate where a person or business is in compliance with all obligations to pay taxes, interest and penalties that are due to the State under the Acts and to file any tax returns that are required to be made.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the tax clearance scheme is to ensure that businesses (residents and non-residents) that derive an economic benefit from the State are in compliance with their tax obligations to the State. Such tax clearance certification is required for Public Sector Contracts, Grant Payments and certain Licence Applications (Section 1094 of the Act).<\/p><p>  While the awarding of a State contract is a matter for the relevant State authority, a condition is that the tenderer must have a current tax clearance certificate in respect of Irish tax. Where Revenue issues such a tax clearance certificate it is in respect of Irish tax rather than the tax status of the applicant in its country of residence. However, as part of the validation process for non-resident applicants (including those from Northern Ireland), routine checks are carried out to authenticate the identity of the business\/person.<\/p><p>  In regard to eRCT, Revenue has advised me that the system operates on a 'deduction at source' basis and applies to payments made under contracts in the construction, meat processing and forestry sectors (including Public Sector construction contracts). The system was introduced in 2012 (replacing the previous paper based system) to bring more control and oversight to construction sector contracts. As part of the process, businesses in receipt of payments made under a contract are, depending on their tax compliance record, assigned a tax deduction rate of 0%, 20% or 35%. For non-resident contractors to qualify for the 0% rate the business must have complied with all of the comparable obligations imposed by the laws of the tax jurisdiction in which the business is tax resident as apply to Irish resident contractors. Where proof of compliance is not received then the business may be assigned to the higher 20% or 35% automatic deduction rates (normally 35% in such circumstances).<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that between the administration of tax clearance certification and the operation of eRCT, Revenue has good systems in place to mitigate the potential for tax non-compliance among non-resident businesses operating in the State.

At\u00a0 a system  level, the amount of ECB funding has\u00a0 also reduced significantly\u00a0and\u00a0is a fraction of where it was at the peak of the crisis so the ECB base rate is not the best\u00a0approximation of the average rate that banks pay for their funding. Finally the banks must ensure that the rate\u00a0they lend at is economically sustainable and provides a return for the bank and ultimately the State as\u00a0a shareholder. Without a positive return on their lending, banks would not be capable of maintaining and growing their capital base and thus be in a position to support the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400053#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Deferrals","counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400053#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[39235\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400053#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 156 of 7 October 2014, the reason persons (details supplied) in County Leitrim whose sole income is disability allowance and whose sole property is vacant, with no rental income and in negative equity, were not granted a deferral of the property tax.","asker":"1192","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":172,"content":"<p>I previously set out the criterion required to qualify for deferral of Local Property Tax (LPT) for the Deputy in my reply to Question 37827\/14.<br\/><br\/>By way of reminder to the Deputy, Sections 132 and 133 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral arrangements for residential property owners\/occupiers based on certain income thresholds. Normally, a couple whose only income source is a Department of Social Protection (DSP) payment would qualify for such a deferral providing they are occupying the property in question. The Act is very specific in this regard and Revenue has no discretion in the application of the law as set down.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will also be aware from my reply to Question 37827\/14 that I included a provision in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 that allows a deferral of the Local Property Tax (LPT) charge that is not restricted to owner-occupiers. This deferral option applies where a property owner suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense as a result of which they are unable to pay their LPT, or maintain phased payment arrangements, without causing excessive financial hardship. Claims for this type of deferral require full disclosure to Revenue of the particular loss or expense that resulted in the financial hardship. The submission, which should be completed on the Form 'LPT 2' must also include details of the person's overall financial circumstances. Full information on the conditions and the application process in respect of deferral of LPT on hardship grounds is available on the Revenue website at .<br\/><br\/>In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy now refers, the persons concerned do not meet the qualifying criteria for the income based deferral as they do not reside in the property in question. However from the information provided by the Deputy they may qualify for a deferral on hardship grounds. Revenue has advised me that the persons in question recently wrote to LPT Branch in regard to possible deferral of their liabilities. LPT Branch replied confirming non-entitlement to deferral based on income but indicating the possibility of deferral based on hardship. LPT Branch also set out the application process including the requirement to file the 2013 LPT Return.<br\/><br\/>Revenue has confirmed to me that the persons in question have not yet responded to the reply that issued to them in respect of their letter. I would urge the Deputy to advise the persons to engage with LPT Branch as soon as possible, using the direct contact name provided to them, to bring matters to a conclusion and avoid any unnecessary enforcement action that might occur on foot of continued non-engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400053#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400053#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[39242\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400053#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the introduction of tax relief for home owners who are liable for both the local property tax and private management fees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p> The Government decided that a liability to the Local Property Tax (LPT) should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.\u00a0 Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.

To date in 2014, two retired public servants were awarded temporary contracts through open competition with the Public Appointment Services.<\/p><p>  The Audit Committee for the Office of the Ombudsman must include external members.  It is also highly desirable that members have experience of corporate governance and have some knowledge of the Public Service.  The Chairperson of the Ombudsman's Audit Committee and one external member of the Audit Committee are former Public Servants.  The Audit Committee meets four times per annum.<\/p><p>  In the course of running recruitment competitions to fill vacancies arising between 2012 and 2014, the Office of the Ombudsman engaged 4 trained and experienced former public servants to chair the interview panels for a total of seven days.  The chairpersons of these selection boards had not worked in the Office and as such were well placed to ensure that the selection processes were conducted in an impartial and objective manner. <\/p><p>  Following the retirement of 8 senior and experienced staff in summer 2014 and pending the completion of appointment processes for their successors, the Office was challenged to avoid backlogs developing, to keep up to date with routine work and to continue with some complex investigations.  The office engaged one retired member of staff to support the Office with one high profile investigation.  It is anticipated that this person will have worked for between 20 and 25 days between August and the completion of this investigation in December 2014. <\/p><p>  Finally, the Office of the Ombudsman has engaged one retired public servant to support the work of the Commission for Public Service Appointments in examining two separate complaints.  Again this person was engaged on foot of the retirement of experienced staff from the broader Office and pending appointment of their successors. <\/p><p>  For this work, retired members are paid on a fee-per-day basis and are subject to tax and other relevant deductions.  The fees are linked to pre-retirement grades and take account of the principal of pension abatement.<\/p><p>  While the Public Appointments Service (PAS) does not generally &quot;recruit&quot; former civil\/public servants, in the course of running recruitment competitions for the public service it avails, inter alia, of trained and experienced retired public servants as interviewers, assessors and as decisions arbitrators.  These engagements would typically be of short duration (a matter of days) and no individual has any expectation of continuing engagement.  For this work, retired members are paid on a fee-per-day basis and are subject to tax and other relevant deductions.  The fees are linked to pre-retirement grades and take account of the principle of pension abatement.  The total number of former public servants employed in 2012, 2013 and 2014 are 91, 76 and 73 respectively.<\/p><p>  PAS would also source interviewers and assessors from among serving public servants (who would be paid no fee) as well as retired and working individuals from the private sector.  The former Chairman of the Public Appointments Service Board is also a former Civil Servant; he served on the PAS Board in 2012, 2013 and up to 31st August 2014.  The Chairperson of the PAS Internal Audit Committee is also a former Public Servant; she served in this role in 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Valuation Office engaged the services of one former member of staff in 2012 as an external member of an Audit Committee.  In addition to this another former staff member was employed as a consultant on valuation matters in 2013.  Both staff members are still currently employed.<\/p><p>  In the period 2012 to date, the number of staff recruited by the Office of Public Works who were already in receipt of a public or civil service pension is 10, nine of whom are seasonal guides, recruited following a public recruitment process which was advertised nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400054#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400054#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":184,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[39208\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400054#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding financial emergency measures in the public interest; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":185,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to PQs\u00a038320\/14 and 38321\/14\u00a0of\u00a0the 9th\u00a0October\u00a02014.

Essentially, all of the EU funding available was drawn and paid to farmers during that period.

Since that time, over &euro;107 million was paid to Irish farmers from unused SFP funds under the Upland Sheep Scheme, Grassland Sheep Scheme, Dairy Efficiency Programme, Beef Data Programme and the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme.  Under Pillar Two of the Common Agricultural Policy, Member States develop multi-annual Rural Development Programmes (RDP), which are co-financed by EU and national exchequer funding.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122\/2009 (which replaced Commission Regulation (EC) No 796\/2004) provides that where there is an over-declaration, applicants are not entitled to benefit from payment until the over-claim is resolved.  This provision has been implemented in Ireland since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme, in 2005.  In practice where any land parcel is claimed beyond its confirmed size in hectares an &lsquo;over-claim&rsquo; is flagged and payment is withheld pending resolution of that over-claim.  In the case of Glenahiry commonage, more land than is contained in the entire commonage has been claimed by applicants, since 2005.  All applicants have confirmed their rights to claim certain shares of the Glenahiry commonage.  Consequently, this is a legal dispute over rights to the commonage.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, my Department has no jurisdiction in relation to disputes over Title, Ownership or grazing claims to land.  All parties to this dispute have been made aware of this.  The law on incorporeal hereditaments is very complex.  The establishment and loss of same is governed by the prescription acts and common law.  In this case Legal Title is based on a Land Commission Vesting Order dated 30th June 1950.  Some parties may have established grazing rights on the mountain and other parties may have lost same.  This is obviously a matter of evidence and the Circuit or High Court has jurisdiction in the matter.  The area is further complicated in that grazing rights invariably attach to appurtenant lowland and from our experience the court orders obtained by claimants are based on the common law principles of &lsquo;Levancy and Couchancy&rsquo;.  In simple terms this means that the right to graze is based upon the ability of a person&rsquo;s lowland to sustain the sheep for the winter period.<\/p><p>  I would also like to bring to the attention of the Deputy the efforts made by my Department to find a resolution to this dispute.  In particular, I wish to refer to the number of meetings organised by my Department at which efforts were made to resolve the dispute and allow payments to issue.  In addition, officers of my Department have spent much time over many years in discussions with the parties involved.  However, no resolution could be achieved despite the efforts made by my Department to secure a settlement.  I acknowledge that this is a complex legal dispute that has proved impossible to resolve since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme and has clearly evoked strong feelings amongst those involved.<\/p><p>  I would strongly urge all of the parties directly involved with this commonage and their representatives to come together and seek a resolution to this matter.  Their cooperation and agreement is the only way in which this matter can be resolved.  My Department continues to be available to facilitate the reaching of such an agreement.  It will, in the context of the end of the Single Payment Scheme this year and its replacement by the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, re-examine all the issues involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400056#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; Deontas","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400056#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[38909\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400056#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n uair a &iacute;ocfar le feirmeoir i gContae na Gaillimhe (sonra&iacute; leis seo) fu&iacute;lleach deontas at&aacute; f&oacute;s gan &iacute;oc faoin Sc&eacute;im &Iacute;oca&iacute;ochta Aonair, faoi Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste agus faoin Sc&eacute;im um Chosaint na Timpeallachta Tuaithe; c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad deontas at&aacute; f&oacute;s gan &iacute;oc leis; cad iad na sc&eacute;imeanna de r&eacute;ir bhliain na sc&eacute;ime at&aacute; i gceist; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>N&iacute; raibh aon mhoill ar &iacute;oca&iacute;ocht a eisi&uacute;int leis an duine ainmnithe.

The original requirement was for 80% participation at commonage level, but this was subsequently reduced to 50%, with a further stipulation that this need only be calculated on the basis of the number of active shareholders on the commonage, i.e. those actually grazing the land.  To give an example, if there are 20 shareholders on a commonage, and 15 are claiming shares under the Single Payment Scheme, but only 10 of those are actively grazing the land at present, the 50% requirement to trigger priority access to GLAS is just <b>5 farmers<\/b>.  Both steps have significantly reduced the challenge of securing the required level of agreement. <br\/><br\/>That said, 50% participation remains the target and in fact I hope and believe that a significantly higher percentage will ultimately join the new scheme.  However, it is important to note that farmers are free to signal their interest individually to their own adviser, or to the co-ordinating adviser for the commonage, without a requirement to first come together as a group.  Once sufficient numbers have indicated their interest, the plan for the commonage can be drawn up using the online systems and databases that are currently being built by my Department.  That plan must be submitted by a single adviser for the whole commonage, and there can only be one plan for each commonage. <br\/><br\/>Where it proves impossible to reach the required 50%, I have already indicated that the farmers concerned &ndash; or indeed an individual farmer, should the situation arise &ndash; may bring the case before the Commonage Implementation Committee for consideration and recommendation.  I have already made it clear that no farmer will be locked-out of GLAS if, through no fault of his or her own, it has proved impossible to reach the required 50% on the commonage concerned.  In addition, I have also clarified that on small commonages, i.e. those of 10 hectares or less, the 50% rule does not apply at all, and in those instances farmers are free to join GLAS on an individual basis, in the same way as they would on their privately owned land.<br\/><br\/>Over the last few weeks, I arranged for a series of public meetings to be held at key locations nationwide to give hill farmers an opportunity to talk to officials from my Department for themselves and raise the issues that continue to give them concern.  I am glad to say these meetings were well attended and I believe we have brought a good deal of clarity to the situation and the level of interest, in what is essentially a voluntary scheme, is very encouraging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400056#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400056#WRG02350"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[39026\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400056#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a disadvantage area scheme payment will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>Payments under the 2014 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme began issuing, on target, on 24 September.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.  The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <br\/><br\/>In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<br\/><br\/>The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<br\/><br\/> The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows: <blockquote>-Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. <br \/><br \/>-Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<br \/><br \/>-Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/blockquote>With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  I can assure the Deputy that in examining this claim from PDFORRA, all pertinent facts including cost to the Exchequer and benefit to the Defence Forces have been considered. <br\/><br\/>As discussions under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any matter in respect of this claim.  However, I can advise that, while there was significant progress made in these discussions, it was not possible to reach full agreement and, as a result, the issue is being referred to third party adjudication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400059#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400059#WRK01900"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[39278\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400059#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will provide a list of all State board appointments since general election 2011; the person who recommended each appointment; the credentials of those appointed; if the vacancy was publicly advertised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. <br\/><br\/>The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013. <br\/><br\/>The only body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. <br\/><br\/>There have been two appointments to the Army Pensions Board since the General Election of 2011. A serving military officer was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011, and a civilian doctor was appointed as non military ordinary member in November 2013. <br\/><br\/>The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011. The then Minister for Defence appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff. As the Army Pensions Act, 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised. Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 13 January 2012.<br\/><br\/>The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website.  A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and Dr. Loretta Nolan was appointed to the Board on foot of this public advertisement process.  Details of Dr. Nolan&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 10 December 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400059#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400059#WRK02200"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[39546\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400059#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of persons who are on public or civil service pensions who have been recruited for work on any basis, either permanent or temporary, under the remit of his Department in 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

While the number of Irish citizens who are believed to have travelled to the conflict zones is estimated at between 25 and 30, within that number are individuals who would have travelled to Libya and other Arab States to take part in the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring which began in December 2010. Some of these individuals are known to have returned and three have died in the conflicts. <\/p><p>  This phenomenon is one to which Ireland gave priority during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. In that connection Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of the Member States to carry out a review of the EU Strategy for Countering Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism.  A primary point of focus in this review is the foreign fighter issue. A number of initiatives at EU level have been developed to combat this phenomenon including community relations initiatives, media campaigns, enhanced tracking of movements, engagement with third countries (notably Turkey) and engagement with internet service providers to curb radical online content.  <\/p><p>  In Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour and in line with best practice internationally has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas. In tandem with that, the Garda&iacute; operate a progressive community relations programme through its Racial Inter-Cultural and Diversity Office. That office is in regular contact with our minority communities and recently received favourable comment on its operation from the UN Counter Terrorism Committee.  It is of course essential that at times like this entire communities do not get stigmatised because of the actions of a few. It has to be recognised that the vast majority of people in our communities wish only to go about their daily lives in peace.<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that I recently published new legislation in the form of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014.  The Bill will transpose into Irish law an EU Council Framework Decision on combating terrorism (2008\/919\/JHA).  In particular, the Bill, when enacted will amend the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 to create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400059#WRK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reserve","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400059#WRK02700"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[38858\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400059#WRK02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an assessment of the performance of the Garda Reserve; the number of active members of the Garda Reserve that are contributing to police in the State; the duties carried out by members of the Garda Reserve; her plans to enhance the role of the Garda Reserve; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":350,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of all resources, including personnel, among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts.

Community policing is the underpinning philosophy and ethos through which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na delivers a service across the country.  The key objective of the station closures in 2012 and 2013 was to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources.In this context the Commissioner  concluded that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the frontline if these particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained. The Commissioner estimated that there are 61,000 more man hours available for frontline services following the station closures.<\/p><p>  There are currently over 2,000 full-time-equivalent civilian support staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

However, I wish to advise the Deputy that it is not feasible to provide all the information sought by him in relation to appointments since March 2011 to State Boards under my remit.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the public advertising of vacancies and the credentials of those appointed, the Deputy will be aware that there are many constraining factors which impact on the filling of vacancies to State Boards. Board vacancies are not always advertised on PAS. Many are advertised on the Department's website or the websites of the organisations concerned. The Deputy will also be aware that there are many cases where legislation requires that a vacancy must be filled by candidates holding certain qualifications or must be nominated by certain prescribed bodies and in such instances public advertisement of the vacancy is usually not necessary.  In relation to the person who recommended each appointment I wish to advise the Deputy that where vacancies were advertised the appointment was based on applications received and in instances where nominations were required the appointment was based on the nominations received from bodies set out in the relevant legislation. Other than that I am not not in a position to provide further information as in order to do so it would be necessary to disaggregate every single appointment made since 2011 and that the resources are simply not available to undertake this task.  However, to the extent possible I have provided below a narrative account of the vacancies filled since 2011 and the manner in which they were filled.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy may wish to note that the term 'State Boards' is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Charities Regulatory Authority Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Expressions of interest for appointment to the Board of the Charities Regulatory Authority were sought through the Public Appointments Service.  Sixteen appointments were subsequently made to the Board of the Authority; thirteen of those appointed applied through the Public Appointments Service.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Children Detention Schools Board of Management<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>One appointment was made to the Children Detention Schools Board of Management.  The position was not advertised as the appointment was made under Section 167(4)(a) of the Children Act 2001 as amended, which requires at least one officer of the Minister.  The person appointed was a civil servant.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy should note that responsibility for the Children Detention Schools Board of Management moved to the Department for Children and Youth Affairs on 1 January 2012.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Classification of Films Appeal Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>There are currently nine vacancies on the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Following an invitation to the public to submit expressions of interest, a total of forty-four applications were received.  I expect to make appointments to these positions in the near future.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Courts Service Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>The Courts Service Board has seventeen members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice. There have been twenty appointments, three of which were individuals nominated by my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. including a civil servant from my Department.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government and consists of a Chairperson, a member nominated by the representatives associations and a member nominated by the Government.  The Chairperson is appointed on the nomination of the Ministers for Justice &amp;amp; Equality and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in agreement with the representative association.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board was reappointed on the 30 September, 2014, for the duration of period ending 30 June, 2017. Seven appointments were made to the board since March 2011.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Nine appointments were made to board on 10 April 2012. These positions were not advertised.  Eight of the outgoing members were re-appointed as the Board, which has been replaced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, only had a few outstanding cases on hands at that time.  The outstanding cases have now been finalised and the necessary steps to close the Board are now being put in place. The 9th appointee is a civil servant.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>The Commission consists of three members, a Chairman and two members.  These positions were advertised through the Public Appointments Service following which 40 applications were received.  Three candidates were selected by my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. and approved by Government as having the appropriate experience, qualifications, training and expertise for the relevant roles.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>On 8 September 2011, the Government decided to merge the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority to establish a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way. The 14 outgoing members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the Human Rights Commission three Commissioners were appointed by a Government Decision on the 20 December 2011 and their term expired on 31 May 2012.  In November 2012, advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; members appeared in the media. The fourteen Members Designate of the new Commission were selected in April 2013 in a process independent of Government and appointed initially to the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission on an interim basis so that the two organisations could begin to operate as a cohesive whole. Following this experience, it was decided that the Public Appointments Service (PAS) should be responsible henceforth for selection of Commissioners, including Chief Commissioner post.<br\/><br\/>The Government appointed the fourteen individuals as Members Designate of the Human Rights Commission in advance of the enactment and commencement of the required legislation. On 31 May 2013 the then Minister for Justice and Equality Mr Alan Shatter T.D. appointed twelve of their number to the Board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended.<br\/><br\/>Emily Logan was recently nominated by PAS as Chief Commissioner of the IHREC and at a Government meeting of the 23 July 2014 Ms Logan was appointed on an interim basis as President of the Human Rights Commission pursuant to section 5 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000. She was also appointed as Chair of the Equality Authority pursuant to section 41 and 42 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 passed both Houses of the Oireachtas and was signed by the President on the 27 July 2014. It is expected that Ms. Logan's formal appointment and the formal appointment of the other fourteen members designate of the new IHREC will then be made by the President following the passing of motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Twelve appointments were made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The Board consists of ten members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes three other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Five of the appointments were individuals nominated by myself or my predecessor Deputy Shatter.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Legal Aid Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Fifteen appointments were made to this Board, nine of which were civil or public servants.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Five appointments were made to the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board.  The Chairperson should have at least 10 years experience as a practising barrister\/solicitor ending immediately before his\/her appointment or shall be a judge or former judge of the Circuit Court, High Court or Supreme Court.  The Board should consist of one ordinary member and at least one approved medical officer.  Individuals are appointed by the Minister on foot of their experience and expertise which is invaluable to the work of the Board.<br\/><br\/><b><i>National Disability Authority (NDA)<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Fourteen appointments were made to the National Disability Authority (NDA).  Appointments to the Board were made from nominations of relevant Ministers, as prescribed in the National Disability Authority Act 1999 (the Act), an elected member of the staff of the NDA (also a requirement of the Act) and respondents to publicly advertised calls for expressions of interest (in line with Government Decision S180\/20\/10\/1424 of April 2011). The Act also stipulates that in making appointments &quot;<i>the Minister shall have regard to the objective that a majority of the Authority would be persons with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers, and, in the case of each member of the Authority, that he or she would have knowledge or experience, either directly or indirectly, of matters pertaining to disability or of any other subject which in the opinion of the Minister would be of assistance to the Authority in the performance of its functions&quot;.<\/i>The Act also makes reference to the objective that not less than 5 women and 5 men be appointed to the Board; and to the desirability that its members would include persons from both rural and urban areas.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Parole Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Eleven appointments made to the Parole Board.  Individuals are appointed by the Minister on foot of their experience and expertise which is invaluable to the work of the Board.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Private Security Appeal Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>The Government appointed four people on 3 April 2012.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.

The Chairman must be a practising barrister or solicitor of at least seven years' standing.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Private Security Authority (PSA)<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Eleven appointments were made to the Board, out of which seven positions were publicly advertised on the Public Appointments Service and Department of Justice and Equality websites.  The remaining four positions in accordance with Section 7 of the Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) were nominated representatives from my own Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSA itself.  Of the positions publicly advertised the legislation specifies that two members should be representatives of employers in the private security industry, two members should be representatives of employees of employers in the private security industry and one member should be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than five years standing.  Following the public advertisement process, six members, including the Chairman were appointed and one discretionary appointment was made by the then Minister.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Property Registration Authority<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Eight appointments were made to the Property Registration Authority.  Following an invitation to the public to submit expressions of interest, a total of 84 applications were received. Four of the eight appointments were public applicants.

Those appointed were public applicants.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Property Services Regulatory Authority<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Eleven appointments were made to the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA).  My Department received 114 applications after seeking expressions of interest from members of the public.

This requirement will apply to new services from September 2014.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the general requirement for a Level 5 qualification, pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school provision to children in the age category 3 years 2 months to 4 years 7 months under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will have to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent, by September 2015. <br\/><br\/>In 2013, &euro;0.9 million was made available to my Department to support existing staff working  in the childcare sector to meet the new requirements.  As a result, my Department agreed to increase the annual grant funding provided in 2013 to Early Childhood Ireland, a national voluntary organisation that promotes quality care and education for young children, in return for the provision of additional accredited training for existing childcare staff.  The objective of the  funding is to ensure that all existing staff are in a position to meet the minimum Level 5 qualification requirement to enable them to continue to work in the childcare sector and that staff seeking to fill the role of Pre-school Leader under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme are assisted to obtain the required Level 6 qualification.  <br\/><br\/>To further support childcare staff, the Learner Fund was launched in March this year.  The Fund, which is being administered by Pobal with the help of local City and County Childcare Committees, has a total allocation of &euro;3 million for the years 2014 and 2015 and is being targeted to subsidise the cost for childcare staff who are required to undertake accredited Level 5 and Level 6 courses. <br\/><br\/>The funding provided under both initiatives will be drawn down in 2014 and 2015 to support staff seeking to meet the new qualification requirements.

These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.<\/p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6 m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013\/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.

In the current system, all persons aged under 55 are covered after 26 weeks of joining for illnesses that commence after taking out health insurance.  Those aged over 55 have longer waiting periods.  The provisions on waiting periods help to support community rating.  Under community rating, everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health.  This system requires &lsquo;intergenerational solidarity&rsquo;, where younger people pay more for health insurance than the level of risk they present would demand, while older people pay less as a direct consequence.<br\/><br\/>The provision of waiting periods helps to encourage individuals to take out health insurance earlier in life, thus minimising the strain placed on the community rating system and ultimately benefitting the entire pool of insured persons in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400063#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":475,"content":"<p>Question No. 165 answered with Question No. 154.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Administration","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400063#WRO00600"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[38965\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400063#WRO00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on medical cards (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>General Practitioners (GPs) are reimbursed by the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service for a range of services they provide to medical card and GP visit card holders.

All tobacco products have been shown to negatively affect health and as such it was considered appropriate that all tobacco products should be treated equally under the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The preamble to the World Health Organisation Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), which Ireland has signed and ratified, states that there is no distinction made between tobacco products and the harm that they cause.  Article 11 of the FCTC concerns the packaging and labelling of tobacco products, and the guidelines issued by the WHO for its implementation request that Parties to the Treaty consider adopting standardised packaging for all tobacco products: &ldquo;Parties should ensure that the packaging and labelling provisions related to Article 11 of the Convention apply equally to <i>all<\/i>tobacco products sold within the jurisdiction.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>There is a wealth of experience internationally that shows the necessity for a comprehensive approach in tobacco control.  The evidence base shows that standardised packaging will impact on the consumption of tobacco products, including cigars, in that it will reduce the appeal of tobacco products and will encourage cessation, whilst at the same time reducing the ability of the packaging of each of these products to mislead consumers about the harmful effects of smoking.<br\/><br\/>As Deputy has pointed out, the UK has not included cigars and pipe tobacco in their draft standardised packaging regulations.  If the UK decides to go ahead with this initiative the resulting regulations will be made under their Children and Families Act 2014.  The proposed Irish legislation is not confined to any specific age group.  From a public health perspective, Ireland has taken the decision to reduce smoking of all tobacco products, and not just cigarettes, to a prevalence rate of less than 5% by 2025.  All smokers, irrespective of the type of product they consume deserve the same level of protection as do those who consume cigarettes.  The standardised or plain packaging legislation already introduced in Australia covers all tobacco products, including cigars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400063#WRO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Funding","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400063#WRO03600"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[39034\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400063#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding mental health and additional resources for frontline mental health care services (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm and the reform of our mental health services are two priority areas for the Government.  In line with Programme for Government commitments, &euro;90 million and some 1,100 additional posts have been provided since 2012, to develop Community Mental Health Teams and Suicide Prevention resources.  In addition, the budget for the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has more than doubled, from &euro;4 million in 2011 to &euro;8.8 million in 2014.<br\/><br\/>The NOSP has primary responsibility for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of <i>Reach Out<\/i>our suicide prevention strategy and has been tasked with coordinating suicide prevention efforts around the country as well as supporting agencies and individuals interested and active in suicide prevention.  The NOSP funds over thirty non-governmental organisations to carry out an array of work in communities that promote positive mental health and work to reduce the incidence of suicide and self-harm.  In 2014, the NOSP will continue to work in partnership to deliver  local and community based supports as well as frontline services.  The NOSP is also working to improve access to information and supports for anyone experiencing mental health difficulties with the development of the free to call Samaritans 116 123 helpline number which was launched earlier this year, and a new on-line portal, which will be launched shortly, that will provide easily accessible and accurate information.  These new initiatives will simplify the signposting to services for people who may be going through tough times.<br\/><br\/>In recognition of the need to further improve the response of the Mental Health Service to people following an episode of deliberate self harm, the HSE, in conjunction with the Irish College of Psychiatrists, has developed a Clinical Programme.  An important aspect of the Programme is to ensure each person is linked in to the follow up recommended by the nurse.  Thirty five posts have been allocated on the basis of the number of self harm presentations to the various Emergency Departments; twenty two of these posts are currently filled and training has been initiated.  In addition, the Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse (SCAN) initiative is being extended to eight new sites across the country and will be operational by the end of the year.  This service provides active liaison between primary care and the mental health services and enables and assists GPs in carrying out speedy clinical assessments of patients presenting with deliberate self harm\/suicide crisis.<br\/><br\/>Mindful that schools are one of the key settings for the promotion of mental health and well-being of young people and that they are also in the position to identify young people experiencing emotional difficulties, the NOSP worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills to develop <i>Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention <\/i>in post-primary schools.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Health and the NOSP are continuing to work very closely on suicide prevention issues and on the finalisation of a new Strategic Framework which is expected to be completed by the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy (2006), <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>, provides a framework for action to develop a modern high quality mental health service over a 7 to 10 year period.  Implementation of <i>Vision<\/i>has included positive mental health promotion, accelerated closure of the old psychiatric hospitals, the development of community based adult and child and adolescent services and bespoke new facilities to support the recommended community-based, recovery-focussed model of care resulting in shorter episodes of in-patient care and the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services.<br\/><br\/>The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service is a key Service Improvement Project for the HSE.  The project aims to improve access to and use of CAMHS in-patient, day hospital and community based services, particularly in the context of agreed protocols governing the area of 16-17 year olds.  As part of  the development funding prioritised by this Government since 2012 for mental health overall, upwards of 230 new posts have been allocated to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams.  This additional investment is intended to enable CAMHS teams to cater for all age ranges up to 18 years.  Area Mental Health Management Teams are now also in place across the country, to ensure a more seamless service between CAMHS and Adult Mental Health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400063#WRO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":512,"content":"<p>Question No. 177 answered with Question No. 173.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400064#WRP00250"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[39045\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400064#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card will be reinstated in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick as they were previously the holder of a medical card on a discretionary basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":515,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

They were published by the Health protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) in 2012. Parts of this guidance have been updated in light of the recent EVD outbreak in West Africa. <br\/><br\/>The key elements of the guidelines include: <br\/><br\/>-the need for vigilance in considering the possibility of VHF in a person with a fever who has recently returned (within 21 days) from travel to an endemic area, <br\/><br\/>-the institution of appropriate infection control measures if a case is suspected, <br\/><br\/>-rapid testing and diagnosis of the case, and<br\/><br\/>-the management of his\/her contacts.<br\/><br\/>Given appropriate infection control measures, onward transmission to others is extremely unlikely. <br\/><br\/>On 29 May 2013 a VHF education day was held for relevant professionals to launch guidance on Management of VHF produced by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC.  This education day concentrated particularly on providing a practical guide to the management of an imported VHF case, including ambulance transfer.<br\/><br\/>Following the announcement on 8 August 2014 a number of additional actions in relation to guidance, communications and transport were put in place, beyond those already in existence.  An urgent teleconference was convened between the Department of Health, the HPSC, HSE-Public Health, HSE-Emergency Preparedness and HSE-Communications to review the following areas:<br\/><br\/>-Travel advice &ndash; advice would issue from DOH advising against non-essential travel<br\/><br\/>-Posters in airports<br\/><br\/>-Repatriation of Irish citizens <br\/><br\/>In addition, the HSE&rsquo;s Port Health Group &ndash; a group tasked with providing guidance and advice in relation to measures in ports and airports.<br\/><br\/>On the day of the announcement, advice for travellers, including features of the disease, modes of transmission, and methods to prevention were posted on the HPSC website.  An extensive Ebola virus disease travel section was developed as a portal for those who would travel between West Africa and Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>The advice document <i>Advice for healthcare workers, including humanitarian aid workers, returning to or coming to Ireland following travel from an area affected by the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak<\/i>(most recent version 5 September 2014) was produced and posted on the HPSC&rsquo;s website.  <br\/><br\/>Advice for airport and port managers that had been developed was circulated to all relevant stakeholders.  This information has been posted on the website for the HPSC. The guidance document, <i>Update for Airport Managers and Airlines on Ebola Virus Disease<\/i>was posted on 22 August 2014 and the guidance document <i>Update for Port Managers and Ferry Companies on Ebola Virus Disease<\/i>was posted on 5 September 2014. <br\/><br\/>Posters (in English, French and Irish) - <i>Returning from West Africa? Important information about Ebola<\/i>&ndash; were printed and distributed to all Airports and the main designated Seaports.  They have been placed in prominent positions in full line of sight of all arriving passengers\/crews in the arrivals areas of these locations.  <br\/><br\/>Following the declaration of PHEIC, a modified  <i>EVD Risk Assessment for use by Ambulance Personnel<\/i>was developed from an existing document to ensure that transport of suspected EVD patients was placed on a clear and systematic footing.  This document provides highly specific guidance for ambulance personnel on the transfer of patients suspected as having EVD.  This algorithm allows for remote risk assessment of a patient suspected as having EVD arriving at one of the country&rsquo;s airports, by an expert physician from the National Isolation Unit in the Mater Hospital.  This guidance document lays out clear procedures whereby ambulance personnel would protect themselves and others from possible infection.  It stipulates the necessary isolation of a potentially infected person, personal protective equipment to be deployed by ambulance crews and the necessary urgent communication pathways required. <br\/><br\/>Beyond this initial contact, extensive guidance is also available for hospital clinicians, general practitioners and other healthcare workers, to enable rapid identification of suspected Ebola patients, in other settings, and their urgent management.  There is also extensive guidance on the necessary steps that staff must take to ensure that they protect themselves and other patients.<br\/><br\/>Healthcare staff in the NIU and hospitals around the country have received information and advice on identification and management of EVD.  In addition, staff in the National Isolation Unit (NIU) have received specific training in the use of the appropriate PPE to be used in the management of a suspected EVD patient.<br\/><br\/>There is ongoing contact between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and updated travel advice is available on the Foreign Affairs' website. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all non-essential travel to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. <br\/><br\/>In conclusion, considerable public health planning is underway with a range of bodies and professionals in relation to the Ebola emergency in West Africa. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400065#WRQ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":554,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400065#WRQ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":555,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[39140\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400065#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a decision will be made on a medical card application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; the reason for the delay in making the decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":556,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Two satellite centres, which will operate under the same governance and management as the children's hospital, are planned for the campuses of Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals. In October 2013, the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform announced that up to &euro;200m would be made available for the hospital from the sale of the National Lottery, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding indented for this project and underlining the Government's commitment to it. A design team has been appointed and is working on design development, with the aim of submitting a planning application in June 2015. It is expected that the project will be on site at the St James's campus and at the two satellite centre locations, on the campuses of Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals, in January 2016.

At the end of this period, Alexion was expected to have developed additional evidence to allow the HSE to make a long term decision in relation to the funding of this incredibly costly agent. The HSE honoured the terms of that agreement.<\/p><p>  The agreement lapsed and a formal re-assessment process was triggered as was agreed with Alexion \/ St James&rsquo;s in 2010. Pending consideration of the outcome of the assessment, the HSE continued the funding commitments entered into with Alexion on behalf of the original 10 patients identified by the National Centre i.e. St James&rsquo;s. The HSE has released funding of &euro;1.9m in the first 8 months of 2014 to fund treatment for the 10 existing patients. <\/p><p>  Many countries have struggled to accept the pricing point put forward by Alexion.

In some instances, it is appropriate to defer formally placing a patient on an inpatient or day-case waiting list after they have been seen for the first time as out-patients until all investigations confirm that a surgical procedure is actually necessary.  This may require sending the patient for further tests as outpatients. <\/p><p>  The HSE continues to implement further measures to tackle waiting lists.  These include: increasing the throughput of patients in public outpatient clinic, reducing the number of patients who do not turn up for their appointment, and increasing the number of new patients in the clinic rather than just reviewing previous patients who are often better returned to their GP. <\/p><p>  It is important for the Deputy to note that there is no policy to manipulate waiting lists.  The only waiting lists that I'm interested in are accurate ones. Accurate waiting lists allow us to plan services.  When it comes to negotiating a good budget for health, waiting list figures that make the situation look better than it really is are no benefit to me.  I will continue to work with the HSE to ensure that the issues relating to hospital waiting lists are resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400066#WRR03700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400067#WRS00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400067#WRS00150"},{"type":"question","counter":627,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[39040\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400067#WRS00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if employee protections are in place for persons working in the foreign missions here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":628,"content":"<p>Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, it is the duty of all persons enjoying diplomatic privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the host State.

In Ireland&rsquo;s case, we are working closely with our partners in the EU and through the United Nations to coordinate our efforts and to strengthen the tools at our disposal.  A special meeting of the European Council on 30 August 2014 called for accelerated implementation of a package of measures agreed in June 2013 concerning four priority areas: prevention of radicalisation, detection of suspicious travel, investigation and prosecution and cooperation with third countries.  The European Council will review this issue in December 2014.<\/p><p>  The approach being taken by the European Council is consistent with the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters which was adopted unanimously on 24 September 2014.  Ireland co-sponsored the Resolution along with 103 other States, including all other EU member states.<\/p><p>  The Resolution takes a comprehensive, human rights compliant approach to tackling the foreign fighters problem in accordance with international law.  It highlights the need to tackle the underlying causes of radicalisation through community outreach initiatives, while at the same time focusing on strengthening legal and security measures.  This comprehensive strategy in the Resolution is very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the issue.<\/p><p>  Our approach nationally combines preventive measures and capacity to prosecute terrorist-related behaviour.  In terms of preventive measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour.  In tandem with that the Garda&iacute; operate a progressive community relations programme through the Racial Inter-Cultural and Diversity Office.<\/p><p>  As regards capacity to prosecute, existing 2005 legislation already provides for the offences of terrorist bombing and terrorist financing.

My Department is committed to using its full resources, at headquarters and through the Embassy network, to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trading interests, cultural profile and reputation internationally, thereby contributing to the continued recovery and development of the domestic economy.  The transfer of certain trade promotion functions from the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to the then Department of Foreign Affairs in June 2011 gave my Department an enhanced role in trade promotion. The responsibilities transferred included chairmanship and management of the Export Trade Council (ETC), the handling of Joint Economic Commissions (JECs) and coordination with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) and Enterprise Ireland (EI) on the annual programme of EI ministerial led trade missions.<\/p><p>  The ETC has met twice annually since it was established in late 2011 and I will be chairing the 7 meeting on 4 November 2014. Overall, the ETC aims to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade, tourism, investment and education, as well as overseeing the implementation of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. A Review of the Strategy was published by my Department in February of this year.<\/p><p>  My Department coordinates Ireland&rsquo;s participation in JECs with China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Libya (currently in abeyance). As a formal bilateral intergovernmental body, dealing with trade development in all its aspects, the JEC format provides a forum for discussing issues that relate to trade development between the two countries involved, serving to further the development of economic and business relations, as well as scientific and technological cooperation. So far this year, Ireland has held JECs with Saudi Arabia (February) and Russia (April). My Department is currently preparing for the forthcoming JEC with South Korea on 4 December 2014.<\/p><p>  The transfer of certain trade promotion functions has resulted in an even closer working relationship with the State agencies. At the beginning of each year, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade coordinate the annual EI programme of ministerial-led trade missions. Trade missions to Mexico and Australia will take place in this quarter and I will also address the EI-arranged Financial Services and BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) dinner in London on 13 November.<\/p><p>  DJEI retains lead responsibility for trade policy, which includes representing Ireland&rsquo;s trade interests in the context of the EU Common Commercial Policy and at the World Trade Organisation.

In 2013, the Embassy network supported a total of 136 high-level visits with a significant economic or promotional dimension across 52 countries. The Embassy network also undertook more than 730 engagements to facilitate trade and investment supporting jobs in Ireland, as well as more than 660 specific engagements to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic position to office-holders worldwide. Ambassadors and Embassy staff engaged with over 1,150 representatives of the international media to promote Ireland&rsquo;s profile and global reputation, and key messages on Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and its strengths as a location for foreign investment were promoted in opinion articles and interviews in the international media reaching more than 53 million people.

The Parades Commission, as the lawful designated authority, has a very important role in creating a stable framework for the handful of contentious Parades that remain.  <\/p><p>  The forthcoming Political Talks offer an opportunity for the Northern Ireland Executive Parties to address the overall Parades situation and other outstanding issues that are preventing Northern Ireland from making further progress on its journey to a peaceful, prosperous and reconciled society.

Under the procedures, the Board of Management must also ensure that the school's anti-bullying policy is regularly highlighted and promoted on a school-wide basis with particular attention being given to incoming pupils and their parents.

Additionally, many pupils with learning support needs or mild general learning difficulties receive additional teaching support in post primary schools from the schools general allocation of resource teaching support.<br\/><br\/>  In relation to initial teacher education, while special education has long been a feature of initial teacher education (ITE) programmes, the Teaching Council, the body with statutory authority and responsibility for the registration of teachers, requires the reconceptualised and extended programmes, which commenced in 2012, to address a number of specific elements including differentiation, inclusive education including special education and literacy and numeracy. <br\/><br\/>  The learning outcomes of these programmes indicate that the graduate teacher should be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs, to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching, to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils, to evaluate learner progress, to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes.  Student teachers may also have access to additional elective courses with content focussing on special education.<br\/><br\/>  Teachers have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to continuing professional development. <br\/><br\/>  My Department also funds a number of Post-Graduate Programmes for teachers involved in Learning Support and Special Education.  These programmes are specifically designed to assist all schools and educational services in meeting the needs of students requiring learning support and the teaching of students with special educational needs.  Since 2007, some 2,000 teachers have completed these programmes. <br\/><br\/>  I am satisfied that current arrangements are adequate to ensure that teachers receive the necessary initial education and have access to quality continuing professional development programmes during their career so that they are in a position to meet the needs of students. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400071#WRWW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Facilities","counter":778,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400071#WRWW00750"},{"type":"question","counter":779,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[39222\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400071#WRWW00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the lack of third level opportunities to access third level education in Tipperary town; if her attention has been further drawn to plans to extend the LIT campus to Tipperary town; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":780,"content":"<p>The National Strategy for Higher Education sets out a comprehensive roadmap for reform of the higher education system, with the aim that the system becomes more performance-oriented and more flexible and responsive, while the diversity of mission is retained and enhanced.

ELTOs which apply for ACELS-recognition are assessed for their compliance with the relevant minimum requirements, in two distinct stages.<br\/><br\/>  Stage 1 involves the submission of relevant documentation by the provider concerned and its assessment for compliance with ACELS standards.  Where applications are complete and accurate this stage is completed in a maximum of 10 weeks.  However, the provider may be asked for additional information and is given a period of 30 working days to respond.  This can happen twice.  Therefore, where a provider is asked for additional information on two occasions, and on both occasions takes the full 30 working days, the process can be lengthened considerably.  Stage 2 involves a site visit and inspection report.  The date of the inspection is agreed with the provider within 10 days of the completion of Stage 1 and, once completed, the provider has 10 working days to comment on the factual accuracy of the report.<br\/><br\/>  QQI re-opened access to ACELS recognition for a temporary period from 17 October 2013 to 31 January 2014.  The purpose of this period was to enable those English Language Training Organisations (ELTOs) which were ready to apply, and which had expressed a strong interest in gaining recognition for 2014, to do so through a revised and strengthened process.  During that period, QQI\/ACELS received a total of 35 applications for recognition.  As of 25 September, 5 of those applications had been successful,1 application had been refused and 10 applications ceased due to closure, suspension or a change of circumstances post-application.  On that date, the remaining 19 applications were still in process, with 14 of those applications being close to completion.<br\/><br\/>  With regard to the closure of ELTOs, the Department is not aware of any ELTOs which have closed while holding ACELS-recognition.<br\/><br\/>  With regard to Marketing English in Ireland (MEI), the Department does not view MEI as a quality assurance organisation for language providers.  Rather MEI is a private membership organisation of ELTOs which hold ACELS-recognition and which extend protection for enrolled learners (PEL) arrangements to each other.  The regulatory reform of the international education sector, announced on 2 September, was entirely a matter for the Departments of Education and Skills and Justice and Equality.  <br\/><br\/>  I am aware that certain providers operating in this sector have concerns regarding the scope of those reforms.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality and I have both indicated that the reforms are urgently required to protect the consumer and educational interests of genuine international students, to tackle abuse of the labour market and the immigration regime, and to safeguard the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers.  While this may cause some short-term disruption to certain providers, it is in the long-term interest of the sector as a whole.<br\/><br\/>  It is important to be clear that these reforms pertain solely to the immigration status of non-EEA nationals. No change has been made which will restrict the ability of institutions to educate Irish citizens or to attract international students from within the European market of over half a billion people. <br\/><br\/>  With regard to the role of ACELS in facilitating the recognition of awards of bodies from outside the State, ACELS does not have such a role. <br\/><br\/>  Finally, the regulatory reform of the international education, which I recently announced with the Minister for Justice and Equality, requires that the programmes concerned lead to awards made by Irish awarding bodies, such as the universities or QQI.  Therefore providers will not be permitted to recruit non-EEA students to programmes leading to the awards of awarding bodies from outside the State.  The rationale for this decision is set out in the policy statement &quot;Regulatory Reform of the International Education Sector and the Student Immigration Regime&quot;.  A number of characteristics common to the colleges of concern are identified, including that they cater mainly to non-EEA students, tend to charge unsustainably low fees, do not have in place arrangements for the protection of learners and &quot;typically offer language programmes accredited by international bodies, vocational\/management programmes whose awards are by overseas bodies or degree programmes that are franchised by UK universities&quot;. <br\/><br\/>  The level of oversight exercised by such awarding bodies in relation to provision in Ireland has, in many cases, been found to be extremely low.  Therefore, the decision to restrict enrolment of non-EEA students to programmes leading to quality-assured, Irish awards will serve to ensure that providers are required to have in place the necessary arrangements for quality assurance and to improve the overall quality of the offering for international learners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400071#WRWW02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":799,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":800,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[39271\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update on her Department's work on developing plans for a parents' and students' charter; the date on which they expect a consultation process to begin; the date on which the charter will be in force.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":801,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware from my recent reply that a set of principles will be required to act as a charter to strengthen the relationship between parents, students and schools, and the position of parents and students generally within the school system.<br\/><br\/>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department is currently examining the legislative changes to Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998 that will be necessary to provide for and support the introduction of such a Charter, and after which consultation with the education partners will take place. <br\/><br\/>It remains my intention to publish my plans during the remainder of this school year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":802,"content":"<p>Question No. 281 answered with Question No. 233.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":803,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX00450"},{"type":"question","counter":804,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[39279\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide a list of all State board appointments since general election 2011; the person who recommended each appointment; the credentials of those appointed; if the vacancy was publicly advertised; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Five Year Plan is focused on meeting those demographic needs and sets out the school projects that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan. My Department will also consider applications from schools for funding for additional classrooms where an immediate enrolment need is arising.<br\/><br\/>  My Department continues to analyse demographic trends and to monitor enrolments in all areas to determine the level of additional school provision which will be required into the future and to ensure that this is provided in a timely manner. An analysis of the relevant data is currently ongoing on a nationwide basis. <br\/><br\/>  Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website. The staffing schedule at primary level operates on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 28 pupils. Teachers are allocated at post-primary level on the basis of 1 teacher for every 19 pupils (23 pupils in the case of fee-charging schools). More favourable ratios operate in DEIS schools.<br\/><br\/>  Normally, the staffing of schools is determined by the enrolments of the previous September. However, the staffing arrangements also include provision for schools that are projecting significant increases in their enrolments for the start of the school year to be allocated additional posts. At post primary level, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concession. <br\/><br\/>  The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.

In addition, Irish Water will receive a subvention of some &euro; 440 million from the Local Government Fund in 2014, which will fund water- related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities and which would, historically, have been met by local authorities from their own resources, non-domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from non-domestic water charge revenues of some &euro;190m and from borrowing, which will be the subject of appropriate Ministerial consents in due course.  The local government funding model has changed considerably in 2014 and, in particular, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector has a considerable impact on local authority financing. The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2014 estimates total expenditure from the Local Government Fund of &euro;1.779 billion in 2014, with income from, primarily, estimated Local Property Tax proceeds of &euro;550m and revenue from motor tax of &euro;1.16 billion.   \u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Quality","counter":827,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX02050"},{"type":"question","counter":828,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[39110\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will advise the Health Service Executive to carry out tests on the lead content in the water supply in an areaa (details supplied) in County Kerry, in view of the fact that independent tests carried out in another area of County Kerry produced results in which the lead content was well above the EU safe limit of 10 micrograms per litre as advised in the HSE-EPA link","asker":"1048","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":829,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[39127\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the water quality in an area (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":830,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[39142\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400072#WRX02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the results of water testing by an independent company for lead content in the water of houses in an area (details supplied) in County Kerry, constitute that the water is unsafe to drink as advised in the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health Service Executive pamphlet and in view of the fact that the tests produced results in which the lead content was well above the EU safe limit of ten micrograms per litre; if the HSE will declare the water unfit for drinking purposes in the area and notify the energy regulator of such a decision in order that the regulator may declare that the residents of the area are not liable for water charges until the issue is resolved.","asker":"1048","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":831,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 290 to 292, inclusive, together.  <br\/><br\/>With effect from 1st January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services. Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water, including Irish Water, are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations.  Under the Regulations, the maximum allowable value for lead is 10 micrograms per litre.  At this concentration, there is a risk of exceeding the limits where lead piping is in use for water supply and in particular where the water has been sitting in the pipe overnight. <br\/><br\/>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these Regulations.  In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier is required to investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive (HSE), to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken.  This may include the prohibition or the restriction of the supply by the water supplier.  The procedures to be followed where there is non-compliance with the parameter values set out in the Drinking Water Regulations are clearly laid out in the Regulations.  In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership should be replaced over time.  The EPA and HSE also recommend that persons in premises that have lead piping should flush the supply at the kitchen tap first thing in the morning, before using for drinking. <br\/><br\/>Irish Water has informed my Department that of its estimated 58,000 kilometres of distribution system, there is a very small proportion of lead piping, consisting of approximately 190 short lengths across 14 local authorities.  Irish Water is working to achieve the replacement of these pipes as quickly as possible. <br\/><br\/>However, there are a significant number of lead public service pipes between the water mains and the customer stopcock or water meter. Irish Water is identifying the location of such lead service connections during the meter installation programme.  The numbers currently being identified represent about 5% of houses, but this is expected to be higher in town centre areas. Irish Water also estimates that there may be a further 30,000 to 40,000 houses with shared backyard lead service connections.  Irish Water has informed my Department that it intends to invest in public lead pipe replacement schemes, primarily communications pipes, with a view to eliminating lead mains, including shared backyard service connections over the next ten years.  Irish Water is also reviewing its water treatment processes to ensure that they can mitigate the risk in the short term. <br\/><br\/>The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance of the internal water distribution system and should ensure that it is kept in good order and repair, so as to prevent a risk to human health or the environment and that the water meets prescribed quality standards. <br\/><br\/>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The CER recently published its determination on the water charges plan submitted to it by Irish Water.  In its determination t he CER has decided that where a water restriction is in place for more than 24 hours, domestic customers should receive a 100% discount on the water supply charge. <br\/><br\/>The EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland, which sets out details on the numbers of water restrictions that are in place.  Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas library or from the EPA website ().  Irish Water also publishes the results of drinking water quality sampling on its website ().<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  <br\/><br\/>The CER has now issued a determination on the water charges plan submitted to it by Irish Water. Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at .<br\/><br\/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014.  This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as for child benefit, while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped.  <br\/><br\/>Irish Water has submitted analysis of water consumption patterns in Ireland to the CER and details of this are available on the CER website.  The analysis is based on actual metered data and follow-on surveys with over 3,000 houses and it confirms that average consumption for a household is 66,000 litres per year for the first occupant and an average further 21,000 litres for each additional occupant. Data on consumption patterns will continue to be provided by Irish Water to the CER on a regular basis. <br\/><br\/>In its determination, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months. The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later. <br\/><br\/>In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package. The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure are being developed by the Department of Social Protection.  <br\/><br\/>Section 21 of the 2013 Act requires Irish Water to charge each customer for the provision by it of water services and therefore there are no exemptions from water charges for local authority tenants. For a domestic property that is not permanently occupied, the owner of the premises will be required to pay a minimum charge for water supply and for wastewater per service.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act defines a customer a s the occupier of the premises in receipt of water services.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <br\/><br\/>The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  The CER has now issued a determination on the water charges plan.  Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at.<br\/><br\/>.<br\/><br\/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014.  This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the billing of properties not connected to a meter on the basis of a scheme of assessed charges based on occupancy.  The policy direction also requires the CER to review assessed charges in the light of emerging data on metered consumption to ensure that the assessed charges remain as close a proxy for actual usage as possible.<br\/><br\/>With charges effective from 1 October 2014 Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure that customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved by the CER.\u00a0 Throughout the last number of weeks, Irish Water has been sending application packs to approximately 2 million households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015.\u00a0 The application process will enable customers to confirm their details for billing and, by providing the relevant PPS numbers, claim the allowances that they are eligible for.\u00a0 This process involves customers informing Irish Water of the number of people living in a property, which is made on the basis of self-declaration. <br\/><br\/>The 2013 Act defines the customer as the occupier of the premises in respect of which the water services are provided. It also provides, unless the contrary is proved, that the owner of a premises is also the occupier of the premises.  The application process gives tenants the opportunity to apply and avail of their relevant allowances and t his will continue until the deadline date for applications of 31 October 2014.  After this date Irish Water has advised my Department that it intends to initiate a further campaign to allow landlords provide proof that their property is occupied by a tenant and that they are not the occupant.  This will remove liability from the landlord in compliance with Section 21(5) of the Act.  Irish Water has an ongoing engagement with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and will ensure compliance with data protection legislation.<br\/><br\/>As outlined in the water charges plan, customers may request Irish Water to change their occupancy status at any time.  Irish Water will facilitate that request subject to the change in occupancy being for a period greater than 90 days. <br\/><br\/>In its determination on the water charges plan, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months.  The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later.<br\/><br\/>Up to 300,000 households may not be metered in the initial domestic water metering programme due to either the high cost or the technical difficulty of doing so.  Irish Water has commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections.  On the basis of this report, it has been agreed to incorporate 48,000 apartments, identified by the report as being easily metered, into the current metering programme.  The advancement of any further phase of metering will be a matter for consideration by the C ER based on proposals from Irish Water.  The same regime of assessed charges, based on occupancy, will apply to apartmentswhich are not metered, as other unmetered dwellings. <br\/><br\/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

In relation to Local Property Tax (LPT), the Government has decided that 80% of LPT will be retained locally from 2015 to fund vital public services. The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State, in such a way as to ensure that no local authority is worse off in 2015 compared to General Purpose Grant allocations in 2014. <br\/><br\/>Every local authority has the power, from 1 July 2014, to vary the basic rate of LPT by up to 15%.

Where a local authority decides to reduce LPT rates, the full cost of that reduction will be reflected in a reduced LPT allocation to that local authority.

To meet this obligation Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewables. Provisional figures indicate that, at the end of 2013, 7.7% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy came from renewable sources.  There is currently over 2,400 MW of renewable generation connected to the Irish grid, with an estimated total required by 2020 of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW. Over 3,000 MW of new generation, mainly renewable, has accepted grid connection offers, reflecting the abundance of Ireland's renewable energy resources. However, to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020, we must increase the rate of build of both renewable generation and the electricity transmission network. Comprehensive engagement with local communities, and communicating the benefits for citizens of realising the potential of our indigenous renewable electricity resources, will be essential in the rollout of renewable energy and grid infrastructure.<\/p><p>  Progress towards the renewable heat target is proving challenging. Estimates by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) show that current policies will not deliver fully on our target of 12% renewable energy in the heat sector by 2020. In this regard, the analysis underpinning the draft Bioenergy Plan, published last week, sets out how an additional bioenergy focussed measure in the heat sector would be a cost effective means of meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets. The Plan, therefore, recommends, subject to State Aid clearance and further Government approval, that a scheme would be introduced that would incentivise larger heat users to convert to biomass heating solutions.<\/p><p>  Though the increased deployment of electric vehicles will contribute towards the target of 10% of the energy in transport from renewables, the deployment of sustainable biofuels through the Biofuels Obligation Scheme will be the main mechanism through which Ireland will aim to support renewable energy in transport.<\/p><p>  Although biofuels from waste accounted for over 62% of the biofuel placed on the Irish market in 2013, a proposed amendment by the European Commission to the Renewable Energy Directive would require that, in addition to the current requirement that biofuels must meet certain sustainability criteria, a limit would apply to the contribution that certain crop-based biofuels could make towards renewable energy targets. This would result in Ireland and other Member States encountering challenges with regard to the availability of sufficient quantities of sustainable biofuel.<\/p><p>  Ireland's 16% renewables target for 2020 is a legally binding obligation, as is the case for all Member States. While the EU Renewables Directive makes provision for the purchase of compliance with targets, the costs associated with this are not yet known. In any event, it is critical that we maintain our focus on taking the range of actions available to us to overcome the challenges we face in meeting our 2020 target, and to making our energy system more sustainable, and more secure, for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400078#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":1015,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400078#WRDD01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1016,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[38950\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101400078#WRDD01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when publication of the sectoral adaptation plan for energy envisaged under the national policy position for tackling climate change will take place; to set out the preparations and progress his Department has made towards the plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1017,"content":"<p>My Department participates in the climate adaptation process through the steering committee for sectoral adaptation plans, which is chaired by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.

In accordance with the Government Decision of 12 April 2011, my predecessor commenced a process of seeking, on the Department&rsquo;s website, expressions of Interest from persons wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of this Department. This information has been used to inform decisions for such appointments, but I would stress that such invitations are designed to extend the range of suitable persons from which a Minister might make appointments, not to constrain it. While appointments are made by the relevant Minister, I would add that appointments to Boards also include nominations, provided for by statute, by Committees of the Oireachtas, worker directors and ex-officio positions. While the precise structure varies from body to body, in total this can amount to a significant proportion of the Board in certain instances.<br\/><br\/>All appointments are made in light of the applicable legislative requirements, objectives of the organisation and on the basis of appointees having the necessary competencies, expertise and experience to contribute effectively to the work of the particular boards.<br\/><br\/>In 2011 there were 31 applications received following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 3 appointments were made. In 2012 there were 37 applications received following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 5 appointments were made. In the current 2013\/2014 call for Expressions of Interest there have been 120 applications received to date following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 9 appointments were made.<br\/><br\/>There have been 114 appointments made to State Boards under the aegis of my Department in the period March 2011 to date. The percentage of these appointments filled from the Expressions of Interest received amounts to 15%. It should be noted that about 30% of the appointments made were either ex-officio appointments, reappointments, the appointment of worker directors chosen by election, or appointments made from nominations made by an Oireachtas Committee. <br\/><br\/>On 30 September, the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform announced further steps to strengthen the process of Board appointments and my Department will be liaising with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that procedures are in line with the new measures proposed. <br\/><br\/>The table lists all appointments to State Boards under the aegis of this Department since 9 March 2011.<table><tr><th>Body<\/th><th>Appointee<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>An Post<\/td><td>Mr Donal Connell CEO (ex officio) reappointed<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>Mr Christoph Mueller (Chairperson)Mr James Wrynn<br \/><br \/>Mr Paul Henry<br \/><br \/>Mr Noel Adamson (worker director)<br \/><br \/>Mr Patrick Compton (worker director reappointed)<br \/><br \/>Mr Thomas Devlin (worker director reappointed)<br \/><br \/>Mr William Mooney (worker director)<br \/><br \/>Ms Martina O&rsquo;Connell (worker director)<br \/><br \/>Mr William Scally<br \/><br \/>Ms Lorraine Tormey<br \/><br \/>*Mr Tom O&rsquo;Brien<br \/><br \/>Ms. Jennifer Loftus<br \/><br \/>Mr Ed Murray<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bord na M&oacute;na<\/td><td>Ms Denise Cronin<br \/><br \/>*Mr. John Horgan (appointed as member and later appointed as Chairperson) <br \/><br \/>Mr Gerard O&rsquo;Donoghue<br \/><br \/>Ms Elaine Treacy<br \/><br \/>Mr Barry Walsh<br \/><br \/>Mr Gabriel D&rsquo;Arcy (Director ex officio) reappointed<br \/><br \/>Mr John V Farrrelly<br \/><br \/>*Mr Denis Leonard<br \/><br \/>Mr Paschal Maher (elected employee member)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ervia (formerly Bord Gais Eireann)<\/td><td>Mr Finbarr Kennelly<br \/><br \/>Mr Michael McNicholas (CEO ex officio)<br \/><br \/>Ms Rose Hynes Chairperson (reappointed)<br \/><br \/>Ms Mari Hurley<br \/><br \/>Mr Joe O&rsquo;Flynn (SIPTU union representative)<br \/><br \/>Ms Jacqueline Hall<br \/><br \/>Mr Laurence Crowley (reappointed)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Broadcasting Authority of Ireland<\/td><td>Mr Seamus Martin<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>RTE<\/td><td>Mr Noel Curran (Director General) (reappointed)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EirGrid<\/td><td>Dr Gary Healy<br \/><br \/>*Ms Regina Moran<br \/><br \/>*Mr Liam O&rsquo;Halloran<br \/><br \/>Ms Bride Rosney<br \/><br \/>Ms Doireann Barry (staff representative)<br \/><br \/>Mr Fintan Slye (CEO ex officio)<br \/><br \/>Dr Joan Smyth (reappointed)<br \/><br \/>Mr Richard Sterling (reappointed)<br \/><br \/>Mr John O&rsquo;Connor (Chairperson)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ESB<\/td><td>Mr Lochlann Quinn (Chairman &ndash;

I am now working to implement this revised model and look forward to the guidelines which Minister Howlin will present in the coming weeks in that regard.<br\/><br\/><b><i>National Gallery of Ireland<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th>Board Appointments since 2 June 2011<\/th><th>Qualifications\/Experience of Appointees<\/th><th>Vacancies Advertised<\/th><th>Appointments made following from a publicly advertised process.<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Suzanne McDougald<\/td><td>Gallerist and Art Collector<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mary Keane<\/td><td>Deputy Director General of the Law Society of Ireland, responsible for the Society&rsquo;s Policy and Public Affairs function.<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Margaret Glynn<\/td><td>M.A. History of Art and Design U.

In the subsequent public consultation process, almost 1500 submissions were received and are currently under examination. This includes a submission received on behalf of the Committee representing turf cutters on the bog referred to.  In general, turf cutting and its associated drainage is damaging to the ecology and functioning of raised bogs and is incompatible with their conservation. For raised bog SACs, it will in most cases not be possible for the State to consent to further turf cutting, as the State is legally obliged to prevent such damage to these sites. There are, however, two sets of circumstances in which turf cutting could be consented to. These can be referred to as Article 6(3) consents (where it can be shown that cutting will not have an adverse effect on the SAC) and Article 6(4) consents (for imperative reasons of overriding public interest), under the EU Habitats Directive. <\/p><p>  The draft National Plan sets out the demanding tests which must be met before flexibility under the Directive could be sought. The final Plan will clarify these issues and whether the provisions of Article 6(4) could be applicable for any particular SAC within the broader context of the Plan, and seek to establish whether sufficient consensus can be achieved at a national level to make a successful case to the European Commission for flexibility on this basis. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that there have been 60 applications to my Department under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme in relation to the bog in question. 11 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation.
