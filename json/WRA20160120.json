However, the pace of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and employment growth has been such that the figures in the Glassdoor report are now out of date.  The most recent Quarterly National Household Survey - for Quarter 3 2015 - shows that 106,500 people were classified as part-time underemployed workers, compared to 124,300 in Quarter 3 2014.  The 2015 figures represent approximately 5% of the total number of people in employment, compared to 9% of total employment based on 2014 figures in the Glassdoor report.

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage are separate concepts. The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis.<\/p>  <p>  Making work pay continues to be a cornerstone of this Government&rsquo;s agenda and the establishment of the Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis in July last year is one of the key commitments in the Statement of Government Priorities agreed in July 2014.

My Department is responsible for controls on the export of these military items from Ireland. Under Irish law, military export licences must be sought in respect of the goods and technology, and any components thereof, listed in the Annex to the Control of Exports (Goods and Technology) Order, S.I. 216 of 2012 which reflects the EU Common Military List.<\/p>  <p>  The report for the period 2013 to 2014 provides information on the destination of military licences. In a small number of cases the licensed destination for military exports may not be the destination of final end-use. This can arise where, for example, a component is being exported to a systems integrator or manufacturer who will in turn export the final item to another destination. Due to a compiling error information on these cases was not included in the body of the report. When this oversight came to light steps were immediately taken to correct the omission. An information note on the destination of final end-use of military exports was published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the same time as the report. These destinations of final-end use included destinations such as New Zealand and Norway, as well as Saudi Arabia.<\/p>  <p>  Previous reports published by my Department included details of the destination of final end-use of military exports. Future reports will include these destinations in the body of the reports. <\/p>  <p>  Where the destination of final end-use differs from the licensed destination, my Department receives information on the ultimate end-use and end-user of the product and seeks a declaration that where the final product is being re-exported it will be done so under a licence issued by the national licensing authority.

Under this proposal, production and packaging will be transferred on a phased basis from the facility in Borrisoleigh.  Consequently, Clonmel will become the core manufacturing site for Bulmers and Magners cider, Tipperary Water and the company&rsquo;s range of niche premium beers and ciders.  In support of the proposal, the Group will invest in excess of &euro;10 million in enhancing packaging and logistics capability in Clonmel, creating 80 additional jobs, and designed to put Irish-based employment on a secure and competitive footing.

In addition, all the supports of the State will be made available.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with the company as it undertakes restructuring.

This system has applied to the newly unemployed since the introduction of the Intreo reforms over 2012-2014. In addition, the Department of Social Protection has commenced a process of re-engagement with those who are already long-term unemployed, a process that is now being sub-contracted to private providers of services under the JobPath initiative.<\/p>  <p>  One concern underlying the Recommendation is the situation in many Member States whereby a long-term unemployed person, who exhausts entitlement to unemployment benefit paid by the national employment service, moves on to a welfare payment administered by municipal and local authorities.

Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  The total reckonable contributions paid or credited are divided by the duration of the period from that date to pension age, and the average produced is a factor in the rate of entitlement.  For example, if someone entered insurable employment 45 years before pension age, and had a total of 1,800 reckonable contributions, their yearly average would be 40 contributions (i.e. 1,800 divided by 45).<\/p>  <p>  Under this yearly average system, the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  By disregarding these periods, the duration of the working life is reduced under the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, thereby making the yearly average higher, as total contributions are divided by a small number.  <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is expected to be in place until the system is changed to a total contributions approach, which is under consideration for introduction from 2020.  In this context, the deadline for applications to the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme has been extended on a number of occasions &ndash; most recently in 2013 (SI 596 of 2015 refers).  It was therefore decided that the period for which retrospective applications for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme be allowed be extended again, to allow further people make backdated claims to this scheme while the yearly average system is in place. <\/p>  <p>  On this occasion, given that the total contributions approach reform is scheduled to be in place by 2020, it was decided that the extension for applications is to 31 December 2020, for periods up to 31 December 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000063#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000063#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[2508\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000063#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to expedite an application by a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny under the carer's allowance scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1199","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer's allowance from the person concerned on 16 November 2015.

The Revenue Commissioners are processing fuel grant applications and my Department is making the payments to beneficiaries.<\/p><p>The Fuel Grant is paid at the same rate as the rates for repayment of excise duty on fuel.\u00a0Accordingly,\u00a0I have maintained the rate for petrol\u00a0at &euro;0.59 per litre, the rate for diesel at &euro;0.48 per litre, and the rate for liquefied petroleum gas at &euro;0.10 per litres.<\/p><p>This fuel grant maintains the\u00a0previous practice of paying the sum\u00a012 months\u00a0in arrears, so that the Revenue Commissions have begun processing applications on behalf of my Department from 1 January 2016. With the assistance\u00a0of the Revenue Commissioners, a number of improvements have been made to the administration of the Scheme. Beneficiaries\u00a0are now able to apply for the fuel grant online on the Revenue website through the 'myAccount' feature. Revenue will process the applications for my Department, and my Department shall make the payment directly to the beneficiaries bank or credit union account.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department and officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0are in regular contact with the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association, who represent many of the beneficiaries of the Scheme. Both organisations have been kept informed of developments as regards the fuel grant.<\/p><p>On 14 October 2015, my Department wrote\u00a0to beneficiaries of the Scheme informing them of the changes to the fuel grant, and informing them that they can logon to the 'myAccount' feature of the Revenue website from 1 January 2016 and claim the grant.\u00a0My Department also informed\u00a0beneficiaries that they may continue to receive the grant using\u00a0a paper form if required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000063#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000063#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[2424\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000063#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the background to the 3% stamp duty that applies to all non-life insurance policies; the amount that has been collected to date in respect of the stamp duty; the anticipated yield in 2016; how this money is spent; if he will ring-fence the funding for flood-related measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":137,"content":"<p>Section 125 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for a levy of 3% on the gross amount received by an insurer in the form of premiums paid in respect of non-life policies covering risks which are located in the State.\u00a0 This levy applies to most non-life insurance premiums with the exception of re-insurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance, export credit insurance and certain dental insurance contracts.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The levy was originally introduced in 1982 at a rate of 1% of chargeable premiums.

This was at the end of a period of unprecedented levels of public capital funding that were directed towards addressing long-standing infrastructural deficits.  While the severe fiscal challenges certainly contributed to the subsequent reductions in capital investment following this period, there is also wide recognition that a considerable amount of Ireland's infrastructural deficits and bottlenecks, particularly across the roads network, had been largely addressed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government's Capital\u00a0Plan\u00a0\"Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021\" announced an Exchequer capital spend of &euro;27 billion over a six year period. \u00a0If we add investment from the wider semi-state sector, and PPPs, total state backed investment amounts to &euro;42 billion over the period.  For Ireland, GNP is a better indicator for the size of the Economy that GDP, and at the time of publication of the capital plan,\u00a0state-backed capital investment\u00a0constituted a forecast\u00a0average of 3.5% of GNP per annum over the relevant period.

They can also provide funding for projects that meet certain criteria, in certain circumstances, and other non-financial supports. For example, with regard to the financial supports available, it should be noted that the LEOs generally grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector which over time can develop into strong export entities. However, there are other non-financial supports available, such as mentoring and training, and the LEO staff can advise as to which supports would be most appropriate. <\/p><p>In addition, any business can use the LEOs to access finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI), which offers loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises (employing less than 10 people) with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.

These include the high-quality of education and skills development, our innovation ecosystem, the ease of doing business here and our openness to trade, along with our overall competitiveness in terms of costs and taxation. <\/p><p>All these factors helped IDA Ireland achieve record results in 2015, with its client companies creating 18,983 new jobs across a range of sectors. Every region of Ireland posted net employment gains and 213 new investments in Ireland were made during the course of the year, of which 94 came from new names. Many large multinationals also publicly announced investment plans in Ireland, including Apple, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Pramerica, Northern Trust, Facebook, Vodafone, SAS, Google, ABEC Inc, and Zalando.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding these record numbers, global competition for FDI - whether from EU or non-EU countries - remains intense.  That is why the agency is constantly monitoring competitor locations and the value propositions they offer to potential mobile investment.<\/p><p>More broadly, our work in continuing to attract international investment in Ireland will be guided by both my Department&rsquo;s Policy Statement on Foreign Direct Investment and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s own five-year strategy <i>&ldquo;Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo;. <\/i>The IDA Strategy details both how the Agency will broaden its target sectors further and seek new markets over the next five years.

This requires us to have sharp and adaptable businesses in a wide variety of sectors which are in a position to win export sales, thus creating jobs in Ireland. In order to ensure that all sectors of the economy continue to compete effectively in European and global markets, continued supports must be made available to overcome market failures associated with companies undertaking R&amp;D.  Enterprise Ireland is committed to improving the innovative capability of Irish industry in order to help companies differentiate themselves in global markets in order to win sales and increase employment in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland will continue to support science, technology and innovation in Irish companies in three main ways: firstly by promoting market-led innovation and R&amp;D in manufacturing and services companies, secondly by supporting effective and flexible collaborations between companies and higher level researchers, and thirdly by capitalising on the research investment made by the HEA and SFI by taking commercially useful technology on to the market. Under each of these pillars Enterprise Ireland operates a suite of flexible supports aimed at helping companies and higher level researchers to work together and to innovate in commercially beneficial ways. <\/p>  <p>  Every year, hundreds of companies benefit from Enterprise Ireland Innovation supports. These range from &euro;5,000 Innovation Vouchers to help small companies source innovative solutions from higher level research groups, to larger Innovation Partnerships, to in-company R&amp;D funding. Enterprise Ireland facilitates many companies to work closely with higher education institutions in order to collaborate on high value R&amp;D projects. <\/p>  <p>  Over 400 companies per annum will engage in multiparty collaborative research initiatives like Technology Centres where groups of companies come together to define a commercially advantageous research agenda which higher education institutions deliver on. Over 350 companies will be supported per annum via specialised incubation facilities on third level campuses. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, over 130 companies a year will receive commercially valuable technologies from higher level research institutions; these deals are in many cases based on Enterprise Ireland commercialisation funding and facilitated by Enterprise Ireland funded Technology Transfer Offices in Universities and Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI). On top of these direct supports, Enterprise Ireland clients will continue to benefit from ongoing and consistent technical, commercial and innovation soft support from Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s network of Development Advisers and Technologists. <\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Innovation 2020: Excellence Talent Impact&rsquo;, launched in December 2015, is Ireland&rsquo;s five-year strategy for research and development, science and technology. The strategy builds on the significant successes delivered by the Government&rsquo;s science strategy over the past decade, which has seen Ireland dramatically improve its performance globally in this area. Through &lsquo;Innovation 2020&rsquo;, our vision for Ireland is to become a Global Innovation Leader driving a strong sustainable economy. In it, we set out the roadmap to deliver on this vision, focusing on excellence, talent and impact in innovation and research. Our goals, as articulated in the new strategy, include having an internationally competitive research system which acts as a magnet and catalyst for talent and industry and also having a strong innovative enterprise base, growing employment, sales and exports. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2016 highlights that measures to promote innovation are an important component of Ireland&rsquo;s research, development and innovation (RDI) systems. Innovation support makes a critical contribution to enterprise policy, and to the goal of developing a competitive national economy, through the stimulus given by innovation to high value economic activities and jobs. By encouraging the development of new economic activities, RDI policy measures strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantage and build potential new areas of economic activity. The impacts of innovation and research include increased competitiveness, maintaining high-value jobs and attracting foreign direct investment, developing our human capital and ensuring a culture of evidence-based policy, processes and practices in the public and private sectors. <\/p>  <p>  Employment in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland increased by a net 10,169 jobs in 2015, with 64% of new jobs created outside of Dublin. This represents a high level of job growth and is a positive indication of a productive indigenous enterprise sector where investment in science, technology and innovation continues to play a key role. Similarly, IDA Ireland saw significant employment growth once again in 2015, with 11,833 net new jobs and the number of investments secured rising to 213 from 197 in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000068#WRL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000068#WRL01250"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[2522\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000068#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he is satisfied with the competitiveness of the industrial cost base; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance since 2011 has been central to securing the recovery in economic growth and employment. Improved competitiveness has made Irish firms more cost competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location in which firms can locate and expand their operations.  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs, which is co-ordinated and developed by my Department since 2012, has set out a comprehensive set of measures to improve our competitiveness performance. Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years. As a result of our concerted efforts to improve competitiveness, Ireland&rsquo;s relative international competitiveness as measured by a range of international indices has improved since 2012. Ireland moved from 24th to 16th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, from 29th to 24th in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and 17th out of 189 countries, up two places on last year as assessed by the World Bank. The Bank&rsquo;s latest report shows Ireland is now ranked 4th in the euro area in terms of ease of doing business.<\/p>  <p>  Cost competitiveness is an important aspect of Ireland's overall competitiveness and we continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis. The NCC&rsquo;s Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report published in April 2015 benchmarks key business costs across over 50 indicators and focuses on areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors, and on costs that are largely domestically determined.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 report concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, energy, water, waste, communications and business services. The report finds that while relative cost competitiveness is improving (i.e. although costs are increasing, they are increasing at a slower rate than in many of our competitors), this improvement is largely being driven by external factors beyond the control of domestic policymakers. In particular, a weak euro exchange rate, low ECB interest rates, and low international fuel prices have all combined to improve Irish cost competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  The NCC report concludes that Ireland&rsquo;s industrial cost base has improved but pressure points are emerging in labour, property and business service costs. We must therefore focus intensely on reducing costs that are out of line with those in competitor countries. There is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness. Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are essential. Improving productivity performance is also key. <\/p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness, therefore, remains a key economic priority for Government. We will continue to progress actions that improve Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position, though for example, the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 which contains a range of actions to making it easier for firms to conduct business in Ireland and to reduce costs across a range of business inputs.<\/p>  <p>  The immediate challenge is to sustain the strong recovery underway by remaining competitive. While growth prospects for the Irish economy are strong, we must continue to deliver aggressively the structural reforms required to support competitiveness, productivity and growth. An updated Costs report is currently being compiled by the NCC and will be available for consideration in Q2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000068#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":223,"content":"<p>Question No. 86 answered with Question No. 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000069#WRM00300"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[2524\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000069#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is satisfied that the small indigenous business sector continues to have ready access to various investment incentives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>Firstly, I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the cross-Government initiative on supports to small business.

It is an ambitious strategy, with the objective of delivering growth over the next decade that is sustainable, led by strong export performance, builds on our sectoral strengths, and that is underpinned by innovation, productivity, cost effectiveness and competitiveness. We aim to build resilience into our economy so that we do not suffer again as we have done in the past number of years.   Earlier this week we launched the fifth Action Plan for Jobs. A key objective of the Action Plan for Jobs process has been to rebuild our economy based on enterprise and entrepreneurship, talent, innovation and exports and provide a solid foundation for future growth. Irish industry has to been to the forefront of the economic recovery, with our enterprises and entrepreneurs innovating, developing and improving their products and services to meet the needs of customers in markets across the globe<\/p>  <p>  The 2016 Plan is the first in a new phase of the Action Plan for Jobs process, after the original target of 100,000 extra jobs by 2016 was achieved last year, 21 months ahead of schedule. Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in Q1 2012, 135,800 more people are at work. The unemployment rate has fallen below nine per cent for the first time since 2008, down from a high of 15.1 per cent in early 2012 to 8.8 per cent in December 2015.<\/p>  <p>  We set a target in 2012 to increase employment by 100,000 by 2016. We achieved that ambitious target and have now exceeded it, with employment growing and unemployment reducing in every region. We want to go further and to replace all the jobs lost during the recession and to realise sustainable full employment over the longer term. Enterprise 2025 sets out a clear statement of ambition, including that we will have 2.18 million people at work by 2020, with the unemployment rate down to 6 percent and that the unemployment in all regions not more than one percent above the national average. <\/p>  <p>  Achieving this objective at regional level will require a renewed focus on building on the strengths of each region to develop the attractive and competitive environments for business to start, grow and succeed on international markets and to attract inward investment. We started the process of rebuilding the capacity of the regions with the launch of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs this year. In the case of seven of the regions for which we have published Regional Plans, we are now firmly moving into the implementation phase of the process and I met with the enterprise champions for each of the regions last week in Athlone.   <\/p>  <p>  Our objective is to establish vibrant ecosystems for entrepreneurship, to stimulate clusters of scale and international visibility in areas of strength and to ensure that Ireland and our regions continue to be the best places to succeed in business. <\/p>  <p>  Through a partnership approach, with enterprise, representative bodies, the enterprise development agencies, Local Enterprise Offices and others, and based on a framework of measurable impacts, we will deliver a step change in enterprise performance and resilience will see a significant increase in Irish owned companies of scale, contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for innovation in international markets. The enterprise agencies and the LEOs will use their budgets in the optimal way to deliver on the potential for enterprise growth in the regions. In addition, earlier this year, we announced additional funding to support implementation of the regional Action Plans of &euro;250m over the coming years. This comprises &euro;150m of investment by IDA Ireland in advanced property solutions in the regions and &euro;100m in competitive funding through Enterprise Ireland to support community enterprise initiatives, innovative initiatives by the Local Enterprise Offices and to support regional collaborative and clustering initiatives by public and private sector bodies and enterprises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000069#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000069#WRM00900"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[2526\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000069#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which the requisite infrastructure for the development of the national economy will be met throughout the regions; if there is room for improvement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>The availability of competitively priced world class infrastructure (energy, telecoms, transport, waste and water) and related services is critical to support economic growth and enterprise development. The recent economic recovery, return to growth, and the creation of more than 135,800 jobs since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched, have all been supported by Ireland&rsquo;s national economic infrastructure.<\/p><p>The competitiveness of that economic infrastructure is assessed by the National Competitiveness Council (NCC). As noted by the NCC, there was a significant reduction in public capital expenditure over the course of the economic downturn, from approximately &euro;9 billion in 2008 to &euro;3.4billion in 2013, although weaker demand for infrastructural services (e.g., reduced road traffic, and declines in energy demand) partially mitigated the impact of this reduction. The Council state that a range of international benchmarks, mostly qualitative in nature, are available comparing the stock and quality of infrastructure in Ireland against our key competitors. In terms of the perceptions about the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure vis-&agrave;-vis other countries Ireland&rsquo;s score has improved since 2010, but perceptions of quality in Ireland still lag the OECD average and are well behind leading performers. <\/p><p>The NCC believes that there is now a need to increase public capital expenditure, and that public investment in infrastructure should be prioritised and targeted at those areas that can have the greatest positive impact upon Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.<\/p><p>In September 2015, the Government published <i>Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021,<\/i>which presents the Government&rsquo;s new &euro;42 billion framework for infrastructure investment in Ireland over the period to 2021. The Capital Plan reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting strong and sustainable economic growth and raising welfare and living standards for all, and in all regions.  <\/p><p>As the Capital Plan states, public investment will have a positive impact on job creation across the country and in almost every sector of the economy. It will serve to underpin the Government&rsquo;s commitment to seeing full employment of 2.18 million people by 2020 as set out in Action Plan for Jobs 2016. Investment in infrastructure, such as transport and communication networks, energy and water, is an important enabler of economic growth and the wider State sector, including the commercial State-bodies, has an important role to play in these areas. In addition, significant investments are planned to support enterprise and innovation. IDA Ireland has reported the highest level of employment in its client companies in its 67 year history. Total employment at overseas companies now stands at 187,056 people, the highest level on record. Enterprise Ireland has reported that total employment in its client companies has reached 192,223 - a record high for the agency. Investment in enterprise and innovation included in the Capital Plan will continue to support and grow the numbers employed in these foreign-owned and indigenous firms. Further, over the six years of the Capital Plan, it is estimated that around 45,000 construction jobs will be sustained through the Exchequer investments in physical infrastructure alone.<\/p><p>Regarding the regions, earlier this month the Government launched the seventh of eight regional jobs plans to be published, as part of a new &euro;250 million regional jobs strategy.

A review of the Skills Bulletin for each of the four years 2012-2015 highlights the following key trends:<\/p>  <p>  -  There are skills shortages for Professionals and Associate Professionals across sectors in the areas of ICT, Engineering and Science (predominantly in the biopharmaceutical, medical devices and food processing sectors).<\/p>  <p>  -  The shortage of ICT talent is potentially significant for a number of sectors such as Software, Data Analytics, Financial Services, Distribution).<\/p>  <p>  -  There are also Professionals skills shortages in specific sectors such as Financial Services, Health (medical practitioners and nurses) and Construction (surveyors) - the latter only beginning to exhibit a skills shortage in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  -  As the economy has picked up, the Freight Transport, Distribution &amp;amp; Logistics sector has begun to exhibit skills shortages.<\/p>  <p>  -  Multilingual skills were identified for Associate Professionals in ICT and Sales &amp;amp; Marketing, and for Administrative staff in Financial Services and Freight Transport, Distribution &amp;amp; Logistics. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, the greatest skills demand is for Professionals, Associate Professionals and people with multilingual skills.<\/p>  <p>  The EGFSN also publishes detailed reports on the future skills needs of particular sectors, with forecasts of the demand for specific occupations.

I do note however that 2015 was a relatively positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average nearly 8% higher compared to 2014.    <\/p>  <p>  The primary determinant of prices in any market is the relationship between supply and demand.  Price variations in different EU beef markets reflect prevailing conditions in those markets. With regard to the price differential between Irish and UK cattle, a number of factors have been identified to explain why Irish-born cattle command lower prices than their British equivalents. These include a British consumer preference for indigenous product as well as additional transport and processing costs in supplying that market.  Last year, Ireland exported approximately 272,000 tonnes of beef, worth in the region of &euro;1.1 billion to the UK.  This constituted 54% of the volume and 52% of the value of Irish beef exports and as such, the UK is overwhelmingly Ireland&rsquo;s most important export market. <\/p>  <p>  I attach substantial importance to the live export trade and my Department has been very proactive during my time as Minister in facilitating both the cross-border live trade and shipments of animals overseas.  Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demand for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for cattle farmers in Ireland.  It is expected that 2016 will see an increase in the export of live cattle.  Improving economic situations in Italy and Spain are expected to boost demand for Irish cattle and general demand for calves for veal are expected to remain strong. <\/p>  <p>  Last year, live exports to all markets amounted to almost 180,000 head.  Geopolitical instability in North Africa, a new veterinary regime in relation to IBR in Belgium and increased domestic prices lead to a reduction in live exports.  Exports to Northern Ireland, the Netherlands and France rose, while exports to Belgium, Italy, Spain and Britain declined.  Bord Bia has forecast that live exports to Italy and Spain, two traditional live export destinations, should increase in 2016 on foot on economic recovery in those economies and disease outbreaks in certain supplier regions.   <\/p>  <p>  There are currently three dedicated and three roll on-roll off vessels approved for the carriage of livestock by sea form Irish ports. Three more vessels are currently at various stages of the process for similar approval. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000070#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Competition and Consumer Protection Commission","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000070#WRN00750"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[2417\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000070#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the proposed acquisition by the ABP food group of 50% of the Slaney and Irish Country Meats business; if he will make a submission to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>The State, through the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, has an existing and well established infrastructure for oversight of competition matters and for dealing with allegations of anti-competitive practices or abuse of a dominant position.

I want to make it quite clear from the outset that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  People are assessed for eligibility for Medical Cards, disability or carers allowance individually.  The assessment takes into account their family income and individual needs rather than a specific diagnosis.<\/p><p>It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the same time that they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughters condition.  The young women and their families should seek medical advice from their family doctor in the normal manner and be guided by this advice in accessing appropriate services including specialist opinion where necessary.<\/p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.  <\/p><p>No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.  The European Medicines Agency has recently advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Therefore healthcare professionals should continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.<\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  <\/p><p>The HPV vaccine, which was introduced in 2010, protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  As you are aware the immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the NIAC.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  <\/p><p>The introduction of new vaccines is based on the expert advice of the NIAC.  Decisions on the supply of vaccines into the market are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day. <\/p><p>Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000074#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000074#WRR00750"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[2386\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000074#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the progress on the Autism Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>In March 2013, a Private Members Bill entitled the Autism Bill 2012 was debated and passed Second Stage in the Dail.

Although the needs of people with autism have received some recognition in recent years, the Bill is seen as contributing to a more enlightened and educated public debate.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Autism Bill, it is important to note that the Government is already committed under the National Disability Strategy (NDS) to ensuring that people with autism are empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society. The NDS is driven by this basic but fundamentally important objective and is the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, has been of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD as part of the National Disability Strategy which covers a wide range of policy areas and Government Departments and agencies, so that we can be sure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions.  The proposed approach was also discussed with the National Disability Strategy Steering Group. <\/p>  <p>  I understand from the NDA that a programme of specific measures has now been agreed for delivery by the relevant Government Departments and agencies, including specific actions to be delivered by the NDA.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice &amp;amp; Equality is currently preparing a revised National Disability Inclusion Strategy with a view to having it in place by early 2016 following a wide consultation with interested parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000074#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Administration","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000074#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[2391\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000074#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied with the operation of the fair deal scheme and if improvements could be made by linking in all additional costs to the original agreed settlement, as at present many persons are subject to additional costs for nursing home care after agreeing to the original arrangement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) or Fair Deal as it is commonly referred to, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term nursing home care.

The HSE National Consent Policy explains that, under Irish law, a family member cannot give or refuse consent to a health or social care service on behalf of an adult patient who lacks capacity, unless the family member has a specific legal authority to do so.  Such legal authority includes if the patient has been made a Ward of Court or is the subject of an enduring power of attorney which covers the decision in question.  <\/p><p>In making a decision about the care and treatment of a person who lacks capacity, a health and social care professional must determine what treatment or intervention is in the best interest of the patient, with reference to the patient's values and preferences if known.  <\/p><p>While family members who do not have a specific legal authority to give or refuse consent cannot make decisions regarding the patient's treatment, the National Consent Policy advises that it may be helpful for the health and social care professional to involve family members in the decision-making process to provide insight into the patent's previously expressed views and preferences and to outline what they believe the patient would have wanted.<\/p><p>The HSE's National Consent Policy may be found at the following link:  <\/p><p>The recently enacted Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will enable a person (while he or she still has capacity) to prepare an advance healthcare directive in relation to his or her future treatment, which could also include appointing a designated healthcare representative.

Where a person lacks capacity, the Act provides that the Court may make certain decisions directly on that person's behalf or appoint a decision-making representative to make such decisions.

This will include GPs, patients, hospital staff, elected representatives, all local support services and the general public.<\/p>  <p>  Any change to services at Portlaoise Hospital, will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner and will take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to your specific query on the status of additional staff, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The Government follows closely reports of human rights violations against Falun Gong practitioners. Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 30 November &ndash; 1 December 2015 and provided the EU with the opportunity to have a detailed exchange of views on a wide range of human rights issues with China.  The EU raised a number of issues including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and freedom of religion or belief.  In 2013, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade held a series of meetings with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association and human rights lawyers.  During these meetings the Irish Falun Dafa Association discussed ways in which human rights issues are raised with Chinese authorities by both Ireland and the EU.  However, it should be noted that the Chinese Government denies accusations of human rights abuses against those who practice Falun Gong.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000077#WRU01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000078#WRV00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tionscadail T&oacute;g&aacute;la Scoileanna","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000078#WRV00150"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[2372\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000078#WRV00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"c&eacute;n uair a chuirfear t&uacute;s le foirgneamh &uacute;r a chur ar f&aacute;il i nGaelscoil na gCeithre M&aacute;istr&iacute;, D&uacute;n na nGall; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1000","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p>Mar is eol don Teachta, t&aacute; an tionscadal maidir le foirgneamh nua scoile a chur ar f&aacute;il, don scoil d&aacute; dtagra&iacute;tear, san &aacute;ireamh sa Chl&aacute;r T&oacute;g&aacute;la 6 Bliana a d'fh&oacute;gair m&eacute; ar 17&uacute; Samhain seo caite, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; liostaithe le dul ar aghaidh chun tairisceana agus t&oacute;g&aacute;la sa tr&eacute;imhse 2019-21.

It would not therefore be appropriate to adopt it as a mandatory standard having regard to the principles of fair competition enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Directive 2010\/31\/EU on the energy performance of buildings requires EU Member States to ensure that all new buildings (including dwellings) will be nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2020. The Directive broadly defines a &lsquo;nearly zero-energy building&rsquo; as a building with a high energy performance where the very low amount of energy required should, to a very significant extent, be met by energy from renewable sources, including renewable energy produced onsite or nearby. The Directive also requires each Member State in setting its energy performance standards to undertake a study every five years on the lifecycle cost of the representative energy performance solutions available within its economy and to ensure that the regulated requirements are set within the range of most cost optimal solutions. In this context, Ireland has been making significant progress in terms of improving the energy performance of dwellings. Ireland&rsquo;s arrangements for meeting it nearly zero energy buildings obligations are set out in the plan <i>Towards Nearly Zero Energy Buildings in Ireland &ndash; Planning for 2020 and Beyond (November 2012)<\/i>which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following weblink:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>The required cost optimal studies, including the lifecycle costing calculations which take account of energy savings for a period of 30 years, for nearly zero energy dwellings, were commissioned by my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in 2013 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following weblink:.<\/p><p>In the case of dwellings, the specified Nearly Zero Energy obligation is such that the regulated energy load (i.e. energy used for space heating, water heating, fixed lighting and ventilation) in a typical dwelling will be 45 kWh\/m2\/annum, a very significant proportion of which will come from renewable energy sources. Currently, a typical dwelling built to comply with the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011 will have a regulated energy load which should not exceed 59 kWh\/m2\/annum. Clearly, therefore, one further upgrade of Part L of the Building Regulations will be necessary in advance of 2020 in order to ensure that Ireland meets its nearly zero energy obligation for dwellings by 2020.<\/p><p>In relation to international best practice, it is worth noting that Ireland&rsquo;s energy performance standard for dwellings under Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011 is recognised by the Global Building Performance Network as being among the leading statutory standards in the world, as may be seen from the comparison published on the Network&rsquo;s website at the following weblink:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>All changes to building regulations are preceded by a comprehensive public consultation process which includes the publication of a rigorous regulatory impact assessment outlining the significant implications, including the cost implications of the proposed changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000081#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000082#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[2483\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000082#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when Westmeath County Council and Longford County Council will receive their budget allocation under the housing adaptation grant scheme and the housing aid for the elderly for 2016.

These works, as has been publicly stated on a number of occasions, will return Nos. 14-17 Moore Street to their 1916 condition, with all original features preserved.<\/p>  <p>  The works are being carried out by Lissadell Construction, who are conservation and heritage experts. Other projects completed by Lissadell include the National Concert Hall, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and Kilmainham Gaol.<\/p>  <p>  The works are being overseen by expert conservation architects and by a Steering Committee which includes senior representatives\/experts from my own Department, the Office of Public Works, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland and Dublin City Council. <\/p>  <p>  The works are also being monitored by the Chief Archaeologist and staff at my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service (NMS).  The NMS is also monitoring compliance with the undertaking given to the High Court in relation to the ongoing works.<\/p>  <p>  My objective is to restore these four buildings to their 1916 state and allow the Irish public to see the marks of the Easter Rising. The four houses - Nos 14, 15, 16 and 17 - are the only houses in the terrace whose exteriors and interiors pre-date 1916 and which bear the scars and evidence of the presence of the men and women of 1916.  In a tribute befitting their sacrifice, the Government is making a significant investment in a sensitive restoration of that property to render it into a national monument of which the Irish people can be proud.<\/p>  <p>  Number 18, in ruins at the time of the Easter Rising, was rebuilt in the 1920s and has no evidence of the presence of the 1916 leaders.  Number 13 was completely rebuilt in the 1960s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012000083#WRAA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"973"}]
