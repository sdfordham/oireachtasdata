Over the 2015 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and a further twenty-seven Ministers and Ministers of State undertook extensive programmes of engagements in a total of 27 different countries, supported by the Embassy network.  Of the 29 separate itineraries for Ministerial office-holders, 25 were in markets identified as &ldquo;Priority&rdquo; or &ldquo;Exploratory and High Potential&rdquo; under the 2014 Review of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. The choice of locations also reflected the recent expansion of the Embassy network, diaspora hubs, and Ireland&rsquo;s work in development cooperation.  The locations included the main centres of global business media coverage, which are critical to conveying Ireland&rsquo;s message of economic recovery.  As in previous years, North America was a particular focus of the visits, reflecting strong diaspora and trade and investment links.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade leads on the coordination of the Ministerial itineraries, and each year coordinates a set of key economic and related messages for dissemination at events overseas. The Embassy network is responsible for management of individual programmes on the ground, working closely with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. As such, Ministerial itineraries are designed to further our national objectives overseas in a highly co-ordinated, visible and effective way.   The value of Ministerial visits is incontrovertible, allowing us to leverage the unique opportunities provided by the international profile of our national day, which is unrivalled by any other country in the world.  The presence of a Ministerial office-holder from Ireland helps to secure bilateral meetings at the highest levels of Government to discuss issues of mutual concern; helps to secure attendance by senior executives of foreign companies at trade and investment-related meetings and events; helps to secure coverage of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery by global and local media organisations; and helps to promote Ireland as a destination for tourism and international education.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the &euro;5 million figure for 2014, this figure comes from the &ldquo;Supporting Irish Exporters Section&rdquo; of the report &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Economic Diplomacy in Action: St Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2014&rdquo;, published by the Department in April 2014.  This report was compiled on the basis of reporting by the Embassy network, in consultation with the promotional State agencies, and the figure represented an estimate of new business won in the immediate aftermath of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period. My Department is currently compiling a report on St Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2015, and this will be published shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made to ensure that costs related to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day itineraries are kept to a minimum. In 2014, the total cost of all Ministerial travel was &euro;281,739.  Again in 2015, clear instructions were issued for all Ministerial visits to be undertaken in the most cost-efficient way.  The full final cost is not yet available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100054#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100054#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[15264\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100054#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the further progress that has been made on regularising the status of the undocumented Irish in the United States of America; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p><b>This is a repeat of my answer to Question No. 181<\/b><\/p><p>Achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US is a priority for the Government in our contacts with the United States.

Firstly to see this individual released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland, and secondly to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. The considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by me and my officials in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests.It is important to bear in mind the role of the Irish Government where citizens are imprisoned abroad. Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.  The decision to release this individual either on bail or on any other basis, will be a decision that is made solely by the Egyptian authorities.<\/p><p>Since this citizen was originally detained in August 2013, I, and officials in my Department including our Embassy in Cairo, have raised this case with the Egyptian authorities regularly and consistently.  In addition, he has received consular visits from Embassy official on 37 occasions.  I can confirm that the Irish Government has formally supported both the application by this citizen&rsquo;s lawyers for his release and return to Ireland under the November Presidential decree, and the more recent application for his release on bail.  Our official support for this citizen&rsquo;s release has been duly communicated to the Egyptian authorities in formal diplomatic notes that have been included in the documentation submitted to the court and the authorities by his lawyer.<\/p><p>I have spoken to my Egyptian counterpart on numerous occasions, both in person and on the telephone.

I also took the opportunity to highlight key humanitarian concerns &ndash; including this individual&rsquo;s youth, his absence from his studies and the length of time in detention without conviction.<\/i><\/p><p>The individual&rsquo;s trial has started, with the next hearing scheduled for 26 April.

Given that the trial has now commenced and a formal petition for his release on bail is currently being considered by the Egyptian courts, my Department must exercise restraint in its public comment.

There are a number of well-documented reasons for this, not least the key role the EU and the common market play in sustaining the strong British-Irish trading relationship.  Our joint presence within the Union is also especially beneficial to the people of Northern Ireland and cross-border cooperation.  Our focus is therefore on keeping the UK within the EU and we have made this very clear to our British and our European partners, both in public and in private.<\/p>  <p>  I outlined the Government&rsquo;s position clearly in a speech to the European Council on Foreign Relations in London last November and I had the opportunity to discuss our views in further detail with my British counterpart, Philip Hammond, at a meeting in Dublin the following month.  This Government acknowledges that the UK has some legitimate concerns about the future direction of the EU and we will be open and sympathetic to considering British proposals, if and when they are presented, on improving the functioning of the Union.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that a British departure from the European Union could have serious and potentially adverse consequences for Ireland.  That is why the Government is monitoring developments extremely carefully.  The Department of the Taoiseach is leading our work in this area and is coordinating ongoing efforts across Government to ensure that Ireland is best prepared for any scenario that could arise.  The Department of Finance is also examining relevant issues and has commissioned a report to improve our understanding of the macro-economic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of our EU membership.<\/p>  <p>  My own Department, given its responsibility for Foreign Affairs and Trade, is naturally closely involved in this process.

It also made three other recommendations, detailed below, to which I assume the Deputy is referring.  The Fourth Report was debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 18 December 2014 and the script circulated in the D&aacute;il that day by the Minister of State with special responsibility for Rural Economic Development and Rural Transport setting out the Government&rsquo;s response is available on the website of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p>  <p>  The three items referred to above, on which the Convention recommended that referendums be held, and the Government&rsquo;s response on each, are as follows. <\/p>  <p>  The Convention recommended that there should be a referendum to permit the appointment of non-Oireachtas members as Ministers. However, as the House will be aware, the Constitution already allows the Taoiseach to nominate as Ministers up to two people who have not been elected to the Oireachtas but have been nominated to the Seanad.\u00a0 This provision enables the thrust of the Convention&rsquo;s recommendation to be met without the need for a referendum.  Taoisigh have availed of this facility only twice since 1937, in each case appointing one person as Minister.\u00a0 The holding of a referendum to widen the scope of an option that already exists but has very rarely been used, and never to the full, would be very hard to justify.<\/p>  <p>  The Convention also recommended a referendum to require D&aacute;il members to resign their D&aacute;il seats on appointment to Ministerial office.  However, proposing a referendum to amend the Constitution to this effect would be a major change from the current Constitutional arrangement whereby members of the Government sit in the Oireachtas. <\/p>  <p>  It would be difficult to propose such a referendum without making provision for who would succeed to the vacant seats and to secure the objective of freeing Ministers from constituency work.  However, as regards filling the vacant seats, the Convention had not favoured a list system\u00a0when considering the D&aacute;il electoral system; and as regards freeing Ministers from constituency work, the Convention did not recommend automatic re-election of Ministers at the next general election.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Convention recommended providing a right for citizens to petition on influencing the legislative agenda and to petition for referendums.  However, referendums are already relatively common in Ireland and there is nothing to prevent citizens presenting petitions.  Also, the Government has already substantially opened up the legislative process to citizens both via the work of the Convention itself and with the various packages of D&aacute;il reform introduced since 2011.  For example, a Public Service Oversight and Petitions Committee, chaired by a member of the Opposition, was established in 2011. \u00a0As part of its remit, the Committee receives and considers public petitions submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Committee also engages with the Ombudsman and other oversight bodies.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in 2011 the Government introduced a system of pre-legislative review before Oireachtas Committees.  In 2013 this was expanded to become a pre-legislative stage before the relevant Oireachtas Committee as a requirement for non-emergency legislation generally.  This allows for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public directly in the law making process.  The Committee can consult with citizens with expertise in the area, civic society groups and other interested groups; crucially, such consultation takes place before the legislation is drafted.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will however bear in mind these recommendations of the Convention when the latest package of D&aacute;il reform, and its success in opening up the legislative process, is being reviewed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100056#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100056#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[14003\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100056#WRD01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding unemployment figures.","asker":"1182","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>The Deputy requested the following details-<\/p><p>Regarding the current unemployment figures, can you advise how\u00a0many people are currently on the various back to work\/further education schemes?

These reforms are being phased in and include changes to allow more public involvement in the law making process:<\/p><p>- A Pre-Legislative Stage before an Oireachtas Committee is now a general requirement for non-emergency legislation.  A Minister who does not bring a Bill to Committee for Pre-Legislative Stage is required to explain that decision to the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>- The new Pre-Legislative Stage allows for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law making.  The Committee can consult with experts and civic society groups; crucially, this takes place before the legislation is drafted.<\/p><p>-Where there has been a Pre-Legislative Stage, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee has an opportunity to outline the Committee's work to the members of the D&aacute;il during the Second Stage debate after the Minister and main opposition spokespeople have spoken on the Bill<\/p><p>- By 28 February 2015, Oireachtas Committees had completed 39 Pre&ndash;Legislative Stages resulting in 37 Reports and two letters being sent to sponsoring Ministers.  <\/p><p>In addition, each year the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will address the D&aacute;il setting out the Government&rsquo;s annual priorities, with Ministers setting out their Department&rsquo;s plans.<\/p><p>The role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget process has also been expanded.<\/p><p>As a result of a set of reforms introduced to reduce the use of the guillotine, only three Bills were guillotined in the D&aacute;il in 2014, down from 12 in 2013 and 19 in 2010.  This has been achieved by reforms including a reduction in the number of Legislative Programmes to two per year increasing the time available for legislative debate in the D&aacute;il by increasing the total number of sitting days, extending the length of sitting days and starting at 9.30 am on Wednesday and Thursdays. <\/p><p>The way legislation is debated in the Chamber has been improved:<\/p><p>- At First Stage the proposer of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill now has five minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il and explain the reasons for proposing it.<\/p><p>- Where proposed legislation has been the subject of Pre-Legislative Scrutiny, at Second Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee which considered the Bill at Pre-Legislative Stage has a speaking slot, of the same length as that of the Minister and Opposition Spokespeople, to report to the D&aacute;il on the Committee's findings.<\/p><p>- At the end of the Second Stage debate, 45 minutes may be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies, chosen by the Ceann Comhairle, who have previously spoken. <\/p><p>The number of Friday sittings has been expanded and the D&aacute;il now sits every second Friday to debate Private Members' Bills and Committee Reports selected using a lottery system.  The new Friday sittings also allow Committees, for the first time, to seek directly to have their own reports debated in the D&aacute;il.  This has encouraged a rapid growth in the number of Bills introduced by Deputies, from 14 published in 2010 to 53 published in 2014.  82 Private Member's Bills were debated in the four years to 6 March 2015, compared to 16 debated in the 30th D&aacute;il, and 21 Committee Reports have been debated, compared to nine debated in the 30th D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>The system of Topical Issues now requires the Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department to reply; if this is not the case, the Deputy who raised the issue can have it deferred until a Minister or Minister of State from that Department is available.<\/p><p>The time allocated to Oral Parliamentary Questions to Ministers has been standardised to 75 minutes. An ordinary Oral Question will be answered only if the Deputy tabling the Question is in the Chamber when it is reached and the Deputy is given a brief period, of 30 seconds, to outline the question. <\/p><p>The Government also passed the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges &amp;amp; Procedures) Act 2013 and the Standing Orders to establish Oireachtas Inquiry system are now in place.

There are currently approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients, for which Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.  Rent supplement expenditure figures from 1999 are provided in the tabular statement below; separate rent supplement expenditure data for the years: 1989; 1993; 1996 are not available.<\/p><p>Details of the current maximum rent limits on a county basis are provided in the tabular statement below.  The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &ldquo;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&rdquo; and it is available on www.welfare.ie.  The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students.  Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market.  The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.  The review finds that increasing the rent limits would have several potentially negative effects, including providing an impetus for current rent supplement landlords to renegotiate their lease agreements to the new limits impacting on all existing recipients at significant cost to the Exchequer.  <\/p><p>In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances throughout the country, including those in the Louth area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits if deemed appropriate.  I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,000 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.  Of the 1,000 recipients mentioned above, over 500 households in Dublin and some 12 in Cork city have been provided assistance through increased rent limits under the Protocol.<\/p><p>The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.  My Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is also considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputies that I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients. <\/p><p><b>Tabular Statements<\/b><\/p><p><b>Table 1 : Maximum Rent Limits<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Single Shared<\/th><th>Couple Shared<\/th><th>Single<\/th><th>Couple<\/th><th>Couple\/<br \/><br \/>One Parent Family -

To this end, the Department provides a wide range of income and work related supports for people with disabilities, which play an important role in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  Among these supports is the Employability service, which supports people with disabilities who wish to take up employment.  The service currently comprises 23 limited companies, each with a specific geographical remit and each fully funded by the Department.  The budget for 2015 provides &euro;9.6 million to run the service. 80 per cent of these costs are attributed to staff costs while 20 per cent are related to overhead costs, such as accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  The average cost of the Employability Service is &euro;2,900 per client.  If the service was expanded by 1,000 clients, the estimated additional annual cost would be &euro;2.9 million. While the service supports around 3,000 people at any one time, on average, some 2,600 clients exit the service every year.  Removing the 18 month time-limit on support would effectively represent an expansion of the service which would cost around &euro;7.66 million a year compounding.<\/p>  <p>  While the Employability service operates in the context of jobs in the open-labour market, data in relation to the sustainability of such jobs is not available as the service is not in a position to monitor persons&rsquo; economic activity after they have exited the service. <\/p>  <p>  Employability is focused on supporting, through job coaches, people with disabilities in the open labour market.  Participants must be motivated to work and be able to work a minimum of 8 hours per week.  The service is open to people between the ages of 18 to 65 years.  The duration of the support is 18 months &ndash; the person&rsquo;s underlying medical condition is not directly relevant to the provision of the service so it is not possible to state how many clients would have a mental health condition.  <\/p>  <p>  The pilot project - Integrating Employment and Mental Health Support - to which the Deputy refers is being led by Mental Health Reform.  The Department is facilitating the project by providing funding to the order of &euro;250,000 to allow each of the four Employability companies participating in the pilot to recruit an additional job-coach for the two-year period covered by the pilot project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100057#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100057#WRE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[15362\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100057#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her Department is currently profiling recipients of disability allowance; the form this profiling is taking, including any link with the probability of exit scores used for the live register and its rationale; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>The Department does not currently profile recipients of disability allowance (DA).<\/p><p>However, the Department is planning to ask those currently in receipt of DA to supply information relating to educational attainment levels, employment history etc. <\/p><p>This exercise will get under way in the latter half of this year and the information obtained will better inform the planning and delivery of employment and training supports to people with disabilities in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100057#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100057#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[15363\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100057#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on the fit for work Ireland initiative; her Department's response to the initiative; the steps taken to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>I welcome the approach being proposed under the &ldquo;Fit for Work&rdquo; initiative.

The legislative provisions governing CIB are contained in the Comhairle Act, 2000, the Citizens Information Act, 2007 and the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011.<\/p><p>While oversight of the CIB is exercised by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) in line with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, the CIB is also accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The CIB&rsquo;s annual report is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is then laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A senior official of DSP sits on the Board of CIB and there is regular liaison between officials of DSP and the CIB executive.<\/p><p>CIB delivers on its remit to provide services to the public by supporting a network of delivery partners which includes 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS) and 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS).  Each of these 93 independent companies in the network has a separate voluntary Board of Management.  Each of these Boards has an average of over 9 members resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The number of board members in the 51 local MABS companies amounts to over 400 and a breakdown by company is included in the following table.<\/p><p>The Citizens Information Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place for expenditure of allocated public funds.  Service level agreements are in place with each delivery partner company and cover standard items such as service delivery, governance, financial controls, HR practices, reporting, evaluation and monitoring.  The use of service level agreements enables the CIB to ensure that excellent service and best value is achieved across the wide range of services it provides.<\/p><p>In 2015, the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46 million of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.  The annual allocation of State funds from CIB to the MABS network of companies over the last five years was as follows &ndash;<\/p><p>2011  &euro;18.4m; 2012 &euro;18.3m; 2013  &euro;19.0m; 2014 &euro;18.6m; and 2015 &euro;17.9m.<\/p><p>The following table shows the funding allocation to the 51 local MABS local companies over the past five years, the number of Board members per company (as registered with audited accounts submitted to Companies Registration Office for 2013), the cost of each Board, including professional fees andthe % cost of the Boards relative to overall administrative costs.<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>MABS<\/td><td>Board Members
