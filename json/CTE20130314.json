At the time, this committee was advised that there was a risk that ongoing examination could encroach on the work of the courts and damage the ability of a State body to defend the case.  That case has now been dealt with and the committee can resume its consideration of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority was asked for  certain information at the meeting of this committee on 14 June 2012 and this information should now be requested again.  The authority should be asked to supply it to the committee.<\/p><p>  In July last year, the committee agreed to postpone its meeting scheduled for 12 July, at which it was to examine the departmental oversight of the authority.  We should now reschedule that meeting with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I refer to the increase in the borrowing limit of the authority, which was sanctioned by the then Department of Finance.<\/p><p>  We had agreed to take evidence from the former chairman of the authority, Ms Niamh Brennan, who was appointed after the events covered by the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as a number of changes were made by Ms Brennan in the authority arising from events that are again covered in the report.  We also agreed that the current executive should attend all future meetings of the committee.  We may return to the issue covered on 14 June 2012, especially where witnesses felt the threat of court action prevented them from giving evidence that could have been the subject of that action.  There are a number of other potential witnesses whom we can invite to assist the committee in its examination of this issue.  Members referred to them at our meeting on 14 June 2012.  I include the individuals who held key posts in the executive and also those who were on the board of the authority during the period in question and who are covered by the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We can review the situation when we have examined the departmental oversight issues, which will put our examination back on track.  We can take all those steps immediately now that the threat of court action has been lifted.  With the agreement of members, I ask the clerk to the committee to go through the transcripts of the meetings to compile the various requests we now need to make of the parties involved and begin the process of holding the hearings.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  In February, I believe, we dealt with the question of Dublin Waterworld.  We sent letters to various relevant parties.

Consequently, chapter 21 was compiled to present a consolidated view of the expenditure on welfare and employment schemes.<\/p><p>  Expenditure on welfare schemes in 2011 was just over &euro;20 billion, which was 3% below the peak figure reached in 2009.  Trends on some of the key categories of welfare expenditure have been more volatile.  In particular, support for people in the labour market more than doubled over a three-year period to reach &euro;5.8 billion in 2010, but then fell by more than 7% in 2011.  This reflects the substantial movements in the live register figures in recent years, transfers of claimants between jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance as benefit entitlements run out, and payment rate changes.  Expenditure on employment schemes amounted to almost &euro;1 billion in 2011.<\/p><p>  The main income source for the fund is pay-related social insurance contributions, which are collected by the Revenue Commissioners and remitted to the fund.  The fund&rsquo;s resources are used to pay for a range of social insurance payments including pensions, jobseeker's benefit and illness benefit.<\/p><p>  At the end of 2007, the fund had accumulated reserves of &euro;3.6 billion arising from surpluses over many years.  However, due to consecutive deficits each year from 2008, those reserves were exhausted during 2010.  The Exchequer has been meeting the shortfall since then.  For 2011, the Exchequer subvention to the fund was almost &euro;1.5 billion.<\/p> <p>This was a charge on Vote 38.<\/p><p> By law, an actuarial review of the financial condition of the Social Insurance Fund must be carried out at least every five years.  A review commissioned by the Department, taking end-2010 as a baseline, projected that the current shortfall between receipts and expenditure will grow substantially over the long term.  It projected that the deficit on the fund will double to &euro;3 billion by 2019 and will have increased to &euro;26 billion a year by 2066.  The actuarial review necessarily was based on a set of assumptions about uncertain future events and conditions.  For example, the review assumed, as a base case, that real earnings will grow by 1.5% a year or more over the projection period.  Analysis of the sensitivity of the projections to alternative assumptions indicates that if real earnings grow by just 1% a year &ndash; which is a significant growth rate over the 50 to 60-year horizon of the projection &ndash; the projected deficit in 2066 would be &euro;16 billion, rather than the &euro;26 billion deficit under the base case.  Another critical factor relates to assumed further substantial improvements in life expectancy.  When lower rates of expected improvement from the European Commission's<i>2012 Ageing Report<\/i>, are used in the projections, the deficit for 2066 is projected at &euro;21 billion, rather than the baseline &euro;26 billion.  Given the importance of these actuarial projections for decision-making about pensions policy, I recommended that the basis for the key assumption rates in the baseline should be subject to more detailed analysis and testing, including scenario testing where a number of assumptions are changed together, in a consistent way.<\/p><p> Chapter 22 reviews the Department&rsquo;s management of recorded welfare overpayment debts.  The total value of recorded overpayment debts at the end of 2011 was &euro;343 million.  Debt recovery during the year increased by half to &euro;52 million but this was more than offset by the value of new overpayment debts recorded, which came to &euro;92 million.  Debts to the value of &euro;12 million were either cancelled or written off during the year.  The net result was an increase in 2011 of &euro;28 million in the total recorded debt for recovery.  The results of audit fieldwork indicated that the Department&rsquo;s guidance about procedures for debt recovery was not being applied consistently in local welfare offices.  It was recommended that the Department should develop procedures to monitor more closely the proportion of debt recovery plans in place and to assess the performance of local offices in terms of debt recovery rates and rates of referral of appropriate cases to the Department&rsquo;s central debt management unit.  The examination also found that while there is an approval procedure in place for cancellation or write-off of debts, such decisions are not subject to review by management.  The chapter recommended that the Department should examine the current arrangements with a view to implementing a consistent approach across all offices including, at a minimum, a standard form to record the background and reason for all decisions to cancel or to write off overpayment debts.  The examination included a review of the Department&rsquo;s overpayment debt management system.  We found that the system lacked a number of the features required to be an effective debt management tool.  In particular, the system was not capable of performing analysis or of producing management information with an appropriate level of detail.  It also does not enable the recording of recovery actions taken or pending in respect of individual cases.  The proportion of fraud cases prosecuted is typically below 3%.  The Accounting Officer stated that prosecutions are taken only in the more serious cases, where there is strong evidence of fraud.<\/p><p> Chapter 23 deals with the regularity of social welfare scheme payments, that is, whether recipients were properly entitled to the amounts they received or have received payments in excess of their entitlements.  Detection and recording of overpayments is evidence that payments in excess of entitlements occur but the Department does not record an overpayment in all cases detected.  Based on the available evidence, I consider that there is a material level of expenditure on the Vote that does not meet the regularity test.  The Department carries out periodic fraud and error surveys, based on a random sample of scheme cases, to assess the risk of excess payments on individual welfare schemes and the likely causative factors.  The results of the fraud and error surveys indicate there is a significant level of underlying irregular payment on certain Vote-funded schemes.  The more recent survey reports include estimates of the net financial loss to the Department, which tends to be a lower figure than the scheme losses.  This occurs because claimants found to be in receipt of an excess payment may be eligible for a payment under a different scheme or may become a dependent of another claimant.  Even taking this into account, the estimated levels of financial loss borne on the Vote appear to be significant, including 4.1% of expenditure on disability allowance and 2.7% on one-parent family payments.  Given the lack of survey coverage for some major expenditure schemes, I recommended that the Department should design a programme of surveys based on the level of annual scheme expenditure, with the larger schemes to be reviewed on a continuous basis, mid-size schemes on a cyclical basis and small schemes to be surveyed occasionally or not at all.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I consider that fraud and error surveys are an important tool in combatting losses due to irregular welfare payments.  The Department needs a reliable estimate of the overall incidence of excess payments across schemes.  This would allow it to assess whether the targeted control activity it undertakes is on a sufficient scale and is effective in detecting excess payments.  Ultimately, unless there is a combination of a high probability of detection, followed by prompt recovery of payments in excess of entitlements, persons tempted to submit false claims for welfare benefits are unlikely to be deterred from doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013031400004#D01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363256100,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.

As well as examining the appropriation account for the Department of Social Protection and the Social Insurance Fund statutory account for 2011, I understand the committee wishes to examine three of the four chapters relevant to the Department that are included in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report for 2011.  As requested last week I provided the committee with an update on the conclusions contained in the three chapters, together with expenditure data from 2011 to date.  I also have provided the committee with three separate reports on our implementation of the fraud initiative 2011-2013, the non-compliance analytics pilot project undertaken with Accenture consultants and the recently completed child benefit fraud and error survey.<\/p><p>  As chapter 21 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report confirms, the Department of Social Protection spent almost &euro;21 billion on welfare and employment schemes in 2011.  As members will see from the material I have provided, the provisional outturn figure for 2012 is &euro;20.7 billion.  I and my colleagues in the Department are very aware of the responsibility we carry in ensuring the proper disbursement of such a significant proportion of Government income and expenditure.  The Department has three main functions, namely, the delivery of income support, activation and control of fraud and abuse and in my view, it must maintain a balance between these in the conduct of its overall business.  I wish to take the opportunity to comment briefly on each.<\/p><p>  Delivery of income support was the traditional role of the Department and still is a vital one.  It involves payments to approximately 2.2 million citizens, comprising approximately 1.4 million weekly and 600,000 monthly payments.  We strive to make all these payments in a timely way, as delays can cause hardship and unnecessary concerns for vulnerable people.  While the vast majority of claims and payments are processed on time, there are backlogs in certain schemes, as we discussed last year.  I can now report that good progress is being made and that the backlogs have been almost eliminated in the case of invalidity pension and will be eliminated by end-March for family income supplement and carer&rsquo;s allowance and by end-June for disability allowance.  In the social welfare appeals office, the chief appeals officer has also made significant progress and the number of appeals to be finalised through her office will be increased substantially again this year.  It should be noted that the elimination of backlogs in scheme areas also will have a positive knock-on impact on processing times in the appeals office.<\/p><p>  I will turn to activation and Intreo.  Pathways to Work provided for the establishment of an integrated employment and income support service.  The integration of three previously separate services, namely, the Department of Social Protection, F&Aacute;S and the community welfare service, is in line with international best practice.  This new service model includes the provision of an integrated service centre, that is, Intreo, a single point of contact for clients where they can come for benefit and employment services, the profiling of clients to help develop an individual progression plan, that is, a pathway back to employment and a group engagement process in which clients with similar profiles receive a briefing on the options and supports available to them.<\/p> <p>It also includes a follow-up series of one-to-one meetings between clients and employment advisors; a closer engagement between Department local offices and their corresponding vocational education-skills training agency to improve the planning and scheduling of courses for unemployed people; formalisation of the concept of rights and responsibilities in a social contract - a record of mutual commitments; more intensive engagement with employers in order to encourage and facilitate the recruitment of people from the live register - this is a vital part of the new service and there has been some good progress to date; and, finally, greater targeting of activation places for long-term unemployed.<\/p><p> We have a demanding and challenging schedule of change with Intreo rolled out to ten offices last year and a target of another 33 this year with full completion by end 2014.  I can assure the committee that the Department, with the assistance of other agencies, will be doing its best to make this happen.  Turning to the control of fraud and abuse, I have provided material and reports in this regard.  While the majority of people in receipt of social welfare payments are entitled to these, there is an onus on the Department to ensure that abuse is minimised and that resources are targeted at those who have an entitlement.  We are examining ways of using data and information in a smarter way, as set out in the material we sent to the committee, while, of course, always being conscious of the requirements of data protection.<\/p><p> As regards debt management, the Comptroller and Auditor General made four recommendations in his chapter on welfare overpayments and in my update to the committee I have reported progress on all of them.  Section 13 of the Social Welfare Act 2012 allows for deduction of an amount up to 15% of the weekly personal rate payable to customers for the purpose of recovering an overpayment.  This equates to &euro;28 per week in the case of customers receiving a weekly payment of &euro;188.  This is a significant advancement as previously we could deduct no more than &euro;2 in many instances.<\/p><p> Our governance committee has approved the introduction of a new debt management system for the Department, which will be tendered for later this year.  The recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his team will be incorporated into the specification for the new system.<\/p><p> We are continuing to develop our computer systems which reliably deliver 87 million payments per year.  Although developed independently, mechanisms exist on our major systems whereby significant changes made to customer or claim details are automatically notified to other relevant systems.  The Department is working towards consolidation on a single ICT platform - the business object model implementation, known as BOMi.  This work is being carried out as part of the Department&rsquo;s continuous service delivery modernisation, or SDM, programme.  As this programme progresses, all of the Department&rsquo;s client and claim-related systems will be integrated on the one platform, ensuring that all client and claim information is fully and automatically available across all of the Department&rsquo;s schemes and places of business.<\/p><p> As a Department, we have completed our first year as a restructured and transformed DSP organisation with colleagues from a number of different organisations bringing their unique insights and experiences to the work.  In this regard, the committee may wish to note that some 3,000 new people have joined the Department since 2009 which, while challenging from a HR, culture and training perspective, represents a huge opportunity for us in terms of different talents and skill-sets.  While adapting to and meeting all the challenges, we remain focused on our three core objects of providing income support particularly to those most in need, providing activation and employment supports and ensuring our controls minimise incidents of fraud and error.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013031400005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363256700,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms O'Donoghue.

I thank her for the opening statement.  I glanced at it last night and I want to deal with a couple of specific aspects in the Department's budget for the year we are discussing.<\/p><p>  The first issue which is probably the most relevant to many people in light of the Government's announcement yesterday, is that of the mortgage interest supplement.  As Ms O'Donoghue is aware, 94,000 people have been in mortgage arrears for over 90 days.  In total, 150,000 people are in mortgage arrears to some extent.  The latter figure has doubled in the last two years.  The Department of Social Protection is the only direct line Department that helps people with mortgage difficulties through the mortgage interest supplement.  I understand that the departmental Estimate for mortgage interest supplement payments in 2011 was &euro;77,246,000.  I also understand that the Estimate for 2013 under that heading is &euro;41,820,000.  That is a reduction of 46%.  The Department's overall Estimate - based on the draft Estimates published on budget day and the revised Estimates to be published on 21 March - indicates a possible reduction of approximately 2%.  However, I do not understand why Ms O'Donoghue's Department has a 25% cut in mortgage interest supplement payments this year alone, on top of the cuts in the previous year, and almost a 50% cut under that heading, even though the Government says that area is the number one priority.<\/p><p>  Ms O'Donoghue might tell me her Department's role in light of yesterday's announcements by Ministers and the regulator.  Today, we are looking at whether the Government is doing what it says it will do.  The only tangible issue concerning the Government and the Department of Social Protection, when it comes to dealing with those in mortgage arrears, is a massive cut in the mortgage interest supplement.  <\/p><p>  Major changes were made in the Social Welfare Bill last year to people's eligibility for mortgage interest supplement payments.  Can Ms O'Donoghue say how many people were in receipt of the mortgage interest supplement in 2011, as well as the current number in receipt of it?  More importantly, how many new people have been put on the mortgage interest supplement payment since the beginning of this year, and especially since last July when the Department made those changes in the Social Welfare Bill?  Those changes seem to run counter to everything that is being said.  We are trying to help people in mortgage arrears, yet the one Department with a role in this matter has halved its budget in this area over the past two years.  <\/p><p>  I would like Ms O'Donoghue to answer those specific questions concerning numbers, amounts, cuts, rule changes and how difficult the situation is.  She should also explain her Department's role with the financial regulator who deals with the same banks to which she provides the mortgage interest supplement.  She should also outline the discussions she has been having with the regulator, specifically concerning yesterday's announcement, so that we can see the overall joined-up approach by Government and her Department's role in this.  <\/p><p>  I would have thought that if one group was to get some relief from expenditure cuts, it should be those in mortgage arrears.  I have posed a number of questions about this specific issue, which the public is very concerned about, so perhaps Ms O'Donoghue can discuss those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013031400006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363256700,"counter":32,"content":"<p>There are two different elements to discuss.  The Deputy is correct to say that the number of people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement has reduced, and the budget line has reduced between 2011 and 2012, and what is projected for 2013.  There are a number of factors involved in that.  Primarily, there have been two changes to the way in which the scheme is operated.  As the Deputy might be aware, a number of different interdepartmental and working groups have examined the issue of support in the mortgages area.  We had our own direct review in 2010.  We participated in the Keane review and were a party to its recommendations.  We continued to work with the various interdepartmental groups leading up to yesterday's announcement.<\/p><p>  The rationale for the mortgage interest supplement scheme was to provide short-term relief for people who were in mortgage difficulties.<\/p> <p>It was mentioned in the Keane review that immediate access to mortgage interest supplement might actually be a deterrent for people to engage properly and quickly with the banks or their lenders in the first instance.  This gave rise to a change in conditionality under the scheme which was introduced in law last year, which means people have a 12 month window period in which to engage with their lender before they can access the supplement.  This would have introduced a change to the numbers of those eligible to apply.<\/p><p> The second change was that the actual contribution of individuals to their mortgage interest payments was increased in line with other increases in social welfare rates and contributions.  The contributions of the households of individuals and couples have been increased since 2010.  What this meant, particularly for those in receipt of local authority mortgages, was that the level of contribution required exceeded the amount in interest to qualify in the first instance.  Again, this reduced the actual numbers eligible for relief under the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013031400006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363257300,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Will Ms O'Donoghue explain that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013031400007#G00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363257300,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Since 2010 the minimum contribution payable by the majority of households of couples has increased from &euro;24 to &euro;37 per week or from &euro;104 to &euro;160 per month.

This is a complex area involving many payments.  I deal with many social welfare queries in my office.  I am not saying I know everything about it, but we are quite busy.  We have a slight concern over deterrents and how people view the system before they engage in fraudulent activity in particular.  I will give an example of an application I printed.  In many cases the only deterrent is the warning printed at the bottom of a typical application that states: \" Warning: If you make a false statement or withhold information, you may be prosecuted leading to a fine, a prison term or both.\"  Looking at the figures, the chances of that happening are quite small compared with other jurisdictions - I will come to that later.<\/p><p>  In its Fraud Initiative 2011-2013, the Department recognised that an effective deterrent regime is important.  It noted that effective debt recovery is an integral part of the deterrent regime and that the Department would take appropriate steps to effect the recovery of the debt, which is fine.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has very comprehensively dealt with the issues on the surveys on fraud and error.  He has identified the shortcomings in the local offices as being training, recovery of debt, etc.  However, I am not concerned about after the fact but what happens beforehand and the thought process when an individual is tempted.  There is considerably more temptation these days to commit welfare fraud for the obvious reasons.  This can be compared with Revenue, for example.  Among individuals thinking about going down the road of committing welfare fraud, is there sufficient deterrent in their mind before taking that initial step?  That is our concern.<\/p><p>  When I look at all these figures - I thank the liaison officer for putting all this together for me - the one concern I have is that we are dealing with it after the fact.  Every year the Department issues press releases on the reviews and the savings made across the different payments.  However, we need to work out how we can be more effective in deterring people from going down that road at the very beginning.  I ask Ms O'Donoghue to outline her thoughts on that, which is clearly something the Department has identified through its initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013031400009#J03300","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363258500,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I will refer to two different points I made in my opening statements.

I suppose one of the things I would point to, which I mentioned in my opening statement, is that the introduction of our new integrated service presents us with a real opportunity to represent a cultural change in our engagement with our customers.  So the social contract that I referred to where people's responsibilities are very clearly outlined is a new dimension to our engagement with customers.  Part of that engagement with customers is a much more frequent interaction with them, both in terms of helping them on progression paths but also in terms of reinforcing our control agenda and ensuring that they continue to remain eligible for whatever payments they are entitled to.

I am making the point that the deterrent is not there.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department are carrying out reviews, but the deterrent is greater in people's minds in other jurisdictions when they engage in fraud.  It is borne out by the figures.<\/p><p>  I will go back to Revenue, which has a reputation.  Compliance levels in tax collection in this country are very high.  It is due to the fact that Revenue is, unlike the Department, very willing to use very tough enforcement measures.  When I compare the Department of Social Protection to the reputation of Revenue in people's minds,  it is different, based on my experience as a Deputy.  People with whom I deal would consider that the penalties and chance of being prosecuted and fined are quite slim given that they would think twice about going down that road with Revenue.

I understand that we are talking about people with very little money.  I deal with enough people who are in very tight situations.  I will go back to the example of England.  For those convicted in court, the Department for Work and Pensions has proposed introducing a two strike regime for imposing benefit deductions.  It proposes to impose a loss of benefits for three months for a first conviction and six months for those convicted of benefit fraud on a second conviction.  A third conviction would result in a loss of benefits for three years.  It is a deterrent.  I am of the opinion that a larger deterrent needs to be introduced in this country.

More than 130,000 pensioners in Ireland who receive a British state pension have until the end of the current month to claim a winter fuel allowance worth up to &euro;350 per annum.

For pensioners, it is very significant.  A rough calculation suggests there would be 3,000 or 4,000 people who potentially qualify for the allowance in respect of my constituency in Waterford.

In developing our computer platform we must be careful to ensure we do not create problems in terms of business continuity and that we do not risk making so many changes at a particular point in time that the fundamental role of the Department would be undermined and payments would not be made.<\/p><p>  Having said all this, the Deputy might appreciate that over time we have had systems developed to service and support various areas of activity as the Department's activities have expanded and the profile and the way in which payments are made have changed.  We have been undertaking a programme to modernise our computer systems for approximately six or seven years and it represents a significant investment by the State.  Our overall approach, in the first instance, was to modernise and have the most sophisticated systems in areas in which there was less risk and volatility.  The first area we examined was that of pensions, which was followed by child benefit.  We have been modernising our systems systematically and migrating schemes to our new platform.  We have considerably multiplied the level of activity in this regard.  The most recent movement to our systems involved schemes which were the source of so much discussion last year, namely, disability allowance, carer's allowance and invalidity pension.  All of these schemes have now migrated to our new platform, which gives us much more integrated information and much better ways to manage the information and understand our customers.<\/p><p>  We have always had data interaction with the Revenue Commissioners who collect PRSI on our behalf.  This informs all of our client eligibility records.  We host the client identity services and the personal public service numbers for the entire public service.  On the back of this we are rolling out the public service card to customers in the first instance and potentially to other users of public services.  We have systems in place which are very much at the height of sophistication and modernisation, but there is no doubt that, equally, we have schemes that we need to migrate.  The most delicate of these are probably in the areas of greatest volatility such as those involving jobseekers, in respect of which there is movement in and out and approximately  900,000 or 1 million claims a year, as I mentioned to Deputy John Deasy.  We have been examining ways in which to do this, while ensuring we can continue our business and yet progress.  We have been taking a few approaches to this task.  While we have invested hugely in developing our own systems, we have also received great support through e-government moneys because where we develop systems and a means of holding information which is potentially of value to the rest of the public service, the infrastructure put in place not only supports the core activity of the Department but it also supports agency services in other areas of the public service.  Systems developed in this way include those for the birth, marriage and death records held by the General Register Office which are published to 50 agencies in the public service and have generated huge savings, particularly in the issuing of medical cards and in respect of Department of Social Protection schemes.<\/p><p>  The other central area encompasses the identity service that I referenced which involves the public service card and validating PPS numbers.  Several hundred thousand such validations are carried out every year for other agencies.  Progress is being made and it is our database which supports what is known as the single customer view.<\/p> <p>This would be pivotal to the next generation of public services in terms of other agencies being able to access and validate customer identity by being able to look at this customer view.  More recently, we have developed a system to capture means data, so when we capture data for the purpose of means assessment, we are working towards developing a system to allow that data be shared with other public bodies.  In other words, if people declare means to us and we validate and capture it, we would be able to share it with other public service providers where means assessment is carried out.  That potentially has much value in other spaces, such as housing, education or health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013031400012#M01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363260900,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Considering my case load as a public representative, I almost never get representations on child benefit, for example, and I presume that is because the system works very effectively and efficiently.

It becomes more complicated if the employment history stretches across Europe and we must validate insurance contributions elsewhere.<\/p><p>  Considering the other schemes we organise, there are dimensions to conditions of eligibility.  For example, for assistance-based schemes, there is a means assessment, which takes some time.  We hope that if a person has previously given means data, we should be able to use it again, which can shorten the process.  If the information can be validated through another public source, it can also shorten the process.  There are various opportunities available to try to reduce processing times for a number of different schemes.<\/p><p>  The schemes which have given us greatest cause for concern over the past couple of years has been those where there is additional conditionality due to medical assessment, and where there is a need for somebody to provide information for a desk assessment, or if it is a review case to attend for in-person assessment.  That can lengthen the process and what we have tried to do in that space is increase the number of medical assessors working in the Department and change our business processes and the kinds of forms and information we are seeking from people at initial application so we can ensure we get the range of information we need to make an assessment on a case.  I hope all those kinds of elements will lead to a position where processing times for claims are no longer an issue on the political agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013031400013#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1363260900,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I will ask about rent allowance for people on the housing list.

Although I am not sure how widespread the problem is, in other cases the landlord will not take anybody on the housing list.  What happens if a house is sold?  Has the Department of Social Protection considered the issues that may arise in this respect?

Housing policy is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with local authorities.  My understanding of government policy is that we want to move to a position where rent supplement is a short-term support for people.<\/p> <p>Assistance for people who have longer-term housing needs would be delivered through a new system called the housing assistance payment.  It has been designed specifically to reduce the perceived disincentive to progress from unemployment to work or from dependence to working.  Measures are being taken to progress the policy over the course of the year.  There were concerns regarding rent supplement in terms of local authority housing and shifting people from rent supplement into the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.<\/p><p> With regard to the security of the payment and the contribution of the individual, one measure that was put in place by the most recent Social Welfare Bill was a mandatory deduction at source facility or household budgeting system that is operated by An Post.  In order words, when a local authority offers a house under RAS it would be on condition that the individual that is due to benefit would sign up to a mandatory deduction of their rent that is payable through the household budgeting system.  That system is now on a statutory basis and we are working with the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to put it into effect.  Ultimately, it is about shifting to the new housing assistance payment system which I am not at liberty to discuss today because it is the prerogative of a different Department.<\/p><p> There was an issue raised about the potential for houses to be sold thus reducing the availability of rental accommodation for people who could benefit from a rent supplement.  We monitor it closely by ensuring that the current rent limits are still operable and we also review rent limits.  One of the things that we take some comfort from is that somewhere between 45,000 and 48,000 new rent supplements were agreed last year.  That is evidence that there was sufficient housing and private rented accommodation for people to avail of.  Obviously the role of my Department's community welfare service officers exists to facilitate and assist people to find alternative accommodation when the need arises.  That measure continues in place. <\/p><p> Another review of the rent limits will take place in July.  Therefore, the rent limits will be assessed in order to ensure that rents are operable.  A real issue for us is that rent limits can have a push or pull factor when it comes to determining rent payable in the private sector.  A number of different facets are moving at the same time such as the rent limits and our continued assessment of them.  We must also ensure that there is enough accommodation available within the rent limits and areas.  Our supplementary welfare allowance colleagues in Sligo monitor the scheme on a continual basis.  There is also the ongoing work in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  For example, the progress of the pilot projects of the housing assistance payment scheme for some time later this year and moving more people into RAS pending that measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013031400013#N00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363261500,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I have three related questions on the issue and then I shall move on to another topic.<\/p><p>  With regard to payments, is the Secretary General aware that some landlords also seek an under the table payment?

Subsequent to that announcement, the Minister found money elsewhere within the Vote to subvent it; therefore, when we carried out the assessment, the level of cutback originally flagged did not have to be enforced during 2012.  A very extensive review was undertaken of all community employment schemes and their financial basis.  It identified various areas where there were savings to be achieved, for example, in insurance, where there were different arrangements for different schemes.  There were other savings to be achieved where potentially we could amalgamate schemes to achieve better efficiencies, or where we could increase the ratio of participants to supervisors within the agreements in place to get greater benefit from the expenditure being made.

I expect  Ms O'Donoghue would probably also accept this - that it is probably higher than the figure of 0.44%.

If a general official is working on a file and then pulled away to the counter, there is no way he or she can devote his or her attention specifically to that file.  When the CWOs arrived in the Department, I would have expected this to present an enormous opportunity to use their intelligence effectively to put in place a crack team, which would give comfort to the general public and the vast majority, if not nearly all, of those on social welfare who are genuine that the system was working.

For example, 2.1% of all disability allowance claims were assessed as being fraudulent, as opposed to an irregular welfare payment.  Out of that, 0.9% were reinstated or transferred.

Regardless of the circumstances around the initial claim which was found to be fraudulent, if they satisfy the conditions in law that entitles them to a different payment, then they are entitled to it.

I am encouraged to note, for example, that the reinstatement rate is high in cases in which the issue is one of medical ineligibility because I often deal with such cases.  Generally, these involve an appeals officer making a different decision based on somebody supplying additional information or a person's condition unfortunately deteriorating.  This is how the system should work.  Reinstatement also makes sense where an error has been made.  However, it is striking that nearly half of those who seek to defraud the State by falsely claiming disability allowance receive a payment from the State, despite the authorities being aware that the individuals in question have sought to defraud the State.

The Deputy must bear in mind that the table does not capture the fact that where the fraud is serious, the person in question is at risk of being prosecuted, although only a small proportion of cases are ultimately prosecuted.  Regardless of the person's eligibility for a different social welfare payment, he or she will be at risk of being prosecuted.  Their eligibility is distinct and different.<\/p><p>  The second point is that if, through a person's efforts - whether fraud or error - an overpayment is raised against him or her, he or she is liable to have this overpayment recovered.  It is not as if a person in this position starts from a clean sheet.  <\/p><p>  This is reporting on the fraud and error surveys and I suppose I should refer to it as suspected fraud.  This is where the deciding officer or inspector has made a judgment on the basis of the evidence available to him or her that this is suspected fraud or a suspected error.  Sometimes there can be a fine line between the two in terms of whether somebody has deliberately withheld information from us or simply forgotten to give us the information.  Two judgments could be made in that respect.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of reinstatement, if a person's claim is terminated or reduced, he or she will have an opportunity to appeal.  The appeals officer who rehears all of the evidence presented may make a different determination from the deciding officer, one that may lead to the case being reinstated.  Whereas the deciding officer might have come to a view that there was fraud in a case, this view may not be echoed by the appeals officer.  I cannot give the Deputy a value for the proportion of cases where this occurs. <\/p><p>  One aspect of the social welfare system is that it is designed to provide income where an income need has been established.  This is done based on particular contingencies or situations.  Somebody may not fit a particular scheme and may be defrauding that scheme, but his or her circumstances may dictate that he or she has an entitlement in a different part of the social welfare code.

We also have two dedicated public service card centres in Dublin, one in Gandon House and other on North Cumberland Street.  To date, we have issued approximately 160,000 public service cards and our target is to issue 600,000 in 2013 and 900,000 in 2014.  There are two methods of registering somebody to safe level 2, the level at which a public service card is generated.  The first is the face to face method, while the second is a reduced process in which we use information currently held by the State, for example, the Passport Office and prospectively the National Transport Authority in the context of driving licences.  If somebody has satisfied the safe protocols by having verified his or her identity and provided an image to the accepted safe level of security required, we will accept this data and, subject to some security questions and so forth, issue a public service card on the back of this.  As I stated, the target for this year is 600,000 cards and 900,000 next year.  At that stage, we expect to be working on other issues in terms of other uses of the public service card to generate demand for it, for want of a better description.

I do not relate it to overall expenditure.  I made the presumption that the Department has sufficient checks and balances to minimise the problem.  I do not minimise the amount by relating it to the greater figure because it is taxpayers' money and we should be concerned about every red cent.  That does not seem to be the case, however.

The amendment aims to ensure that existing conditions of availability of concessionary rates of motor tax are retained for some of the vehicles within this category which were taxed at &euro;95 or less prior to budget 2013 but where the tax was raised to &euro;102 following the budget increase.  The vehicles concerned are agricultural tractors, island vehicles, trench diggers, excavators, motor caravans, hearses, dumpers and fork lift trucks.  In order to ensure that existing provisions are maintained for those vehicles, this amendment increases the threshold to &euro;119.  This sum will ensure that no new vehicle types are brought within the provisions.  The new lowest &euro;120 annual tax for electric vehicles, which can be taxed half-yearly and quarterly, would be the next lowest annual tax, while maintaining the status quo for existing categories.

The whole idea in 2008 was to change the culture whereby people who bought more fuel-efficient cars were rewarded through the tax code.<\/p><p>  The other aspect of this to which I wish to draw attention is the issue of the motor tax fund.  Last week when we were debating this issue, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government said that most of the motor tax fund is ring-fenced for local authorities.  However, he also said that &euro;150 million would be taken out of that fund this year to pay down some of our national debt.<\/p> <p> This is not about motor tax at all.  This issue is a major source of complaint from the public.  People are paying into a fund.  The motor tax rates are being increased but the public does not see a return for its money.  For example, there is a competition to located the biggest pothole in the country.  There is a practice of labelling taxation, such as the carbon tax, for example, yet this tax goes into the general fund.  Similarly, this tax is being called a motor tax but it will go towards paying off the national debt.  Another example is the property tax which is not really a property tax because in many cases it is a tax on a debt as the householder is still paying for the house.<\/p><p> I note a dangerous development.  We are ruining the prospect of people changing the type of vehicles they buy.  When they see that their roads are deteriorating, yet they are paying more tax it is no surprise that there is resistance and it is an understandable resistance.  The Government needs to take that on board in its taxation policy because if there is not compliance, the whole system fails.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013031400003#B02100","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363270200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I note that Deputies are opposed to the increases that took effect from 1 January 2013.  I recognise that any increase in tax is unwelcome, this being the second increase in as many years.  However, it is an unavoidable fact that the new CO2-based system introduced in July 2008, has resulted over time in a decline in motor tax receipts.  This means it has worked.  Instead of the switch being revenue-neutral while also providing an environmental incentive for use of the more fuel-efficient cars, the tax was structured in such a way that in the absence of budget increases the effect is that by the time the switch to CO2 taxation is completed in the next decade and a half, the tax base will have shrunk by 50%.<\/p><p>  Since 2008 there has been a year-on-year reduction in motor tax income related to the changeover to CO2 taxation.  Income went from a high level of &euro;1.060 billion in 2008 to &euro;1 billion, approximately, in 2011.  There was an increase to &euro;1.05 billion in 2012, due to the increases in motor tax rates announced in the budget for 2012.  In the absence of that increase, it is estimated that the income would have been in the order of &euro;954 million, a reduction of 5.5%, over the 2011 income.  In the absence of further rebalancing measures, the downward trend will continue as the proportion of vehicles taxed on CO2 increases as an overall proportion of the car fleet and as technologies mandated by the EU requirements lead to a greater proportion of cars being even more efficient.<\/p><p>  This year for the first time, the majority of new registrations are in the lowest tax band.  In the absence of increases in motor tax, the bulk of which goes to the Local Government Fund, and supports the general funding of the local government system, as well as the roads and public transport system, the Deputy may be aware that other forms of financing of local government would have to be found.<\/p><p>  The increase in motor tax this year amounts to &euro;86.5 million, which is a significant sum to make up in the current financial circumstances.  The Government and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, have encouraged the local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates and where possible, to reduce them.  This is one of the measures provided for in the action plan for jobs.  The other sources of funding for local authorities from 2014 will be the local property tax.  The Deputy must recognise that cutting motor tax would place inevitable pressure on locally-elected members to increase the take from the local property tax within the 15% discretion.<\/p><p>  Ensuring sustainable funding for local authorities is a priority for this Government.  Cutting one important source of funding, as the Deputy proposes, would damage our efforts to restructure the financial base for local authorities.

The property tax will bring in &euro;500 million at best.  Therefore, we will not see an increase in the services.  There needs to be a relationship between what people pay for and what they get in return.  Last week, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, stated that &euro;150 million was being taken out of the motor tax fund to pay the national debt.  That is not why people pay motor tax.

I can read the response provided to the amendment.  The need and resource model was developed in 2000 to assist in the determination of the allocation of general purpose grants to local authorities.  The aim of the model is to bring about equalisation between local authorities over time so that each will have sufficient resources from a combination of central grants and local income to provide for a reasonable level of service.  The model was first used to assist in determining a portion of the allocations for the local government fund in 2000 and was used after that each year until 2007.<\/p><p>  The amount provided for equalisation amounted to &euro;18 million in 2004, &euro;12 million in 2005, &euro;17 million in 2006 and &euro;16 million in 2007.  The amounts each year are consolidated into each local authority's baseline allocation for successive years, thus ensuring that progress is being made on a gradual basis to move local authorities towards a position of greater equity.  Equalisation and general purpose allocations since 2008 are based on the pattern of equalisation established by that model.  Local authorities had previously provided detailed annual returns and this action was very time consuming.  This approach to equalisation from 2008 and subsequently was used to release key staff to work in other areas.  <\/p><p>  In 2012, 99% of the available general purpose grant was allocated on the basis of the adjustment to the baseline.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, allocated the balance of funding towards those authorities with acute financial positions, as evidenced from their annual financial statements or engagement with the Department, and in relation to costs associated with the provision of environmental infrastructure.<\/p><p>  Equalisation remains a core principle and it will apply for 2012.  While all local authority revenue sources are under pressure, we are reflecting the need to ensure that local authorities have the resources to provide a reasonable level of service.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, remains committed to the principle of equalisation.  In the current difficult financial environment it is critical that the Government ensures as far as is possible that all citizens can expect a reasonable level of service provision from the local authority regardless of where they live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013031400005#D00500","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1363270800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>Is the amendment proposing the amendment of section 1 of the Act of 1952 agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013031400005#D00600","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1363270800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>It is not agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013031400005#D00700","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363270800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363270800,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363270800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Section 3, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363270800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Sections 4 and 5 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363270800,"counter":572,"content":"<p>SECTION 6<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1363270800,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 3 proposes an amendment of section 6 of the Local Government Act 1998, while amendment No. 4 relates to the Title.

It is to provide for the transfer from the Local Government Fund to the Exchequer during 2013 as a necessary measure towards the reduction of the national debt.  An amendment to the Local Government Act 1998 is necessary to allow for the legislative underpinning of the transfer.  The amendment provides that in determining the payment, regard must had to the balance in the balance in the fund when all commitments have been made.  The transfer is in respect of 2013 only.  In 2012, &euro;46.5 million of motor tax income was transferred from the local government fund to the Exchequer.  This year an amount of up to &euro;150 million is to be similarly transferred. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that the projected income to the Local Government Fund for motor tax in 2013 is in excess of &euro;1.1 billion.

Obviously it is being done in a transparent way in that the Minister of State is telling us that he is hijacking this money from the Local Government Fund.  This proposed amendment is not about motor tax revenue, rather it is about that revenue with part of it being used to pay off the national debt.  That is the reality of it.  I want to be as transparent as possible about that and I find the approach taken objectionable.<\/p><p>  The reason there will be more income in the fund is that there is an increase in the amount of motor tax that people are being asked to pay.  There is a considerable number of older cars in the national fleet.  With the distance many people live from where they work, they have the added burden of coping with the expense of the cost of commuting to and from work.  They have to pay road tax to have a vehicle on the road but rather than paying road tax they are paying a more general tax.  I wish to press the point that this is unfair.  The Title of the Bill, Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2013 should also include a reference to the national debt if we were to honest about what the Bill is about. <\/p><p>  I wish to return to a point the Minister of State made in response to the needs and resources model.  That model is fundamentally flawed in that the baseline when it was taken counted the needs of local authorities, which were varied.  For example, counties with communities that developed from the time of that baseline do not have new unmet needs included in that calculation.  There are wide variations in the staffing arrangements in local authorities.  For example, in County Meath there has been an increase in the population of approximately 40,000.  There are more people living in County Meath than there are in County Kerry but the number of staff in the local authority in Kerry is double the number in the local authority in Meath.  The need there would be greater because there is a staff complement that will have to be paid.  New facilities and services for growing populations are not included in that model and it is fundamentally unfair.  There is a double unfairness in this respect in some parts of the country because of the way that the needs and resources model is calculated.<\/p><p>  I do not know if the Minister of State heard Dr. Prionnsias Breathnach from NUIM interviewed on the \"Morning Ireland\" this morning; he spoke about the potential distribution of the property tax, the equalisation model and the types of difficulties that will be posed. <\/p> <p>This has not been considered in the context of the needs and resources model and I believe there will be serious problems with it.

Any one of these themes could legitimately form - I expect in due course they probably will form - the subject of extensive consideration by the committee and probably separate reports by it.  I will do my best to express some coherent thoughts on the three areas.  Given the time constraints I might confine myself to the first area &ndash; financial, budgetary and economic policy integration &ndash; and then return in more detail to the important issues of the United Kingdom and democratic accountability and legitimacy in the question and answer session that follows.<\/p><p> On the theme of financial, budgetary and economic policy integration in the European Union, probably the most sensible place to look is the extensive report produced by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, towards a genuine economic and monetary union.  We could call that the current culmination of a series of documents, interim reports, roadmaps, Commission communications and European Council conclusions, which constitute responses to the June 2012 invitation by the European Council to President Van Rompuy to do something extremely ambitious, namely, to come up with a specific and time-bound roadmap for the achievement of a genuine economic and monetary union.  The ambition of the document should not be underestimated.  It does only constitute proposals but we will see many of them come true, particularly the short-term and medium-term ones because they were mostly endorsed in the European Council conclusions on 13 and 14 December.  Whether some of the long-term proposals come to fruition remains to be seen.  Any document written by the President of the European Council with the collaboration of the European Central Bank, the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the Commission is no ordinary discussion document and it really needs to be taken seriously.<\/p><p> Three stages are envisaged in heading towards a genuine EMU, or completing the half-built house that is economic and monetary union.  Stage one runs from the end of 2012 to the end of 2013.  In other words, we are already in stage one.  Stage two runs from 2013 until 2014 and thus also to some extent involves activities which have already begun.  Stage three runs from after 2014.  The aims involved in the three stages overlap with each other.  They run into each other and they are multifaceted.  Rather than parse each stage, a better idea is to pluck out the three biggest ideas involved in the Van Rompuy paper.  These are the following: big idea No. 1, if I could call it that, is that of integrating the eurozone&rsquo;s financial framework or, to put it another way, creating a financial market union.  Big idea No. 2 is what is called integrating the eurozone&rsquo;s budgetary framework.  Big idea No. 3 is what is called integrating the eurozone&rsquo;s economic policy framework.  I would like to have a quick look at financial, budgetary and economic integration.<\/p><p> Big idea No. 1 is the creation of a financial framework, or to put things more ambitiously, which is the case in the Van Rompuy report, the creation of a financial market union.  This is really about breaking the perilous link, as we found out to our cost in this country, between banks and sovereigns.  It is about ending the situation in which when banks go under, they drag countries' finances down with them.  The proposals in this area are concentrated in stage one and stage two.  In other words, they are happening right now.  What I am talking about is the setting up of a single supervisory mechanism for eurozone banks.  As we are all aware, we have already had unanimous agreement of the legislative framework for that to guarantee effective, unbiased oversight so that banks do not get into trouble in the first place.  Second, work is also ongoing on the creation of a so-called single rule for banks.  That will include the adoption of the capital requirements regulation and the capital requirements directive.  Third, there is agreed harmonisation of national frameworks for resolution of insolvent banks.  We are talking about the recovery and resolution directive.  Fourth, is the agreed harmonisation of national deposit guarantee frameworks.  In other words, that is the draft deposit guarantee scheme directive.  The idea is to ensure sufficiently robust national deposit schemes are set up so that one does not get destabilising deposit flights between institutions.  Fifth, there is the setting up of an operational framework for direct bank recapitalisations for the European Single Market.  We will be interested in that one but also in how retrospective its effect might turn out to be.<\/p><p> That is all happening right now.  In terms of achieving the aim of what I call big idea No. 1, only the first main element is the single supervisory mechanism.  The second main element involves more harmonised deposit guarantee mechanisms.  The third element considered necessary is a single resolution mechanism.  Already, there is a draft directive on recovery and resolution.  The idea of that is harmonising the tools needed for orderly bank resolutions in all EU member states; in other words, sorting out bank failures.  The single resolution mechanism would go a step further.  It would move the responsibility for dealing with bank resolutions to European level.  Once the recovery and resolution directive and deposit guarantee scheme directive are in place the Commission is going to propose a single resolution mechanism.  A crucial element of what Van Rompuy is proposing is an appropriate and effective common back-stop as well; in other words, money, which would have been very useful if it had been in place like a lot of mechanisms associated with economic and monetary union when our crisis hit home.  The idea basically is that public assistance would be recouped via <i>ex post<\/i>levies on the banking industry.  That is big idea No. 1.  The plan is that it will be set up by the end of 2014.<\/p><p> Big idea No. 2 is what is called integrating the eurozone&rsquo;s budgetary framework.  Again, that is based on the reality that we are all economically interdependent, in particular within the eurozone.  When one country messes up budgetarily, we are all left picking up the pieces.  The idea is to ensure sound national finances and, vitally, as we have seen in this country, to build up the eurozone&rsquo;s capacity to deal with asymmetric economic shocks, which is what we experienced in this country.  We have already seen a huge amount of activity in this particular area.  Since December 2011 we have had the five regulations and one directive that make up the six pack.  I do not need to remind anyone that we have had running parallel to that the fiscal stability treaty.  The day before yesterday the European Parliament agreed on the two pack, involving strengthening eurozone surveillance and monitoring and assessing of draft budgetary plans.  To borrow a phrase, a lot has been done but a lot remains to be done.<\/p><p> It is probably fair to say that we have seen more stick than carrot in regard to stage one, even if the stick is necessary in order to ensure that we do not commit budgetary hara-kiri.  One could ask about stage two which runs up to the end of 2014 and stage three.  For stage two, Van Rompuy is suggesting the possibility of financial incentives being provided for member states to engage in valuable structural reforms.  Stage three is the most interesting idea.  Basically, what is being proposed is the idea of giving the European Union the ability to provide fiscal solidarity against adverse fiscal shocks.  Again, that is something that would have been most interesting had it existed when the Irish financial crisis hit home.  Van Rompuy does note that all other currency unions are endowed with a central fiscal capacity.  We do not have that in the European Union as a distinguishing feature.  I noticed that in the European Council conclusions of December that particular point remained conspicuously absent.  There are no guarantees that it is going to happen at the end of the day.<\/p><p> As I said, this is a report that has been considered by the presidents of all of the important institutions at European level so it cannot just be ignored.  There is always the point that if one eliminates the impossible, whatever else remains no matter how improbable must be true.  Is it possible for a European Union to exist without this kind of centralised fiscal capacity?  It is obvious that those particular presidents have some doubts in that regard.  We will have to wait and see.  There is nothing coming up in terms of European Council results in relation to that but certainly the idea is out there at the moment.  The Van Rompuy report does refer to choices regarding particular shock absorption mechanisms as to whether they would be macroencomic or microeconomic but I do not need to detain the committee with those considerations today.<\/p><p> Big idea No. 3 is the creation of an integrated economic policy framework.  The problem being addressed here again is that we are all economically interdependent and if one country pursues unsustainable policies that gets everyone into difficulty.<\/p> <p> In terms of the proposed solution, the Von Rompuy paper puts forward a number of ideas, one of which is completing the Single European Market, which will promote growth.  That is something of a perpetual aim.  It is not easy to achieve in difficult economic circumstances such as those we are experiencing.<\/p><p> The second idea is creating a framework for systemic <i>ex ante<\/i>co-ordination of major economic policy reforms.  Members might recall that systemic <i>ex ante<\/i>co-ordination is specifically envisaged in Article 11 of the fiscal treaty.  In other words, setting up a mechanism for that is envisaged and work on that is ongoing.<\/p><p> A third idea we can expect to see implemented in stage 2, Towards a Genuine EMU, is the idea of contracts, in other words, arrangements of a contractual nature between member states and the European Union institutions to bring about desirable structural reform.  It is a type of contract between the institutions on one hand and the member states on the other.  The idea is that it would be as a result of a dialogue between the member states and the EU institutions.  They would need to be approved and monitored by national parliaments, and the details of their implementation possibly renegotiated on the occurrence of a national change of government.<\/p><p> Those are the basic ideas being put forward, and I imagine they are the kind of ideas that need to be thoroughly discussed in Ireland.  There are also the issues of democratic legitimacy and accountability, and also the important issue of the United Kingdom, but I have probably used up my speaking time and I want to give Professor Laffan an opportunity to contribute.  With the Chairman's permission, I might come back on the other issues during the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363270200,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Yes.

The first message I have, which echoes much of what my colleague said, is that we are looking at more Europe, so to speak, in the euro area.  There will be further integration of a serious kind to retrofit the euro area to ensure it becomes more stable and sustainable in the longer term.  The euro area itself has settled on what I would call a very low trust regime in that there is still a major cleavage between the debtors and creditors, the prosperous and less prosperous, those with high unemployment and those without.  That remains a major challenge in terms of what is happening in the real economy.<\/p><p>  As my colleague said, retrofitting is the Van Rompuy roadmap that looks to develop the four pillars of the EMU.  First, on banking, I will not reiterate what my colleague said on banking other than to say that a banking union will have major implications for the Irish pillar banks, the International Financial Services Centre, and also for the Irish Central Bank.  There is high politics but there are also many technical issues, and that must be watched carefully.  That part of the Van Rompuy plan is proceeding at a pace.<\/p><p>  Second is the fiscal area.  In a sense one is looking at the build-up of very strong monitoring, surveillance and what I would call intrusive EU policies in the budgetary field.  That raises major issues for national parliaments, including this Parliament, because it will alter the timing of the budgetary cycle in Ireland, and the Commission will make recommendations about the Irish budget.  The question arises, therefore, as to how Ireland interacts with the Commission on this.  I do not believe the Commission should simply come to national capitals and talk only to finance Ministries and officials.  It must come into Houses like this and engage with the Parliament.  It is more stringent monitoring, more surveillance and what I would call the development of constrained politics.  That is important not just for the Parliament.  It also has implications for all political parties that aspire to holding power.  The budgetary regimes are shifting.<\/p><p>  The third issue is economic union.  I would argue strongly that a stable, long-term euro area will require automatic stabilisers, a capacity to intervene, and a capacity to help countries facing asymmetric shocks.  Therefore, we should work out the kind of stabilisers we believe are necessary for the euro area, and we should support that development.  That is not in the immediate agenda.  It is further out from that, but in the long term there is a very strong functional need for this in the euro area.<\/p><p>  To sum up, those three pillars are necessary if the euro is to remain a stable currency and we avoid the calamity of the past few years.  It will require more Europe, as it were.  In my view it will also require another European treaty at some stage.  Given that we are a referendum country, I know that the prospect of further treaties is always a challenge.<\/p><p>  It is also important to consider the format such a treaty would take.  Will it be a treaty of the 27 member states or of fewer countries?  We must think carefully about whether the fiscal treaty or compact has now become a model.  That has implications because the fiscal treaty was ratified once 12 countries agreed to it.  It did not require the unanimity of all.  Therefore, the referendum on the fiscal treaty in Ireland was the first time Ireland had a referendum on a European issue that was only about Ireland and that had no implications for the other member states.  Had we voted &quot;No&quot;, we would not have been part of the fiscal compact, but the fiscal compact would have happened anyway.  We do not know what will happen in terms of future treaty change.<\/p><p>  That bring me to the second issue, the euro area, and the so-called ins, pre-ins and outs.  There is no doubt that the European Union, <i>&agrave; la<\/i> 27, is now characterised by what I would call enhanced co-operation across the member states.  Law making among smaller groups of countries is now used much more frequently.  For example, a financial transaction tax has just been proposed for 11 countries, and there are other examples.<\/p><p>  In the long term the question that arises is the way this system retains unity, given this diversity or divergence.  In that regard one would distinguish between what I would call the pre-ins, who want to joint the euro at some future date, and those who are unlikely to do so.  Currently, I identify four countries that are unlikely to join, that is, Sweden, Denmark, the Czech Republic, although it might shift, and the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>  On the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, that has now become highly contingent following Prime Minister Cameron's speech, his desire for renegotiation, and his commitment to putting an issue of in or out to the British people at some stage in the future.  It is in Ireland's interest that we do everything we can to keep the United Kingdom as a full member of the EU.  We are its closest neighbour.  It really matters to us.  There is a benign scenario and a less benign scenario.  The benign scenario is that both the 26 member states and the UK can do a deal on competences, they will review what is happening in the EU, and on issues such as the working time directive or whatever, they will be happy to reach a deal that a British Government can then put to the people.<\/p><p>  It is almost, although not entirely, inevitable that there will be a referendum in the United Kingdom.  I think the Labour Party may have to offer a referendum but that may not be the case, and the current Government may not win the next election.  What is clearly at play is a high level of uncertainty and contingency about the relationship between the United Kingdom and the system.  It is important we display very strong support for continuing membership and that we engage actively in ensuring there is something with which both sides can live, but that is challenging because we are looking at a much more flexible EU and more flexible membership.<\/p><p>  That brings me to the third area, namely, democratic legitimacy and accountability.  If one looks forward ten years to where the system is going and at what is happening not so much in the institutions but also in politics across Europe, it is clear that party systems across Europe are under strain.  We see parties of both the extreme left and right acting as challenger parties, those in the centre getting squeezed, and a good deal of instability in party systems in a number of countries.<\/p> <p>How will Europe deal with this?  I do not think democratic politics will live with it for ten years, unless there is the prospect of prosperity for all countries in the system.  I do not think we can continue on this track for the next five years.  What really matters is what will animate politics across Europe.  There are the related questions of how the political actors can be held accountable and how national parliaments can respond to what is happening.  There is, however, no institutional or policy-based fix.  What we are seeing is that democratic politics is largely national - that is where the most important events take place for individuals in Europe - but the European Union is really important in terms of the policy remit.  This needs to be knitted some way or another.  These are questions of politics rather than institutions, but they also involve the question of how national parliaments can continue to be important arenas with democratic legitimacy, given that the European Parliament is becoming a much more dynamic and powerful actor.  Therefore, there are challenges for the country, the Oireachtas and members of this committee as politicians.  There are also challenges for us as analysts because prediction is always easier in hindsight.  All I have tried to do is give the committee a sense of where the drift is taking place in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Brigid Laffan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363270800,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for coming to speak on this important issue.  I would like to ask about Eurobarometer surveys and the attitudes of people in Ireland and across the European Union towards the Union and its institutions.  There has been a decrease in confidence and trust in European institutions.  Do the delegates think the reality of people's experience of the Union - the most recent experience in Ireland was with the troika - has affected their opinions of the Union and its institutions?<\/p><p>  Unemployment and emigration rates are still high, while the mortgage and debt crisis is pushing more people towards financial hardship.  This has the effect of dampening domestic demand and, in some respects, blocking a return to economic growth.  Do the delegates think this is affecting people's opinions of EU institutions?  What do the European Council and the Commission need to do to reverse this trend in public confidence?  In particular, what policy change, if any, is required?<\/p><p>  I have read Professor Laffan's document and heard what she had to say.  She referred to input legitimacy and said it was not just about giving a voice to the people but also concerned their responsiveness.  She said she thought there would be a new treaty.  In that context, how does she think the re-running of referenda feeds into this?  Going back to the confidence issue, when people say \"No,\" how does the reaction that there will be another referendum feed into the issue of input legitimacy?<\/p><p>  Professor Laffan referred to the democratic accountability and legitimacy of the European Union.  Last week the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Martin Schulz, said it was a Frankenstein Europe because there was not the necessary balance of powers across the European institutions.  He said people could not trust the Union when the division of labour was not clear on a legal basis.<\/p><p>  Professor Laffan said democratic politics was largely national, while Mr. Schulz said the European Commission was an undemocratic mix of legislative and executive powers.  He also said we needed to reform the Commission and parliamentarise the European Union.  I would like to get Professor Laffan's opinion on that issue.<\/p><p>  Professor Laffan referred to the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, and the British Labour Party.  I would like to hear her views on the recent result achieved by the UKIP candidate in the Eastleigh by-election and what it means for Mr. Cameron and the Tory Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400005#D00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1363270800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I am afraid we will have to continue this debate at another time.  I congratulate our guests for the manner in which they have laid out and grasped the issues before us.  This serves to focus once again on the challenging issues emerging for us, as Members of Parliament, and our colleagues throughout Europe.<\/p><p>  The question of the financial markets, as well as budgetary and financial frameworks, has been well and accurately laid out by Dr. Gavin Barrett.  As has been said before, we must all move in the one direction.  When the crisis hit, each country seemed to run for cover, while ignoring its neighbours to a large extent, with one or two exceptions.  That was how the problem arose in the first instance.  It is true Europe had never been asked to address an issue of this nature before.  <\/p><p>  There are lessons to be learned from history, of which I know the Chairman and our guests are keen students.  When crises struck Europe in the past, it turned on itself.  It was cannibalism for want of a better description, to which Professor Laffan also referred.  In the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt's guidance cajoled the people and led them in a different direction.  They were encouraged not to take the destructive route.  I ask our guests to address this point.  The destructive route is very dangerous.  It is as old as history itself and has been followed countless times on the continent of Europe.  Sadly and unfortunately, it seems to be moving in that direction again.   <\/p><p>  Professor Laffan referred to party systems being under pressure.  They are because they have nothing good to offer.  In addition, they have no easy options.  The Italian election in recent weeks was a classic example of where people wanted to go for easy options.  Unfortunately, however, there are no easy options.  It is a question of dealing with issues as they arise in the earlier stages, or dealing with a more serious issue in the not too distant future.  I do not accept the notion that we cannot arrive at that juncture again.  <\/p><p>  Various commentators have suggested the Second World War solved the problem that arose in the 1930s after the roaring twenties.  We find ourselves in a similar situation.  I do not believe the Second World War solved the problem, but humanity recognised that it was about to obliterate itself from the face of the map.  People across the globe, not in one particular area, recognised this.  They suddenly realised the seriousness of the problem and that untold damage could be done and it was.  I do not think modern Europe is conversant with what happened in that era, including the options that were taken and those that were not.<\/p><p>  A good point was made on democratic legitimacy, but where do we go from here?  Do we lead the people or <i>vice versa<\/i>?  That is what it comes down to.  It is a difficult issue that nobody else can really assess, except those on the front line.  Those of us in the public arena must seek public support to do what is right for the people.  It is a difficult position to be in.  It is easy to seek public support to do what people want, if that is the easy option.  Therefore, we all have to choose.<\/p><p>  There are those who believe the abolition of the party system is the answer to their problems, but it is not.  The opposite is the case.  I do not think the European Union can succeed socially, economically or politically without a single currency for the entire Union.  Professor Laffan also referred to this issue but did not come to the same conclusion.  All kinds of excuses have been made, but effectively we now have a two-speed European Union.<\/p> <p>It is going the opposite route to the way the founding fathers of the European Union who had experiences from a different time from which they learned wanted it.  Several weeks ago this committee heard from a delegation from the European affairs committee of the Swedish Parliament.  We learned that this committee has a veto over their Ministers at Council meetings.  The committee was asked on whose behalf the committee speaks when it has to use the veto.  Is it on the behalf of the people of Europe or the people of Sweden?  We know what the answer is in that case.<\/p><p> I believe when each member state takes ownership of the European project as if it were theirs and recognises the need to accommodate others, then we will succeed.  Until that it is done, we are wasting our time.  All we are doing is talking around the subject.  A classic example of this is when the euro was introduced.  We all thought, in our naivety, that the European Central Bank was going to control European fiscal policy.  It did not, despite the fact each member state had representatives on the bank's board.  Why did this happen?  It happened because each member state wanted to go its own particular route, looking after its own interests.<\/p><p> Enough said, although I could go on for ever and I know our two guests could go on for an awful lot longer than they have.  I would love an opportunity at some later stage to have a longer debate on this subject.  We need it in this country and Europe needs it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400005#D00300","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363271400,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I thank both speakers for an in-depth discussion about this issue.  I am a relatively new member of this committee, so I am still learning about Europe as I go along, notwithstanding the fact that I am a public representative with a mandate from the people.  How do we fill this democratic deficit between the people, parliament and the European Union?  The fact we have not come to terms with properly structuring the MEP system is a disaster.  If we are talking about accountability and legitimacy in the European Union, someone must convey this to the people.  Theoretically, MEPs are challenged with that task.  How do they fulfil this role?  In the case of Ireland, there were three elected MEPs who packed it in and now have substitutes representing them - Proinsias De Rossa, Joe Higgins and Alan Kelly.  It appears to some that election to the European Parliament is used as a route back to the national parliament.  Do we treat the European Union as seriously as we ought?  How are our MEPs supposed to be conveying the message of work they are doing in Europe to the people?<\/p><p>  The committee recently heard an argument - one that was dismissed but worth repeating - that the Irish political system is so clientalist-based that we will never achieve a sense of political reality unless the multiseat constituency concept is changed to stop the incredible competition between political parties and members of parties.  Is there a domestic platform for MEPs?  It would seem this fundamental structure is missing and MEPs have no domestic platform to convey the work they are doing.  Then it falls upon committees like this to come to terms with the European project.<\/p><p>  Does the delegation agree that to develop the concept of the economic and monetary union and bring the people along with its debate, that more of our Ministers, Prime Ministers and committee chairmen should spend less time at home and work more on the European agenda?  We know from our EU Presidency term that the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Ministers are forever out of the country doing productive work for the Union.  Given that Europe is developing and taking on more member states, is this the future for senior Irish politicians?<\/p><p>  We are in challenging times with three member states in bailout programmes and Cyprus heading that way too.  The people are suffering financially.  There is no government in Bulgaria.  Italian voters were so disillusioned, 20% of them thought there was nothing wrong with voting for comedians.  Given that austerity is hurting people and that Europe needs to consolidate and convey its message back to the people, are we doing it as well as we can?  I feel Ireland is rather unique in Europe in so far as our Constitution requires referenda on European treaties.  It provides a shock system to the electorate to decide on treaties such as Lisbon.  This debate on the future of Europe is so important that it has to be extended to higher and lower political levels, right through to all elected public representatives.<\/p><p>  As regards the future of Britain in the European Union, I presume Northern Ireland would be part of the in or out scenario.  Its Assembly already has eurosceptics such as Sinn F&eacute;in.  I am not quite sure where the DUP stands in the euro ball game.  I agree we must do all we can in our power to keep Northern Ireland in the European Union.  Notwithstanding the tendency to be opportunistic and say the Brits are out, let us start playing on the insecurity of foreign direct capital, target it for Ireland and ignore the English and all of that, we do need them in at all costs.<\/p><p>  These are rambling comments that the delegation might pick up on in their responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400006#E00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1363271400,"counter":618,"content":"<p>The committee regularly invites MEPs to meetings.  None of them is in attendance this week because it is Strasbourg week but we do hope for improved attendance from MEPs at future meetings.  On Monday, we had a fruitful meeting in Copenhagen at which I presented a paper to representatives of 20 different member states.  It dealt with how we co-ordinate the role of national parliaments at European level with the new European semester and the new system for economic governance with the European six pack and the forthcoming two pack.<\/p> <p>We had a very interesting discussion and a paper will be published with recommendations for enhancing the role of national parliaments.

There is also the issue of financial solidarity between member states when there are fiscal shocks in the system.  These are absent from the December paper, but if they go ahead, how will the measures be funded?  Will there be more fiscal union, new taxes or higher levels of contributions from member states?  Significant amounts would need to be available to cater for the fiscal shocks and structural reforms.<\/p><p> Professor Laffan spoke about how European politics might develop over the next ten years.  At a time when so many of our economic exports go to the European Union, what happens at a European level is very important to the country.  How does Professor Laffan see the role of European parties developing with regard to issues such as a joint manifesto at European elections?  How will European election campaigns change by the next European election next year and for subsequent elections?

With regard to financing shock absorption, very considerable resources would have to be provided to make a difference in that regard.  The suggestions put forward include national contributions, financing from own resources and a combination of both.  The point was made that a key aspect of fiscal capacity would be the possibility for the eurozone to borrow, with common debt issuance.  The implications of this should not be underestimated and the paper envisages the setting up of a common European treasury.  Perhaps it was the sheer ambition of ideas such as this which led to their not appearing in the Council conclusions.  Ultimately, we either want the euro to function or we do not.  If shock absorption mechanisms are needed, they must be of an appropriate scale, so perhaps the issue will not stay off the table.  If it is put on the table, these are the kinds of thing we will consider.<\/p><p>  A number of questions were raised, with democratic legitimacy being one issue and the role of the United Kingdom another.  I am not sure I have any particular comment to make on the United Kingdom Independence Party's performance in the latest by-election but it is part of a somewhat worrying trend across Europe in that regard, as well as in the United Kingdom.  It is vital to consider the relationship among Ireland, the United Kingdom and the EU.  We do not know what will happen in the UK and whether there will be a \"Brexit\" and, curiously, we are not even sure there will be a referendum on a British exit.  As Professor Laffan mentioned, that referendum is promised for the first half of the next British Parliament, at which time Prime Minister David Cameron, if current polls are anything to go by, will probably not be in power.  The holding of a referendum is dependent on the Labour Party's acceptance of the need for it, and so far it has been unenthusiastic.  The party will be under immense pressure to concede a referendum, although we are not sure what the result of such a referendum would be.  There are many issues up in the air with regard to the United Kingdom and I encourage the committee to consider such issues.<\/p><p>  The committee should also consider whether there will be renegotiation between the United Kingdom and European Union and the position to be taken by Ireland with regard to concessions.  Should we be in favour of repatriation of powers to the United Kingdom, for example, or minor concessions?  We must also consider what would happen if the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.  These are crucial issues, and they involve matters such as free movement of powers and the implications for justice and home affairs.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne and Senator Reilly in particular raised very important questions on democracy and what needs to be done.  It is a very difficult problem at a European level, as Europe is where decisions and policy are made in many respects but it is at national level that rewards are reaped.  Essentially, policy is at a European level and politics are at a national level.  It is very difficult to design an adequate democratic system which copes with that reality.  More parliamentarisation may be required, which would make the executive at a European level more responsible to the European Parliament, but that is difficult where individuals identify themselves primarily by national identity and may not feel adequately represented by the European Parliament.  That leads to difficulty, and the European Parliament, along with national parliaments, must have a role in that regard.<\/p><p>  With regard to democratic legitimacy and accountability in developing the economic and monetary Union, the guiding principle is that democratic control and accountability should occur at the level at which the decisions are taken.  That implies that, in so far as there are shifts to a European level, it will be the European Parliament which forms the primary forum for accountability.  At the same time, the pivotal role of national parliaments must be included.  I can go into further detail on the proposals for legitimacy or accountability in respect of the three areas I mentioned but these are the basic principles.  Nobody doubts the crucial nature of the question of democracy and the European Union, and the survival of the European integration project depends on our finding an adequate answer to the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gavin Barrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363272000,"counter":624,"content":"<p>Senator Reilly mentioned the decline in trust in European institutions.  It would be extraordinary if that did not happen, as Europe is experiencing the most serious economic challenges since the Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  One would expect a decline in trust in institutions.  With regard to attitudes in Ireland towards European integration, there is a solid core of support for Ireland's membership and the notion that membership is both necessary and good for Ireland.  That was seen very recently in a RED C poll indicating that 85% of Irish respondents would remain in the Union regardless of what the United Kingdom did.  It is the settled will of the Irish people and hard euroscepticism has much political leeway.  I do not expect it to develop.<\/p><p>  With regard to input legitimacy, the EU must become more responsive, and I argue that one way to do this is to marry monitoring and surveillance on the fiscal side to real social investment on the other side.  I expect there will be rebalancing as long-term politics demand it.  There was a question on running referendums again.  There is always a democratic dilemma in running a referendum again; we have done it twice in this country.<\/p> <p>In both cases it was done on the basis of an Irish Government asking for a mandate from an Irish Parliament. It was entirely democratic.  One third of the Irish electorate voted in the first Nice referendum on a treaty that was more important to east Europeans than to us.  It was absolutely right to ask us to vote again.  The other member states saw the Lisbon treaty as being in their interests and wanted to ask the Irish whether this was their final answer.  We are part of a larger system which requires our making these decisions in a very considered way.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Byrne&rsquo;s question on how Europeanised Ireland is, public knowledge of the EU is weak subjectively and objectively.  When confronted with European issues we are like students who suddenly realise there is an exam the next day and we do a lot of cramming so that we feel comfortable with the subject.  There is a real problem in communicating about the EU because most of the time we want the thing to work and we do not want it to bother us too much.  It only comes to our attention when it is highly problematic, as it is now.  There is, however, a real task to be done throughout Europe in political communication about the EU.  It is not about the jargon and acronyms but about how this part of the world, which is very small, can cope with a highly globalised and shifting world.  Europe has no choice but to hang together or it will fall apart, but we all need to debate and discuss what globalisation means and our connection with the wider world. <\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Durkan that party systems are under pressure, but I am also struck by how the centre is holding.  Although there are challenger parties on the extreme left and right, this does not feel like the 1930s.  We are not seeing the 1930s recreated.  There are pressures on politics in Europe, but also because countries are faced with serious challenges of reform.  The countries that are and will be prosperous are those that can adapt, adjust and reform.  The countries that can do that will survive.  For example, Spain has extraordinarily high levels of youth unemployment, but even in the boom it had a youth unemployment level of over 20%.  In other words, it had a lousy labour market.  Faced with a deep recession, the labour market freezes.  Adjustment, adaptation and reform are part of what it means to live in today&rsquo;s world.  That poses a real challenge for politics.<\/p><p> Europe does not have a party system yet in the way that each country has, but there is no doubt that the European parties are coalescing and strengthening and we will see a shift in the next European elections.  It has already been announced that they will be led by someone whom they will propose as the next President of the European Commission.  There will be manifestos.  I do not expect the next European elections to be transformational.  Everything in Europe happens in a slow-drip, incremental way and this is no different.  There is a drift from diplomacy to politics in the EU.  It is becoming much more like a political system than a diplomatic inter-state system.  That shift interacts and intersects differently with each country.  Some countries and peoples are more comfortable with it than others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Brigid Laffan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363272600,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in to speak to us.  I am sorry I missed the early part of Dr. Barrett&rsquo;s presentation.  I was at another meeting but I might get a copy of his comments afterwards.<\/p><p>  While we have touched on the level of Europe&rsquo;s crisis, with chronic unemployment and low levels of growth, it is worth acknowledging that what people thought was going to happen 12 or 18 months ago has not happened.  Until last summer, reasonable people were predicting that Greece would be forced out of the eurozone and that would lead to an unravelling of the eurozone, which did not happen.  People predicted that the European Central Bank would not play a greater role in keeping the euro together and dealing with our difficulties, which did happen.  The spectre of mass sovereign defaults plunging the entire economic system into catastrophe did not materialise.  Even though we are still dealing with profound crises for individual countries and the eurozone, many fears that were propagated during parts of this crisis have not materialised.  We cannot say they are unlikely to materialise in a year&rsquo;s time, but they are unlikely to materialise tomorrow.  That is significant progress compared to our recent situation.<\/p><p>  I was struck by Senator Reilly&rsquo;s Frankenstein analogy, which I had heard before.  It is accurate in two ways.  Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster was made of many different constituents, like the eurozone, and he came back from the dead.  I cannot recall what happened to him in the end so I will leave the analogy there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400008#G00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1363272600,"counter":627,"content":"<p>He was reconstructed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400008#G00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1363272600,"counter":628,"content":"<p>It is important to counter the fact of our terrible difficulty with the fact that the even greater difficulty which some thought likely has not happened.<\/p><p>  I have three questions on that point.  Professor Laffan spoke about the politics of constrained choice.  Would we not be dealing with that anyway?  Regardless of the nature of the eurozone, or what the EU will look like, globalisation is the game-changer.  It changes everything.  Alongside that are financial markets that will lend to countries in the future at the rate they think appropriate.  The eurozone and the EU just offer a way for countries to get through that constrained choice more safely.<\/p><p>  The idea that there is no choice, that no matter whom one votes for one gets the same thing, is detrimental to the development of politics.  Should we not be engaging on the subject of what the planned and orderly exit of a country from the eurozone would involve?  One of the big difficulties is how a country might leave the EU.  It might be clear but nobody knows how a country would leave the eurozone, apart from the fact that it would probably be a disaster.  If a country decides it does not want to be a part of this, how can it leave without bringing the entire structure down on everybody else?<\/p><p>  What would development look like?  Could we be heading towards an EU that will be extraordinarily fractured?  Could we end up with a patchwork quilt of participation in the eurozone, in which various countries such as Britain decide to opt in and out of different arrangements, or would that be too unwieldy to manage?  I know that the fiscal compact referred particularly to the eurozone, but Britain did have to participate in some of its consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400008#G00400","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1363272600,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming to the meeting and for their very interesting and thought-provoking contributions.  Some of my comments are similar to those already made.  Deputy Byrne and Senator Reilly spoke about the election system and democratic accountability, saying that the various countries have diverse electoral systems and historical experiences of democracy.<\/p> <p>Do the witnesses believe this makes improving EU accountability more difficult?  We have what is regarded as one of the fairest and most accountable electoral systems with PR-STV.<\/p><p> At present we are in an EU-IMF programme with targets to which we must adhere and issues regarding loss of sovereignty.  Will more European scrutiny of budgets, more surveillance and the natural tendency of politicians to blame somebody else - the present Government excluded, of course - increase the likelihood of anti-EU feeling across the country, which would have implications for referendums?  People might be inclined to believe that Europe is putting the screws on us and constraining us in our budgets, and therefore they will turn against the EU.  It is a rather simplistic view, but unfortunately one that is quite commonly held.<\/p><p> In general the UK has no problem with the Single Market but has problems with a number of other clauses and treaties as part of the European Union.  Professor Laffan spoke earlier about this country doing what it can to help ensure the UK remains within the EU.  I presume she is talking about opt-outs from various treaties, etc.  I ask her to expand on the particular ones she believes would help solve that problem.  According to the opinion polls a referendum on independence to be held in Scotland will be defeated.  However, if Scotland were to become independent, would it increase the chance that the UK would vote to leave the EU - the Scots presumably being more pro-EU?  Do the witnesses believe the British Conservative Party might start to regret its failure to support the alternative vote proposals of Liberal Democrats?  With the UKIP now eating into the Conservative Party's vote, it would be a natural transferee for the alternative vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400008#G00500","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363273200,"counter":631,"content":"<p>There are some very interesting questions there.  The Deputy mentioned optimism and pessimism - as some members may have noticed from my contributions to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, I am something of an incurable optimist about the European Union.  It rarely fails to surprise and it is still there, and yet it moves, as Galileo might have said.  There are certainly grounds for optimism.  The ECB has played a significant role in this regard.  Ultimately, its intervention is a holding action, and we need more.  We have not done too badly so far and it has done enough to survive.  Growth in the eurozone will certainly play a key role and the prospect of debt relief for Ireland remains important also.  Answers have been provided for some of the questions.  The European Union is a half-completed house.  We have a very small &quot;e&quot; but a very large &quot;m&quot; - we have monetary union but a very incomplete economic union.  We are now catching up in constructing the economic union.  Quite an amount remains to be done, but much is going on, as we have seen.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked if we were constrained in our choices.  Of course we are.  Sometimes we need to pay more attention to real sovereignty, as opposed to nominal sovereignty.  The choices for a small state can sometimes be very limited indeed.  The degree to which it can influence its destiny can be quite limited.  I believe that being in the European Union allows us to increase our sovereignty - in other words, increase our power to influence the decisions that affect every Irish man and woman.  That is a crucial reason for being in the European Union and also the eurozone.<\/p><p>  In terms of leaving the euro, monetary unions are easier to join than to leave.  The decision to go into the euro in the first place was crucial.  The costs of leaving a monetary union can be enormous because, generally, the reason for a country to leave a monetary union is so that it can devalue its currency.  As everyone is aware of that, it faces the risk of investment flight, bank runs and all such things.  The thought of leaving a monetary union only occurs when the costs of staying in it are so enormous that they actually justify the potential trauma of leaving it.  I do not believe any state, including Greece, is contemplating that at the moment and I do not believe it will happen.<\/p><p>  The European Union as a patchwork quilt is not a bad analogy.  It works at multiple speeds and it appears that will continue for a while.  I cannot see the United Kingdom, for example, joining the eurozone any time soon, so we will continue to have multiple speeds.  However, at the same time, its centripetal effect is also very striking.  In other words, states not in the eurozone at the moment will join it.  There are only around four states in the European Union that will not join the euro shortly.  While I agree it is a patchwork quilt, to a certain extent the patchwork nature of it is a temporary phenomenon in respect of many states, although there are exceptions - I would include, for the time being at least, the UK's objections to the eurozone in that regard.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked whether more surveillance of budgets would increase anti-EU feeling.  I believe the answer is &quot;Yes&quot; if national parliaments do not play their role in this regard.  This is why it is crucial that the Oireachtas consider very deeply its role in these measures.  The more Europe becomes involved, the more pressure there will be for an adequate democratic response.  Some of that can come from the European Parliament, but some of it must come from national parliaments.  It is incumbent on the Oireachtas to think about this carefully.  There may be winners and losers among national parliaments in this crisis.  Some national parliaments will come out of this financial crisis stronger and some will come out of it weaker.  I hope the Oireachtas comes out of it stronger because we will all pay a price if it does not.  I may not have answered all the questions, but those are the answers that strike me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013031400009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gavin Barrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363273200,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I will say two things about the politics of constrained choice.  Rather than putting the emphasis on constraint, I would put the emphasis on choice.  Regardless of the EU's panoply of surveillance, how much tax a country applies, whom it taxes at what level and how, and how much it spends are entirely national decisions and will remain so.  Rather than emphasise just constraint, we should recognise there will still be extraordinary choice.  That means that domestic politicians must face up to the choice, in that it is not being imposed.  All governing parties or parties aspiring to govern are within that space of constrained choice.  In Europe we have seen the challenger populist parties engage in the politics of &quot;You can have it all&quot;.  While populism is the easiest form in politics, with globalised markets people cannot have it all because the financial markets will ensure that a country cannot fund itself.<\/p><p>  In answer to the question about having no choice in exiting from the euro, I agree with Dr. Barrett about the danger of capital flight - not just international capital leaving a country, but a country's own population removing capital <i>en masse<\/i> without very stringent capital controls.  I believe it would be really difficult and probably catastrophic.  I do not believe countries would lightly contemplate leaving the eurozone.  That does not necessarily mean we will not reach a time when the world is sufficiently stable that it might be contemplated, but I am not so sure.<\/p><p>  The Deputy used the analogy of a patchwork quilt.  A quilt usually has a nicely designed centre, and in the EU at the moment, at the centre of that quilt is the euro area, becoming the hardest of hard cores.  It is not just a multi-speed Europe but also a multi-tiered Europe, and some countries will not join.  Can the EU manage this?  Up to now it has.  It can manage because it must - there is such diversity in income levels in countries across the panoply, from the borders of Russia to southern Portugal, that it has no choice.  However, differentiation is now an important feature of the EU and one that will continue to be part of the EU that evolves.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked about anti-EU sentiment and the budget.  In an interesting way, the new European semester will force budgetary systems in Ireland to become much more transparent and open.  The history of budgets in Ireland is that the Minister for Finance would arrive with his bag and no one knew most of its contents beforehand.<\/p> <p>In fact, it can open out the budgetary process in important ways advantage of which can be taken by national parliamentarians.  National parliaments should engage directly with the Commission on its recommendations rather than with their national governments only.<\/p><p> I was asked about the UK and competence.  My point was that the UK is engaged in a competence exercise currently.  Every EU competence is being examined across Whitehall in preparation for a phase of renegotiation.  There may well be a space as a result of the outcome of deliberation in the UK which overlaps with what is happening in the Commission.  The Commission has a great deal more work to do and would not mind re-nationalising some elements of competence.  There may be an overlap where the Commission and EU-27, as it will be with the accession of Croatia, meet the UK.  There may be some opt-outs but not many.  The UK will not be permitted an <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i>approach.

We have sought this opportunity to speak to the people's legislators because the issue is potentially one of life and death for people with epilepsy - it is that serious - and all those close to them, their families and friends.  We are not an organisation that is often in the public limelight and it is out of necessity to protect the health and well-being of people with epilepsy that we are here today.<\/p><p>  Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological condition.  It is characterised by unprovoked seizures which can occur at any time.  About one in every 20 people will have a single seizure at some time during their lives.  Seizures may take many forms, differing from one person to another.  There are around 20 anti-epileptic drugs on the market and there are surgery options for suitable candidates.  About 70% of people can become seizure-free.<\/p><p>  Epilepsy is a source of major long term, yet often hidden disability.  A diagnosis involves learning to cope with the physical impact of seizures, the medications prescribed to control them and impaired psychological and social functioning.  Loss of one's driver's licence, in particular, and employment and education problems, loss of independence, social isolation and the lingering stigma attached to the condition are all potential challenges that may cause as many problems as the seizures themselves.  According to the Department of Health's estimate, there are about 130 epilepsy-related deaths in Ireland each year, about half of which are due to a phenomenon known as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, SUDEP, the cause of which we do not know but we definitely know that they are seizure-related.<\/p><p>  Epilepsy Ireland is the national organisation for people with epilepsy, established in 1966, to work for and meet the needs of everyone with epilepsy in Ireland and their families and carers.  Our vision is to achieve a society where no person's life is limited by epilepsy.  Today, we have in excess of 8,500 members and ten offices located around the country, from which we provide services.  In addition to providing a wide range of support services to people with epilepsy and their families, we are also committed to raising awareness of epilepsy, training and educating health professionals and supporting Irish epilepsy research.<\/p><p>  We also act as an advocate for the condition of epilepsy and work to promote legislative and civil rights for those we represent.  Like any health care charity, we have concerns about funding and service levels, including the recent issue of the epilepsy monitoring units at Cork University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital, which remain unopened because of staffing issues months after work to complete the units finished.  The HSE has at least indicated recently that opening both units is now a priority and we expect to see them fully operational very soon.  For the 37,000 people with epilepsy aged over five in this country - we do not know the number with epilepsy aged under five - an even bigger concern is that of generic substitution of anti-epileptic medication.<\/p><p>  Next week, this committee will begin its consideration of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill.  The reason we are here today is to appeal to the members, as responsible legislators, to change the Bill that will come before them to ensure it specifically excludes anti-epileptic drugs from its terms relating to generic substitution and interchangeability.  This is something the Moran report, published by the HSE and the then Department of Health and Children, recommended two years ago.  Legislating for this exclusion will remove the risk that people with epilepsy will be exposed to through substituting generic drugs and the catastrophic effects which such exposure could bring up to and including massively increased risk of mortality.<\/p><p>  The reason for this is that AEDs have a particularly narrow therapeutic range.  Unlike the vast majority of medications used to treat other illnesses and conditions, any variation in the manufacture and composition of a tablet or capsule introduces a factor that can disturb balance and result in otherwise avoidable \"breakthrough\" seizures.  As things stand, finding not only the right medication but also the right dosage is a matter of expert skill and a degree of trial and error.  An epilepsy specialist such as Dr. Peter Widdess-Walsh or a neurologist will increase the dosage slowly over time until an ideal level is attained, something which will vary with each patient.  It is an very individual thing.  AEDs, therefore, are carefully concentrated for each individual to ensure good seizure control.  Introducing a generic that can vary significantly in form from the original branded medicine and, especially, from other generics of the same origin, introduces a factor that can undo years of work in stabilising an individual's seizures.<\/p><p>  Under the proposed legislation, as it stands, patients can be switched between different generics from month to month which can mean that they might receive a generic medicine with effectively 25% more active ingredient than the branded medication on one occasion and one with effectively 20% less active ingredient on the next occasion.  It is this large window for \"generic to generic\" substitution that is the real problem for people with epilepsy.  There are also potential concerns around the role played by inactive substances or additives, which do not need to be identical, in the absorption of the active substance.<\/p> <p>These safety concerns have been highlighted in numerous studies.  As a result, treatment guidelines in countries such as the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour, and France discourage anti-epileptic drug, AED, switching.  Other countries that do not allow substitution of particular AEDs include Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Greece.  Countries that have excluded some AEDs from substitution include Denmark, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.<\/p><p> Furthermore, as I stated earlier, the Moran report, published by the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive in 2010, specifically recommends AEDs be excluded from any system of generic substitution in Ireland.  It is because of these undisputed safety concerns that we are asking the members to include our amendment in the Bill, thereby legislatively guaranteeing the safety of people with epilepsy.<\/p><p> There are four important points that need to be made.  First, there is no risk of the floodgates being opened if AEDs are exempted.  We understand that no other patient group or organisation has come or sought to come before the committee seeking an exclusion for any other range of drugs.  The only group of people likely to be disadvantaged as a result of generic substitution are people with epilepsy.<\/p><p> Second, Epilepsy Ireland is not against the general concept of generic substitution.  We welcome moves to reduce the State's annual drugs bill.  We are also in favour of the use of generic AEDs when they are prescribed for new patients by an epilepsy specialist and on the<\/p><p> Third, the cost implications of excluding AEDs from substitution through the legislation are negligible.  While official figures we have seen indicate that &euro;75 million is spent annually on AEDs, almost &euro;40 million of that figure is accounted for by one drug, which was licensed as an AED but is prescribed almost exclusively now for neuropathic pain and other conditions, and for less than 1% of cases of people with epilepsy.  We want to be clear that our proposed amendment does not seek to unnecessarily exclude AEDs from substitution if they are prescribed for reasons other than preventing seizures.<\/p><p> Fourth, it is important to note that the points we are making here today are backed up by the entire epilepsy community, including epileptologists, consultant neurologists and others caring for people with epilepsy.<\/p><p> Regarding the Department of Health's view, next week the Minister will tell the members that the Bill is intended to merely establish a framework for generic substitution and that it should not exclude any particular class of drugs from substitution.  He will say that the Irish Medicines Board solely should have the authority to decide which drugs are deemed interchangeable, and which are not.  He will say that there is no need for an exemption for AEDs in the Bill, and that there are safeguards in the Bill to satisfy our concerns.<\/p><p> Epilepsy Ireland understands this position and accepts that from an administrative point of view, it is neater not to specifically exclude a class of drugs such as AEDs.  However, this issue is much greater than a desire for administrative neatness or a desire to make negligible savings within the State's annual drugs bill.<\/p><p> Refusing to incorporate the exclusion of AEDs into the primary legislation would mean passing up an opportunity to safeguard people with epilepsy.  Allowing for the possibility of substituting AEDs will create a dangerous environment for people with epilepsy.<\/p><p> In 2011, the European Parliament approved a Bill overwhelmingly, which was signed by a huge number of MEPs, introducing the European declaration on epilepsy.  That was sent to all health Ministers in the EU asking them to ensure that people with epilepsy were looked after and that research and care for people with epilepsy was affirmed in legislation in particular.  If this Bill as currently drafted is passed, Ireland's first reaction, at the time of its Presidency of the EU, will be to put people with epilepsy at risk rather than supporting them, as the European declaration intends.<\/p><p> Epilepsy Ireland is already aware of a number of cases where an individual's epilepsy has worsened having been switched from a regular brand to a generic.  This switching is taking place even now, despite the absence of legislation and of interchangeable lists.  Many pharmacists appear to lack awareness that AED substitution differs from other drugs.  They are already acting as though the legislation has been passed and are not making a differentiation for epilepsy or any drug.  This problem will worsen significantly if the Bill as drafted is passed.<\/p><p> As an association devoted to the interests of all people with epilepsy, we have prioritised this issue over many other pressing issues because we genuinely believe that the Bill as drafted presents a real and present danger to the well-being, safety and, ultimately, the lives of people with epilepsy.  That is not a claim we make lightly.  We do not doubt the bona fides of the Minister and the Department.  However, we urge the members of this committee, as legislators, to put aside party loyalties and use their critical role in the legislative process to put the wider public interest and the safety of people with epilepsy ahead of administrative neatness and convenience.  I thank the members for their time.  We will be happy to answer any questions they may have on the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Glynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363254000,"counter":646,"content":"<p>At the outset I would like to extend a warm welcome to all three witnesses, Mr. Mike Glynn, Mr. Peter Murphy and Dr. Peter Widdess-Walsh.<\/p><p>  It is hugely important for us as legislators, leaving aside our respective party and non-party hats that we wear here, to inform ourselves as we prepare to engage even more deeply on the detail of upcoming legislation, and this particular legislation on the pricing and supply of medical goods Bill.  I do not have extensive exposure to epilepsy, but I have had a number of experiences, including a very close friend who has been through this experience.  The words \"been through\" are important because Mr. Glynn has indicated that with proper medication and treatment, some 70% to 75% of people come out the other side and that there is a good result for many of those who have a seizure experience at some point in their lives, and this could present for any of us in this room who may have never had the experience previously.  That is important.<\/p><p>  Mr. Glynn made a point regarding the immediate impact following a seizure or a series of seizures, and the life-changing consequences of that.  He mentioned the driver licence issue and not being able to self-transport, the employment and education consequences, and the loss of independence.  Sadly, as with many other issues we have addressed here over the years, there is also a social stigma aspect.  We often think of the stigma attached to mental health, something that we, as an all-party committee, concentrate on trying to break, and will continue to do that, but there is a social stigma attached to epilepsy also and a reluctance on the part of some, perhaps many, to even expose the fact that they have this particular condition.  That must be addressed.<\/p><p>  I have a number of questions.  On the increased risk of mortality in the event of generic substitution and the inexactitude of the replacement drug, do we have any statistics in terms of either domestic or international circumstances that present?  I am sure it is not just anecdotal, but the witnesses may not have the detail with you here today.  Would any of the three guests be able to offer any further information on the increased risk of mortality as against any of the other likely or possible consequences of not having that exact drug consistency continuing?<\/p><p>  On the international situation, I note some uncertainty in the witness's presentation.<\/p> <p>He referred to guidelines in regions such as the neighbouring island, north of the Border and France that discourage AED switching.  However, he then stated countries that did not allow the substitution of AEDs included Britain and the North of Ireland.  Can I receive clarification on this point?  Are there guidelines or more prescriptive provisions?<\/p><p> The deadline for the submission of amendments to the Bill has passed.  I advise members that I have taken the opportunity to table appropriate amendments.  Members who may not be clear on this point should note that the door is not shut, even now.  If concerns are raised on Committee Stage, we can introduce amendments on Report Stage.  I claim no monopoly in getting this right and I am just making the point that if another issue arises, we will have another opportunity to address it next week with the Minister.  Report Stage will be taken in the D&aacute;il Chamber.<\/p><p> With regard to pharmacists and a lack of awareness, what engagement has there been with the Irish Pharmacy Union to try to address that significant deficiency?  Outlining the problem here is not enough.

Some months ago Senator Tony Mulcahy bent my ear on this issue and he has been pressing a number of us on it in recent months.  What we are discussing is not alien to most of us.  Our former colleague, the late Senator and Deputy Joe Doyle, had epilepsy.  He was a great advocate for people with epilepsy and a great role model.<\/p><p>  What is the legal position in the United Kingdom?  Is the system based on primary legislation, regulations or guidelines?  Will the delegates furnish the committee with the wording, be it in a regulation, statutory instrument or primary legislation?  This would be helpful in our consideration of the Bill because of the similar legislative processes in both jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  My next question concerns the fact that switching is taking place.  Some pharmacists are switching, although the legislation is not in place.  It has already given rise to difficulties.  I refer not only to the point made on epilepsy.  The point made this morning was very valid and is one we will be putting to the Minister next week.  If one is taking only one type of medicine, switching may not have a huge impact, but many older people who may be on 14 or 15 types of medicines may be affected.  If a medicine is being substituted, the pharmacist should explain to the patient or his or her family that this is the case.  It is important that it be explained to patients that a particular medicine is being prescribed for them.  To avoid confusion, they ought to know whether their heart or epilepsy medicine, for example, is being substituted.<\/p><p>  Is it not better to have a provision in the legislation that would tie a pharmacist to prescribing a specific medicine?  The delegation made a very strong case for patients with epilepsy.  There will be a very small cohort who, for one reason or another, will have suffered adverse effects on moving to another formulation of medicine, although the active ingredient will have been the same.  The last outcome one wants is a set of circumstances in which the patient must try, every time he or she enters the pharmacy, to convince the pharmacist that he or she needs a particular type of medicine.  Should we focus purely on AEDs or should we table an amendment that would allow the doctor or consultant to stipulate that a certain medicine should not be changed in any circumstance because of the patient's particular illness or the characteristics thereof?  I include people with epilepsy but also a very small cohort who, for various reasons, may not be able to adapt to changes in the formulation of their medication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400005#D00300","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363254600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I will ask Dr. Peter Widdess-Walsh to answer the medical questions.<\/p><p>  Most of the countries that allow generic substitution have many epilepsy specialists and neurologists.  If somebody gets into trouble, he or she can be referred to one of these specialists very quickly.  This cannot happen in Ireland.  There are so few neurologists, let alone epilepsy specialists such as Dr. Widdess-Walsh, that it may take a very long time to gain access to one of them when in trouble.  Getting somebody back on the rails can take much more time than it should and this must be remembered.<\/p><p>  In 2011 the United Kingdom was going to allow the substitution of AEDs.  I believe this is not included in the legislation.<\/p> <p>However, they communicated with patients, people with epilepsy and epilepsy specialists.  They had a listening consultation over a period of months and when they saw the case was so overwhelming, they stepped back and listened.  This is what we want to do here.  In respect of the United Kingdom, I note there is a proposal under the peace process that in the north west, services for both sides of the Border will be focused on Altnagelvin Hospital.  In that case, someone from Lifford who gets a prescription from Altnagelvin will be in a different position to someone from Sion Mills who gets one.  This would be a ludicrous situation and I note something similar happened years ago in respect of driving, when there were major problems with different legislation for epilepsy and driving.  This is the position in the United Kingdom.  While I do not believe it is in legislation, it is effective nonetheless that the Government there has indicated it will not allow substitution of anti-epileptic drugs, AEDs.  I will now hand over to Dr. Peter Widdess-Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Glynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363255200,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to speak.  I have been an epilepsy specialist for almost nine years and have treated hundreds of people with epilepsy and share Mr. Glynn's view and concerns about generic substitution of anti-epileptic drugs.  It is a specific class of drugs that should be protected.  In the case of other medications such as, for instance, cholesterol or blood pressure medications, a couple of points in difference might not make too much difference.  However, when one is talking about the chemistry of the brain, where even a slight alteration in brain chemistry in a patient with epilepsy can result in destabilisation of the epilepsy and seizures, this is a major concern.  Epilepsy is common and we think there is a prevalence of approximately 1%, or one person in 100 in western populations, which means it will affect every community in Ireland.  A patient with epilepsy who lives down the road and who gets a generic substitution will have a higher risk of having a seizure which, by its very nature is unpredictable and could occur at any time including when such people are behind the wheel or when there are kids crossing the road.  Consequently, there is both major concern for the patients themselves and a certain public safety concern.<\/p><p>  As for answering some of the medical questions, I refer to the risk of death from epilepsy.  While we do not have exact figures on sudden death related to generic substitution, we do know that sudden death in epilepsy is much more common than in the general population.  It is at least twice the risk of that which obtains in the general population and for patients who have more delicately controlled or difficult to control epilepsy, the risk is up to 20 or 30 times for sudden death when compared with a general population risk.  Consequently, we would expect to see some increased risk of death on foot of destabilisation.  In addition, studies have shown specifically after generic substitution that there have been increases in injuries and seizure-related complications, which have then required a switch back to the brand.  There are studies showing high rates of switching back from generic to brand for anti-epileptic drugs as opposed to many other studied classes of medications.<\/p><p>  As for the 20% to 30% change to which reference was made, these are pharmacological parameters and there can be relatively wide variations in such pharmacological parameters between different generics.  For a single drug, one could have up to 20 to 30 different generic formulations and again, a patient could get any particular one of those generic formulations when they go to the pharmacy on that particular month.  It is of major concern that there can be such a wide variation.  This number, when it boils down to actual absolute changes in the concentrations of medications in the body, would be in the order of 3% to 5%.  However, from our perspective these still are huge numbers in respect of those chemistry changes in the brain that can result in destabilisation of the epilepsy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Widdess-Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363255200,"counter":653,"content":"<p>May I also ask Mr. Peter Murphy to speak about the position in respect of pharmacies?

It is a long process and I do not believe this message can be promulgated in a matter of weeks or months.  There is much education to be done both for health professionals, including pharmacists and general practitioners, and for people with epilepsy.  This is a highly complicated area and it is important to be aware that many people with epilepsy do not necessarily understand the significance of switching.  People are not necessarily going to be vigilant in the long term.  The question is whether they will be assertive enough, when visiting their GP, to insist the words \"Do not substitute\" are written on the prescription as the Bill currently provides.  The Minister will argue the words \"Do not substitute\", as provided for in section 13 of the current Bill, is a measure that should satisfy our concerns.  The argument is that a GP or a prescriber can write \"Do not substitute\" and the problem is solved.  This is not the case and as we have seen, pharmacists already are beginning the process of switching despite the absence of legislation and of interchangeable lists.  If the Bill goes through as it currently stands, our role will not be limited to educating pharmacists.  We also will be obliged to conduct what I would call an unnecessary educational process to get across the message to the tens of thousands of people with epilepsy in Ireland that they will need to insist to their doctors that the words \"Do not substitute\" are written on their prescriptions.  In my opinion, this certainly is placing too much of an onus on the patients to look after their own health care in a complicated issues such as this one.  Moreover, in recent weeks alone, we have received approximately ten separate reports directly from people with epilepsy of switching actually having taken place.  A number of those concerned have allowed us to use the details to highlight this condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1363255200,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Have you spoken to the Irish Medicines Board on foot of these reports and the issues Mr. Murphy has raised regarding the conditions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400006#E00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363255200,"counter":656,"content":"<p>We have not spoken to the Irish Medicines Board directly on that issue.

Before Christmas, we attended a briefing session held by the Department, the HSE and the Irish Medicines Board on the Bill.  During that session, I raised the issue of AEDs.

At the time, the Minister of State was quite adamant that the Bill is, as he described, merely a framework to establish substitution.<\/p> <p>We believe it should be a lot more than that.  There is no reason why it has to be just a framework.  As we have heard, there is strong evidence which I do not think is generally in dispute.  We do not see the value in delegating such an important power to the Irish Medicines Board when such strong evidence exists.  In basic terms, why should the safety, well-being and health of people with epilepsy have to depend on the discretion of the Irish Medicines Board?  That is where we think this committee comes into play.  There is an opportunity here to do the right thing, to enshrine people's rights within the legislation through a relatively simple amendment.  It is one exception and there are no flood-gates.<\/p><p> We can take the Irish Medicines Board out of the equation, as well as all the confusion, by having an amendment to the legislation.

Surely the objective should be to do the best for public health.<\/p><p> When we met the Minister in January, his parting comment was that the Bill was intended to serve the public health of the country.  Of course it does in reducing the cost of medicines and enabling substitution where there are no difficulties - that is serving the public interest.  However, the interests of 37,000 plus people in Ireland will not be served if the Bill goes through exactly as it is.

Social exclusion, poverty and intergenerational deprivation have major impacts on life outcomes.  Social determinants at birth, including parents' education, health and housing status, are significantly correlated with children's educational attainment, health including mental health, employment chances and other significant life outcomes.  High concentrations of need at area level impose significant burdens on children and families, on services, communities and the State.<\/p><p>  A cycle of disadvantage is replicated, in part, because we are not investing in the right types of evidence-based supports to families to build protective factors and skills early enough in life and with sufficient consistency.  Disadvantage is heavily concentrated in certain geographical areas and family level disadvantage is compounded by neighbourhood effects.  Area-based approaches are critical to addressing this.  Structural cause and effect mechanisms of poverty can be impacted on through whole-community integrated service strategies.  We know what can work to counteract social determinants at birth.  With an integrated service plan, appropriate capacity-building, sufficient motivation and focus, we can measurably improve life outcomes for children living in areas of social disadvantage and risk of poverty.<\/p><p>  Youngballymun, along with our colleagues in Tallaght and Darndale, was established as a Prevention and Early Intervention Programme for Children in 2007.  Jointly funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and the then office of the Minister for Children, we were tasked with designing and implementing a ten-year strategy to improve outcomes for children and families in Ballymun.  To ensure a comprehensive lens was brought to planning the youngballymun initiative, we paid particular attention to the service design phase of the work.  Partners from across the education, health and community sectors, as well as local parents and residents, were brought together to strategically map out the needs of the area and appropriate evidence-based responses.  Our service design phase involved in-depth needs analysis across different ages and stages of development, the investigation of service strategies that had been proven to work in other contexts and in-depth reflection by local service providers on their roles in delivering measurably improved well-being and learning outcomes for children and families.  The design phase resulted in the development of a comprehensive area-based service plan, comprising four interconnected programmes of work - infant mental health, quality early years practice, social and emotional development, literacy and language practice, and youth mental health.<\/p><p>  Infant mental health is about activating the resources of parents in fostering healthy infant development through interventions by public health nurses, speech and language therapists and community practitioners.  The quality early years practice is about developing capacity of early-years services in Ballymun to implement the S&iacute;olta quality framework and the high scope curriculum.   The social and emotional development, literacy and language aspect involved interconnected programmes and initiatives to build capacity of parents, children and teachers to foster social and emotional development and language and literacy skills.  The youth mental health aspect is about re-engineering, ensuring access to and building the capacity of youth and health services to actively promote and respond to young people's mental health.<\/p><p>  There are a number of core features of the youngballymun model.  The life cycle response is fundamental.  We need to start from pregnancy and birth to build protective factors and set the right foundation.  From this solid start, we continue to implement rigorous supports consistently in a child's journey through life in tandem with public services.  Evidence-based approaches are at the heart of everything that we do.  All the initiatives we implement have a strong basis in evidence and ongoing analysis of child and family outcomes is central.  We must all invest in what we know will work.<\/p><p>  Changing outcomes for children means building capacity of those they interact with to foster and nurture their growth and development in a conscious and informed way.  This means parents, service providers and the wider community.  Capacity building is the development of specific skills and competence in order to implement evidence-based practice and to work collaboratively.  The practice changes that youngballymun promotes are taking place within existing systems - health services, schools, preschools and community groups.  The embedding of practice in mainstream services allows universal reach to a whole community of children and also for the practice to be sustainable.<\/p> <p>The youngballymun model is designed to be replicated.  The approaches we promote can be scaled up in other communities interested in this way of working and we hope to be in a position in coming years to support that process.  However, services are only cost effective when they deliver outcomes for children and families.  All of our work has a keen eye to efficiency and effectiveness and we are committed to delivering results and demonstrating returns on investment.  A value for money study forecasts return to the State of &euro;4.50 for every &euro;1 invested in youngballymun.<\/p><p> Outcomes to date from practice in Ballymun are encouraging.  Successful examples include a 70% uptake of the parent-child psychological support programme which an evidence-based programme for babies up to the age of 18 months delivered in partnership with public health nurses and speech and language therapists.  Early indications suggest that the proportion of babies demonstrating secure attachment, which is a strong indicator of a resilient protective factor, is greater than that of typical population samples.  We have published the evaluation of our early years three-four-five service and it indicates that measurable improvements have been achieved in the quality of service provision.  Children who have participated in a junior and senior infant social and emotional classroom curriculum, the incredible years programme, have shown reduced hyperactivity and conduct and peer problems, and increased pro-social behaviour.  In parallel, parents participating in the incredible years parenting programmes exhibit significantly lower levels of stress and depression following the programme.  These improvements are largely sustained at the six month follow-up point.  Increased time is being spent on literacy in schools and pupils&rsquo; literacy scores have improved across the primary school community.  The number of children in the lower percentiles has decreased and first class children in Ballymun are now achieving reading scores above national averages.<\/p><p> The programme for Government acknowledges the importance of drawing on a strong evidence base and reconfiguring existing services to fundamentally reform our approach to child poverty.  This is reiterated by the 2013 budget commitment to an area-based approach to tackling child poverty.   Youngballymun is an active working model of how an area-based strategy to tackle child poverty is delivering real results for children in the real world context of Ballymun.  The establishment of the child and family support agency, the new service commissioning strategies across the HSE, the priority given to evidence, the development of family support service pathways nationally and a renewed policy focus on supporting parents offer important opportunities for policy and practice integration locally.  We look forward to working with the Department of Children, the child and family support agency, primary care providers and other partners in prevention and early intervention to develop practice and share learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eleanor McClorey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363256700,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McClorey for the work she is doing and wish her well next Sunday in Croke Park.

I will instead speak briefly about our programme and the prevention and early intervention network.<\/p><p>  Our programme is based in the Dublin 17 area.  Typically it is attached to Darndale but it covers a wider area including Priorswood, Bonnybrook and Kilmore West.  We decided in 2004 that we needed to do something about the number of children in our area who were not school ready when they started primary level.  We commissioned a study using the early development instrument and found that more than 50% of the children demonstrated deficiencies in critical areas relating to school readiness.  We engaged in a planning process which was similar to that described by Ms McClorey with all of the health, education and community partners to identify what we could do in our community to address this deficiency and help children.  We collectively decided to develop a discrete programme focused on supporting families and parents.<\/p><p>  Our hypothesis is that if parents are adequately supported during pregnancy and the early years of a child&rsquo;s life, this will lead to improved outcomes for children, their families, schools and wider society.  Waiting until children arrive in school before intervening leads to a range of negative outcomes for children and their families which begin to manifest themselves as soon as the child starts school.  Many of these negative outcomes continue to be a drain on resources throughout the child&rsquo;s life and impact on his or her ability to fully engage.  We wanted to test the efficacy of investing in and supporting parents during pregnancy and preschool years.  We are carrying out a random control trial over that period of time.  Random control trials are governed by a range of restrictions and rules and we can only release outcomes when we have full sets of data.  As we currently have outcomes for six, 12 and 18 months, I can share this information with the committee.  <\/p><p>  The areas on which we are predominantly focused with parents are child development and parenting.  We are using a rigorous process including Triple P, which is an international evidence-based parenting programme.  In the area of child development we are using all the information that the HSE has made available but we are packaging it differently to make it accessible to families.  The programme is based on working with families in their own homes.  The vast majority of families, or approximately 80%, agree to work in their own homes but if that is not their preferred option we will work with them in community settings.  We are also supporting all of the early year settings in our area to improve their quality.  We have participated in the S&iacute;olta quality framework and we are delighted that six of our services have been accredited by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Our intervention with families is holistic and takes place on a wide variety of levels.  It includes physical health, social and emotional development, approaches to learning, language and literacy and cognition and general knowledge.  We are trying to support parents and their children across these areas.  The Geary institute in UCD is working with us on our research and a number of international people are also involved.  Members may be familiar with Richard Tremblay, an associate professor in UCD, who is leading this part of the research.  <\/p><p>  We are finding significant results after six, 12 and 18 months in a number of important areas.  We are starting to find significant results in cognitive development of children in both growth and fine motor skills.  We are also seeing a number of positive developments in parenting.  One of the parenting outcomes is that parents are less hostile towards their children.  There is a detrimental effect on children's growth if parents have a hostile relationship with them.  Reducing hostility improves the parent-child relationship.  We are also seeing improvements in home environments so that children are being brought up in more stimulating and safer environments.  There are significant improvements in interactions between parents and children, in social support for parents and in the health of the children.<\/p> <p>In the current climate we are very conscious that obesity and child health represent a major issue.  Diet needs considerable attention in communities such as ours because, unfortunately, many of the children would not have a very rounded diet and we are working effectively with parents on that.<\/p><p> From a medical point of view, we have also had some very significant birth outcome impacts where the number of women who had caesarean sections at birth was significantly below the national average and the number of women who had induced labour was also significantly lower.  The medical community has got quite excited about this because it has failed to impact on those areas.  The work we did with parents during pregnancy seems to be the factor that has made a big impact there.<\/p><p> We will continue to work with these families.  The first of the children started school in September and the rest of the children in the study will start in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  Unfortunately, our final results will not be available until the last child arrives in school, but we are incrementally releasing the results.  At the moment we have our six, 12 and 18 months' reports which are available on our website - I flagged that on the document I submitted to the committee.<\/p><p> Nationally, 25 organisations are involved in prevention and early intervention work.  Over the past two years we have formed a network, the Prevention and Early Intervention Network, which has become a very vibrant and active network which has gained considerable traction.  We have had considerable communication with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, with politicians and policy makers.  We are delighted with the interest in this area at the moment, as Ms McClory said.  It is a very rich environment for child policy at the moment and we want to contribute our piece.  We all collectively believe that investment in early intervention and prevention will, in the long term, produce better outcomes for children, families and for the country as a whole.  I have some cards on the Prevention and Early Intervention Network and if members are interested, details of the work and research we are doing are available on our website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400009#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363257300,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly - it is good to renew his acquaintance again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400010#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363257300,"counter":687,"content":"<p>We met on the sidelines over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257300,"counter":688,"content":"<p>It was many years ago.<\/p><p>  I now call Ms Marian Quinn, chief executive officer of Childhood Development Initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400010#J00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363257300,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I have no football analogy for which I am deeply sorry.  I feel very bereft - I will get a whistle next time.  I live and work in an area that is not doing terribly well in any sporting domain.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present today.  Given what Ms McClory and Mr. Kelly have already said, there are things I do not need to repeat.  We appear the morning after a new pope has been elected.  His commitment to anti-poverty measures and social reform is worth noting given that the focus this morning is on how we can respond to child poverty.  Some synergies may well yet emerge.<\/p><p>  We know the Government and its predecessors have had a commitment to prevention and early intervention.  The research is consistent on the costs and benefits, and the purpose of prevention and early intervention.  The three organisations appearing before the committee this morning are seeking this, and the programme for Government's commitment to area-based responses offers the opportunity to maximise the investment made, to utilise the learning we now have with a view to ensuring that we best support children, families and communities in improving outcomes.  Having said that, the context for the work CDI does in Tallaght west is very similar to the work in Ballymun and Darndale.  The communities are very similar, which is why we were chosen.  When the profile of the populations was considered in 2006-06, they were identified as three of the most disadvantaged communities.<\/p><p>  We also went through a process that Mr. Kelly and Ms McClory both described for their areas, which was a very significant consultation and needs assessment, which in the case of Tallaght resulted in the document, How are our Kids?  In 2006, Senator Zappone made a presentation to this committee and last year we had the opportunity to present the document, How are our Families?, to this committee, which was a repeat of that work and another comprehensive insight into life for children and families in a disadvantaged community.  Both of those reports provide a framework for the work CDI is doing in Tallaght west.  That process across the three organisations that lead on the prevention and early intervention programme needs to be a core element of any area-based response to child poverty.<\/p><p>  As a result of the How are our Kids? report, we developed a number of services to respond to the priority needs.  I will not outline them in detail as they are listed in the presentation, but I can respond to questions on them.  We have eight independent evaluations, seven services with very specific outcomes identified, all of them being researched very rigorously, three through randomised control trials.  Five of our evaluations have now been completed and published and the reports for those five are all available on our websites.  We also have a policy paper for each of our evaluations and I have brought copies of those.  They identify the key outcomes, findings, recommendations and policy implications.  If people are interested, I can come back to any of those individual pieces of work.<\/p><p>  After six years and having completed and published five of the eight independent evaluations, there are some recurring themes.  They can be taken on the basis of the individual child and what we know about what helps individual children to achieve their maximum development.  We also know there are things that happen at a family level, very importantly at a service level and also at a community level.  Mr. Kelly and Ms McClory both talked about some of the outcomes for individual children and again we can talk to some of that, particularly regarding some of our speech and language, and literacy initiatives.  At a family level the kinds of interventions all three of us have been doing are resulting in improved home learning environments with parents feeling more confident and able to engage to support their children's development all of which is very important.  At a service level all three organisations have taken responsibility for co-ordinating, enabling and supporting an interagency approach to the needs of children and families in the community.<\/p><p>  The work has identified some deficits that need to be addressed in terms of the pre-service and in-service training of professionals who work with children.  All of our services work with professionals, who are qualified, well trained and well supported.  Regarding all of our services, including those working with teachers, early-years providers, social care workers or youth workers, every one of our evaluations found that the professionals felt ill equipped to effectively engage with parents.  Some really important policy recommendations need to be considered if we are all to be best fitted and best able to engage with children and families effectively.<\/p><p>  My presentation deals with our approach to child poverty in Tallaght west.  We do not believe it is possible only to work with the child.  There is an ecological approach where we know that we also have to engage with the family and we have to engage at a community level.  Poverty is at the root of dysfunction and disengagement, and underpins all the negative findings that our three communities have demonstrated for decades.  There needs to be an economic response as well as individual child and family responses.<\/p><p>  We have set out what we believe are really core processes that have enabled CDI in Tallaght west and all the other two sites to begin to develop, deliver and evaluate effective responses to child poverty.  It needs to start with that interagency approach.  That requires leadership, commitment and buy-in.  The buy-in is about being prepared to do things differently.  We know that for 20 years in Tallaght west there has been massive investment in children and families.<\/p> <p>Every service one could ever want is in Tallaght west but we also know that until the last decade, there was no change in outcomes for children and families.  Business as usual has not worked.  It is not just about money or extra money.  It is about changing the core of what we do and how we do it.  Some of those processes are set out.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363257900,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quinn for coming before the committee again.

I was asked last night to speak to the committee so my presentation will not be anywhere near as refined and smooth as those who have gone before me.  In terms of a football analogy, it occurs to me in listening that we all play what is put in front of us.  I walk in every day as a teacher and that is what is in front of me and what I must deal with.  Mammy gets up in the morning, there is one child bouncing off this wall and another off that wall and that is what Mammy must deal with.  I will continue on from where Ms Quinn finished.  Colleagues here spoke about the three areas.  We are from the inner city, if I may be so bold as to say.  We are the original and best but what is interesting is that we might have been forgotten.  I am fascinated by and watch very carefully what is going in these areas, such as Limerick Regeneration.  I am always digging for ideas.  Although we had Tony Gregory at one stage and social partnership grew out of it and we had different organisations like the Inner City Organisations Network, I am jealous of the focus, organisation and direction I see growing in these organisations.  Ms Quinn made the point that it is business as usual and it has not worked.  This is a great place to start.<\/p><p>  We launched a report last week entitled \"The Boundary Wall\".  A group of us got together out of a slight sense of frustration.  It involved those of us working in schools and early years education and all the organisations dealing with children and young people in the community getting together to ask the community and children for their perspectives and what had changed.  It is something of a mixed bag.  From one perspective, we could say that things have really improved.  As a principal in the senior boys school in Sheriff Street, I can say that the Celtic tiger hit us about 2006 and 2007.  I was not getting an outbreak of impetigo and scabies every year in the school.  We started having a little traffic jam at the gate in the evening.  It dawned on me that no parents had cars up to the late 2000s.  It came in around 2007 and 2008 and left in 2010 and we feel we are back in the struggle against poverty again.  <\/p><p>  I could tell the committee that I inherited a school that was in bits, which was true.  It had a daily attendance rate of 84% and in ten years, we moved that to 94%.  When I inherited the school, the percentage of children missing 20 days or more in 2005 was 28% to 30%.  In 2010, this percentage was 10%.  That is all marvellous and makes great headlines in newspapers but it is not working.  I concur with my colleagues here.  I am very interested in Mr. Kelly's work with early years - the age group between 0 to 3 referred to in the curve by James Heckman from the Geary Institute.  I would come back to what Professor Kathleen Lynch said at our launch, which is that equality of opportunity can only be gained when there is greater equality of condition.  In our country, we have a top and a bottom.  I use the Celtic tiger analogy again but it fascinated me to see kids in certain families in 2007 and 2008 showing up regularly on time because perhaps Daddy got a job doing a bit of scaffolding and there was a bit of work for Mam.  Suddenly people had some hope.  We try to run what we do on respect, hope and trust.  These people have done a fantastic job.  <\/p><p>  We are hearing about a bottom-up effort and bottom-up striving.  Unless it is led from the very top - this is a small country - I do not know whether we will achieve the outcomes we need.  The outcomes I need, because I will retire in about 15 years time, are to avoid a pension crisis.  That means all the lads in my school must do well and get jobs so that my public service pension can be paid.  We all think from our own perspective.  I appeared in a programme called \"Townlands\" in 2000 or 2001.  I spoke about what these people are talking about, namely, a continuum of support from the cradle onwards.  One sees the anger in young people because I am telling kids that if they come to school and work hard, they will do well.  Lads have come back and told me that they worked hard but that it did not happen for them.  That is what Ms Quinn says and is so true.  In North Wall, we had a load of unemployed dockers and seamstresses by 1980.  When I look at all the things we have done, today we have exchanged that for a load of unemployed painters and decorators trained in F&Aacute;S and unemployed hairdressers.  <\/p><p>  The challenge is there.  I agree with all of the early years stuff but to make it work, I suggest that any report produced by the committee needs, to use a terrible phrase, a tsar.  I need to be accountable.  I do not need to sit in the North Wall Education and Welfare Group and have a veto because I need to protect and manage my little school and because I must fight with somebody next year to get funding.  Technically, we have subsidiarity so we are watching each other all the time.  This the way all of us must do business.  We are all concerned about where the next bit of money will come from and how we do this and that.  Policy is so interesting because we get policies that really work for us and at the same time, we get other policies that work against us.  I was talking to Mr. Gannon on the way over and we said that there is some great work going on in the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs and we have a wonderful piece of legislation.  I do not like my 15 year olds having guns hidden in the back of the garden, which is pretty much a reality.  Services like SWAN Youth Service make a huge difference in this regard.  These are kids with challenges but SWAN Youth Service helps keep them off the street and out of prison.  However, its budget has been cut by &euro;65,000.  We need a tsar.  It needs to be at the level of the Taoiseach's or T&aacute;naiste's office.  It need to look at areas like Waterford, Limerick, Cork, Ballymun and Tallaght.  It also needs to look at the inner city.  I said to Mr. Gannon that North Wall is very small and has only 2,000 people but perhaps the inner city could be looked at.  They need to come in,  look at services and say there needs to be some rationalisation and focus and start in terms of what Mr. Kelly is talking about with building resilience and supporting families.  <\/p><p>  Our frustration results from us knowing what we can do.  It is about making it happen.  Unless this is led from the very top of whatever Government is in power, it will not work.  We often talk about the Finnish experience.  They do the following things well - structure, planning and strategy.  Perhaps it is not an Irish thing but it is something we do not do as well.  Finland got rid of its inspectors in 1995.  It had a banking crisis and put the money elsewhere in education.  To support the excellent work that is ongoing, we need to try as best we can to maintain the funding and supports we have but to develop and get where we want to be.  Our vision is children going to college and being happy and sustaining those communities.  It needs to be led from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Government of the day and the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste's offices.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Candon"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257900,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Candon for his very challenging presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400011#K00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257900,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I will come back later if that is OK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400011#K00500","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257900,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I join with the Chairman in welcoming our guests this morning.  I do not have a series of questions to pose to the delegation.  In respect of many communities the length and breadth of the country, we listened in awe and hope because what the delegation has explained and outlined is a template.  That is the real message.  It is a powerful presentation that offers that hope.  We know there are only three projects in the prevention and early intervention programme.  I have spoken with some members of the delegation before and we know three further projects are promised.  Communities in various locations, not just in this city but beyond, hope whether they can be one of those three.<\/p> <p>Given that mine is a rural constituency, it is not likely to be included at an early point.  I, therefore, ask about the capacity of the programmes which have been outlined by delegates.  What numbers are engaged in delivery?  There is a huge commitment in terms of home visitations.  How does this translate in human resourcing terms?  Perhaps they are not the right words to use, but what are the footfall and throughput?  With how many can the programmes cope?  Mr. Noel Kelly said a figure of 200 pregnant women was the starting point for Preparing for Life.  What is the situation in relation to Young Ballymun?  Can we be provided with comparisons?  That is not to exclude anything other delegates said.  Would any of them like to suggest this is a template that is only applicable to concentrated, urban areas, or will it have application in vastly rural areas?  I represent the largest constituency geographically in the State.  It stretches from a point ten miles from the Irish Sea to a point 25 miles from the Atlantic.  The population is comparable to that in some of the major housing areas of Dublin.  Can the programmes and initiatives cope with the extra pressures and challenges presented by a sprawling rural area?<\/p><p> This is all about preparing young children for life.  Often times a failure of the past was to measure by reference to achievement.  Measurement must be by reference to participation and equal opportunity.  Mr. Kelly made a point about the utilisation of phraseology and making a strong start.  The committee met Mr. Toby Wolfe just the other day to discuss Start Strong.  I made the point then as an elected voice that more and more I was finding that young people were no longer able to access the fulfilling opportunities of sport, drama and music.  Other colleagues will have seen this and heard it if not from their own children, then from other families.  These are some of the early indicators of where poverty is really starting to bite.  It is poverty when a child is denied access to activities that his or her peers continue to enjoy.  It perpetuates the idea of the haves and the have-nots with which we all grew up and about which we know only too well from our own childhood memories.  It must be addressed.  The delegates are dealing with it at a very early point and there is no better place to start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400011#K00600","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363258500,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank each of the groups for attending to discuss an issue I look forward to us trying to get under a little more.  While we all agree on the need for early intervention and prevention, the difficulty often concerns early acknowledgement.  We do not intervene until much later in the cycle for the child.  We all know there is a problem, but the question is whether the supports are available to allow for intervention.  The issue of return on investment is very important in the context of early intervention in a child's life.  Equally, we know that if we do not follow up early investment with investment at other stages in a child's life, the return on investment is hugely reduced.  All too often, we focus on only one part of a child's life, not on the journey he or she undertakes.<\/p><p>  There are difficulties with the area-based approach to tackling child poverty.  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to children living in rural areas where there was consistent poverty.  It is not just a problem in urban areas.  There are particularly vulnerable groups, including Traveller and migrant children and children in families which have been disproportionately affected by budget cuts, including children of lone parents or in other groupings.  Part of me questions - I am being very upfront - the fact that each of the pilot schemes on which presentations were made adopted very different approaches and programmes.  While there are positivities in this, there are also difficulties for us in trying to evaluate them.  How do we decipher the numerous evaluations and move forward with a model?  One model takes the area-based approach, but how is it to be replicated in places that will not benefit from being one of the chosen areas?  This is where we need to create a more national policy.  The approach set out will involve the Government seeking philanthropic partners, but is that realistic with the exit of Atlantic Philanthropies from the sector?  I do not see other major philanthropic partners appearing.  It may be that there will be philathropy at project or community level, but the question arises as to whether a major philanthropic partner will emerge.<\/p><p>  While the work the groups before us are doing is tremendous, the question arises as to how we can replicate it and avoid a territorial approach which is about each area looking to ensure its own survival.  At our hearings on Tuesday we heard that there were too many pilot programmes.  The issue is to look at the next step and determine how we can mainstream and widen programmes to ensure we get a return on investment throughout a child's life.  We know about the life chances of children and teenagers living in poverty.  It is important to look at the very early years and most times when people think of early intervention, they think of toddlers.  I do not think of toddlers but of intervention throughout a child's life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400012#L00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1363258500,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for attending and making their presentations.  I also thank them for the broad overview of their work.  There are different approaches, but what emerges in common is that the pilot projects use services which are already available in communities.  It was not just about what was being done but how it was being done.  That is what has changed.  We talk a great deal about inter-agency work, but I would like to tease out the difficulties which must be acknowledged.  There are countless examples of people trying to do good things in particular pockets of communities.  Mr. Mark Candon is perhaps an example of someone like this.  However, these examples are very much personality driven.  They are not matters of policy and will not, perhaps, be replicated elsewhere in the absence of these individuals.  It is not good enough that it is left up to a personality.  This is about how we deliver services as a state and a recognition that we all have a responsibility in delivering services to children.<\/p><p>  My experience before being elected was as a social worker.  Working with a family, I was the only professional across the services willing to visit the home.  Other services might have a policy to issue two letters for speech and language services or a psychological assessment appointment for a chaotic family with poor literacy skills.  The appointments are missed and the child then comes off the list.  That issue would have been eradicated if other professionals were willing to come on a home visit with me and carry out an initial assessment.  We tried to pilot that approach in Clonmel, but management moved on and in the absence of a policy, the practice stopped.  There are professionals throughout the country sitting in offices waiting for people to attend appointments who never arrive.  These professionals still get paid.  It is a question of how we utilise the services we have available in our communities to best meet the needs of all children.  We must acknowledge that while the phrase \"inter-agency work\" rolls off the tongue, it is hard to achieve.  People are worried about giving away responsibility and budgets.  We must adopt a service design approach to delivering community services.  I would be interested to about the experiences of the delegates and their views on what we could do better to meet the needs of children nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400012#L00300","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1363259100,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me time to make a few brief remarks, and I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  To consider international comparators with regard to the area-based approach, I am most familiar with West Dunbartonshire in Glasgow, where, as opposed to waiting for the national government to churn out a policy eventually, local solutions were found when an individualised problem with literacy levels among children was identified.  We may need a value shift in national policy.  Other jurisdictions use different language and speak about moving towards the total eradication of illiteracy, whereas we speak about tackling educational disadvantage.  Do we need to be more ambitious and use terminology that depicts child poverty as a disease which must be eradicated?  Are we too comfortable with where we are?<\/p><p>  What the witnesses are dealing with is a crisis of underachievement, disconnection, disempowerment and poverty.  Unfortunately, when one digs deep into preventative approaches in projects involving children, there can be a great deal of fluff.  Mr. Candon and I worked quite closely together in Sheriff Street for many years and had the misfortune to deal closely with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  We learned quickly the value of taking a photograph of an impoverished-looking child while sitting behind a laptop; if one takes a photograph it looks like one is doing something.  It is more difficult to have a long-term strategy that can dig deep to empower the child and his or her family to find a way out of this poverty.  An evidence-based approach is needed.  We have spoken previously about the Hart-Risley report and the differential between the oral language skills of a three-year-old in a professional family versus those of a three-year-old in a welfare family.  We have spoken about maternal depression and isolation and the huge crisis this represents in certain areas of the country.  One project, which I will not name, dealt with the percentage of infant children who decided their own bedtimes.  These crucial areas have not made it into mainstream discussions on what has an impact on children.<\/p><p>  Deputy Conway made a very good point that we cannot depend on the goodwill of an inspirational person.  Many communities depend on such goodwill, but the State must step up to the mark.  The State has been allowed off the hook by those who are willing to go the extra mile in their communities, but this is not good enough any more.  Far too many services know the boundaries of their responsibilities and are very keen to stress them.  These include the HSE, education services and housing authorities dealing with estate management in various communities.  None of these agencies seems to have a mechanism for speaking to any other.  I am taken with Mr. Candon's suggestion of an overall tsar who might be able to knock heads together and start delivering benefits for children.  Parental empowerment is key.<\/p><p>  How would this be mapped over a prolonged period of time?  Early intervention strategies can show great results in the fifth or sixth year of a child's life.  How is this maintained over a long time when a child begins to plateau at the age of ten in primary school and cannot move to the next level of literacy that is needed to tackle secondary education?  Do we need a 20 or 30-year strategy to tackle child poverty?  Is there something the political system can do collectively?  Party politics is one thing, but child poverty is far too important for us to play politics with, and it should not change every five years with a change of government.  Do we need a plan we can all buy into for eradicating child poverty?  I would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400013#M00100","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1363259100,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their presentation.  I apologise for missing some of it but I thank them for forwarding their documents prior to the meeting.  Listening to what previous speakers said, I got the impression that there is concern about the future viability of certain projects and there is a lack of inter-agency working relationships.  This is a pity, because at a time of scarce resources it should not be a question of protecting one individual project over another; we need to ensure that scarce resources are put to their proper use, which is to protect children and families that urgently need to be protected.  It was interesting to hear what Mr. Candon said about having somebody in an overarching position to take control and ensure the resources get to the people for whom they are intended.

One can get lost in the individual differences at surface level between Tallaght, Darndale and Young Ballymun, but we welcome these differences because they have allowed us to develop various types of learning which we can contribute to the collective pot.  It would have been deeply regrettable if this money had been invested in doing the same thing three times over.  Without getting into the detail, which my colleagues have covered very well, there are cohesive factors, particularly with regard to strategic planning, evidence of need, evidence-based responses to these needs and ways of engaging with an entire community, whether we are talking about children aged up to three years, people across the life-cycle or any other combination.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made observations about concentrated areas, mainstreaming throughout the country and rural disadvantage.  We must first ask what the evidence tells us.  I will not stray too far from the territory I am confident I know, having worked in this area since 2007, because I do not want to make overreaching statements that I cannot verify.  I can state that in concentrated urban areas of disadvantage, as Mr. Candon, Ms Quinn and Mr Kelly have articulated, significant State investment is made in dislocated silo-based health, education and community and voluntary service strategies.  In our view it is not so much that the State does not spend enough money - although additional investment will always be welcome - but that there is a fundamental question about how this money is strategically managed and whether an integrated service strategy is in place.  We know integrated service strategies are not in place in areas of rural or urban disadvantage throughout the country.  In the mainstream sectors of health, education and youth and community services, it is a question of embedding in various ways the evidence-based practices that will change outcomes.  With at least two former school principals sitting in the room, I state very cautiously that we know that changing teaching practice in the classroom will change literacy levels.  We know investing in children's social and emotional development, particularly from birth or very early in childhood, will demonstrably improve their learning outcomes and mental health outcomes.<\/p> <p>The Incredible Years programme is one example but there is also the Doodle Den programme in Tallaght.  There are examples of improving literacy in the classroom and parallel initiatives to improve literacy with classroom and teacher efforts.  I make the assumption that the international evidence on teaching practice could be transferred to any school or community, regardless of whether it is urban or rural.  That is based on rational assumptions rather than hard evidence.<\/p><p> Childhood Development Initiative, Preparing for Life and ourselves collaborated extensively on the S&iacute;olta process.  It would be reasonable to assume, based on evidence, that early years centres in rural settings - if they embody an evidence-based curriculum like High Scope and the S&iacute;olta quality assurance framework - will almost definitely improve child outcomes with the quality of early years provision.  The nature of services and populations are dispersed.  For example, in an urban environment in Ballymun, families in the community were traditionally described as not engaging with service providers.  When we set up the child development clinic, the conventional wisdom was that families would not engage, which is completely untrue, as families will absolutely engage with services if they are relevant to their needs and delivered respectfully.  That culture of respect, equality and participation is required, with the parent seen as an expert on their child.  There must be respect for what parents know, their capacity and their commitment in very difficult circumstances.  That can be transferred across other areas.<\/p><p> Senator van Turnhout commented on how to bring all this learning together.  There are diverse ways of implementing area-based strategies and, for example, in Young Ballymun, we focused mainly on embedding practice in mainstream services.  We put much of our time and attention into that.  Other strategies can go with this, and in Preparing for Life there was an emphasis on home-based visitation.  We did not test that as we tested clinic-based services.  It is about really considering in a coherent way the programme rather than asking if this or that works.<\/p><p> What we have collectively stated is that there must be a collaborative planning process that engages all key stakeholders before making a decision on what is being done.  The process is as important as the programme.  The programme is the evidence-based strategy that the community decides to implement but the process is how to get there.  The process will significantly influence the level of participation, ownership and buy-in, which is another important lesson.<\/p><p> There must be strong national leadership with samples of anonymised records.  The point was made that child poverty cannot be addressed without addressing family poverty.  Children live in families so a child will not emerge from being poor on its own; the child will only become \"not poor\" if there is an integrated economic strategy.  There is an opportunity in the Government, a new focus on jobs and where economic investment has not been made, to integrate children services strategies with economic investment.  Others on the panel have made that point clearly.  Children do not end up poor accidentally and we tried to emphasise in our presentation the causal aspects.<\/p><p> We can respond to points collectively.  There were points about maternal depression and children finding their own bedtimes, etc.  When we really engage with families during pregnancy and the early stages after birth, as we have through our Ready, Steady, Grow service and the child development clinic, along with the efforts of partners, we really get a sense of the struggle.  Maternal depression can be a biological and medical factor in any pregnancy or birth but environmental stress and financial anxiety, as well as conflict in the family and domestic violence, can massively compound maternal depression.  It is a critical risk factor for child outcomes.  Rather than assumptions on children going to bed on their own, there is really a need to consider holistically the needs of parents and responses, where possible, to support parents and children's well-being.<\/p><p> There is the issue of investment and sustainability.  We have designed Young Ballymun as a ten year change strategy.  There will be embedding of mainstream practice across the community, which is why sharing models with other communities is so important.  One must build up synergy and a movement across the country to build sustainability in future.  The emerging policy context around children is very important and if that could be matched with an economic and employment strategy for extremely disadvantaged areas, it would be all the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400013#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eleanor McClorey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363259700,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I will not go over the points so eloquently made by Ms McClorey.  When we started planning what we might do in our area, the possibilities were enormous and we could have taken many approaches.  We quickly decided that the greatest resource in a child's life is a parent, parents or grandparents.  As a State and people, we have ignored that for so long and we have not invested in parents.  Any time we have a difficulty we invest in professionals and parachute people in to try to resolve the problem.  Our belief is that we must invest in parents appropriately, at the right time and, as Ms McClorey indicated, through the life cycle.  The process must be continued as children get older.  My parents had very little education but I am here because my mother had a dream that I would do better than she did.  I grew up in a rural area and we had nothing.  If we can get parents to have ambition and help them in realising that ambition, it will provide the greatest chance for any child.  Other significant adults are also good but the parent is key.<\/p><p>  I am jumping around because I do not want to make points made by Ms McClorey already.  Families' confidence in services has not been discussed today, and unfortunately, families have very little confidence in many services.  In many cases that is driven by poor behaviour from professionals and professionals not being willing to meet families in their own home.  Somebody mentioned this morning a fear of going into a family's home, which is absolute nonsense.  A tiny percentage of families in the country may be involved with serious crime but my staff visit families who are very welcoming.  Nevertheless, these families need to know who we are, why we are there, what the business is and how they will be treated.  Unfortunately, families in our areas have often been burned when investing in professionals because the professional has moved on.  It is an issue for some of our services, particularly social workers, as families referred to social workers need stability but often do not get it.  They may be bumped from one person to the next.<\/p><p>  That is why we decided on a five year investment in these families.  With some of the families it has taken a year to two years to get to the stage where they trust us.  They must see that we will be consistent in returning and being fair and friendly.  It has taken us generations to get where we are and we will not be able to fix the problem quickly.  We should not jump at solutions.  Ms McClorey already made the point that there is very little expertise in the area, so it would be unfair to expect the three of us to suddenly formulate a solution.  We are coming up with some really good ideas and certain elements work.<\/p> <p>However, we have looked at the international scene and there is very little evidence internationally of area-based approaches really being effective.<\/p><p> The next point is long-term investment in families.  I have made the point already that many of the things we have done in Ireland have been based on a quick fix.  I have been working in this area for 30 years and, unfortunately, in my experience quick fixes do not work.  They might work with families with a very high capacity, where a short intervention can work.  For most of our families, however, more is required.<\/p><p> Inter-agency working was mentioned.  We are at the tip of the iceberg in that regard.  Both Ms Marian Quinn and Ms  Eleanor McClorey went a little deeper in the asks they made of the agencies.  We find that the agencies are with us on this but the real challenge comes in the next phase when we get on to the area-based strategy in our area and when we will put the finger on their shoulders and tell them we want them to do X or Y, to release some of their staff, to stop doing things they are doing already and to do them differently.  That will be very challenging.  In many professions, the focus is on the professionals rather than the families.  We must change the rules of the game.  We are here to serve the families.  Fair enough, we need good working conditions and we must be treated fairly but, unfortunately, much of our energy and dialogue is about what is happening in the professions rather than what is happening with families.<\/p><p> It would be remiss not to make the point that it is really challenging to work with approximately 20% of our families.  Even though our way of working is very different from that of many other agencies, we still find it very challenging to work with those families.  These families' lives are quite chaotic and, in some case, they become disempowered.  They have nearly been over-serviced by agencies.  We carried out an audit in our area when we started, and there are 63 potential services available to children and families.  That would be quite confusing for somebody who has a doctorate, so imagine how it feels for parents.  They really do not understand the difference between one group and another.  We must narrow down the field, and Mr. Mark Candon already made this point.  We must get to the stage where everybody must make a serious commitment to a percentage of families and do it well.  I question the value of doing a little with lots of families.<\/p><p> We have traditionally worked from a deficit model, so we have put services in when we find problems.  We have to work from a strengths model.  Both Ms Marian Quinn and Ms Eleanor McClorey have made that point.  We should be able to say to every family: \"You have got strengths.  We are going to find those strengths and work with you on them.\"  By working on those strengths one deals with the deficits.  Families have traditionally seen that services only come when they have a problem.  That immediately creates a negative mindset.  We need to turn that around, so there is a positive mindset.  Unfortunately, many of our agencies work on serious, tough problems all the time.  That is quite demoralising for staff as well.  Staff need to have the space to work on positive things.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputy Troy on the return on investment, when we are finished we have a commitment from James Heckman, who is the world master, to do a cost-benefit analysis of our programme.  He has already started to look at the data.  Unfortunately, it is quite challenging in Ireland because many of the things that happened in Ireland were never costed.  We do not know what it costs if a child goes into care or a social worker is engaged with a family.  We can cost things such as education because we know what the cost is per pupil.  Some estimates and guesstimates will have to made on that, and perhaps by looking at what is happening in the UK, our nearest neighbour.<\/p><p> We must look at best use of resources.  We have to start challenging every organisation working with families to show evidence of how they are using State money to produce best outcomes.  At present, people report on numbers.  I am a teacher and I have worked in education.  People are really concerned with numbers and percentages, but it must go deeper than that.  We can get the percentage of children turning up in school to increase, but if the quality of what is happening in school is not good, it does not matter whether they are there or not.  It will not change anything.  We must change the rules of the game.  Instead of looking for statistics and numbers, we must ask people who are getting funding to show how what they are doing is producing outcomes.  We know, because of the research we are doing into our work, and we will be able to state that we know that what we have done has produced a certain outcome.  Unfortunately, very few people can do that.<\/p><p> I will conclude on that point.  There is much detail in what the members have asked us, but the one thing I caution them against is jumping at a solution.  The UK jumped at Sure Start.  It had success in one or two areas so it rolled it out, but it has failed miserably in many areas.  Just because ourselves, young-Ballymun or CDI might find something really exciting, it does not mean it is the answer for everybody.  We must be more cautious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400014#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363260300,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I will respond on four issues - there are too many pilots, the inter-agency work, models of delivery and our policy framework.<\/p><p>  There was a question about whether there are too many pilots and how to determine what works.  The Centre for Effective Services, which is 50% government funded with the remainder coming from philanthropy, is tasked with extracting the findings across the range of evaluations.  It has already begun to produce thematic documents that draw on the evaluations across all of the grantees from the network Noel Kelly referred to.  While there is no one size fits all, we know a good deal about what works.  There is a point where we need to commit to only evidence-based, proven models of delivery.  That brings us to the thorny issue of not when do we stop taking on new pilots but when do we stop doing something that we have done for 20 years but which has no impact.<\/p><p>  One of the pieces of work we delivered in west Tallaght was proven not to work.  It was a pro-social behaviour programme and evidence based.  It was tested through a randomised control trial and there was a very rigorous evaluation.  The evaluation was the same as our Doodle Den programme, which had great outcomes.  However, in our pro-social behaviour programme, children were measured on 21 outcomes.  Sixteen of the outcomes were what is called flatline, where nothing changed, and three of the outcomes were moving in the wrong direction.  We had to stop delivery of that programme.  The people engaged in the programme - the children, parents, teachers who referred children to it and the youth workers who delivered the programme - all engaged knowing it was a test, that it was a short-term piece of work and that we would find out whether it could be integrated.  They were given hard evidence that it was not working, was at best making no difference and might not be helping at all, but people said: \"I do not believe you.  I do not believe the research.  I like what I am doing and I am working really hard at it.  I am really trying to make a difference here.\"  Therefore, believing that trying to make a difference does not necessarily mean one is making a difference is very difficult for us.  One of the questions that policymakers and managers need to start grappling with is not just about how to start taking on new things, but how to stop doing the things that make no difference.<\/p><p>  That brings me to models of delivery.  Certainly, there is an issue regarding where and how services are delivered.  We are beginning to learn that for some families it is necessary to do much more outreach.  We cannot expect people to come to us.  That raises questions about how much of our work is about developing the capacity of families to engage and also, critically, how much of the work is about helping us, as service providers, to be more effective in how we engage.  It is not always the family's problem or their fault.  It is not always the family that must change.  Sometimes we, as service providers, managers and the people who design these structures, are the people who need to do a little re-thinking.  Part of that raises questions about the skill of managers in being able to grapple with negotiating that.  I was a fairly senior person in the HSE and had responsibility for many service level agreements.  There was never a place where I had an engagement with the people to whom we were giving very significant amounts of funding in which we talked about whether what the service was doing was what the community needed, whether it was achieving the outcomes or whether we even knew the outcomes we were trying to achieve through the very large budget being given by the HSE.  There is the issue of people who are decision-makers, particularly budget holders, having the capacity, accountability and authority to have those negotiations and to ask those questions.<\/p><p>  With regard to inter-agency working, the children's services committees, which are established now in 16 counties and which will be a core part of how the child and family support agency works, are a critical structure.<\/p> <p>They are tasked with ensuring integrated service planning and delivery and if we are talking about the tsar, or what we in CDI like to call scrutiny and support - and we need both - in the context of where it is held, the children's services committees offer us a good opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400015#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363260900,"counter":707,"content":"<p>Responding to the points of the Vice Chairman, it is an issue of massive frustration for many of us plodders involved in service delivery, or what Lipsky called street-level bureaucrats.  If I have a child who must attend a psychologist or a psychiatrist and the child does not like the office, we are between a rock and hard place.  The mountain will not go to Mohammed and Mohammed has no intention of going back to the mountain.  When I talk about a tsar and knocking heads together, it is to get by this stuff and get it organised.  It is not that some people, within their own groups, agencies and professions, do not do great work.  We have talked for years about inter-agency work and linking up.  This goes back to social inclusion and Departments working together.  There were interdepartmental committees about social inclusion and we are waiting for it to filter down to us.  These remain the frustrations and that is where we need to draw it together.  This must involve the Departments of Justice and Equality, Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs and Social Protection.  There must be someone above all of that.  In her presentation, Ms Marion Quinn referred to the nested model of family, the community and the child.  They must also be a nested model of services.  The first level is the school or the preschool, the next is the area within which they work, and there are other subsequent levels.<\/p><p>  Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to evidence-based policies, which I love, but a good researcher is someone who maintains a healthy scepticism about findings.  One can have projects that may make certain findings but one really needs ten or 15 projects over time in different places.  Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to Dr. Tommy MacKay, our dear friend in West Dunbartonshire whom I would love to have a pint with, and 65,000 kids, all of whom read at nine years and six months as tested through Neale analysis.  As a teacher, I would love to see how 65,000 kids can be tested using Neale analysis.  It takes some time.  Yesterday afternoon, I was at a homework club with a very bright child of ten or 11 years who is highly dyslexic.  How will he end up reading at the level of nine years and six months when tested using Neale analysis?  The Hart-Risley study is great, but let us look at the methodology and how it was done.  We know things and we learn things, but let us be careful, because there is enough expertise in this country and among our own people to answer many of the questions.<\/p><p>  The most wonderful thing was said at this meeting, which is that families will engage with services if they meet their needs and are delivered respectfully.  We can bring a horse to water but we cannot make it drink.  I referred to the Eithne Kennedy's Write to Read project, whose key secret is ongoing engagement.  Gr&aacute;inne comes in every second week so I must have my homework done for her, as the kids must have their homework done for me.  That is the ongoing professional development and support.  At the strategic working level, that is what keeps it sustained.  Without one person, such as tsar I am talking about, saying that this is how we will do business, I do not see how we can make services deal respectfully with families.  How long will it take to teach them?<\/p><p>  Looking at the research in the educational field over decades, going back to the war on poverty, James Coleman did a major study and concluded that schools will not make a difference.  For 40 years, there was research on school improvement and school effectiveness showing that schools make 8-15% of the difference.  This is what Coleman said.  We must change the rules of the game.  We must start with a focus on the child.  I am a wonderful person, if I say so.  Next September or October, I must look at how I play the game to retain people or do this or do that, with the best will in the world.  Policy-makers and legislators need to think at that level.  How would we allow the chief superintendent in Store Street to work in a certain way so that his backside is covered?  I need to know my back is covered because someone here is saying we should get together and work together.  Without that, we are very limited in the outcomes we can truly achieve.<\/p><p>  After 25 years teaching, at the start of which I was sent home because I wore an earring, and having started my teaching career at 15 or 16 with the old fella in Christ the King, Cabra, I have been looking at this all my life and seeing how different bits work together.<\/p><p>  Regarding the trade of the Vice Chairman, which is social work, I would love to see support for Mountjoy Square, where there is a throughput of social workers.

It was music to my ears when I heard Mr. Noel Kelly speak.  Although I would not call myself deprived, there was an element of poor people where I grew up beside Keogh Square in Inchicore.  Keogh Square was the main housing block for the city council.  I spent many a day running in and out of it with friends and living and working there voluntarily.<\/p> <p>There is too much duplication of many services.  It is very confusing for people.  Much money has been poured into services that have not lived up to the required standards.  That is where we have failed parents.  I do not believe we should put everything on to teachers so that they must ensure children turn up for school dressed and with a breakfast.  We need to focus again on the parents, family, surroundings and family networks.  My main concern is that we should not take parenting away from parents.  A teacher can only do so much when a child enters a classroom in the morning and goes home.  A youth club can only do so much.  The gap in the evening or early morning is where we have failed.  <\/p><p> Given the area I come from and having worked locally with young children for a long time, I know that when children walked into the youth club, one could automatically see how their life would go - whether they would live longer than 18, for example.  I am mainly concerned about the fact that schools I know cannot get a parent to sit in on a parenting class or sit on a board of management or even the parents' council.  I am not blaming the teachers or the school.  People criticised the Minister for Social Protection for taking away the dual payment.  It has provided a focus for people who want to do something with their lives and not rely on a double payment anymore.  That is evident where I live.  I can see young people's attitudes changing completely.  They do not have the security of that double payment so they are looking outward.  <\/p><p> We need to look at what services are being duplicated.  Should we have this amount of services?  Should we concentrate on the services that are working as they should?  Some of them are not found in the large agencies but are very small and involve working one-to-one with communities.  I have a question about the Childhood Development Initiative, CDI, programme.  What role do flesh-and-blood parents have in the early years programme?  I enjoyed listening to everybody and think Mr. Kelly is a breath of fresh air.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400016#P00700","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363261500,"counter":714,"content":"<p>Does Senator Burke wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400017#Q00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1363261500,"counter":715,"content":"<p>My apologies for not being here this morning.

Everyone had their own agenda and targets but they are not co-ordinated and as a result, there is a significant lack of progress in real terms.  Some medical consultants at UCC provided paediatric consultations on their own initiative within the community.  This avoided people having to travel to the hospital and has brought about significant benefits locally.  The aim now is to put it on a proper footing.  It shows how a small initiative like that can have a significant influence.  That is where joined-up thinking between all the institutions is lacking.

We have seven services, all of which have an element focusing on parents.  In respect of our early years service, it was a valuation through a randomised control trial.  We had 18 services, of which eight or nine delivered business as usual.  The remainder were the intervention which received wraparound support and additional services.  We do a number of specific things for parents.  Each of those services had a parent carer facilitator who is very like a home-school liaison officer.  It is someone working in the service whose job is specifically working with parents.  That is one of the pieces of our early years service that has proved to be very effective and we are glad we have been able to continue that.  That piece is continuing now.  As part of our mainstream integration, they are being overseen by the county child care committee.<\/p><p>  What the parent carer facilitator does is build capacity with parents and help them to engage not just with the service but with their child's development and learning.  Like the other two sites, we were involved with S&iacute;olta.  We have all been doing the quality framework for early years provision.  Deputy Catherine Byrne spoke about schools not being able to get parents onto boards of management.  Of course, that would be our experience in Tallaght west.  As part of our S&iacute;olta work, parent carer facilitators worked with parents and our S&iacute;olta co-ordinator worked with the staff in the early years service to find a way for the governance of the service to become more real and accessible to people - something people wanted to get involved in.  We increased the number of parents involved in boards of management of our early years services.  <\/p><p>  We have an early intervention speech and language therapy service.  It is what we have all been talking about.  The speech and language therapist visits the preschool and primary school, akin to what Senator Burke referred to in Cork.  Attendance has been 100% as opposed to 50% for HSE assessments.  Our model is three-pronged.  The therapist works with the child and with either the early years practitioner or teacher to develop their capacity.  Accredited training is delivered to them so they are able to reiterate the messages and ways of working of the speech and language therapist.  Importantly, they work with parents so there is a formal parental education element in our speech and language therapy.  It involves really simple tips for parents such as things one can do to help one's child recognise letters when one is going to the supermarket.  It is all about increasing capacity, confidence and awareness of what I as a parent can do to help my child's learning in my everyday life.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400017#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1363261500,"counter":719,"content":"<p>Ms McClorey will speak, followed by Mr. Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400017#Q00700","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363262100,"counter":720,"content":"<p>Before responding to Senator Colm Burke, I will make a number of observations on the points made by Deputy Catherine Byrne, specifically the powerful and vital point she made that we should not load everything on to schools.  Ms Quinn put the matter well when she described the parent as the primary resource and central element of the area based strategy to tackle child poverty.  No one is more committed to children's rights and no one is a greater advocate and defender and protector of children's rights than an empowered and resourced parent.  We engage with parents across the community, from pregnancy and birth onwards, to provide a coherent, integrated set of services that are specifically designed to increase their capacity to be a powerful advocate and driver of outcomes for their children.  That point was very well made.<\/p><p>  While I focused on literacy and methodologies in the classroom, I should emphasise that primary schools in Ballymun have broken new ground by sharing their literacy data with us.  All of them have given us permission to analyse this data on a whole community basis.  We also engage with individual schools, confidentially with principals, on what the data is telling us about how we need to work more closely with the schools in our literacy strategy.  There is, however, a parallel family and community literacy strategy that is activated across the life cycle of the child.  As such, it is not the case that everything is placed on the shoulders of our teachers who work so hard already.  While they have embraced this change strategy, this does not mean parents are having this role removed from them. <\/p><p>  On the quality, duplication and integration of services, I will focus on the youth sector.  I note from the Chairman's opening comments that we should not refer to organisations by name and I will not do so.  The most recent round of cutbacks targeting the youth and community sector were applied across the board.  We have a dynamic youth sector in Ballymun which spearheaded the change strategy with youngballymun.  Key leaders from the youth sector in Ballymun development group invested a couple of years of work in designing the prototype which we, youngballymun, further refined and implemented.  They spearheaded accessible youth mental health services, evidence based youth practice and new ways of documenting and coding the work they were doing.  None of this was taken into account when the cuts were applied a few months ago and no recognition was given to best practice, evidence or innovation.  Instead, cuts were applied across the board and the service in Ballymun was cut by the same amount as all other services.  As Deputy Catherine Byrne noted, there are services which do not embrace this kind of innovation and resist accountability.  The lack of incentive for best practice must be tackled urgently in the funding allocations to the youth sector, particularly in respect of communities where agencies have had an opportunity to engage with evidence.  Those communities which did this are being treated as if they had not done so.  There is something terribly unfair about this failure at policy level to stimulate a best practice culture.  <\/p><p>  Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of joined-up thinking.  Based on our experience of learning in youngballymun, joined up thinking must start with a blank sheet or large empty space on which one then notes a few critical or key points.  We had evidence based area need and my colleagues have discussed some of the key criteria that underpin our strategy.  Outside of that, our local service providers and community designed the work that is done by youngballymun.  Those elements of the prototype design, if one likes, that they were not confident could be implemented were set aside and the providers developed a revised vision for the strategy.  If one has speech and language therapists, public health nurses, teachers and community leaders sitting around a table designing a service, the likelihood that they will embed changes in their practice is much greater than if a committee from outside the area were to tell them what they must do.  In some respects, it much more difficult to embed change when one is not part of it as one does not fully understand it in such circumstances.  However, one also has resistance to imposition and control.  While policy, funding mechanisms, standards and so forth must be centralised, we also require a bottom-up element.  We had this across the three strategies.  There was a prototype, a top-down with our funders and ourselves and then a bottom-up approach which was taken at the level of each local community.<\/p><p>  The issue is not solely the programmes - the evidence and what one does - but the process in which one engages to enable joined up thinking.  At this stage of the work - members have heard my colleagues from Tallaght and Darndale make the same point - it is also about incentivising the change process through funding lines.  Funding must be continued where there is an opportunity to deliver and design change and if an agency is not willing to avail of this opportunity, accountability must come into play, particularly to the local community.  I am delighted to extend an invitation to members to visit us. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400018#R00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Eleanor McClorey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363262100,"counter":721,"content":"<p>A great deal of work is under way on reforming local government.  Unfortunately, however, another set of boundaries is about to be developed for the new child and family support agency.  A decision must be taken at national level to establish one set of boundaries and require everyone to work to it.  This is a real challenge when one is engaging with agencies.  For example, we are in a particular area of Dublin City Council but the health board area with which we work only encroaches into a little corner of the council area as most of its work is in the Fingal County Council area.  This is presenting a challenge in conversations we are having with key officials in the Health Service Executive as they tell us they cannot focus specifically on our area because they have a responsibility to the wider area.  We must find a way to devise coherent boundaries.  The country is not so large as to require 20 different sets of boundaries.  The boundaries of the child and family support agency, which is one of the great hopes for the future, need to be realigned with other boundaries as otherwise we will have a further layer of confusion.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Catherine Byrne for her positive comments.  I failed to mention that parents who want to create change in their family often meet the greatest resistance within their family unit.  The issue is not necessarily an external one and resistance is not always from agencies or schools but often from within the family.  The change process taking place in families is as difficult or probably more difficult than the change process across services.  We must empower and equip parents to step to one side and decide to do things differently, which means taking a different route from that taken by everybody else.  We must appreciate that this is extremely difficult for members of families which have experienced three or four generations of unemployment, addiction and so forth.  I am delighted that the first parent in our programme who got her child to school immediately joined our board of management.  Perhaps there is something good in that.<\/p><p>  Mr. Candon referred to the Write to Read literacy project, which has been running in one of the schools in our area.  This is an Irish produced literacy programme, similar to that to which Ms McClorey referred.  It is great it is being extended to a number of other schools.  As Ms McClorey and Mr. Candon pointed it, the purpose here is to provide continuing professional development for teachers as opposed to giving people a two day course and telling them the issue is sorted.  We will change professional practice by continually monitoring, checking, supporting and upgrading as well as addressing difficulties.  There is an appetite for this in schools and other settings provided the right supports are made available. <\/p><p>  Members will probably not be familiar with implementation science because it is a new concept in Ireland.  Experts in the United States make the point that training achieves 5% of the impact whereas coaching and mentoring achieve 95% of impact.  We have never done the coaching and mentoring piece.  Instead, we delivered training and told people to go and apply it.  We must reduce training and refocus on supporting people to implement the practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013031400018#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363262100,"counter":722,"content":"<p>At different times, Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in and I chaired the after school education support project in the North Wall.

Some of our teachers would have helped out with women who were going for FETAC level 4, level, 5, level 6 and level 7 courses.  All our mothers, particularly anybody over the age of 30 or 35, would have left to go into sewing factories at 14 years of age.  Three of those girls have gone to the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, and have completed social science degrees.  I have said previously that the United States makes films about stuff like this.  I feel a deep sense of frustration.  That is one group.  I talk about SWAN.  We have the national college support group where the parents do a wonderful job.  There are all these bits.  My frustration concerns tying all the bits together to get continuity.  I want to keep stressing the importance of that.  There is a funding issue here.  I do not know what will happen after Atlantic Philanthropies goes.  I love my history and old wine in new bottles.<\/p><p> In the past there was the Bernard van Leer Foundation.  There was also a small project whereby every time something was done in the education area in Ireland, it was trotted out and put near the top paragraph of the new report, called the Rutland Street project.  Holland's book on the issue is fantastic from a qualitative understanding.  The Educational Research Centre, ERC, produced two reports on it which are very interesting.  In 1976, it was decided that because of cutbacks we could not afford to continue this work.  The work that had been done was left in abeyance.  I remind members, and those people who are old enough to remember the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in working class communities and in the inner city, of the invisibility, how things fell apart and how it has been presented to us through the work of Roddy Doyle in <i>The Commitments<\/i> and so on.  Times got very tough then.  I have a serious concern that not today or tomorrow, but ten years down the road some of what is happening now in terms of cutbacks where the soft underbelly is being taken away will be paid for in 2020.  What happened from 1975 to 1985 was paid for in 1995 and right up to a few years ago. <\/p><p> The idea of an area base is really interesting.  I cannot understand why the north inner city as a group is not involved; it is an area that should be involved.  I stress that leadership issue.  I need to be accountable to somebody.  We have worked extremely hard on trust, respect and openness.  We have ten years' work behind us with girls who are having babies at 18 and 19 years of age.  They have worked with us all the way through.  What we need is somebody to turn on the engine for us to make it happen.  I think my colleagues understand the frustration.  If we look at the group I mentioned, the after schools education support programme - Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in will verify - it is fascinating what can happen.  <\/p><p> I took over a small boys school 13 years ago.  To give an idea of some of the challenges out there and looking at the cohort who attend, I discovered that from 2000 to 2010 almost 90% of the mothers of the children who attended had not completed a State examination; they never got beyond primary school.  That is a hidden Ireland and those are the challenges.  The bottom up work has been done and it needs to be supported by the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste's office.  It is a dialogue issue.

I am joined by Mr. Donal Leavy, who is director of ComReg's wholesale division.<\/p> <p>The wholesale division is responsible for implementing specific regulatory measures that enable or help develop more competition within various parts of the electronic communications sector.  We are happy to answer any questions members may have about the matters raised and look forward to the discussion.<\/p><p> ComReg is the national regulatory authority for the electronic communications and postal sectors.  We were established in 2002, taking over the functions of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, which was set up in 1997.  ComReg also manages Ireland's radio frequency spectrum and the national numbering resource.  We also regulate the emergency call-answering service, among other activities.  We have a committed and hard-working team of highly experienced individuals.<\/p><p> Our overall responsibilities are to promote competition, inform consumers and encourage innovation.  Members may recall that ComReg recently held a successful auction of radio spectrum for next-generation mobile telephone licences.  This will raise &euro;854 million for the Exchequer between now and 2030.  The auction also will allow mobile companies to roll out high-speed, fourth generation mobile communication services later this year.  Arising from this auction, &euro;450 million of auction fees were forwarded to the Exchequer last December.<\/p><p> Under the 2002 Communication Regulation Act, ComReg is responsible for promoting competition within the electronic communication sector.  We focus on ensuring that users derive maximum benefit in terms of choice, price and quality, that there is no distortion or restriction of competition, that efficient investment in infrastructure occurs, that innovation is promoted, and that we have efficient and effective use of the radio frequencies.  The way we regulate is very much defined in European and Irish law, with a significant role played by the European Commission under the relevant directives.<\/p><p> The provision of competitively priced broadband to businesses and consumers, capable of supporting a range of new applications, is essential to Ireland's economic recovery.  It will help ensure that Ireland remains an attractive location for new investment from both foreign and domestic sources.<\/p><p> There have been a number of positive signs of progress in recent years, with strong competitive forces and consumer emphasis on value putting downward pressure on prices while quality and coverage levels have improved.  ComReg's regulatory interventions in regard to wholesale broadband have helped to stimulate such competitive pressures and ensure new investment.<\/p><p> As a result of the regulatory and business environment, the telecoms sector in Ireland today is making investments of approximately &euro;1 billion in next generation broadband and fibre networks.  These networks will deliver speeds of 30 to 150 Mbps to Irish consumers. Broadband adoption has continued to grow in recent years, as have broadband speeds.  That has been driven in part by user demand for video consumption and other content services such as gaming and social media networks.  There are currently 1.6 million broadband customers in Ireland, and an estimated 65% of Irish households have chosen to purchase broadband.<\/p><p> Outside the regulatory framework, there have been a number of State-sponsored programmes in the past decade.  More recently, the national broadband scheme was completed in October 2010 at which point additional broadband services were made available in more than 1,000 electoral divisions across every county in the country to ensure national availability of broadband.<\/p><p> Following the national broadband scheme, the Government recently rolled out the rural broadband scheme to provide broadband to any remaining individual rural premises not capable of getting the service from existing providers.<\/p><p> Last August, the Government published its national broadband plan, which charts progress made to date in achieving the EU digital agenda targets and sets out steps to ensure the country exceeds the targets set for both 2015 and 2020.<\/p><p> With regard to broadband speeds, it is worth noting that higher speeds are being achieved.  Approximately 74% of all broadband subscriptions are in the 2 to 10 Mbps category, while 21% are greater than 10 Mbps.  ComReg will shortly roll out a new initiative in regard to advertised speeds whereby we will launch an online facility allowing for the measuring and publishing of broadband speeds experienced by consumers using different platforms.<\/p><p> Our analysis of the market reveals that, increasingly, customers are purchasing several services as part of a single bundle.  Products offered as parts of bundles include fixed phone, broadband, TV and mobile phone services.  The most common bundle purchased is fixed phone and broadband.<\/p><p> Competition in the sale of those bundles is strong, and consumers gain from that through better offerings and lower prices.  The strength of the bundles market can be seen from the recent entry of Sky, with an offering that includes satellite TV, broadband and voice.  That is in direct competition to UPC, which offers the same bundle but over their cable platform.<\/p><p> It is useful at this point in our introduction to describe the platforms used by Irish customers in obtaining broadband.  Members received a submission from us in advance of today's meeting, and I would direct them to charts 3 and 4 on page 3 of that submission.  These are two charts from our quarterly reports.  The most recent quarterly report was published yesterday therefore, these are up-to-date figures.  They report on the final quarter of 2012.  On the top chart, chart 3, members will see a number of different platforms identified whereby Irish consumers obtain their broadband service.  If I start at the bottom, members will see the dark blue area, which is DSL.  DSL is the Eircom copper network with which we are all familiar.  DSL is the way we get broadband through that.  It is the biggest source of broadband for Irish consumers.  The cable network is shown in green.  Members can see that, quarter on quarter, the number of subscribers using cable to get broadband is increasing.  The grey area is fixed wireless access.  This is a spectrum based service, which ComReg introduced targeting rural areas in particular six or seven years ago.  While numbers using that platform have declined, it is still a very important platform, particularly in the more rural areas.  Detailed in red are smaller but important services across satellite and fibre direct into houses.  Outlined in light blue is mobile broadband, which has been a significant means of getting broadband to more rural areas in Ireland.  Members will see that over 500,000 people avail of mobile broadband.<\/p><p> The second chart breaks down the DSL group, and it is important for today's discussion to mention that.  In chart 4, the dark blue area is where Eircom provides broadband to its own customers on its own network.  The green area is where other operators such as Vodafone, Sky, UTV or IFA resell Eircom products to consumers but using the Eircom network.  In that case it buys a wholesale product and then resells it under its name, but it is on the DSL Eircom-owned copper network.<\/p><p> The final category is what we call local loop unbundling where other operators have effectively taken control of that last part of the Eircom network.  They have invested in the exchanges and can innovate to a greater extent, and offer more variety.  Rather than being just a resell, it is a reuse.  It is important to explain the way in which people currently receive broadband.<\/p><p> I will refer briefly to two recent regulatory decisions ComReg has made.  These relate to next generation access and the bundles I have described. competition.<\/p> <p>The next-generation access decision provides a regulatory framework for next-generation broadband in Ireland that will facilitate investment and the promotion of competition.  The bundling decision ensures that other operators can effectively compete with an Eircom bundle so they can sell the products they buy from Eircom without being squeezed out of the market by the latter.  Both decisions were notified to the European Commission.  ComReg took the utmost account of all comments received in consultation.<\/p><p> Subsequent to these recent decisions, Eircom announced that it would provide a &euro;3 discount on wholesale line rental that all operators could avail of from the date of Eircom's NGA launch, where wholesale line rental is purchased with another wholesale service from Eircom which enables the operator to provide broadband to consumers.  Put simply, wholesale line rental is a wholesale service provided by Eircom that allows another operator to provide services over the phone line.  ComReg welcomes the Eircom wholesale line rental discount announcement.  The discount applies for a period of 18 months.  ComReg considers that Eircom's proposal gives certainty to operators regarding their wholesale input costs from Eircom and ultimately allows for the prospect of faster broadband services to consumers without the need to increase retail prices.<\/p><p> The wholesale line rental discount is also available to operators who purchase next-generation-access-enabled broadband wholesale services.  Eircom has announced it is investing &euro;400 million in its fibre infrastructure, which will result in the making available to 1.2 million premises of next-generation broadband, delivered over five phases.  In practical terms, it should mean that a significant number of households and small businesses get access to fast broadband services, in most cases with a choice of provider.  In conjunction with the wholesale discount, ComReg hopes that the next-generation access deployment will further stimulate competition in the market and ultimately lead to better services for consumers at higher speeds and lower prices.<\/p><p> It is important to note that there is a significant distinction between retail line rental and wholesale line rental.  Retail line rental is provided for under the universal service obligation regime put in place by ComReg and ensures that fixed-line telephone services are available to end users at the same standard price everywhere in the country.  Retail line rental is the flat monthly fee paid for by consumers to access the telecommunications network so that they can receive and make calls on their fixed telephone lines.  I emphasise that this nationally averaged universal charge applies to all consumers, urban and rural, regardless of location, and there are no plans for this price to change.<\/p><p> Broadband availability has grown significantly in recent years and the further rolling out of more next-generation broadband is crucial to our economic recovery.  ComReg takes measures aimed at stimulating competition within the marketplace to enhance the roll-out of next-generation broadband and to encourage competition.<\/p><p> With regard to claims about line rental, I am happy to emphasise to members that there is no retail line rental price differentiation between urban and rural areas, nor is there any proposal to amend the relevant legislation.  We will be very happy to take questions and discuss these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363255800,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for his very detailed overview and clarification.

Regardless of where one is in the country, if one obtains a fixed line from Eircom for one's house or business, there is a standard rate available.  What has changed is one of the fees that Eircom charges other operators that resell its products.  There is a large list of fees that Eircom charges to companies such as BT, Sky and Vodafone, which resell its services.  These charges relate to leased lines for big business, the reselling of basic broadband products and all sorts of different products.<\/p><p>  Eircom is subject to economic regulation whereby we ensure that where it has a very strong position, it does not overprice.  We must also ensure it does not underprice to cut out competition.  When it sells products to other operators, we put in place regimes that ensure there is a sufficient difference between the Eircom retail price and the other operator's wholesale price so the latter can run a business and have scope for a markup.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1363255800,"counter":741,"content":"<p>Does that mean there can be a price differential?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400004#C00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363255800,"counter":742,"content":"<p>The best way of describing it is that while Eircom might sell something in the market for &euro;50, for example, it must sell it to another operator for &euro;30, for example, so the other operator can then sell the product at a retail price of &euro;40 or &euro;50.  There are many prices at which Eircom must offer its products to other operators.  The change is in relation to one of those prices, in the context of Eircom's rolling out of next-generation broadband.  Since Eircom is constrained ultimately by the price at which it sells to other operators, it needs to reduce the price in this context so it can sell competitively in respect of the next-generation access products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1363255800,"counter":743,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and welcome the ComReg representatives.  On the last occasion the regulator was present, we were given a presentation that was written in gobbledygook, and I said that at the time.  I compliment Mr. O'Brien on using understandable English for the layman on this occasion.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about the answer to the Chairman's question.  Rural people have contacted us stating telecommunications services can be offered at a charge above the rental price for the urban market.  The purpose of this meeting is to obtain a very clear \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer in that regard.  If memory serves me correctly, Regulation No. 41 of 2001, written by ComReg, gave the opportunity for bundles to be sold at a lower rate to urban centres with large populations than to rural dwellers.  Does the regulation allow Eircom services to be offered to rural dwellers at a higher rate than the rate at which they are offered to urban dwellers?<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Brien stated that line rental charges must be universal, but that is not the practice.  Organisations representing rural communities have contacted all Oireachtas Members asking that this be highlighted.  It was highlighted by some of the organisations representing rural communities nationally.  Is there a regulation allowing a higher price to be charged to rural dwellers as opposed to urban dwellers?<\/p> <p>Is it the practice, as I believe it to be, that they are being charged a premium rate, as opposed to the urban dwellers?  Is some other regulation available ?  In response to the Chairman's question, Mr. O'Brien outlined there was a market, that ComReg has a specific universal regulation and then it is changed when it goes from wholesale to retail and so forth.  Is something in place that clearly gives evidence that rural dwellers are being charged a higher rate than their urban counterparts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400004#C00600","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363256400,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I will revert to the primary protection that is there for all consumers in the country regardless of where they live, which is the universal service obligation.  It guarantees that the retail price is the same for absolutely everyone in the country.  It also guarantees access and if the cost of building to a house located in a particularly difficult location is anything up to &euro;7,000 of additional cost for Eircom or whoever is the universal service operator, that company must meet the cost.  There are quite strong rules in place that guarantee one will get a fixed line no matter where one lives and guarantee that its price, which is around &euro;25, is the same for everyone.  In that regard, the cost to Eircom of providing a copper line in an urban area could be quite low, let us say it is &euro;5, while in an extremely rural area, the cost could be &euro;50 or &euro;60 or more.  Consequently, by having a single national price, the urban population in some cases probably is subsidising the rural cost.  This is something that occurs across all types of utilities and there is a similar approach in respect of energy networks.  This standard national cost is a guarantee to everyone and as I noted, there is no plan to change this.  It is something valued at a European level as well as at a national level.<\/p><p>  If I come to the price change, which I think has led to this debate, members should imagine a scenario in which Eircom has not yet started to build its next-generation network, which it actually is building as we speak.  Perhaps I should explain what it is building.  At present, in the main, one has copper wire from an Eircom exchange to a house.  That copper wire usually extends to a cabinet somewhere on the edge of a housing estate or a road and then from that cabinet, it continues to individual houses.  At present, Eircom is laying fibre from its exchange to the aforementioned cabinet.  In a sense, it is going halfway to all the houses with fibre-optic cable, which is a much better and faster way of providing broadband.  It is doing this by starting with urban areas but with an announced target of reaching 1.2 million houses.  As it does this, it needs to sell this new product, will have higher speeds and will compete a lot with UPC, for instance, which already offers high speeds in a lot of the country.  In order to compete, Eircom must be able to reduce its retail prices for this product against what they may have been.  If Eircom reduces a retail price, to maintain that space in which other providers that buy its wholesale product can compete against it, it must also reduce wholesale prices.  We regulate it in order to keep those two things going together, that is, to keep open that economic space for someone else to be able to make a buck.  What is happening is that Eircom has chosen basically to drop both of those levels in order that its new investment can be sold in a competitive way as it rolls out across the country.  Inevitably, Eircom is building that new infrastructure in urban areas first and therefore, this service will arrive in urban areas first.  A major challenge for us all is to try to make sure it goes as far as it can.  That is the pricing change that has happened in this case.  It really is about what Eircom charges others and the indications that has for Eircom's retail prices itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1363256400,"counter":746,"content":"<p>Does that clarify the point for Deputy Moynihan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400005#D00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1363256400,"counter":747,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400005#D00400","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1363256400,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of ComReg for everything.  The big issue obviously is that of the fixed line charges.  While Mr. O'Brien stated there is a universal service guarantee at present, he has outlined that as competition increases, there will be possible threats to this in the future.  This is feared by a lot of people in rural areas, particularly, as Mr. O'Brien has mentioned, if the fibre-optic cables initially are to be rolled out mainly in urban areas and subsequently into the rural areas.  Is there no way we can insist it is rolled out into the rural areas?  Can ComReg make a demand that if one intends to roll out fibre-optic cables in urban areas, it should be done at the same time across the board?<\/p><p>  I am aware that UPC upgraded a lot of its infrastructure a few years ago and probably is ahead in many ways.  However, Mr. O'Brien might outline to members in general terms the present position of the 4G roll-out.

The way that ComReg and the regulatory framework are set up is one starts off with a marketplace.  ComReg does not design that marketplace but comes and regulates that marketplace as it finds it and tries to deal with problems within it.  Ultimately, Eircom and UPC are free to deliver services as they see fit, to develop their business plans and to compete in a liberalised marketplace.  Our job then is to ensure that any distortions or blockages to competition are taken away and that it is a fair place for competition and investment.  For instance, in the case of UPC, its network passes over 700,000 households, while that of Eircom, as I stated, goes to every house in Ireland with the telephone line.  However, its announced plan is to hit 1.2 million houses with this new next generation access, NGA, broadband.  We intervene in a way that tries to maximise that investment and to maximise the competition that leads to this investment.  However, we have no powers to direct people to build and provide service, with the exception of the aforementioned universal service obligation, which pertains to the fixed line.  However, it is not a broadband service.  There has been debate in Europe as to whether the universal service regime should specifically mandate broadband and that broadband should be something that everyone must receive through this regime.  In Ireland, we are of the view that the national broadband scheme I mentioned, which the Government ran a couple of years ago, had a target of giving broadband to everyone in Ireland and the indications are that this target was met.  I acknowledge that many people in the more rural areas were receiving mobile broadband.<\/p> <p>The Government subsequently ran the rural broadband scheme which was a mopping-up exercise to find out if there was anybody who could not get service.  About 4,000 or 5,000 people said they could not get a connection and effectively the Department did a matchmaking exercise with operators who said they could provide a service, many being satellite or wireless operators.  It was reported that four people could not find an operator and there has been some intervention there.  Because of these interventions it would appear that everybody in Ireland can get that basic level of broadband so the need to change universal service to mandated is probably not required but it is something that everybody will continue to look at.  The challenge is to give everybody not one or two megabits but to try to give everybody in the country 30 megabits, which is the Digital Agenda target in Europe and is also the target the Government has put out in its new national broadband plan from last summer.  We are all focused on trying to achieve that target.  ComReg can do it by allowing the market go as far as it can and the Department has announced that it is prepared to intervene and put in public funding for that last piece.  That is the fixed network piece in the main.<\/p><p> On the fourth generation roll-out, we completed our auction in that regard last November raising in the region of &euro;850 million for the Exchequer.  Four operators were winners in that auction.  Those operators have all bought spectrum at different parts of the band.  In summary, those licences run until 2030 - there are two periods - but in the main there are licences until 2030.  Those licences permit the operators to launch fourth generation services where, on average, there will be much higher speeds to one's mobile telephone or<b><\/b>tablet<b>. <\/b>The coverage obligation that we have put in place is a minimum of 70% within three years.  We did this, noting that many of the operators, in terms of telephony coverage are already up around 99% and the expectation is that they will replicate and compete on coverage, as they have done in the past.<\/p><p> As to when the operators launch that service, that is their business but they have paid for that spectrum in order that they can launch that service.  We would expect that as soon as they are ready, they will be in the business of offering fourth generation services and no doubt advertising heavily as they do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400005#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363257000,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the presentation but I have read it.  I refer to the decision to allow Eircom to charge different rates for urban and rural areas.  I strongly believe that communications technology will be market led but not solely market led.  Otherwise there would be no need for intervention by the regulator.  Eircom is the universal service provider.  Which part of the universal service is being ditched here?  To which part of the obligations set out in legislation are we saying \"no\"?  In other areas, where there is a universal service obligation, for example, in An Post, which is not meeting its targets, a different forum will be used to encourage and force it to do so.  In the legislation passed almost two years ago to deregulate much of An Post's operations, one of the keystones was the universal service obligation on that company.  It is difficult to see how we can chip away and essentially make fish of one and flesh of another in terms of an obligation.<\/p><p>  I welcome ComReg's work in delivering higher speed next generation broadband and the 30 megabits as standard in the Digital Agenda.  I understand that not everybody will get this in the short to medium term.  It is an expensive roll-out.  There are minimum standards as set out in the presentation.  I have seen this in west Cork and particularly in Bantry and peninsular areas.  Amazon has come in and created 26 jobs where I live.  It is extremely significant to provide back-up support to a company such as Amazon.  Regrettably, people have lost those contracts because we could not get five megabits.  We need to anchor down the idea of a universal service obligation.  I am concerned at the hard decisions the Oireachtas has taken in regard to An Post and other areas.  The decision to allow Eircom discriminate against other areas because it was more expensive to provide the service is a dangerous road to go down.  I am not happy with it.  Why do we have the regulation in the first place?  We can go 100% to the market and satisfy many people in the country or we may not.  There is a reason for having regulation.

I find it hard to fathom some of the statements made at the committee today.<\/p><p>  I am trying to comprehend a reply to a parliamentary question I received from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, which states that in early February, Eircom's greater flexibility in setting wholesale rates for bundle services offered to its competitors a telephone exchange where there is already active competition among service providers or exchanges where next generation access services are available.  It also states that the retail price for basic fixed line telephone services alters, as a consequence of the decision, or remains at the standard price across the country in line with Eircom's universal service obligation.  I believe this is a dereliction of duty by the regulator in regard to this matter.

This is having a negative effect on those trying to maintain their livelihoods or to expand their businesses.  It is having an impact on many people in rural Ireland, including farmers, for whom farming is a business that requires up-to-date technology.  It is good that this committee is focusing on this issue and I hope that ComREG will accelerate the process of ensuring a balanced provision of broadband services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400006#E00400","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363257600,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I shall take those questions in the order in which they were asked.  On the point made by Deputy Harrington, the universal service regime for telecommunications is not changing and there is no ditching of any element of it.  That regime, set out in European law and implemented by ComREG in Ireland, results in the designation of Eircom as the provider of fixed-line telephone services for everyone at the same price, regardless of location.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no change at all in that regard.  What we were discussing was the price of certain wholesale products in the context of Eircom launching its new, next-generation service.  The company sells wholesale products to other telecommunications operators and needs to sell them at a price that allows the other operators to resell them and still make an acceptable return.  That is where the change has happened - in the wholesale rather than the retail price.  Nothing at all has changed with regard to universal service provision for telecommunications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257600,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Would Mr. O'Brien agree that, ultimately, Eircom will benefit from this?

If Eircom reduced or increased that price it would have to do so for absolutely everyone in the country.   We are never afraid to take compliance cases with Eircom if we need to.  The wholesale price change relates to Eircom's roll out of its next-generation service and the fact that it needs to reduce its prices in order to be able to compete with the likes of UPC.  It needs to be able to reduce its wholesale prices so that other operators can compete with it.  That change is happening and is something that ComReg welcomes but it is not a change that we have approved.  It is within the rules of regulation under which Eircom operates.<\/p><p>  Specific reference was made to Amazon.  We have an ongoing dialogue with the IDA and larger businesses, rather than availing of the residential-type broadband services in Ireland, tend to avail of leased line services and more bespoke services.  Ireland has a good record in terms of the price, availability and quality of those big-business services.  However, where there are any specific issues, we are always happy to talk to the IDA and other industry representatives.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Phelan made reference to quality and that is certainly one of the big issues <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> broadband.  As I explained earlier, it is a reasonable presumption that broadband is now available to everybody in the country but in a lot of cases it is at very low speeds.  The problem is how to ensure that we get higher speeds and a very reliable service for everyone.  The solution is always a mixture of technologies.  Where people can avail of fibre and cable networks, the platforms are upgraded.  Fourth generation mobile technology will also help.  The fixed wireless access service I mentioned earlier has also been important in this context.  <\/p><p>  A lot of what we do in ComReg on the consumer side focuses on transparency.  We have a website, <i>callcosts.ie<\/i>, where people can input information on their location and their telecommunications needs.  They are then given information on the service providers in their area and the speeds and prices on offer.  I mentioned that we are starting to put together a broadband speeds pilot scheme where we will have people around the country sampling products in their local area and reporting to us on the real experience.  Obviously, there is often a difference between the advertised speed and the real experience.  We want to get some genuine user experience data that we can make available to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257600,"counter":758,"content":"<p>How would a person apply to take part in that scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400007#F00500","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363257600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>An external provider is setting up the scheme for us and that entity is responsible for putting together the sample, which needs to be an appropriate size with an adequate geographic spread.  I can discuss this further with the Deputy after the meeting and would be happy to provide her with the specifics on the scheme.  It is very important for us that the sample is correct, accurate and reflects the real experience.  That is a new project for us.  We have also had discussions with the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, ASAI, about the advertisement of broadband speeds.  A number of years ago the authority set out guidelines for telecommunications operators and their broadband advertisements so that the operators would not exaggerate the speeds available in their advertisements.  The operators have been directed to indicate speeds at busy times rather than in the middle of the night, for example.  We have done a lot of work in that space.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Fleming's contribution, I repeat what I said to Deputy Harrington, namely that there is no change in the retail price for a fixed line in Ireland.  The universal service regime applies fully.  We are fully aware of the need to try to drive telecommunications investment out as far as we can into more rural areas and we are very aware of the value of these services to rural communities.  Everybody needs high-quality telecommunications services in this day and age.  We do our best to regulate the market in a way that pushes service provision out but for that last leg or piece of the picture, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources engages in public interventions, as is the case across Europe.  We try to minimise the piece that the Government needs to fill in.  <\/p><p>  In the context of universal service, we insist on high-quality standards from Eircom.  We have put in place a performance improvement scheme with the company, whereby it is expected to achieve certain metrics, year on year.  As an example of this, Eircom had obligations last year with regard to fault repair, whereby it had to repair 80% of all faults within two days.  <\/p> <p>While Eircom achieved most of the targets we had set, this was one it did not meet.  We applied a penalty of &euro;225,000 in respect of fault repair which it paid over to us at the end of last year.  We have this performance improvement regime in place for universal service and where Eircom does not match up, we apply penalties to the company.  It is a regime that is in place to try to improve the quality of universal service provided everywhere in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363258200,"counter":761,"content":"<p>Does ComReg have more forensic figures to show where Eircom falls down on fault repairs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400008#G00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363258200,"counter":762,"content":"<p>The figures are as reported and independently audited.

I have some questions and will try to be as specific and brief as possible.  <\/p><p>  As the delegation is aware, in 2013 the charity sector and mobile operators launched a mobile text service to ensure 100% of donations would go to charity.  This was most welcome and I acknowledge it.  Why does ComReg require charities to obtain a premium rate service licence when they do not appear to come within the definition of premium rate provider under the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010?  The specifics of the legislation point out that it must apply to an organisation or an individual that gains, but I do not believe charities are in the business of gaining, rather they are in the business of engaging in more altruistic work.<\/p><p>  Does ComReg monitor the volume of text messages sent to television and radio programmes?  Does it have the capacity to do this or can it provide relevant information in this regard?<\/p><p>  There is very good fibre optic communications broadband infrastructure in the north west, namely, Project Kelvin.  It extends from North America to the north west<b><\/b>and includes Coleraine, Strabane and Letterkenny.  The project is remarkably beneficial to a town such as Letterkenny.  However, there is a geographical region, the Inishowen Peninsula, which is larger than County Louth and has a larger population than County Leitrim.  There is concern among the people living on the peninsula that they are being put at a comparative disadvantage as a result of the lack of connectivity.  Is ComReg aware of this?  Does it believe the people living there are being put at a comparative disadvantage from an industrial investment point of view?  Does it have plans to address the issue?<\/p><p>  There is a specific issue in Cornagill, outside Letterkenny, where there is a household that cannot avail of broadband service because it is at the critical four-mile point.  I will submit the specific information to ComReg and I am keen for the delegation to follow up on it.<\/p><p>  My final question relates to the methodology used by ComReg.  Some years ago I sat on the joint committee which was responsible for dealing with telecommunications issues.  At the time the methodology used in measuring mobile phone coverage involved a person getting into his or her car and driving along the national primary routes.  Is that methodology still in vogue?  The reason I ask is that in a county such as Donegal, especially on the Inishowen Peninsula, there are few, if any, national primary routes.  The eastern side of the Inishowen Peninsula is a disaster for mobile phone coverage.  There are places in my neck of the woods where one can drive along scenic routes from Mulroy and the Fanad Peninsula to Milford or Carrigart, but there are no national primary routes.  Is that methodology still being used and, if so, what plans does ComReg have to ensure it will measure mobile phone coverage in a more comprehensive and equitable manner for regions that are not near national primary routes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400008#G00400","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363258200,"counter":764,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions, the first of which was related to what we call the premium rate services sector.  I will provide a brief explanation of the history.  Premium rate services involve buying and paying for a service through one's telephone bill.  The costs appear on the bill, whether it is for a mobile or fixed telephone.  For many years this service was regulated by an industry funded group called Regtel.  Following on from the 2010 legislation the duty was given to ComReg to regulate this area.  The Act is specific in terms of ComReg's duties and how a premium rate service is defined.  We have no scope to escape from the definitions set out in the Act.  Following the enactment of the legislation, ComReg sought to put in place a code of practice to protect consumers.  ComReg has approximately 33,000 consumer contacts per year.  By contact I mean an issue a consumer brings to our attention.  Of these, approximately 21,000 or 22,000 relate to communications services, while more than 10,000 relate to premium rate services.  It has been an area in which there has been significant confusion and upset has been caused to consumers, in particular in cases in which consumers believed they had not subscribed to a service but in which they had found that amounts of money were being added to their telephone bill. <\/p><p>  ComReg introduced a code of practice in this area and several providers of premium rate services took legal proceedings against it because of the premium rate service regime.  The cases were taken not only against ComReg but also against the State, the Minister, the Government and the Attorney General.  I am pleased to report that these proceedings have come to a conclusion and a code of practice is being fully applied.  We have taken several compliance actions against premium rate providers in cases in which, in effect, consumers were not being treated appropriately under the code.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned a specific issue affecting charities.  ComReg must examine each premium rate service on its merits.  We will apply the legislation and the code in the normal way with regard to the issues mentioned by the Deputy.  That is the general approach we must take.  Regardless of who is advertising, whether it be a business or a charity, it is important that the consumer who is the subject of the advertisements receive correct information and that the advertisements not be in any way incorrect.  I have no wish to comment on a specific case, but we have this code of practice on which we publicly consulted and we apply it to everyone equally and fairly.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked whether we could monitor the volume of premium rate service texts.  Our quarterly report publishes the total number of texts sent in Ireland.  It is a vast number, approximately 3 billion per quarter - I believe we are the most active texters in Europe.  We do not have information on the number of texts sent to premium rate service providers, as that is their business and so on.  However, we monitor the adherence of premium rate service providers to the code of practice.<\/p><p>  I understand Project Kelvin has been delivered by the Government working jointly with the Government in Northern Ireland with EU funding support.<\/p> <p>I absolutely agree that these types of international broadband connectivity are vital.  The first big one in Ireland was the global crossing network, about ten or 11 years ago.  It is vital that the country has these connections.  The next big question is whether other areas in the country connect back.  Do they have backhaul to the point of international connection?  A key issue for an area like Donegal would be whether other operators, such as BT, Eircom or ESB are connecting back to Project Kelvin and bringing that connectivity into the area.  I do not have specific information about where Project Kelvin goes.  It was a matter for the two governments and not for ComReg.<\/p><p> Deputy McHugh mentioned issues regarding certain parts of Donegal.  If we talk afterwards, we can get that detail from the Deputy and follow up with operators to see what the specific issues are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013031400008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363258800,"counter":766,"content":"<p>There was joint North-South and EU funding but ComReg is, nevertheless, a communications regulator.
