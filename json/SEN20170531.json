The Minister of State is very welcome to the House this morning and I thank him for his presence.  I want to discuss the issue of rural sewerage schemes.  The Minister of State's Department has a multi-annual rural water programme that runs from 2016 to 2018.  It is due to expire at the end of this year.  One of the areas for which funding can be got is group sewerage schemes where clusters of households are on septic tanks, which in many cases are troublesome from an environmental perspective.  As the scheme is due to expire, I am interested to know the Minister of State's plans for a new scheme and how it will evolve under his new announcement.  There was huge demand in terms of uptake of the current scheme.  I understand 17 local authorities made applications and 83 submissions for funding were received from those local authorities.  Unfortunately, in its current guise the scheme is very limited, as the Minister of State is aware, in that only two schemes in the State are funded each year.  I am sure he will agree that is inadequate, and I ask that he might address that to ensure every county would benefit from some form of funding to deal with this issue.<\/p> <p>As I said, the scheme in its present guise is quite limited and onerous on members of the public.  Householders who wish to form as a group to seek funding have to form a limited company, hire engineers and collect moneys.  That is onerous on the groups involved.  I would like to see the local authority taking complete control of such issues and taking the burden off people who, with all due respect to them, are not qualified to deal with them.  In many cases, the local authority has an overriding function to ensure all matters are dealt with accordingly, so that should be taken from the local authority.  I would welcome Minister of State's comments on that.<\/p> <p>The other issue the Minister of State might comment on, while we are graced with his presence, is funding for individual septic tanks.  When people were asked to register their tanks initially, it was done under the perception from Government that funding would be made available to householders with troublesome septic tanks.  Unfortunately, when they registered, it became clear that was not the case.  People are only eligible for funding where a member of a local authority discovers that a septic tank is not functioning properly.  That is unfair and that scheme should be looked at also.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State again for his presence here and I would welcome his comments on both issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#A00400","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I think the Senator got two bites of the cherry, but I am sure the Minister of State will be able to handle it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#A00500","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>No better man.  He is well able to do it.  He is a typical Monaghan man.  He squeezes as much as he can out of it.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising these issues.  I am happy to answer them as best I can.  My Department's new multi-annual rural water programme 2016-2018 was developed through a working group of key stakeholders involving local authorities, the water services transition office, Irish Water, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes as well as my Department.  The programme provides for the funding of demonstration group sewerage schemes through measure 4(d), where clustering of households on individual septic tanks is not a viable option, particularly from an environmental perspective.<\/p> <p>In January 2016, local authorities were invited to submit bids under the programme.  The invitation envisaged no more than two demonstration group sewerage projects being brought forward under the measure in any one year of the three-year programme.  That is in line with the sanction received by my Department in December 2015 from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to increasing the maximum grant per house to &euro;6,750, which is up from &euro;6,500, to cover a limited number of new demonstration group sewerage schemes.<\/p> <p>In addition, sanction was also given for these new demonstration group sewerage schemes, in exceptional circumstances, to benefit from a supplemental grant, subject to my Department&rsquo;s approval, where the project represents the most economically advantageous option.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Where a supplemental grant is approved, the overall level of funding from the rural water programme is limited to approximately 90% of the cost per house subject to a minimum contribution of &euro;2,250 per house.<\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge the inclusion of these demonstration group sewerage schemes within the overall new multi-annual funding programme.  Last year, 2016, represented the first year in transitioning to the new funding framework for the rural water programme.  Therefore, we are in the early stages of this new approach.  The demonstrations will allow my Department, over the course of the programme, to determine the appropriate enduring funding levels and relationship with the current grant scheme.<\/p><p>As new demonstration group schemes have been identified for the duration of the programme, and given that only two demonstration projects can be advanced in any given year, my Department does not propose to modify the programme at this point.  My Department will give consideration to the scope of the measure under the programme from 2019 onwards having regard to the implementation of the existing multi-annual rural water programme, which runs to the end of next year.  My Department also will give wider consideration to the report of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services as it relates to the rural water programme.  That report is still being worked on.  There is an interest and a desire in the Department to do more in this regard, but it all depends on what funding we get from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>The demonstration projects are moving forward.  Given that the Senator has mentioned it previously, I know that he is interested in the Milltown project.  A range of projects could be moved forward if we were able to secure funding, so we will keep that in mind as we roll out the programme, particularly its first phase.<\/p><p>Regarding funding for septic tanks, it was clear at the time that people were being asked to register their tanks in order that local authorities could manage the situation from an environmental perspective.  There was never a commitment that money would be available for every issue.  The then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, made it clear that, where a problem was identified following a test by a local authority, a grant would be made available if someone needed help correcting the environmental issue.  There has been a low level of testing in some areas, but that testing is targeted on key areas where there are environmental concerns, generally near waterways.  However, no major concerns have been raised about the grant.<\/p><p>Concerns were raised in this and the Lower House that thousands of difficult situations would arise, but that has not happened.  As with many issues that are raised in the Houses in a big hullabaloo, the panic was not necessary and the situation has been relatively calm since.  There have been a couple of cases and we might discuss them, but if an environmental risk is flagged to a local authority, it generally conducts tests on a number of septic tanks or bioCycles in the area to determine whether there is an issue.  That can then lead on to the issue being addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#A00600","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

This matter relates to the direction given to local authorities regarding residential car parking.  We can all say with certainty that this matter has caused a great deal of hassle in areas.  Being Dublin-centric, I am speaking about Dublin.  I will not address individual requests, angst or fights but there is a great deal of anger and disbelief about the requirement on people to pay for car parking outside their own front doors.  We must examine all of the Dublin local authorities' by-laws in their entirety.  Will the Minister of State ask local authorities to engage in public consultation in order to update by-laws and provide priority parking for residents on their own streets?  Other people leave their cars in their areas and spend the day in town or at work or go on holiday and leave their cars behind for considerable lengths of time.<\/p> <p>I asked the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to undertake a research paper on this matter.  It is a wonderful research paper.  The service examined the five European cities of Edinburgh, Exeter, London, Paris and Amsterdam.  While they have no priority parking for residents, there are novel ways of providing residents with parking close to their homes.  I would like to send the paper on to the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>We need to modernise how people live in the city, with all of its demands on roads and parking.  The idea is for people to make less use of their cars, but people will realistically have to use them and park them safely outside their own homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#B00700","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Devine for raising this issue.  If it is okay, I will take the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who could not make it this morning.<\/p> <p>I wish to clarify the Minister's role in this matter.  The parking of vehicles on public roads is controlled either through the application of prohibitions and restrictions under road traffic (traffic and parking) regulations made by the Minister under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 or by by-laws made by local authorities under section 36 of that Act with respect to public roads in their functional areas.  The power to make by-laws is, therefore, conferred on local authorities by the Oireachtas through primary legislation.<\/p> <p>Under existing legislation, there is no power for the Minister to give direction to local authorities regarding public consultation so that city parking by-laws can be updated and residents given priority for parking within their estates.  Responsibility for traffic management is devolved to individual local authorities, including those in the Dublin area, to enable them to manage and regulate affairs within their own functional areas.  Through by-laws, local authorities have responsibility for determining where parking places will be, the level and payment of fees and the conditions to be applied.<\/p> <p>Before making by-laws under the Act, local authorities are obliged to consult the Garda Commissioner, give public notice of their intention to make the by-laws and consider any observation or objection that results from that process.  This process affords the opportunity to members of the public to have a say in and an input into the shaping of the policy to restrict or prohibit parking in specified circumstances on public roads in specified areas.  Any feedback or representation received must be considered by the elected local authority prior to the making of any by-law.<\/p> <p>It is appreciated that a certain inconvenience can be experienced by residents when parking congestion arises on a daily basis on public roads in residential areas.  At some locations throughout this city, for example, motorists may use residential areas to park if they are working or as park-and-ride facilities while they commute onwards by bus, rail or tram to work and collect their vehicles later that day upon returning, which can cause parking challenges for residents.  As the Senator mentioned, people might park in an area for a week while they go off on holiday.<\/p> <p>However, there is no legislative provision to reserve parking on a priority basis on specified public roads exclusively to those who reside on them or in the relevant estates.  The policy behind this reflects the fundamental principle under road traffic law that the use of public roads is for public purposes.  This means that private individuals should not be able to exercise proprietary rights of any nature over our public roads.<\/p> <p>While there is no provision for priority parking on public roads by residents, those who wish to avail of on-street parking in their own residential areas, where paid parking operates under by-laws made by the local authority, can apply for a resident's permit from the local authority, which allows them to park on their streets without having to pay the applicable parking rate for the duration of such parking.  I trust that this clarifies the Minister's position for the Senator.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> If the Senator has carried out research, like all Ministers, Deputy Ross will be glad to avail of that and will certainly have it looked over by the Department.

Management at the airport met with the three unions representing staff a few weeks back to inform them of the plans, which will include the re-categorisation of the airport from category 9 down to category 7, which will limit the number of larger airlines transiting through Shannon.<\/p><p>This news came as a complete shock - a bombshell, in fact - to the staff working in Shannon.  I can tell the Minister of State first-hand that many staff are now worried about how the airport has been struggling financially since it separated from the Dublin Airport Authority.  One of the staff said to me that staff feel Shannon cannot survive on its own.  They feel this reduction in status reduces it to the same level as Knock or Kerry airports.  They know it is losing money and they feel a category 7 airport is for smaller aircraft, effectively making Shannon a Ryanair airport for European destinations.  Union officials are currently talking to staff at the airport to decide how to respond.<\/p><p>I want to put this in context.  The original business plan for the airport painted a rosy picture of achieving 2.5 million passengers by 2021 and adding 3,000 new aviation jobs in the first five years as a stand-alone operation.  Behind the spin and bluster, Shannon has completely failed to achieve anything like these figures.  In reality, passenger numbers increased from 1.4 million to 1.7 million by 2015, but 2016 saw just a 2% increase in to 1.74 million, a figure way below growth in comparable airports.  This compares to 3.6 million travellers who were going through Shannon in 2007.  It is depressing to think that those passengers also include the hundreds of thousands of US troops who should not be there, but that is a whole other issue for another day.<\/p><p>Shannon management are now working on a new masterplan, as they describe it, or perhaps that should be a cunning plan, in the Blackadder Baldrick sense of the term.  The reality is that instead of increasing jobs, the airport now wants to cut jobs via a downgrading of the status from category 9 to category 7.  A key consequence is that Shannon would no longer be nominated as a diversion destination for aircraft travelling across the Atlantic.  This is a very retrograde and short-sighted proposal.  The name of Shannon Airport is synonymous throughout much of the Western world as a safe haven for flights that encounter difficulty.  It is part of the unique brand that Shannon has had to offer for decades.  Now, the management want to ditch this brand, with all the goodwill and name awareness it generates, in order to cut services and jobs.<\/p><p>It is increasingly apparent that management have no credible vision for the future of the airport and that the decision to hive off Shannon from the DAA has been a significant mistake.  The Minister needs to take responsibility.  I would remind him of the words of his predecessor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, with regard to Shannon, when he said: <\/p><blockquote>I think it is defeatist to think that we can&rsquo;t achieve modest growth by 2021.  Quite frankly, if Shannon can&rsquo;t achieve that kind of growth by 2021, there is no future for the airport...<\/blockquote> <p>Clearly, right now, we are miles behind the targets we need to hit.<\/p><p>In conclusion, Shannon Airport has a proud history of transatlantic travel and international status.  The people of Clare and Limerick are seeing that tradition and history being rolled up into a ball and thrown in the bin by current management, who made empty promises and have clearly failed to hit targets they themselves promised to deliver.  Rather than job growth, we have job cuts, and we now have the prospect of relegating the airport's status, a shameful prospect that no Government should stand for.  I ask the Minister to recognise the need for an urgent review of policy with regard to our regional airports, Shannon international airport in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#C00800","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gavan for raising this issue.  It is always a pleasure to spend time in his company, which I appreciate.  We are touching on a familiar subject when it comes to Shannon Airport.  I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  As the Cathaoirleach said, while he could not be here, he did offer to take this matter at another time.  He is quite generous with his time, when he can be.  As we know, Ministers must at times commit to other diary engagements and these debates often take place at short notice.  I think it wrong to complain he is not here when he offered to deal with this at a more suitable time.<\/p> <p>The Government's policy in regard to Shannon Airport is clearly set out in the national aviation policy published in 2015.  The policy recognises that Shannon Airport holds a strategic importance for connectivity to the mid-west region and also serves as a gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way.  I understand a major consideration for the Government in deciding to separate Shannon Airport from the DAA in 2012 was the serious decline of passenger traffic at the airport.  Shannon Airport was loss-making since 2008 and passenger numbers plummeted by over 60% from 3.62 million in 2007 to 1.39 million in 2012.  A consistent decline on that scale was always going to be challenging to address and would take time.  However, since its independence, Shannon Airport has not only succeeded in reversing a five-year decline in passenger numbers, but has recorded four years of successive increases, with cumulative passenger growth of over 24% in that period.  That is not to be sniffed at and is quite a good percentage.  In 2016, passenger numbers at the airport increased for the fourth consecutive year, with almost 1.75 million flying through the airport, a 2% increase on 2015, with a number of new airlines and services.<\/p> <p>Shannon Airport Authority is a subsidiary company of Shannon Group, the commercial semi-State group established in September 2014.  The group's strategy is to improve air connectivity, develop its commercial property infrastructure and enhance its portfolio of tourism heritage attractions, all of which will attract more people to live and work in the region.  Shannon Group is an enabler, providing the right environment for foreign direct investment and indigenous industry to prosper.<\/p> <p>The latest data from the IDA shows the mid-west was the fastest growing region outside of Dublin in 2016, with 16 companies that announced new or expanded operations, citing the global connectivity provided by Shannon Airport as a key reason for basing themselves on the west coast.  The year 2016 saw the largest increase on record in employment growth by IDA client companies in the mid-west, making this region the fastest growing nationally for FDI at more than 10%.  I spend a lot of time in the Limerick and Shannon area, given my involvement in enterprise and job creation programmes and in trying to future proof companies and jobs.  As the Minister has said, much of the feedback suggests that connectivity is a key part of business decision making.  The Government and the various authorities involved recognise this, as is borne out in our policies.<\/p> <p>The Shannon Group has advised that it is currently focused on providing quality infrastructure to entice more FDI and indigenous investment to the region.  To this end, Shannon Commercial Properties, the group's property company, is investing over &euro;26 million in property solutions at Shannon free zone to give the IDA and enterprise agencies the tools they need in attracting investment and jobs to the region.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I understand that Shannon Commercial Properties will have developed over 200,000 sq. ft. of state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing, warehousing and office space by the end of this year.  This new business accommodation will assist the job creation agencies in enticing more employment and investment to the area.<\/p><p>Like any business owner, the Shannon Airport Authority is conscious of the need to control its\u00a0costs so that it can remain competitive and continue to attract new airline business in an increasingly\u00a0competitive international marketplace.  In this regard,\u00a0the company has engaged with staff and union representatives on a range of proposals, one of which is to operate at category 9 on a flexible basis rather than to operate permanently at that level on a 24-7 basis all year round.  This proposal has led to claims of the airport being downgraded, which have been repeated here.  That is not the case.  What is being proposed is an optimal use of resources in line with best business practice, thus ensuring that resources are deployed more efficiently and when required.  I am informed that this flexibility will enable the airport to operate at optimal manning levels in order that it might be as efficient and cost-effective as possible and contribute to a more efficient operating model at the airport without any material impact on flight operations.<\/p><p>The categorisation of an airport is from a fire-and-rescue perspective.  It is dictated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO.  The categorisation is based on the size of the aircraft that operate through an airport and outlines the minimum number of fire appliances and fire-fighting media required to operate at the appropriate categorisation.<\/p><p>Shannon Airport currently operates at category 9 level on a 24-7 basis all year round.  As I stated at the outset, the operation of the airport is the statutory responsibility of Shannon Airport Authority.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport believes that the airport authority is doing a satisfactory job in a very competitive environment.  He believes that it should be encouraged in its efforts to run the airport as efficiently as possible, ensuring the future viability of the company for all of its staff and customers, and securing the airport's position as one of strategic importance for the connectivity of the mid-west region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#C00900","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>May I comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#D00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Very briefly.

I thank him for coming to the House to provide clarification on a statement made in respect of a Commencement matter tabled by Senator Conway on 14 December last year.<\/p><p>Mr. Jim Connolly asked me to bring this issue to the attention of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Mr. Connolly is the founder and Chair of Rural Resettlement Ireland.  To date, over 800 families have been resettled in rural areas.  The project has been hailed as a major contributor to rural regeneration.  As the Minister of State will know, Rural Resettlement Ireland is a registered housing body that provides free services to anyone who wishes to relocate.  Rural Resettlement Ireland received core funding from the Department every year until it was cut in 2012.  That move resulted in the final and very regrettable closure of the organisation this year.<\/p><p>During a Commencement debate last December, the Minister of State said:<\/p><blockquote>[T]o guarantee that the rental properties supported by RRI are sustainably managed and maintained, fees for the management and maintenance of capital loan and subsidy scheme supported properties continue to be available to it, subject to compliance with the relevant terms and conditions.  These fees, together with loan and interest charges, amounted to more than &euro;696,000 over the past five years.<\/blockquote> <p>From my discussions with Mr. Connolly, and having had sight of the audited 2016 accounts for the charity, this is at best an inaccurate figure due to unclear accounting or, at worst, an outright misrepresentation of the facts.  To place the matter in context, the 21 social houses referred to represent only 0.25% of the 800 families resettled since 1990.  The Department's management grant paid to all voluntary housing bodies is &euro;436 per house or &euro;9,156 per year, which amounts to &euro;45,780 for five years.  This is a far cry from the &euro;696,000 referred to during the Commencement debate last December.  While it is true that amortisation, which is an accountancy term, of the Government grant appears in Rural Resettlement Ireland's accounts, it relates to the normal method of building 21 houses with non-repayable mortgages.  This does not translate into ongoing cash support in any way and to imply that it does is wrong.  The immediate clarification of this aspect is a matter of personal and public significance to Mr. Connolly, who is seriously aggrieved by the statements.<\/p><p>The rural resettlement initiative is one of the most successful voluntary initiatives ever undertaken in this country.  The scheme has provided one-to-one relocated services for 800 families who have rejuvenated rural communities.  It has give the families an exceptional qualify of life in communities of their choice through sustained co-operation with the Department, State agencies, family and local services.  Rural Resettlement Ireland built up a wealth of experience, wisdom and knowledge that cannot easily be replaced.  Since its State funding was cut in 2012, Rural Resettlement Ireland has still managed to assist almost 40 families to move to rural areas in private rented housing.  The work has been done entirely on a voluntary basis.  I find it incomprehensible that this project had its funding cut in 2012 and is now being wound up during one of the worst urban housing crises that this country has seen.  Instead of cutting funding to a recognised housing body with a wealth of experience, one would have imagined that it would have been viewed as a viable solution.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, when speaking about the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development of 600 towns and villages, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, said that people are needed to revitalise towns.  In light of decreasing rural populations, initiatives that promote relocation should be encouraged.  The Minister's grant aid for home purchase and renovation is laudable.  However, we must remember that not everyone has the money to purchase his or her own home and, for many, long or medium-term rental is the optimum solution.<\/p><p>What Mr. Connolly and Rural Resettlement Ireland have achieved through relocation has been more enduring and successful than any Government policy.  We need more , not less, of such inspirational commitment, which has been given over decades.  Far from misrepresenting or discrediting the work of Rural Resettlement Ireland, however accidentally, we should applaud it and give it the due acknowledgement in respect of its indisputable success.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position regarding figure of &euro;696,000 to which I refer.  I also ask him to give serious consideration to the reinstatement of the grant aid to Rural Resettlement Ireland, which would allow us to harness the wealth of knowledge and experience that it has accumulated.  I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to come to the House.  I hope that he will answer my queries, particularly my call for the re-establishment of Rural Resettlement Ireland.  We have been told that there are many houses available in rural Ireland, so all we need is to get Rural Resettlement Ireland and similar organisations up and running again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#D00800","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The context of the question that was supplied to me is a little different from what he has asked today.  I shall endeavour to answer all of his queries to the best of my ability.<\/p> <p>Let me be clear, I took that debate in December.  I thought I went out of my way on that occasion to praise the work done by Mr. Connolly and Rural Resettlement Ireland over the years.  I wish to make it clear that Mr. Connolly and Rural Resettlement Ireland have done great work.  I am very conscious of the more than 800 families that have been helped.  I have watched numerous programmes that featured the work.  Certainly, the debate on the previous occasion should not have left Mr. Connolly with the wrong impression.  If I need to talk to him directly, I shall do so.<\/p> <p>The original question tabled by the Senator did not feature this matter so I may be unable to reply to everything.  We have discussed this matter on two occasions.  I have definitely discussed it with Senator Conway and with other Oireachtas members from the Clare area.  I have complimented and recognised the work of Rural Resettlement Ireland.  Mr. Connolly has engaged with the Minister's officials about ways to develop and fund new rural resettlement projects.  There is a homeless situation in many of our larger cities and urban areas, yet there are many vacant properties in rural areas.  We are trying to join the dots in terms of this matter.  We have engaged with Mr. Connolly because of his expertise and we are happy to continue to do so.  There should not any doubt about the quality of his work or that of his organisation.  If anything I said last December gave that impression, then I am happy to correct same.<\/p> <p>I shall clarify matters that relate to the rural resettlement initiative.  From 2011 to 2016, my Department provided &euro;696,228 to Clare County Council.  This money was solely in respect of 21 properties developed by Rural Resettlement Ireland.  The funding was provided under the terms of the capital loan and subsidy scheme, CLSS.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The capital loan and subsidy scheme, CLSS, provides capital funding via the local authorities to the approved housing bodies, including Rural Resettlement Ireland, to construct social housing for those on the waiting lists of the local authorities.  More than 10,000 social homes have been delivered through the CLSS since it was commenced in 1991.  Under the CLSS arrangements, local authorities access funding from the Housing Finance Agency through loan finance arrangements.  In turn, the local authorities provide this funding to the approved housing bodies by way of a non-refundable loan, provided that the AHB complies with the terms and conditions of the CLSS.  The local authorities repay the loan finance received from the Housing Finance Agency over a 30-year period using the funding they receive twice yearly from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Of the overall amount of &euro;696,228 provided from 2011 to 2016 by the Department to Clare County Council in respect of 21 Rural Resettlement Ireland properties, the sum of &euro;662,220 relates to the servicing of the loans the council received from the Housing Finance Agency.  A smaller amount of &euro;34,008 relates to the management and maintenance subsidy paid to Clare County Council for the dwellings occupied by tenants of Rural Resettlement Ireland under the terms of the CLSS.<\/p><p>Unlike local authorities, approved housing bodies do not receive capital funding from the Department for the upkeep of their housing stock or for upgrading works.  Instead, the approved housing bodies rely on rental income plus the management and maintenance subsidy to maintain their stock.  Similar to the funding received for the servicing of the loans, the management and maintenance subsidy is provided to the approved housing bodies via the local authorities.  To qualify for the management and maintenance subsidy, dwellings of the approved housing body must be let to tenants approved for housing by the local authority.<\/p><p>To clarify this matter, the figure of &euro;696,228 provided by the Department between 2011 and 2016 relates to the 21 houses developed through the capital loan and subsidy scheme by Rural Resettlement Ireland at various locations in County Clare.  The figure is broken into two elements: &euro;662,220 of funding provided by the Department to Clare County Council towards servicing the loans, and the balance of &euro;34,008 for the management and maintenance subsidy paid to Clare County Council.  I can confirm, therefore, that none of the funding included in the &euro;696,228 relates to the administration of the rural resettlement initiative.  Separately, grant assistance was historically provided by the Department to Rural Resettlement Ireland as a contribution towards its administrative costs.  In the five-year period to which Senator Craughwell refers, &euro;30,081 of such funding was provided: &euro;20,081 in 2011 and &euro;10,000 in 2012.  I hope this clarifies the matter and it was certainly not my intention in December that there would be any doubt around that.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to clear that up.  I am sorry that I did not realise that was reason the Senator asked the question in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#D00900","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The sheer scale of the taxpayer bailout of &euro;20 billion should warrant a more transparent approach to any potential sale of this State-owned bank.  Any plan to sell part of this public asset should be clear in its reasoning.  The plan to sell up to 25% of the shares has been announced with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, providing little or no rationale.  This is a profitable bank from which the State received &euro;250 million in dividends last year.<\/p> <p>There is no reason AIB should not be kept as a State bank to invest in our economy and to operate in competition with the private banking sector.  The only reasoning offered so far is that state banks are not successful.  This is not true.  There is no basis for this whatever.  Some of the best performing banks in Europe, such as those in Germany, are state banks.  Every bank in this State that collapsed was a private bank.  In one of his final acts as Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan is not being honest with taxpayers.  These are the people who bailed out AIB and ultimately own 99.9% in shares.  It is no surprise that AIB was far more receptive to public pressure on issues such as the standard variable rates and the sales to vulture funds.  With any proposed sale, we will lose accountability.  Even when it was State owned, they had to be brought kicking and screaming before the finance committee to examine the variable rates.  That process is ongoing.  When it is privatised we will have no accountability whatsoever.  There needs to be a full debate and clarity provided on this and I would welcome Deputy Noonan coming into this House to explain why he wants to sell it now and why he is not negotiating the fiscal rules in order to allow us to spend any dividends from AIB in capital funding.  We need explanations because it is the people who suffered most, the SMEs, the mortgage holders and the rural branch users who will now be at the mercy of unaccountable private investors.

This is a landmark decision with major implications for how we treat asylum seekers in this country.  I have raised it here before and human rights organisations have been saying it for years but the system of direct provision is a disgrace.  We have an obligation to treat people with basic dignity and respect and that includes the right to work.  Who benefits from stopping talented, ambitious people from realising their potential and contributing to their communities?  Who benefits from telling bright young children in education that they can go no further in their studies or employment?  This particular case was brought by a Burmese man who had spent eight long years in direct provision without the right to work a single day in that period.  Imagine what it must feel like to go that long without being able to seek employment to provide for oneself or contribute to the community like one's neighbours.  He noted how this had led him to suffer from depression and to an almost complete loss of autonomy.  We owe this man a huge debt of gratitude.  While the State dragged its heels and refused to address this injustice, the perseverance of this man in pursuing this case has now forced the Government to act.  Credit to him and to all those in direct provision who spent years fighting this ban.  They have done a huge amount to improve the lives of asylum seekers in Ireland.<\/p> <p>The onus is now on the Government to respond humanely.  The court has adjourned the case for six months, which means that we in Leinster House have until just before Christmas to sort this out.  I am concerned to read reports in this morning's newspapers suggesting that the common travel area and Brexit negotiations may be used as an excuse to implement an overly restrictive right to work.  We should not go down this route.  We should use this ruling as an opportunity to look at our employment policies when it comes to asylum seekers and extend them generously.  It is also important to note that at their hustings in Cork at the weekend, both would-be Fine Gael leaders expressed support for this idea.  It time to put their money where their mouths are and I ask the Government to outline its plans on this issue as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#H01400","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I support Senator Black's comments and welcome the Supreme Court decision yesterday on the right to work.

I am asking that the Leader take account of this.  I know we have a busy day today but I am conscious that we have an extra half hour to spare given that the time allocated to Private Members' business has been reduced.  On behalf of the Labour Party Senators, we would be happy to take the motion in the Minister's absence and vote on it in this House.  It is a matter that is quite urgent.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh has spoken eloquently about the rationale for the motion, but briefly, in order that colleagues are aware, the motion simply calls on the Government to postpone the sale of AIB shares until we have sought and achieved a change to fiscal rules to permit greater levels of capital spending.  It is somewhat ludicrous that the Minister for Finance has admitted that the proceeds of the sale of 25% of AIB will pay down just over 1% of our national debt.  We in the Labour Party say that a far better use of the funds would be to put it towards capital investment, the investment that we all acknowledge is needed.  Just this week, the future of health care report was published.  Labour's Deputy Alan Kelly was on the committee and Labour has welcomed it, as have all parties.  The report outlines an ambitious plan towards a single-tier health system but a key part of the plan is a &euro;3 billion transition fund to provide for one-off system-changing measures.  We say that fund would be a far better location for the proceeds of the sale of AIB.  We need to delay the sale of our share in AIB to ensure that we can in fact put it towards investment in health or housing or public expenditure of the sort that is so desperately needed across the public service. <\/p> <p>There was support across the D&aacute;il for this motion and I ask colleagues across the House to support my proposed amendment to the Order of Business in order that we can take this urgent motion today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#H02100","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>For clarification, I take it that the Senator is proposing a debate with the Minister of Finance on the proposed sale of AIB shares be taken today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#H02200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Yes, I am proposing that although we would be happy to have the debate in the Minister's absence if his availability is a difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#H02300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>We will see the Leader's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#H02400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>We wish to have a debate on the motion and a vote on the motion today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#H02500","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>As spokesperson on sport, I raise the farcical situation that has come to light in recent days in regard to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John O'Mahony:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2202\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2202&amp;amp;pid=JohnOMahony&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One could not make up what has happened and what is emerging.

When I was chairman of the committee on sport, we had the Irish Amateur Boxing Association in before us explaining why it lost one of the best coaches and high-performance people in the world.  Is this now going to happen again?  Boxers who had failed drug tests were allowed to travel to Rio.  The coaches did not even know about it and were only informed as the draw was being made in Rio.  It is simply not good enough.  The boxers are the innocent people involved here.  I understand that more than &euro;700,000 has been allocated this year for the high-performance unit.

I am just back from a COSAC plenary meeting in Malta at which we had all 27 countries sitting around tables.  Mr. Michel Barnier gave a speech on Brexit and spoke about openness, transparency and various other things.  As he drew his speech to a close, he addressed the special, unique position of Ireland.  I have never been so encouraged as I was listening to him speak about the problems of Ireland.  The second speaker, a Ms H&uuml;ber I believe, also raised the special, unique problems of Ireland at the end of her speech.

There is a proposal for Dublin public transport that would require an investment of &euro;1 billion in the near future.<\/p> <p>If the Minister cannot come to the House, I think we should have an open debate in the House and the motion should be voted on.  Over a week ago, I put the Leader on notice that we would be tabling such a motion, and he asked us to delay it until the Minister was in the House.  I listened to the Minister's contribution and I felt there was no justification for the sale at this stage.  In fact, we will receive approximately &euro;250 million in dividends from AIB which will come back to the taxpayer in 2017.  There has been no cost-benefit analysis on future profits that could be made through dividends from the State's shares in AIB.<\/p> <p>Under the current rules, if this sale goes ahead, that &euro;3 billion will be used to pay down debt.  That would be 1% - big deal.  If we delay, we have an opportunity to make the sale in autumn and to make sure that money can be invested in much-needed infrastructure projects.  The Labour Party has already started discussions with our sister parties across Europe with regard to changes in the fiscal rules and has received great support in the matter.  The recently elected President of France has also indicated a need to change the fiscal rules in this area.  There is no benefit in proceeding with the sale this month.  If we delay until the autumn, there is an opportunity for an additional &euro;3 billion to be invested in much-needed infrastructure throughout this country.  I strongly believe we need to debate this in this House today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#K00100","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I welcome the doubling of funding, from &euro;650,000 to &euro;1.3 million, that is being provided to aid the crackdown on illegal dumping throughout the country, which is wrecking many lovely, beautiful spots in various counties.

Some time ago I suggested that these people be properly named and shamed.  If that requires amending legislation, so be it.  At a minimum, these people's names should be posted on the websites of the council and the Department.  That would act as a further deterrent.

There has been great discussion on the possibility of elements of Coillte being privatised or sold off.  We know that there are a further 90,000 ha dedicated to biodiversity, or non-core forestry activity, which is a vast amount of land.  As I say, this is a very rich natural and national resource and asset.  It is important to have the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, in the House at some stage in the future to have a debate about forestry - where it is going, what plans there are for it and the greater vision for forestry for the next two to three years.

Could we even get 15 minutes, if possible?  We will clearly not have eight minutes and we will be talking in a jam jar.  The Minister will not have an opportunity to respond.

We also need to look at the right of people in that system to education.  We certainly need to look at scrapping direct provision and I want to see us debate that again as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise a very distressing issue this morning.  It is in respect of lives being put at risk in rural areas due to a lack of ambulance services.  It is not I who is saying this.  A local GP in Connemara has highlighted this issue due to frustration.  Last Saturday night, he was called at 11.30 p.m.  A call was placed for an emergency, blue light ambulance.  This was for a potentially life-threatening acute illness in a 60 year old man.  If an ambulance had been based in Carraroe, it would have been with the gentleman in approximately ten minutes.  Unfortunately, the doctor says, as is frequently the case, no ambulance staff were available in Carraroe and the estimated arrival time for the ambulance was 57 minutes.  He goes on to outline the dangers of that and the fact he felt afraid that the patient would die at the side of the road.  Thankfully, he did not.  On another occasion last year, however, the response time was 120 minutes and, on a different occasion, an ambulance had to come from Roscommon to Carraroe, which is totally and utterly unacceptable.<\/p> <p>I have raised these issues in this House on an ongoing basis since I was elected in 2011.  I have got the deaf ear from every Minister who has ever come in to discuss them.  I know that people in Leenane in north Connemara have raised this issue as well.  They have had meetings with the Minister, Deputy Harris.  The Minister gave them a lovely hearing and was very concerned with their issues but fobbed them off again to the National Ambulance Service.  The Ministers, Deputy Harris, Deputy Varadkar and, the former Deputy, now Senator Reilly, all washed their hands of this issue.  When is the Government going to get real and realise that this is a life and death issue?  In 2015, for example, one of our proposals was to put &euro;6 million from the budget aside to make eight more ambulances and crews available throughout the country.  That was the same year in which &euro;6.5 million was spent on setting up the administrative system for the water conservation grant, which never happened.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government has certain priorities in the way it is spending money, but it is certainly not spending it on rural ambulance services, which it needs to do.

For many years and in previous Olympics the performance and achievements of our boxing team were the envy of many other sports.  Boxers were the standard bearers of Irish sport.  It is 100% proof of bad corporate governance to hear yesterday on the radio and read today in the newspapers where they are at currently.  They did not become bad boxers overnight or over the past four years.  The state of the sport and its organisation at the moment is totally due to poor corporate governance and bad leadership.  When the Minister facilitated a meeting yesterday to try to find a resolution, it was most disrespectful to him that one member of the board did not have the decency to turn up to the meeting.  Amateur boxing is a big beneficiary of the sports grants that are available in this country and, at the end of the day, that is taxpayers' money.  The Minister should pull rank and step in to take control of the association.  That is his prerogative and duty, and especially given the way he was treated yesterday, I would have no problem with such an approach by the Minister, with him knocking heads together and removing some people if he has to.  The situation is most unfortunate because we all took great pleasure from the sport.  It was easy after we had victories to praise those involved to the high heavens, in council chambers or in this House, but they have let us down, and it is not the boxers who are at fault.  The message that should go out from here is that the problem has nothing to do with the boxers but relates to corporate governance.  The issue is mismanagement by the people at the top.  The matter must be addressed immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#L00400","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I have been contacted a number of times in recent weeks about the worsening phone coverage in County Carlow that does not seem to be specific to any one provider.  Mobile signals seem to have deteriorated, which is impacting not only on the service to residential customers but also on businesses, especially in rural areas.  The mobile phone network is essential for businesses seeking to stay in contact with customers and suppliers.  Coverage is more important now than ever before as more and more businesses rely on the mobile phone network for email access.  People's reliance on smartphones is set to increase in the coming years, so it is important the necessary investment in the mobile infrastructure takes place to support this growth.<\/p> <p>We need a state-of-the-art mobile and broadband coverage to support jobs and growth, and the mobile phone operators have been focusing on large urban areas.  That is the reason I raise this issue today.  Carlow town is getting a new broadband system, but the improvements are confined to urban areas and are not available in rural areas.  That is having a massive impact on rural areas.  I read in the newspaper today that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has a catch-up strategy for those who are left behind.  It outlines how he will ensure we have post offices, a GP service available in rural areas and the provision of broadband.  Will he also include phone coverage?  Reference is also made in the strategy to the provision of money for roads.  This is a whole new system.  We need to look at phone coverage and broadband in rural areas because they are affected.

I encourage Members to meet the NHI if at all possible.  The group has raised a number of concerns, in particular the change in the mechanism for the calculation of commercial rates.  I spoke to one nursing home provider who told me the home's commercial rates have increased from &euro;18,000 per annum to &euro;54,000.  That is a huge added cost to the budget of the nursing home and provision will have to be made for it.  The cost will have to be spread down the line.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, was to come back by 1 June with a review of nursing home rates and the rates being paid to private nursing homes, but my understanding is that the review will not now be published on time.  I am concerned about that because nursing homes took a substantial reduction in recent years in what they were being paid for caring for elderly people.  More than 23,500 people are covered under the fair deal scheme.  Nursing homes provide a service and, on the one hand, the State and local authorities are imposing a higher charge on them - the rates have doubled in many nursing homes - but, on the other hand, the NTPF has not indicated when it intends to publish its review of rates.  It is important to deal with the issue as nursing homes have increasing costs.  Nursing homes are also faced with increased insurance costs, as the rates have doubled and trebled in a lot of places.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange for the Minister to deal with this issue.  I understand the Minister is also carrying out a review of the fair deal scheme.

As he knows well, I am not slowing the matter down or obfuscating on it.  There has been an ongoing liaison between my office, Senators Lawless and McDowell and the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality regarding the Bill.  Work on it is proceeding.  We have asked for it to be expedited.  On behalf of the Government side of the House, I am not stalling that work or refusing the Bill to be laid before the House.  I have asked the Department to liaise with Senator Lawless personally.  I can do no more other than ensure that this side does not prevent the Bill's continuation.<\/p> <p>Senators Black and Gavan referred to yesterday's Supreme Court decision.  I welcome the decision and look forward to the Government's response.  It has six months to do so.  Direct provision was discussed on yesterday's Order of Business.  The Government will ensure that there is a positive response.  We must welcome yesterday's decision.  As I said on television last night, I have friends in the direct provision centre in Cork.  They are members of my political party and make a valuable contribution.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned, these people want to be able to contribute to society through their work.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, have been working towards that.  We will debate the matter again.<\/p> <p>Senators O'Mahony and Paul Daly raised the issue of the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA.  It is unacceptable that we are once again seeing turmoil, upset and internal fighting within the IABA.  As Senator Paul Daly rightly said, the boxers were the envy of everyone thanks to their performances.  It is disappointing.  Senator O'Mahony is a former Chairman of the sports and tourism committee.  In his personal capacity as a manager and coach of high-performance athletes, he is right to question what is happening.<\/p> <p>We celebrated at the weekend.  In the Cathaoirleach's native west Cork, the O'Donovan brothers, Mr. Shane O'Driscoll, Mr. Mark O'Donovan and Ms Denise Walsh won medals while representing Ireland in rowing.  There was pride, unity and strength.  That the boxing world is in turmoil again is disappointing and frustrating.  When someone of the calibre of Mr. Bernard Dunne is being undermined, it poses the question of why.  What is it all about?  When people wear the green jersey and represent their country in sport, in this instance in the ring, it is about winning and representing our country with pride.<\/p> <p>There is a duty on those who are charged with running the IABA to show unity and ensure that boxers receive the most advantageous, high-performance and quality training that they can get.  Mr. Dunne should be empowered in his role, not disempowered.  That Mr. John Treacy and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, were treated disrespectfully poses the question of why.  I appeal to everyone involved that they sit down, thrash this out and come out of the room united so that our boxers, who are of the highest quality, as the Senators said, are able to win for all of us.<\/p> <p>I believe that Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to the M20 but I missed a part of what he said.  He will be glad to hear that be our leader Deputy Varadkar or Deputy Coveney, the M20 Cork-Limerick road will be a priority.  As every Senator from the south knows, that road needs to be upgraded as a priority.<\/p> <p>I will pass on Senator Craughwell's message of good will to the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy.  He is a fine Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.<\/p> <p>Senators Craughwell, Mac Lochlainn and Wilson raised the matter of the Jadotville medals.  My next point will be made with sincerity.  With Senator McFadden, I have spoken to the Minister of State.  I have made the case to him.  I will not have a political row in the Chamber but my understanding is that the Minister of State has a different view of his meeting with Senator Mac Lochlainn in the canteen this morning.  In saying that, I have given a commitment.  By text, the Minister of State gave me a commitment after our meeting.  The Defence Forces are conducting an archival review, which will be of assistance in forming a decision.  The Minister of State is willing to meet.

Amendment No. 1 provides a definition of domestic violence that captures not only acts of physical violence, including sexual violence, but also acts of psychological and economic abuse, including stalking and other forms of harassment, and acts which are undertaken to exercise coercive control over their victim.  A law against coercive control has recently been introduced in the United Kingdom.  The aim of the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 should be to reduce and prevent violence in domestic relationships by recognising that domestic violence in all its forms is unacceptable behaviour and by making sure there is effective legal protection for victims of all forms of domestic violence, not just the customary physical abuse of which we are all very intolerant.  I thank my colleagues in the National Women's Council, Safe Ireland and others for all their support in tabling these amendments.<\/p><p>This Bill refers to domestic violence 36 times without attempting to define it, thereby implying that what is meant by domestic violence is clear and understood.  However, reports and statistics to date do not reflect that position, and therefore it is essential that the Bill provides clarity.  There is a real opportunity to do in the Bill.  The committee on the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women has called on the Government to introduce a specific definition of domestic violence into our laws.  In 2014, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality said that domestic offences, given their seriousness, must be clearly defined.<\/p><p>When determining what this definition should look like, we should look to the Istanbul Convention, to which we must adhere.  It defines domestic violence as all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur in the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, regardless of whether the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim.  This is set out in Article 3 of the convention.  The convention also states that violence against women includes threats of the acts listed above as well as coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty.<\/p><p>The National Women's Council of Ireland has called for a clear statutory definition of domestic violence that reflects modern understanding and it should capture not only acts of physical violence, including sexual violence, but also acts of psychological and economic abuse, including stalking and other forms of harassment, and acts that are undertaken to exercise coercive control over their victim.  Furthermore it should recognise that violence within the home is not limited to intimate relationships and can extend to all members of the household.<\/p><p>Inserting a definition into legislation is a feature of other common law jurisdictions.  In particular, New Zealand has had a definition of domestic violence since 1995 which has been amended several times since enactment as social norms and expectations continue to change and new evidence about how to stop violence occurring continues to emerge.  The definition recognises that a distinguishing characteristic of intimate partner violence and child abuse is that violence can be a pattern of harmful behaviours occurring over time that can result in the victim's life being controlled by the perpetrator in a very real way.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  I thank the National Women's Council of Ireland for its help and assistance with this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#P00600","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I support amendment No. 1 in addition to amendment No. 52 in my name as well as the names of other Senators.  It is rather difficult to provide a completely exhaustive list of behaviours.  I have had a communication about a situation in which a woman was being coerced, controlled and intimidated by her husband, outlining the methods he used.  These included putting on the hot water system and consistently leaving the taps running in order that enormous bills would mount up.  There was also telephone and other abuse.  It is rather difficult to produce a completely exhaustive list.  However, the absence of any kind of definition causes a problem and it might lead to a conclusion that domestic violence is the only thing that is contemplated by the Bill.  I have the highest regard for Barnardos as an agency and it has given us strong indications that it would support this Bill.<\/p> <p>I point out that I think there is a typographical error in paragraph (c)(i), which reads \"threatening (including threating suicide)\", which I think should be \"threatening suicide\".<\/p> <p>The situation in terms of women is very worrying indeed.  The numbers that are being supplied to me are quite horrifying.  In 2015, just two years ago, 9,712 women and 3,383 children got support from a domestic violence service.  That is astonishing.  Some 1,471 women and 2,093 children stayed in a refuge.  That is a very interesting figure.  It shows a shift in balance from the first figures.  The figure of 9,712 women and 3,383 children shows a complete preponderance of women and a considerably lower number of children.  When it comes to staying in a refuge, the situation is reversed, where it is a smaller number of women and a considerably larger number of children.  That shows the vulnerability of children in these situations of domestic violence.<\/p> <p>What is more worrying is that 4,796 requests for refuge could not be met.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On one day in 2015, 502 women and 269 children sought and received support from a domestic violence service.  Some 112 women and 147 children were accommodated in refuge but - and here is the real stinker - 18 women could not be accommodated in refuge.  In the past week or two we have been very concerned about a small number of homeless families who were not accommodated and slept in their cars but this is much worse.  It is one thing to be homeless and uncomfortable in a car but these people are exposed to the danger of violence and the danger of harm being visited upon them.<\/p><p>We would not be alone in introducing definitions of controlling and coercive behaviour.  In the United Kingdom, section 76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015 defines controlling behaviour as a range of acts designed to make persons subordinate and-or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their resources and capacities for personal gain, depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance and escape, and regulating their everyday behaviour.  Coercive behaviour is defined in a far more extensive way and includes threats to a child, threats to hurt a child, threats to publish private information, denying people access to transport, isolating them from friends and family, depriving them and monitoring their time and their bank accounts.  In British Columbia in Canada, the Family Law Act, chapter 25, part 1, defines family violence as, \"physical abuse of a family member, including forced confinement or deprivation of the necessities of life, but not including the use of reasonable force to protect oneself or others from harm\".  It also includes sexual abuse of a family member, attempts to physically or psychologically abuse a family member and the exposure of a child to the threat of physical violence.<\/p><p>My amendment shows the significance of the previous amendment because it refers directly to controlling or coercive behaviour and states what is required to establish that an offence has been committed.  In the absence of a definition, this is substantially more difficult so it is important to have one.  The definition goes with amendment No. 52 and proposes that a person commits an offence if he or she repeatedly or continuously engages in behaviour towards another person that is controlling or coercive.  It is assumed by the Minister that everybody knows what controlling or coercive behaviour is but it is no harm to have a definition.  It exempts a parent because a parent has a right and an obligation to control the behaviour of a child and if a child is behaving inappropriately it would be part of his or her learning process.  There follows a series of definitions relating to when people are members of the same family, etc.  I will support amendment No. 1, which gives the definition and leads into amendment No. 52.<\/p><p>I have no difficulty in supporting amendment No. 53, although I am not as strongly in favour of it as I am in favour of amendment No. 1 and my own amendment No. 52.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#P00700","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to engage in constructive debate on this Bill, which we all welcomed on Second Stage, and I am sure the Minister will be amenable to looking at many of the proposed amendments.

Senators Norris and Kelleher spoke very eloquently on both amendments and I support both.  Indeed, the Labour Party, along with others, put forward amendment No. 52.  The CEDAW committee recommended that we introduce a specific definition of domestic violence and the justice committee of the last Government, of which Senator Conway and I were members, recommended a specific offence of domestic violence.  Very moving testimonies were given at the committee hearings by survivors of domestic violence and they advocated a specific definition of domestic violence.  This would have a practical import but also an impact that is cultural and educational and will change attitudes.  It will challenge myths about domestic violence as well as the dismissive attitude towards domestic violence that one still encounters at different levels of society.  The tendency to dismissiveness has not been helped by the phrase itself, which has been widely criticised academically.  By calling it \"domestic violence\" it somehow trivialises or de-emphasises the reality of the harm involved.  For all of these reasons it is vital that we have a definition and the definition in amendment No. 1 is very helpful, though we would be open to debating how it could be improved upon.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 52 seeks to insert a specific offence of controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship and I am grateful to SAFE Ireland for the very considered submission it made on the need for such an amendment to the legislation.  Others have spoken about the recently introduced offence in English legislation, in the Serious Crime Act 2015 where the offence of coercive or controlling behaviour, recognised widely as a prevalent and very significant part of domestic violence, came into force 18 months ago.  A study by Jane Monckton-Smith of the University of Gloucestershire stated that control was seen in 92% of domestic killings.  This is the extreme end of domestic violence and it is often presaged by a culture of control within the relationship.<\/p> <p>There was some doubt about how effective the UK legislation would be and whether it would be possible to police and enforce a law against coercive and controlling behaviour but we can be heartened by the prosecution figures from Britain which show that, of 155 defendants prosecuted for coercive control in 2016, 59 were found guilty and 28 sent to prison.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There have been substantive prison sentences handed down in some of these cases, which have been widely reported on, the most well known, probably, being that of the murder of Natalie Hemming, which was the subject of a Channel 4 film.  While that was a homicide, it was a case that involved a high level of coercive and controlling behaviour, which, as we know from various studies, is very much a feature of many abusive, violent relationships.  It is important that we would seek to introduce by way of this legislation a similar offence in Ireland to deal similarly with this type of controlling or coercive behaviour that falls short of the type of physical assaults currently the subject of most prosecutions under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  It is also important that in introducing a definition of domestic violence we include within it a specific reference to controlling and coercive behaviour.  <\/p><p>For all of those reasons, the reasons put forward by the NGOs that have worked on the front line in terms of providing help and support for survivors for many years and on the basis of the arguments already put forward by colleagues and likely to be put forward by other colleagues, I ask the Minister to consider these amendments in the round and to come back to us on Report Stage with provisions that might take account of our concerns and address the need for definitions, particularly of domestic violence, as well as of coercive and controlling behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#Q00200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here again today and for her work on this Bill.

Amendment No. 1 in particular is important.  It is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the definition of domestic violence.  In the absence of training for judges and the judicial and legal systems as a whole, a better definition of domestic violence will give instruction and guidance to ensure better outcomes and justice for women and children experiencing the crime of domestic violence.  In all of this, we must be mindful of the crime that it is.

I acknowledge the enormous effort and work she has put into this legislation.  I am particularly delighted that she is here today to see this Stage of the Bill through the process.  As stated by Senator Conway-Walsh, domestic violence is a crime against families and children and their right to innocence.  It is a crime against women and, in some case, men.  The reality is that there are men suffering domestic violence.  I have many of them at my office where they came to share their grief, including that nobody believes them.  <\/p> <p>When people experiencing domestic violence seek help they do so as a last resort.  There is a lack of training or understanding of these matters in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is not altogether its fault.  The same applies in respect of the courts.  Two weeks ago, a woman and a child appeared before the District Court with no supports and a social worker saying they were telling lies.  Why is it that much of the time people do not believe, particularly children?   Why is it that 11, 12 and 13 year old boys and girls, who tell of their grief, concern and abuse, are not believed?  We must allow children to talk and we must facilitate that engagement.  We must listen but we also must believe.  I would like to leave here today confident that we have addressed the issue of the need to believe children and people who make complaints.  People do not make up stories of abuse.  People do not want their relationships to fail: they want their relationships and their family units to succeed.  Everyone wants that.  That is the place we need to come from in terms of our understanding of this issue.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the Minister's work on the Bill, which consolidates the law on domestic violence into one piece of legislation.  It will provide additional protections for victims of domestic violence and, importantly, it will, or should, meet the requirements of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, more commonly known as the Istanbul convention, which is a really important convention.  This is about creating safety for women, children and families.  I acknowledge the briefing document provided to the Oireachtas by Safe Ireland.  It is a very informative document.  The agency has taken the time and the trouble to assist us in our legislative work.  There is collaboration between the NGOs and other agencies on this issue.  People are sharing their personal experiences.  It is not easy to do that.  It is not easy to share that one's family relationship has broken down.  It is not easy for any man, woman or child to say, \"I am a victim of crimes in my own home\"; \"I do not feel safe in my own bed\" or \" I fear my lover or what was once my lover and companion\".  That is not easy to do.  We need to be there to support people.  This Bill attempts to do that.  I thank all of the people outside of this Chamber who have suffered and contributed to this Bill and have kept the pressure on over many years to see it enacted.<\/p> <p>I support all of these amendments.

I believe these amendments will strengthen the Bill and thus deliver the outcome all of those who have put work into it over the years have been seeking.<\/p> <p>The crucial amendment is the amendment proposing a definition of \"domestic violence\".  There are more than 36 references to domestic violence in the Bill but no definition of what constitutes domestic violence.  The Minister will understand the importance of a clear definition of what constitutes domestic violence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is not a common understanding of it in society, within families or across Europe.  The Minister signed Ireland up to the Istanbul convention and I know she is eager to move to the next stage of ratification.  There can be no doubt that the comprehensive definition of domestic violence in the Bill, which is also a Council of Europe definition, is what we need because it is comprehensive and includes physical, sexual, psychological and economic violence.  My colleague spoke about economic violence with regard to adult safeguarding.  These are all intertwined areas of control.  Many of us have heard examples of that from advocacy organisations.  Almost everyone here will know of examples in their own lives involving friends, families or neighbours who have been in abusive relationships, the subtleties of that abuse and its inter-linking aspects.<\/p><p>I note a typographical error has been pointed out.  We are very open to working with the Minister on the question of a definition, but it must be based on and enshrine the definition of domestic violence in the Istanbul convention, that is, the Council of Europe convention.  It also must include definitions of coercive behaviour and controlling behaviour.  That must be spelt out.<\/p><p>In terms of the psychological definition, we acknowledge that the list as we have phrased it is not comprehensive because psychological cruelty can take very innovative forms and we recognise it may need to be expanded.  These are to give an example to and plant a question mark in the minds of those supporting those who have experienced domestic violence about the types of activities engaged in, which might seem subtle but are important in terms of harassment within the family and the effect of the threat of violence.  I will touch on that when dealing with amendment No. 52.<\/p><p>On the question of definitions, as others have said, it is not necessary to send this signal legislatively.  It sends a clear message, educationally and culturally, to those who are enforcing the law but also to the victims of violence in that when they experience something which feels like intimidation and abuse, it is abuse and they are able to look to that.  It sends a signal to perpetrators and potential perpetrators and it also sends an important signal across Europe.  I represent this House at the Council of Europe and I see that there is a backlash and a push regarding domestic violence.  We need to be part of the advance guard that fully supports the Istanbul convention and its definitions.  We will be happy to work with the Minister on that.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 52, which the Minister will see has comprehensive support across the House, this amendment takes this a step further, which is to talk of coercive and controlling behaviour as an offence.  Its omission is regrettable.  Barnardos and almost all of the advocacy groups have spoken about the fact that domestic violence as a specific offence is not included in the legislation.  It is a real omission and this proposal in respect of coercive and controlling behaviour is an opportunity to address that.  <\/p><p>We know from the Garda Inspectorate reports that even though domestic violence is not recognised as a crime, it is a volume crime.  The Garda Inspectorate report describes it as one of the highest volume of incidents which occur and are recorded, even though we now know, as it has emerged in recent years, that they were under-recorded.  We know there is a huge volume of incidents of domestic violence and we need to acknowledge that.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecution has expressed its concerns about prosecution but we have seen in the United Kingdom that there have been successful prosecutions.  As mentioned by my colleague, there were 59 successful prosecutions, and 125 other cases were taken.  Unless we have a crime of controlling and coercive behaviour, we will neither address nor capture domestic violence.<\/p><p>If we look to something like assault, we are literally talking about a tiny part of the picture.  For example, as damaging as any assault is the linking of that assault to somebody's experience.  I refer to someone who walks around in fear for months because they know that when they engage in normal behaviour such as contacting a family member or talking to their co-workers they may be visited with violence.  That threat of violence and control, and the fact that someone might seek to destroy one's relationships with others in a wider circle, is the climate in which an incident of assault takes place and it is very hard to prove.  It is known by many domestic violence organisations that many of the forms of assault that take place such as choking, for example, can be extremely difficult to demonstrate and prove.  However, a litany of control is something that can be captured and shown.  I ask the Minister to consider that this crime is being monitored in the UK and to send a signal to society in respect of it.<\/p><p>Recently, in Russia, we have seen a roll-back whereby effectively, they have decided that violence within the home is acceptable except in the cases of hospitalisation and broken limbs.  There is a dynamic happening globally to the effect that abuse within the home can continue and is in a separate space.  Unless we are part of the positive dynamic such as we have seen in the UK that says that all forms of abuse within the home will be tackled, taken seriously and treated as a crime, we are lending succour to the negative trend taking place globally and contributing to a dynamic which is seeking to roll back and legitimise violence against women.  I urge the Minister to continue with her original intent and renew a commitment to a reference to a crime of domestic violence or specifically controlling and coercive behaviour in this Bill.  That would send a valuable signal to women, men and children across Ireland.  I look forward to the Minister's response.  I hope she will be able to work with us and that we can move forward on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#R00600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending the House and for her dedication to the Bill over the course of this Seanad term.

As many of my colleagues have pointed out, those groups have done a good deal of the hard work on the Bill for which I thank them.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill to help address the appalling problem of domestic violence and violence against women in all its manifestations.  Domestic violence is a deeply traumatising act that demands Government action.  <\/p> <p>Members who were watching TV on Friday night may have seen the interview with Norah Casey, who bravely outlined her tale of domestic violence.  It was thought-provoking and took everyone by surprise.  She presents herself as a strong, independent woman.  One would never think something like that could happen to her but she was able to outline her story, which was horrific.  It is a story to which many of us can relate.  We all have a friend who is in a similar situation with a very controlling partner, be it a man or a woman.  Getting out of that situation and recognising that the problem exists is very brave.  It was very brave of Ms Casey to share her story with us last Friday night.  I want to acknowledge that because it hit home.<\/p> <p>The Bill aims to improve the protections available for victims of domestic violence.  The court process is cumbersome and is the last place a victim of domestic violence wants to go to seek help.  Anyone who has been to Dolphin House will know it is very intimidating.

The operation of the courts, including the system for listing cases, is in terrible shape.  While the Bill does not address these issues, it makes it a little easier for victims by providing a right to be accompanied to court.  This will shelter victims a little from the deprivation visible in Dolphin House where people living in Dublin must seek safety and barring orders.  The provision allowing victims to give evidence by television link is also very welcome.<\/p><p>Victims of domestic violence who are cohabiting with, or are parents of, the perpetrator will be able to apply for an emergency barring order lasting for eight working days.  A person who applies for an emergency barring order will not be required to have a greater or equal interest in the relevant property.  Many of these provisions will be discussed in detail and the Fianna F&aacute;il group has tabled a large number of amendments with the support of SAFE Ireland.  I support the Bill and look forward to the Minister's response to many of the amendments, which have been considered by various groups and are worthy of acceptance.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#S00200","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>As previous speakers stated, this is a crucial Bill which should be implemented as quickly as possible to assist the most vulnerable.  We see victims of domestic violence in our clinics day in and day out.<\/p> <p>The statutory guidelines which judges will take into account when deciding to make an order are crucial, especially with the definition of violence placed in context.  The guidelines will help applicants and their representatives to present their case.  This means the most vulnerable applicants and their dependent children will be better served by the justice system when they face the risk of serious harm by the perpetrator.  It is important that people are able to have someone accompany them to court, particularly where they have young children.<\/p> <p>I have been contacted in my clinic by people who have paid &euro;130 for free legal aid.  Once they hand over what we describe as a \"slip\" to a solicitor, they must pay another &euro;130 if they seek a maintenance order within six months.  This should not happen in cases where people must go to court again because a partner does not make maintenance payments.  I ask the Minister to address this issue. <\/p> <p>Almost one in three Irish women - 31% - experience some form of physical violence, while 70% do not contact services, including the police, following violence.  We are at the top of the European table in this regard.  An awareness campaign is needed in this area.  The most vulnerable in society must be made aware of their entitlements and provided with help.  There is no women's refuge in Carlow, my local area.  This means people seeking refuge in the area are sent to Kilkenny or Waterford, which is unacceptable.  Every town should have a refuge for women with young children who are the most vulnerable in society.  The barriers facing women in fear of losing their children who do not have money or a place to go and do not want to break up their family cause low self-esteem, depression and feelings of anxiety and guilt.  Moreover, women in this position lose confidence.<\/p> <p>I recently encountered a woman who broke up with her partner as a result of violence.  They had been renting a home for years but because her name was not on the lease she could not obtain a barring order.  This issue needs to be addressed in legislation.

This is a practical example of the difficulties people experience.  We have a responsibility to close loopholes such as this in a way that protects vulnerable women.  In the majority of cases where couples rent a house, the names of both partners will be on the lease.  When the name of a woman with small children who is cohabiting but in a violent relationship and clearly lives in a property is not on the lease, it is reasonable to expect the State to provide protection.  I have not encountered similar cases.  Other speakers made similarly strong points.  I encourage the T&aacute;naiste to consider the contributions to this debate and identify how the legislation can be enhanced on foot of all of the concerns expressed by Senators.

The Senator's point is relevant and I will give consideration to it.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh referred to the conditions in the courts.  The position regarding Dolphin House clearly needs to be dealt with.  We have a new property at Hammond Lane.  The then Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW and current Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I did a great deal of work on the matter.  The building in Hammond Lane will be the new family law complex.  A planning group has commenced work on the project.  It will be a terrific facility, with rooms for witnesses and children and much better facilities.  This development is absolutely overdue.<\/p><p>I appreciate what Senators are trying to do with their amendments, which seek to provide a definition of \"domestic violence\" and create a specific offence of coercive control.  I want to make an important point on the framing of these amendments.  The amendment to section 2, as submitted, is confined to defining domestic violence.  That is very important because there is no linking of the definition with any subsequent provision in the Bill.  That needs to be looked at.  There is no point in having a definition if it is not linked and if there is no implementation that follows from it.  I am sure Senators will accept that.  If I was to accept the amendment, the effect it would have is not clear because it is not linked with other provisions in the Bill.  That is a technical point but one with many implications <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#T00400","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Is the Minister prepared to accept the principle of the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#U00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I will get on to that now.<\/p> <p>There is also an attempt to capture coercive and controlling behaviours, including those with a psychological element.  I have no ideological difficulty with defining domestic violence or creating an offence of coercive control.  I have no ideological resistance to that whatever.  The key question is will it be effective and is it going to be supportive of victims in the real world, namely, in the courts?  That is the question we have to ask and we need to be sure that the answer is \"Yes\".<\/p> <p>I will go through some of the detail with Senators because it is important that I am very comprehensive about this.  If the latter proves to be the case, we will achieve the best result.  Consideration was given to establishing an offence of domestic violence during the drafting process.  We also looked at coercive control.  Senators will appreciate from the amendment that what constitutes domestic violence encompasses a very wide currency and spectrum of behaviours.  We all recognise that.  The question is how does one match that with what happens in the courts in terms of prosecuting these cases.  As Senator Norris said, it is extremely difficult to come up with an exhaustive list and, for obvious reasons, we all recognise that.  It is a complex issue and the amendment, as proposed, demonstrates how problematic it is to define it in statute.  Behaviours in a domestic setting which involve emotional abuse, humiliation and fear, are clearly detrimental and an abuse of the trust associated with an intimate relationship but the key is that effective legislation needs to be enforceable.  That is the criterion against which we must measure this.  Is it enforceable in the courts?  Is it going to make it easier or be helpful in taking these cases?<\/p> <p>Many instances of domestic violence take place in private.  The difficulties in obtaining evidence of non-physical behaviours and the harm they cause in order to satisfy a criminal standard of proof that is beyond reasonable doubt and secure conviction are obvious.  All the agencies represented here today - Safe Ireland, Women's Aid, the National Women's Council and Barnardos - will be very familiar with the problems relating to this issue.  The difficulties in securing convictions in respect of relatively simple offences - and I use that term in context - such as assault, could potentially be compounded in the case of an offence of domestic violence.  That is something for which we must watch out.  When we considered this issue, we had very wide consultations across the criminal justice agencies, by which I mean people with a keen interest in this matter who would be prosecuting in the courts.  I will now outline the advice I received.<\/p> <p>There is not a gap in the range of offences that can be prosecuted in domestic violence cases, primarily under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  Acts of physical violence, such as assault, assault causing harm and sexual violence, are already offences, as is the threat of violence.  Non-violent abuse is also captured by the harassment and coercion provisions contained in the 1997 Act.  Likewise, causing damage to property, animals and so on is an existing offence.  Prosecuting an offence of domestic violence in addition to other existing criminal offences could make prosecutions more complicated and could create a further burden on victims.  That is the advice I have from the people taking these cases in the courts and who observe how they are prosecuted now and how they go through the courts.  That is their view.<\/p> <p>As matters stand, the courts can take into account the fact that such acts took place in a domestic setting when sentencing an offender.  Senators will recognise that there are lots of overlaps with existing criminal offences and duplicating offences in the amendment that is being put forward.  That is a fact.  To summarise, the reason it is not there is because the issue regarding the exhaustive list and the crime of violence and other crimes I mentioned are already captured in legislation and as a result of the concern that proving a crime as complex as that encompassed by the proposed definition would be very onerous.  The downside of putting a very complex offence on the Statute Book is that it will not be prosecuted, while assault and the other crimes I mentioned may be prosecuted in a domestic violence context.  If the former proved to be the case, a message would be sent out to the effect that the offence of domestic violence would not be prosecuted.  That is not what any of us wants because it would be misleading and would not reflect the seriousness of the situation.<\/p> <p>I wish to make a few more points on both the overall situation and the international position.  Amendment No. 53 would have the effect of moving operational independence in respect of investigations away from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and into the political arena.  It is a long-standing principle that the Minister for Justice and Equality has no role in respect of the conduct of Garda investigations.  I ask Senators to consider that because I do not think it would be good to move away from that principle now.  We make a point of the Minister for Justice and Equality being separate from operational decision-making regarding investigations and I would be concerned about changing the position in that regard.<\/p> <p>In March 2017 the Scottish Government published the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Bill, which defines abusive behaviour as including psychological abuse.  The legislation is still before the Scottish Parliament.  There has been an offence of coercive control in the UK since December 2015, as Senator Bacik mentioned.  UK media reports from August 2016 indicate that since the offence of coercive control was introduced, there have been more than 22,000 prosecutions for general domestic violence.  Recent research has found that since its introduction, 202 people have been charged with the offence of coercive control.  Senator Bacik did mention some information in respect of this matter.  However, there is little enough available regarding successful prosecutions.  The first person convicted of coercive control was jailed in September 2016 and that conviction was in addition to convictions for serious physical assault which led to the victim suffering permanent disability.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That can demonstrate some of the potential difficulties associated with successfully prosecuting such an offence on its own.<br\/><br\/>What I hope I have done is outline the reasons a particular approach was taken regarding the Bill - the complexities of the definition.  I have been struck by what the NGOs and Senators have said.  What I would like to suggest is that I take account of the points that have been made here today, that I consult again with the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel, and I examine, if possible, taking account of the points that I have made, if there would be benefit in trying to move forward on the points that have been made by Senators today.  I certainly want to make absolutely sure that anything we do, and I think Senators will agree, is in the interests of victims and ensures that we can strengthen the legislation and make it easier, if at all possible, to take prosecutions but, equally, not do anything to damage prosecutions that might be taken under other legislation.  I would propose asking Senators that I would have time to examine this matter and come back on Report Stage.  That would be my suggestion regarding this matter.  I have had a preliminary discussion with the Attorney General on it.  <br\/><br\/><b>Senator David Norris:<\/b>I may have been inadvertently discourteous because I am the only one not to welcome the Minister to the House but it is such a formula.  We always welcome all Ministers to the House.  I also would like to pay tribute to the various organisations that have so effectively briefed us, which my colleagues also did but I neglected to do so.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Minister for her temperate and considered approach to the matter.  I thank her for showing a desire to co-operate with this House to improve the legislation.  She asked whether the amendments will be effective.  She raised reasonable doubt about some aspects, for example, the question of proving a situation in court.  If it is just hearsay or if it is just the supposed victim of violence saying, &quot;He said this to me&quot; or &quot;He threatened violence&quot; then it is a judgment call.  There is no absolute mechanism of proof in that situation.  I am not sure if we want to leave that in but, again, it is a matter for the Minister to consider.<br\/><br\/>She also asked whether the amendments are acceptable to victims.  I think they pretty certainly are because these amendments were essentially suggested by the organisations that represent victims.  It is fairly unarguable that the victims would support these amendments.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the definition, I have made the point that it is difficult to be exhaustive.  On the other hand, the interpretation section lists definitions for the court, a dependent person, an emergency barring order, the full age, an interim barring order, the Minister, the prohibited degree of relationship, a protection order, a respondent, a safety order, a spouse and welfare.  It seems a little bit odd when one defines all of these things that appear fairly obvious to the ordinary person on the street that we baulk at defining what are the central elements of the legislation.<br\/><br\/>The Istanbul Convention has been mentioned.  I would like to put on record Article 33 of the Istanbul Convention which reads, &quot;Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that the intentional conduct of seriously impairing a person's psychological integrity through coercion or threats is criminalised.&quot;  The gloss that I got on this matter is that the proposed events of controlling or coercive behaviour drafted in similar terms in the corresponding UK legislation, in section 76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015, would capture the coercive and controlling aspect of the behaviour described in the Article.  According to my advice, the existing defence of harassment under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, as amended, does not capture the controlling or coercion aspect.  The Bill presents an opportunity to advance the ratification of the Istanbul Convention by inserting an offence that captures exactly the sort of behaviour identified in the Article.<br\/><br\/>I would like to refer to a case, and I already did so without naming Natalie Hammond and her partner, Mr. Hemming.  I would like to expand on the kind of things that he did.  I have already instanced in another case that the heating was switched on and taps were left running.  Mr. Hemming refused to put her name on the deeds of their house, which goes directly to the situation referred to by Senator Murnane O'Connor.  I am very glad that the Minister has agreed to consider this matter.  It does seem wrong that children in this situation simply by a technicality, and one in which there is clear evidence that the partner or whatever one wants to call him, and it is usually a him, refused to put a name on the deeds.  That fact let him out of the situation.  He also monitored her mail, scrutinised her bank statements and tampered with her phone.  That is pretty ghastly behaviour.  Unsurprisingly, the judge at the trial described Mr. Hemming as overbearing, controlling and jealous.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Bacik referred to a study of 358 domestic homicide reviews conducted by Dr. Jane Monckton-Smith that showed control was seen in 92% of domestic killings.  That proves how important the question of control and coercion is.  It is not just the battering.  The control is part of the environment that facilitates the battering and it is almost always present.  Control is something that must be addressed.  The study showed there was obsession in 94% of cases and isolation from family and friends in 78% of cases.  The following statement made by Dr. Monckton-Smith must be taken into consideration by this House.  She said that the British Government brought in legislation, &quot;because coercive control is really dangerous to women and children, not just because it&rsquo;s unpleasant.&quot;  It is not just something that is nasty and we say, &quot;Oh God, that is dreadful.&quot;  It is actually dangerous to women.  I am very glad that the Minister has agreed to consider these situations and to come back to us on Report Stage and shows the potential for a good day's work in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#U00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I recognise that the Minister is willing to work on amendment No. 1 that seeks to insert a definition for domestic violence in the Bill and that it is applied to the whole Bill.  We are happy to work with the Minister on this matter for Report Stage.<\/p> <p>I am concerned somewhat by the message given by the Minister about viewing coercive crime as a crime.  We have talked about the type of messages that we send out from here.  I am very concerned that a message has been sent that this matter is too complicated.  Many of us know people who are or have been in abusive relationships.  Therefore, we know how difficult it is to leave such relationships due to the network of control, psychological oppression and the doubt that is planted in the victim's brain.  One of the messages that one gets from victims is that when they try to extract themselves from an abusive, coercive or controlling relationship, it is complicated.  We reinforce the message that this matter is too complicated, that it is a matter just for the two people involved and that society has no interest because it is so complicated if we simply say it is too complicated for the courts.  How the hell is anybody meant to get out of a relationship when he or she knows that society considers what a victim is experiencing to be too complicated for our laws and procedures to take on?  I believe it is straightforward.  Good work has been done elsewhere.  There are practices and behaviours that are wrong and abusive.  Such practices and behaviours need to be identified and named.  The fact that the list may expand does not stop us from identifying the behaviours that exist now.  We must identify them as wrong and ensure that they can be reflected in our courts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As Senator Norris has very adequately said, if we are ratifying the Istanbul Convention we need to engage and deal with coercive behaviour.

Following a recommendation by the Ombudsman for Children concerning the removal of two Roma children from their families, a report of the audit of the emergency removal of children from their families was commissioned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to review its handling of section 12 cases.  While the report&rsquo;s focus and recommendations are based on an examination of Garda records and are primarily directed at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dr. Shannon also considers and makes recommendations regarding Tusla and the broader child protection system.<\/p> <p>Before I address the report itself, it is important to have a clear understanding of when section 12 is invoked.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the power, under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991, to remove a child urgently from a situation for his or her safety and welfare.  This includes a power to enter any premises without a warrant under certain conditions and the child, once removed, is to be delivered to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Tusla social workers have no powers to enter a home or to remove a child from a dangerous situation in an emergency.  The main issues for Tusla raised in Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report can be summarised under the following headings: interagency co-operation and communication; the repeated application of section 12; section 12 and out-of-hours services; and the lack of suitable emergency accommodation leading to young people being admitted to hospital or kept safe at Garda stations.  Work has been ongoing and is already under way on these issues.  <\/p> <p>With regard interagency cooperation and communication, Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s review looked at PULSE data from 2008 to 2015, all Garda cases where section 12 was applied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2014 and a sample of Garda cases where it was applied in 2015.  Since this time, Tusla has been fully established and has set up processes to enhance interagency working.  Both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla confirm that there is excellent communication and co-operation at senior management level, both formally through regular meetings of the strategic liaison committee and informally through regular communication.  It is recognised that there is always a need to ensure that this is realised on a consistent basis at a local level.  In order to address this, both organisations have recently developed a joint protocol on the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 which, I am assured, will be signed off by the two organisations very shortly.  <\/p> <p>This joint protocol was developed in line with the new Children First guidance and the Children First Act 2015.  It covers: the application of section 12; the process to be adopted during office hours and out-of-office hours as emergencies arise; Garda notifications to Tusla; the medical history of the child; and the follow-up action required.  The Garda national child protection unit, in co-operation with Tusla, will carry out a review at local level of the child protection operations between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>Further noteworthy actions to enhance interagency communication and co-operation have been in planning and will be completed shortly.  First, a dedicated Tusla official will be assigned to and co-located at the Garda national child protection unit in the coming days.  Divisional protective services units are being established in all 28 Garda divisions and effective liaison with Tusla will be a feature of these units.  Where local operational difficulties cannot be resolved through these units, the strategic liaison committee will act as a forum where any significant operational issues can be addressed.  Ongoing development of Tusla&rsquo;s national child care information system is progressing well which, when finalised, will greatly improve the information available both to Tusla and to its partners in child welfare and protection.  These actions should facilitate continuously enhancing and improving interagency working between the two agencies with statutory responsibility for child protection.  <\/p> <p>In addition to the high-level Garda and Tusla strategic liaison committee, Tusla has put in place dedicated intake teams which monitor and manage section 12 cases, including consideration of repeated use of section 12.  In response to Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report, Tusla has set up a team to review the contextual and situational factors and their actions around the 91 cases cited in Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report to clarify the number and reasons for repeat applications of section 12 in the cases examined in the report and to consider the common themes emerging.  In order to allow Tusla to identify the specific cases referenced in the report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has agreed to provide details of these cases by Friday of this week and I am assured that this work will be completed by the end of June. <\/p> <p>Regarding the out-of-hours social work service, a significant enhancement of the service took place in November 2015, the period after which is not covered by the report.  Tusla now provides a national service which facilitates 24-hour Garda contact with a social worker in cases where removal of a child under section 12 is being contemplated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The services provided by the emergency out-of-hours service include: a national call centre where social workers consult with and provide advice to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the arrangement of emergency foster and residential care placements for children under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 and access by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the national child protection notification system.  Through this service, social workers are available on the ground at night, over weekends and bank holidays to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the busiest areas of Dublin, Cork city, Kildare and Wicklow.  The call centre is contactable for advice and placement support from all locations in Ireland.  In light of Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report, I have asked Tusla to look at the current demand for a similar on-the-ground service for the rest of the country and Tusla will report back to me on this matter.<\/p><p>In line with best child care practice, most emergency accommodation is provided with family foster carers.  This meets the needs of the majority of children admitted in an emergency situation.  There are some situations where family care is not suitable, including where the young person is under the influence of alcohol and or drugs, or is exhibiting suicidal ideation, and may require medical assessment or treatment in hospital.  In 2016, there were 41 incidents where a request was made for a social-medical admission to hospital.  These occurred, following a discussion between the Tusla out-of-hours service and the Garda, where it was deemed that the child was unsuitable for a foster care placement.  There were no social admission cases in the Dublin-Kildare-Wicklow area, as a residential service is available.  In the midlands area, Tusla now has access to residential emergency placements and is about to commission additional emergency residential places in the south of the country.<\/p><p>In 2016, there were 12 incidents of children staying in a Garda station instead of an alternative placement.  I have been told that this was due to circumstances other than a lack of foster care placement.  It may be, for example, that the young person arrives there at 5 a.m. and it is thought better to keep him or her there rather than travel some distance to an alternative placement.  It may be that the young person is very aggressive or has been arrested.  I have been assured that social admission to hospital only takes place in exceptional cases, and only where such a placement is for the safety of the young person.<\/p><p>The national out-of-hours service is continuing to review demands for different placement types and is considering the need for the development of additional residential placements.  Senators will be aware that HIQA inspects and publishes reports on Tusla&rsquo;s child protection services.  This work includes how Tusla handles referrals from the Garda under section 12.  We are looking closely at HIQA&rsquo;s observations and findings in respect of Tusla&rsquo;s handling of emergency placements.<\/p><p>I look forward to meeting with Dr. Shannon in the coming days to discuss his report and the recommendations regarding Tusla.  I also intend to talk to the T&aacute;naiste about a joint monitoring of implementation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla of the actions recommended for both organisations in Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report.  While I note that Dr. Shannon has expressed full confidence in Tusla&rsquo;s child protection framework, I am absolutely committed to ensuring that all reasonable action is taken quickly to provide for the safety and welfare of children in Ireland.  As a result of the various meetings I will be indicating clearly what those actions will be, in addition to the ones I have already indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#W00900","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for addressing us today.  This recently-published audit reveals a shocking lack of consistency and resourcing in how we treat our most vulnerable children.  It demonstrates very poor level of co-operation between the agencies of the State.  It reveals several cases where children were placed back into extremely abusive and dangerous situations because of poor co-operation between State agencies.  The audit covers the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act, which refers to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides for a Garda member to remove a child from the care of his or her family or persons acting, in a case where the Garda member believes there is an immediate or serious risk to the child.  I feel that this is very serious.  I acknowledge the Minister has spoken of addressing different issues, but after the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme, everybody was heartbroken.  It is very emotional to even talk about it today in the Seanad.  The audit found that garda&iacute; are often forced to repeatedly use the provision in section 12 with very little or no existing support from Tusla or other State agencies.<\/p> <p>In 2012 Ireland voted to place the rights of the child on a constitutional footing but this audit demonstrates how little the Government is doing to actually deliver these rights.  Clearly, all State agencies should work together to ensure that vulnerable children are protected.  The Minister announced recently that a Tusla official should be co-located in the national Garda unit within the next week or so.  I seek clarification on that.  A measure such as this is akin to putting a sticking plaster on the situation and surely there are other measures we can take.  Our children are our future and it is not enough to just open the lines of communication between the Garda and Tusla, we must learn from the harrowing lessons of the past.<\/p> <p>In the report on \"Claire Byrne Live\", we saw that children were removed from their families by garda&iacute; on numerous occasions.  They were returned back to the families within 48 hours, yet no risk assessments were done.  This is unacceptable.  How can a child go back in to the same family within 48 hours with no risk assessment?  Tusla was established in 2014.  It was obvious that a huge amount of work needed to be done to improve our child protection systems.  According to the report on \"Claire Byrne Live\", garda&iacute; have removed two children per day in such situations, which is 680 children per year, under the section 12 provision.  It is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>After the report on the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme, I wish to highlight the need for more investigations into the current child protection systems in Ireland to look at where the failings are today and what are the barriers to effective protection for these children.  I know the Minister's announcement is only the start but Senators need to be part of the solution.  We need to find it, we need to be brave and we need to ask the hard questions.  The most vulnerable people are our children and we must make sure that we give them the proper upbringing and service and help with their need for a family for which they cry out but are not getting at present.  The Minister will address all these issues for me and I thank her again for coming in to the House today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#X00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the Minister to the House.  I acknowledge her three-page report but I have heard all of this.  I do not mean to be rude when I say that as politicians of both Houses, we are tired of having history lessons about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and history lessons about child protection.  The previous Minister who came into the Seanad was speaking about the protection of women and domestic violence in families, issues which dovetail in many ways with the issues we are discussing now.  There are many similarities between the two.  What is striking about all the issues is that the NGOs and the other organisations outside feed in so much to us through those who share their personal experiences.  This is no easy thing to do especially if it is around domestic violence, family breakdown, abuse within the family by members of the family or the possible question of children being taken in to care.<\/p> <p>Over the last few weeks I have been touched by these people as they bring their situations home to us.  They have experienced these issues on a day-to-day basis.  When one is involved in legislation, the problem can be that one can become quite cold.  I have seen some letters - the detail of which I shall not go into here - relating to cases that have been made of complaints, be it by Departments or State agencies.  The letters are cold or they have no regard to the particular circumstances of the people and in many cases they are not even child-centred.  It is an appalling way to treat people who have particular difficulties.<\/p> <p>I want to stay focused on the audit by Dr. Shannon.  It really highlights grave failings in Ireland's child protection system.  We can talk all day and reports can keep gathering dust on shelves but nothing seems to happen.  Let us be clear, however, on what Dr. Shannon's report tells us.  The report tells us there is a lack of adequate out-of-hours social work services.  Let us deal in the facts.  There is a \"lack of access to case files\" to enable effective assessment and decision making in respect of child safety.  That is what the report says and I am quoting directly from it.  There is a lack of \"reliable data\" on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's PULSE system.  We know all about the lack of data in other areas but this is the lack of accurate data on the PULSE system in respect of section 12 removals.  The audit also states there is a lack of training, resources and support for garda&iacute; when they exercise their powers to remove a child at risk, pursuant to section 12.  The audit found a lack of clarity around the responsibilities of Tusla.  I have had Tusla up to here at this point.  Everybody says that Tusla is fit for purpose but I say it is not fit for purpose.  Why do I say this?  It is because I am meeting people every week who have horrendous experiences of this organisation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister herself has commissioned a number of inquiries into Tusla, on which she has elaborated here.  There were serious concerns about this organisation and I do not believe it has the capacity needed.  I accept that Dr. Shannon, in fairness, seems to have a different view and I acknowledge that he is the expert.  Maybe all the experts, doctors, professors and professionals are slightly removed from it all.  People on the ground tell a different story.  There is some disconnect there and it is important to ask why this is the case.<br\/><br\/>The use of Garda stations as safe places for children to be held is of real concern.  I do not care if it is for an hour or ten minutes; it is against best international practice, as the Minister knows.  The Shannon report clearly says so.  The report also expresses concerns about the use of some private fostering services.  While I do not want to go into that in any detail, the Minister will be aware of the media coverage of inappropriate behaviour over the past two weeks.  Children have been left exposed in foster care situations.  That is the reality.  There are not too many cases, but they are there and they are alarming.  Some of them are mentioned by Carol Coulter in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  These are serious matters.<br\/><br\/>At the end of the day, what can we do to find solutions?  There are 17 recommendations in the Shannon report, which I believe should be implemented.  I call on the Minister, the Government, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla to commit to implementing in full all of the recommendations without any excuse.  I am calling on the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs - their roles dovetail in respect of this issue - to present an action plan to Seanad &Eacute;ireann within three weeks.  That is not unreasonable.  I ask respectfully for this to be done.  If it does not happen, it is my intention to table a motion in the Seanad.  I will lobby hard to bring one or both of those Ministers back to the House to set out an action plan and a timeframe for implementing the 17 recommendations.  I would like the Minister's response on that.  I am looking for a full plan and a detailed implementation strategy addressing all of the recommendations in the report to be brought before the Seanad within three months.  Otherwise we are wasting our time.  Hopefully we will all still be here or somewhere nearby.<br\/><br\/>Ultimately, recommendations are meaningless unless we are going to action them.  Every time we have a report it is because we have been dragged into a situation.  The Minister has to come in and we have to have a report because that eases everything and calms us down.  That criticism is not directed at the Minister, Deputy Zappone.  I have an awful lot of time for her and acknowledge the enormous amount of work she has done.  However, honeymoons are now over and the Government is well established, having been in power for over a year.  It does not have a lot of time and time is precious.  Most important, the children and families have no more time to wait for action.  I want to hear the Minister tell us how she intends to deal with the 17 recommendations.  Does she think it is reasonable to have a plan for us in three weeks?  If not I intend to come back to the matter in three weeks.  Certainly I would like to think we could have a very detailed map of the way forward within three months, in terms of addressing the issues that Dr. Shannon has identified in his report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#X00300","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House so quickly when Senators asked to discuss this issue.  There is no disputing that Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's recent report has given rise to grave and understandable concerns.  I join with other speakers in their comments.  There are a number of criticisms of Tusla in the audit.  We have all heard about it in the media in the last few days.  In particular, some of these criticisms concern the out-of-hours social work service and effective communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>As the overall issues raised in the report were summarised by the Minister, I do not propose to repeat them.  In respect of the out-of-hours social work service, a significant enhancement of the service took place, I understand, in November 2015.  A national service now exists which facilitates 24-hour Garda contact with a social worker in cases where removal of a child under section 12 is being contemplated, and which provides emergency foster and residential care for a child who is removed from his or her family under this provision.  As part of this service, social workers are available on the ground at night, over weekends and bank holidays to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the busiest areas of Dublin, Cork city, Kildare and Wicklow.  I would like to hear more from the Minister on her view of what is actually happening as regards the out-of-hours service.  This begs the question about service provision in the remaining 22 counties as well.  Statistics show that the period in which most of these calls are made is between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m.  I have been assured that the volume of calls in these counties indicates that contact with Tusla social workers by telephone is sufficient.  Nevertheless I am encouraged that the Minister has confirmed that this matter is specifically under review.<\/p> <p>There is also a need to ensure that this is realised at local level.  In order to address the matter, I understand that both organisations have recently developed a joint protocol on the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991, on which they are due to sign off shortly.  The joint protocol covers the application of section 12 and the process to be adopted during and outside office hours as emergencies arise, in addition to notifications to Tusla.  It must be noted also that at the launch of the report on Monday, 29 May, Dr. Shannon expressed his full confidence in Tusla's child protection framework which, I suppose, is some comfort in the context of what is quite a stark and grave report overall.<\/p> <p>Some additional concerns have been expressed about the placement of children in Garda stations and hospitals.  It is my understanding that social admissions to hospitals take place only in exceptional circumstances and only where such a placement is for the child's own safety.  Tusla apparently does not request for the Garda to keep a child over part of the night.  That is a Garda decision.  While the report is very complimentary about the Garda and how empathetic and understanding and kind garda&iacute; have been to children, I do not think it should fall to them to be involved in the first place.<\/p> <p>I would like to summarise the actions taken to address the findings of the report so far.  Although I obviously have serious concerns, from what I gather, as outlined earlier, work is already well under way in respect of many issues identified in Dr. Shannon's audit.  Tusla will continue to work on rolling out its national child care information system which will significantly improve the information available in respect of vulnerable children.  The Garda national child protection unit will carry out an audit at local level of the child protection operations between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Divisional protective services units are being established in all 28 Garda divisions.  A joint protocol is being finalised between Tusla and the Garda on the operation of section 12.  What remains outstanding, however, is a full audit of child protection services throughout the State.  I commend Senator Boyhan's suggestion of an action plan.  I am sure it is something that is in the Minister's mind in any case.  There is good reason to have an organised review with a time frame set out, given that there is a report with identifiable issues.  I support the Senator's positive and constructive suggestion in that respect.  While I am encouraged that the Minister has committed to taking a review in a year's time, we need to keep an eye on this.  I do not mean to be patronising in any way.  It is something that she will be actively watching over the coming weeks and months.  Looking at child protection in its entirety, however, and taking into account recent cases such as the Grace and Mary cases, I believe a thorough overhaul of the current system needs to take place.  As such I am very much encouraged that the Minister will be meeting Dr. Shannon within the coming weeks to discuss further the matters raised.  He will be an excellent person to have on board to review services throughout the country.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise an issue that I have been working on in recent times.  It is in respect of a statutory provision to seize mobile phones suspected of containing child sexual exploitation images.  Currently, garda&iacute; who have reasonable suspicion about an individual do not have the power to seize his or her mobile phone.  The law as it stands does not reflect the gravity of the fact that mobile phones are just as powerful as desktop computers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hardly ever go near a desktop computer now.  I use one of the slightly bigger iPhones.  Maybe I am damaging my eyesight over time.  We are not up to speed with the fact that most modern mobile phones have the memory capability to store thousands of images.  I have thousands of images on my phone.  Much of the child pornography is being kept on phones now.  This is in addition to the capacity to store texts and visual evidence of grooming, solicitation and sexual exploitation.  According to the special rapporteur on children, the author of the most recent audit, mobile phones with sexual exploitation images or evidence of grooming should be treated as a crime scene and I do not believe our law is up to speed with that.  In fairness, what one can do online is evolving so quickly that it is difficult for legislators to keep up with it.  However, we will need to step up the pace in this area.<\/p><p>I also echo Dr. Shannon's call for new powers to request information from technology companies, such as Facebook and Google, with offices in Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be afforded powers to obtain a production order in respect of data that are either held or accessible by content providers based in Ireland.  New legislation dealing with the capabilities of the latest technology must be introduced as a matter of urgency.  The protection of vulnerable children should always be our top priority and we should drop other things to ensure those matters are addressed.  As it may be a matter that applies to the Minister's Department and to the Department of Justice and Equality, I may also need to speak to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, about it.<\/p><p>I again thank the Minister for coming to the House so expeditiously to discuss this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#Y00200","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I again welcome the Minister.  It is a case of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>.  Here we go again.  So many things seem to be rotten in our State and we uncover layer after layer.  What do we do with it?  Section 12 was exercised about 680 times a year.  The report was commissioned by the Garda following the removal of two children - quite a racist incident at the time.  Internationally the media was over it because of the Maria case in Greece, and the Garda seemed to jump on that far too quickly.<\/p><p>We are dealing with the section 12 report by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.  He found chronic systematic failures in child protection structures along with superficial and inadequate co-operation between the Garda and Tusla.  That speaks for itself and is very disheartening.  It is depressing for Senator Boyhan and me to talk almost every week about failures such as the horrors Dr. Shannon has uncovered and the horrors that have been uncovered previously, including the cases of Grace and Mary.<\/p><p>Do we ever get it right?  I think we do, but this sort of stuff would make one wonder how right we get it and what is swept under the carpet and ignored as well as how wrong we get it.  Among the most shocking findings is the repeated removal of children under the provisions of section 12 and the repeated placing of them back where they came to harm physically, sexually and emotionally.<\/p><p>Overall Dr. Shannon was very positive about the attitude and commitment of garda&iacute; and the detailing of the cases where they walked into unbelievable circumstances where small children and young people were subjected to so much daily horror, never allowed to be nurtured, never loved and never hugged.  It is extremely upsetting for the entire community.  We have that social sense of belonging and a sense that our children are precious and should enjoy their childhood.  Some of them from the moment they are born or even prior to being born have never experienced happiness or laughter.  That is an awful indictment of what the State allows to go on.<\/p><p>I find this very emotional.  Looking after our children was the most glorious, happiest, greatest work I have done as a mother in my life.  I hope I did it reasonably well.  I feel great sadness about how we get it wrong repeatedly for this cohort of damaged children.  They continue to be damaged.<\/p><p>There are 19 records under PULSE where section 12 was exercised where no details could be found for the child.  What happened to the child?  The child disappeared.  Child protection training is totally inadequate for garda&iacute;.  There is little evidence of training for garda&iacute; and they seem to do on-the-job training rather than formal training, which must change.<\/p><p>Dr. Shannon pointed to the lack of co-operation and communication between agencies and the lack of out-of-hours social work services.  I know we have talked about the hubs of Dublin and other urban areas where there is a nod to out-of-hours services.  This morning, representatives of the Irish Foster Care Association and EPIC, which represents the voice for children from residential or foster home placements, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  They have repeatedly said that, even where an out-of-hours service is supposed to exist, it is inadequate.  Outside of the hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., foster carers have no access to social workers, which is an indictment because problems occur.  Just as with our mental health services, problems happen after 5 o'clock and at the weekend.  They are crying out because they do not know where to go.  In the end, friends help them and, at times, garda&iacute;.<\/p><p>The use of private fostering services as a de facto official out-of-hours child protection service is a concern.  The reliance on private agencies is considerable.  Tusla commenced an out-of-hours emergency social work services which co-operated with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2015, but there is no comprehensive social work service that is directly accessible to children or families at risk outside of hours.  Several difficulties arise as a result.  In several cases a child has been refused placement or one could not be arranged.  In those cases the child ended up siting in the most unsuitable place imaginable, incarcerated as they would see it in a Garda station.  On the issue of child care settings, one child had to be placed 112 km away, giving the garda&iacute; round trips of almost 250 km.<\/p><p>What can we do?  We must digest the failures again and again and then come up with resolutions.  That is our job.  However, we have failed.  Tusla is the head of a broken and dysfunctional child protection system.  Children are being put at risk and left in situations of risk every day.  Yet again the most vulnerable are being failed.  Tusla's honeymoon is over.  We need Tusla to react and be proactive in protecting our children and doing the job it should be doing.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs has invited representatives of Tusla to appear before it.  I believe the Minister will also be invited at that stage.<\/p><p>We need to establish a commission, independently chaired by an appropriate expert.  If we can do it with the commission investigating the future of the Garda and with commissions on taxation, why can we not do it for our children?  We need a wide-ranging brief that covers every aspect of child protection structures, including those relating to accountability, leadership, management capacity, policies and, most important, the culture of Tusla's child protection structures.  It should make recommendations within 12 months of its establishment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will work alongside Senator Boyhan and others within the three-month timeframe to bring this back to the Seanad.<\/p><p>I want to conclude by extending my grateful thanks to Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.

I am aware that this is as devastating for her as it is for the rest of us.  I know she is a very compassionate person who cares a lot about children.  I have no doubt she is doing her best to change the situation, particularly in regard to this report.<\/p> <p>It is devastating.  Like my colleague, I am deeply saddened by what I have heard.  In fact, it is hard to read in the report what has gone on.  I noted on the Order of Business yesterday that, when reading the report, I was struck by the clear focus on alcohol abuse and how big an impact this is having on child welfare.  The report states that in a significant number of the 90 cases reviewed as part of the audit, it was evident that drug and-or alcohol abuse by parents was compromising their ability to care for their child.  In one instance, a one year old child was found wandering alone in a housing estate because the mother was under the influence of alcohol.  This is an awful situation and it will not stop unless we really start to address the root causes.<\/p> <p>Again, I want to quote Dr. Shannon on the role alcohol plays.  He said the biggest challenge facing society is the adverse consequences for the welfare of many children posed by alcohol.  Drug and alcohol abuse are a key feature of the report and have a very damaging effect on children.  The failure by society to address alcohol is a fundamental problem and places insurmountable problems on the child protection system.  It is not just about Tusla or the Garda; it is about society and our ambivalence to alcohol and substance misuse.<\/p> <p>I totally agree with Dr. Shannon.  Sadly, it is no real surprise to me, given my own background in working with people suffering from alcohol abuse, that several such cases have been cited.  I believe we are a nation in denial around this issue.  I am very concerned.  As the Minister knows, I set up an organisation for families because I know the devastation involved and see it every single day.<\/p> <p>Some years ago, a young woman came to me and told me the story of what had happened to her eight year old niece, who came to her and said, \"Please take me out of the home I am in because I cannot live any more.\"  She started to tell her aunt about the alcohol misuse and fighting that was going on.  This young woman went everywhere.  She went to local organisations, to the local community, to local garda&iacute; and even to a lawyer.  She wanted to take this child under her own wing and take her out of the home where there was severe alcohol misuse.  Even though it was her own family member who was misusing the alcohol, she wanted to protect the child.  At one point she just took the child and kept her, but the Garda came and took the child back to the home.  It was devastating.  Whether it was because of the legislation, I do not know, but the reality is the child was brought back.  That was a good few years ago.  I am concerned about where that child is now, given she is probably 13 or 14.  Is that child going to end up in alcohol misuse?<\/p> <p>I am just giving the Minister examples of an issue I deal with every day.  I worked with another family where there was a three year old daughter.  When the mother put her head in her hands, the child knew automatically to go to the press to get wine for mammy because the child thought that was what fixed mammy's headaches.  When the child went into a local shop, she would go straight over to the alcohol part of the shop and get a bottle of wine for mammy.<\/p> <p>That is the reality.  That is what we are dealing with.  I know I keep harping on about the alcohol issue but I am dealing with it every day.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill needs to be addressed.  There is no doubt this is about changing our culture, so it is a long-term strategy.  The Minister knows I work with the RISE Foundation.  I believe we can educate families about the impact of alcohol misuse.  Alcohol is in our souls; that is the reality.  It is devastating families.  If there is one family member who is misusing alcohol and there is a young family, the partner is so preoccupied trying to look after that person or trying to stop the arguments, he or she cannot be present for their children.  If we can get to one family member, it will break the cycle.  It does not have to be the one who has the alcohol misuse problem.  If we can educate the other parent or partner, I believe we can stop the legacy of alcohol misuse.  We need to educate the family members, and that is what RISE does.<\/p> <p>I am only talking about this because I am very passionate about it.  I see it daily.  I see families and children's lives being devastated.  Here we have a report that is at last highlighting it.  I feel that at last someone is speaking on behalf of these families.  I want also to be a voice for those families.  We need to change our culture.  We need to highlight and address this issue.  I sincerely thank Dr. Shannon for what he has done.  I am deeply grateful, as are all the families I represent here who have someone they love with an alcohol, drug or gambling problem.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.  I wish the Minister well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#AA00200","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and thank her for coming to the House.  I welcome the opportunity to debate this important report and I thank the Leader for giving us the opportunity to do so at such short notice.  Like others, I acknowledge the tremendous work of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon in carrying out this audit.  I acknowledge also that what prompted it was, of course, the report of the then Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, in 2014.  She had been asked to inquire into the exercise by the Garda of the section 12 power in respect of a number of children in Roma families, a case which, as we are all aware, gave rise to a huge outcry.<\/p> <p>The ombudsman's report in 2014 called for an independent audit of the exercise by the Garda of the section 12 power.  One of the points Dr. Shannon makes in his report is that no study into the use of section 12, the frequency with which it is employed and the nature of the cases in which it arises had ever been carried out in this jurisdiction, and section 12 had been in place for a long time, given it is a section of the Child Care Act 1991.  The audit itself is hugely important in adding to our level of information and knowledge about how section 12 is exercised.  The ombudsman also recommended further research, which Dr. Shannon said is beyond the scope of his report.  Will the Minister explain whether it is envisaged that the further research sought by Emily Logan will be carried out, in particular where she asked for a comparison of the number of successful applications for emergency care orders flowing from section 12 removals and a comprehensive examination of the length of time children were deprived of their family environment where section 12 had been exercised?  That further research would also be extremely useful in giving us a more comprehensive picture of the exercise of powers by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>We are all well aware of the section 12 power.  A high threshold is required by garda&iacute; before they may exercise their power of removing a child to safety, and that is where they consider there to be an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a child in a situation where it would not be sufficient to await the application for the making of an emergency care order.  It is a high threshold.  Dr. Shannon acknowledges the work of garda&iacute; and notes they are first responders.  As others have commented, he is in general very positive about the exercise by front-line garda&iacute; of their section 12 powers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He says that removal in all of the instances he reviewed was well within the subjective risk threshold under section 12 and that there was no evidence of an over-zealous use of section 12 powers by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That must be acknowledged.  I should declare my own interest in this, having worked for some years in child protection cases in Dolphin House, a setting which was rightly criticised by Senator Ardagh in our earlier debate on domestic violence.  The Minister for Justice and Equality in response pointed out that there is a move planned to a building in Hammond Lane.  I understand a building has been purchased and work is beginning on a new child protection court complex.  Dolphin House is entirely inadequate.  Anyone who has ever had the occasion to go in there, including lawyers, social workers, garda&iacute; and the individuals before the courts, will be aware it is a difficult working environment for people dealing with such highly traumatic cases in terms of taking instructions in crowded corridors and inadequate consultation rooms.  That also must be acknowledged.  There are resources that need to be spent on that very physical infrastructure too.  All of those acknowledgements must be made.  <br\/><br\/>Another key issue, based on my own experience and on what social workers have told me in the years I was involved in this area, is the lack of intervention in situations where social workers and garda&iacute; were aware of abuse.  Senator Black illustrated this very eloquently.  There have been situations where the Garda felt the threshold was not sufficient for a section 12 or section 13 order, or there were not enough resources to enable social workers to investigate fully.  These issues and concerns around the legal entitlement to intervene, given the very strong protections for the family under Article 41, have provided a context where we have seen children being abused in private and family settings and the State failing in its duty to protect children by failing to intervene.  That is an important point.  Of course, it is vital that we look at how section 12 powers are exercised and that we ensure there is no abuse by garda&iacute; in their powers to intervene but we must also be conscious that the State has been criticised in the past, and rightly so, for failures to intervene and failures to remove children to safety.  It is important to say that.<br\/><br\/>I will speak briefly to four points that jumped out to me from Dr. Shannon's report.  The first point is the difficulties with data and flaws in the PULSE system, which was also mentioned by other speakers.  Dr. Shannon noted he could not be sure that he had access to full data from PULSE.  He also conducted qualitative interviews and focus groups in an effort to address those problems.  Dr. Shannon has made recommendations on the need for greater consistency in reporting of allegations of sex abuse and, in particular, consistency in reporting section 12 removals, in respect of which he points out the numbers annually are not great and that it should be possible to enable clear and coherent reporting through the PULSE system of the exercise of section 12 powers.  That is very important.  Dr. Shannon also calls in his final recommendation No. 17 for a report by the Garda in a year's time on the recommendations of the audit and whether they have been implemented.  As part of that, in recommendation No. 17, he also says that the Garda should publish statistics on an annual basis on the invocation of section 12 in the preceding year and report on any challenges or difficulties experienced in the exercise of this power.  This, again, would greatly add to our knowledge.  It is an important recommendation to address.<br\/><br\/>The second point, also picked up on by many other speakers, is the issue of training, which the Minister also spoke about in her opening statement.  Dr. Shannon has very concerning findings about the lack of formal training of new Garda recruits in child protection, the emphasis being on-the-job training.  This is an issue that was also highlighted in other reports.  The Garda Inspectorate made similar criticisms of the PULSE system and of lack of formal training within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We know then that not only in regard to child protection and section 12 but more generally we need to ensure greater emphasis on training, in particular training on ethno-diversity and how to deal with children from different and diverse backgrounds.  Concern was expressed by Dr. Shannon that there is no training or strategic policy direction from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.  I note the Minister addressed that issue in her opening statement but perhaps she would comment specifically on training on ethno-diversity.  There is a very worrying report in today's <i>The Irish Times<\/i>which focuses on poor garda training.  It concerns a failure in the State system of child protection in the case of a child who was interviewed extensively by the Garda about allegations she had made of child sex abuse within her home, those interviews having been carried out in a way that the District Court has described as abusive and relentless.  The garda involved in the interviewing process is severely criticised, as is the lack of interagency co-ordination and the very troubling outcome, whereby seven men who had been identified by the child will not be prosecuted because of the flaws in the interviewing process of the child.  This is very clear evidence of the difficulties around training.<br\/><br\/>The third point is on interagency co-operation, which the Minister also addressed.  She made the point that this has improved since 2015.  Dr. Shannon's audit is in respect of the period up to 2015.  I am glad to hear that interagency co-operation has improved but there is still much comment in regard to difficulties with Tusla, in particular, and around the lack of co-ordination between agencies.  This is a key issue that needs to be addressed.  There are some very damning findings by Dr. Shannon in this regard, including that there continually are poor and limited levels of interagency co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and the broader child protection framework.  That is a very stark finding.<br\/><br\/>The fourth point is out-of-hours services and the lack of availability of a 24-hour social work service for children at risk.  The report references the farming out of children to private agencies, one of which is named.  Dr. Shannon states that he is very concerned about the lack of co-ordination, supervision and monitoring of the contracting out of powers and responsibilities to external and private bodies.  The Minister has referenced the need to address these issues.  Senator Boyhan made the sensible suggestion that we might assist and support her in assessing how these recommendations are being implemented.  Dr. Shannon has called for a report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in one year but as suggested by Senator Boyhan, it would be helpful if were to revisit this issue in this House with the Minister, with her permission, in a shorter timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#AA00300","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their reflections, all of which I will not have time to respond to today.

Dr. Shannon has made recommendations and damning findings in regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and society as a whole.  I take on board Senator Black's comments in terms of the great work being done by the RISE organisation on the alcohol issue, which is critical in all of this.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine said that we have failed.  I agree, we have failed.  Parents, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and the Department have failed in respect of our most vulnerable children.  As for what we need to do, we need to support preventative work in my Department such as that undertaken by the Department itself and by the RISE Foundation.  <\/p> <p>Many Senators raised the issue of out-of-hours services.  I have indicated and Senators have acknowledged that there has been some change since 2015 and this audit.  In regard to whether there should be more change, full services are available in the four towns mentioned and 22 counties are covered by emergency out-of-hours services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In a small number of cases, the service was required outside of these busy areas.  In 2016, there were ten cases of social workers being called to rural areas.  I am sure that Dr. Shannon is aware of this as well.  He is calling for more.  I have asked Tusla to review the situation again.  I will put that analysis together with Dr. Shannon's perspective on the matter.  We will consider international best practice so that vulnerable children do not fall through the cracks.<\/p><p>I have called for more reflection.  If additional change is required, I intend to ensure that that happens.  It is important to point out that, with all of the expertise that Dr. Shannon brings to the audit, he has indicated his confidence in Tusla in terms of the national child protection framework.  Tusla launched its national child protection and welfare strategy last week.  The action plan is in development, so there is a great deal of room to incorporate some of our learnings from the issues being raised by the Senators.  That is critical.<\/p><p>Regarding repeat removals and placing young people back with their families, it appears from some of the stories that we have been reading about and watching on RTE that there are instances in which doing that is not good for the children.

In light of my various requests to Tusla and the meetings that I will have with the T&aacute;naiste, Dr. Shannon and others, as well as the meetings that I have already had with Tusla, we will put together an action plan relatively quickly on how to proceed.

These statements on tourism are coming about as a direct result of a number of Commencement debates.  I told Senators from both sides of the House that, if they wanted a genuine and robust discussion on the development of tourism, I would be delighted to return.  As such, I welcome the opportunity.<\/p> <p>We must consider the current context.  The performance of the tourism industry has been exceptionally strong in recent years.  Last year, a record number of overseas visitors - more than over 9.5 million - came to Ireland.  That was almost 11% more than in 2015, which was itself a record year.  It is worth mentioning that the 2016 numbers were an amazing 59% higher than the corresponding figure for 2010.  Good growth was recorded from all our source markets, with Ireland's market share growing ahead of that of its competitors.  Overseas visitors contributed more than &euro;4.5 billion to the Exchequer and the economy, representing a 9% increase on the previous year.  This helped to sustain more than 220,000 jobs in communities across the country.  It is fair to say that that figure is closer to 230,000 jobs now.<\/p> <p>In 2017 to date, the performance has remained robust.  It is a concern, but not a surprise, that the number of visitors from Great Britain has fallen in the early part of the year.  I will speak about Brexit shortly.  By the same token, it is encouraging that numbers are up from virtually every other market, with North America increasing by a considerable 25% for the most recent quarterly period.  It is worth pointing out that, while the greatest number of overseas visitors to Ireland come from Great Britain, individual spend from the North American market delivers a higher return in respect of revenue.<\/p> <p>Clearly, 2017 has started well.  The challenge for us now is to maintain that growth.  There is no room for complacency, particularly given the highly competitive nature of the global travel industry and the uncertainty that exists in some markets.  Our capacity to sustain growth will depend on, among other factors, Ireland maintaining its competitiveness, effective marketing and the continued development of iconic holiday experiences.<\/p> <p>The Government's ongoing commitment to tourism was reflected in budget 2017.  Despite demands on the public purse, the 9% VAT rate on tourism services was retained and funding of &euro;122 million was secured.  This will enable Tourism Ireland to continue its effective marketing overseas and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to continue its work in developing our industry on the ground.  Although most Senators will know, it is worth pointing out for the record the differences between the two.  Tourism Ireland is an all-island body established under the Good Friday Agreement whereas F&aacute;ilte Ireland is the national tourism development authority for this jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>Following what was a record year for overseas visitors to Ireland in 2016, recent figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that overseas visitor numbers from February to April 2017 were slightly up on 2016.  While there was strong growth from the North American market, which increased by 25.7%, the number of visitors from Great Britain decreased by 10.7% year on year.  This is obviously a cause for concern.  It is too early to state definitively what the reasons are for this decline and whether it will carry through to the remainder of the year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is clear, however, that the sterling depreciation following the Brexit referendum result has made Ireland and every other eurozone country more expensive for British travellers than had been the case previously.  Furthermore, research has indicated that British consumers are likely to scale back on overseas holiday activity this year.<\/p><p>The tourism action plan is committed to seeking to restore the tourism marketing fund to pre-recession levels on a phased basis.  Budget 2017 included increased funding of more than 2% for the tourism marketing fund this year and the Minister and I will seek further additional funding for next year to mitigate any negative effects of Brexit on tourism.  Tourism Ireland will continue to focus on protecting our market share in Britain, while seeking to increase diversification into other markets, particularly those that deliver higher tourism revenue.<\/p><p>Maintaining overall competitiveness in the tourism industry is also vital at this time.  While the industry acknowledges its primary responsibility in this regard, I will endeavour to assist by seeking to maintain the lower VAT rate for the tourism industry and to keep the air travel tax at zero.  The aviation sector is critical to Ireland and tourism.  As an island with an open economy, the sector is essential for our trading relationships, all of our industries, especially tourism, manufacturing and retail, and our participation in the global economy.  Brexit, unless accompanied by some form of agreement replacing the impacted traffic rights and associated regulations, will affect the existing rights of Irish licensed airlines to fly between the United Kingdom and the European Union, within the United Kingdom, and between the UK and a range of other third countries, including the United States and Morocco.<\/p><p>Our preparations for the impact of Brexit are continuing at both political and official level in order that we are ready for the challenges it may bring for Irish tourism.  Tourism Ireland's market diversification and rebalancing strategy is already paying dividends as we can see, with mainland Europe now clearly the star performer in terms of delivering tourism revenue and North America overtaking Great Britain in terms of its contribution to overseas visitor revenue in the Republic.  Many tourism businesses have already successfully rebalanced their marketing emphasis to reflect the new reality and I expect that others will follow in the coming months.  That said, Britain is our nearest market and will continue to be the most important market for tourism to Ireland for a long time to come.<\/p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to deliver on its commitment to the industry, providing a suite of targeted training and business supports to enhance the competitiveness, enterprise capability and sustainability of the tourism sector.  It is also placing a strong emphasis on assisting the tourism sector to increase the geographical spread of activity and lengthen the tourism season beyond the peak summer months.  It is working on a number of fronts to assist the diversification and development of our tourism industry and the attractiveness of our tourism offering.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also rolling out a new Brexit response programme that will focus on delivering a capability building programme for tourism businesses.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s tourism policy statement, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025, brought a particular focus to what is perhaps our greatest potential tourism offering, namely, where the aspects of people and place converge at the level of the local community.  Senators will be aware of the success in 2013 of The Gathering.  Local authorities were the essential link that enabled community effort to be supported by State resources.  The success of The Gathering has provided a foundation on which to develop a more structured role for local authorities in support of community initiatives in tourism.  In this regard, it has been a priority of mine to ensure local authorities are encouraged to support communities in tourism development and will co-operate with neighbouring authorities, as appropriate, to maximise tourism opportunities for their region as a whole.  Accordingly, I was delighted at the end of March to attend a local government tourism conference in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, under the heading, Collaborate Locally to Compete GlobaIly, and, crucially, for the first time to officially launch tourism statements of strategy and work plans for each of the 31 local authorities.<\/p><p>A key element of the reform of local government was the strengthening of the role the sector plays in economic development.  Tourism is recognised as an important driver of the local, regional and national economies and is, therefore, a central component of the economic ambitions of all local authorities.  A local economic and community plan has been prepared for each county and city area throughout Ireland and these set out clear objectives, specific goals and actions to support the tourism sector in each county.<\/p><p>It is more important than ever that we create what we describe as \"stand-out\" for Ireland in our markets by rolling out inspirational Ireland destination messaging.  This essential destination sell will be supported by the promotion of our iconic holiday experiences, namely, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, the Wild Atlantic Way and the Dublin brand.  I will discuss these later if Senators have questions on them.  All three experiences are major themes for Tourism Ireland this year, as is the promotion of touring holidays, city breaks, festivals, events and activities.  Work is continuing with airports and airlines to encourage the creation of new routes and expansion of existing services to the regions.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, Ireland is bidding to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023.  After much preparation, I understand the IRFU will lodge its bid with World Rugby tomorrow.  The hosting of a Rugby World Cup on the island of Ireland has the potential to be very beneficial, both in terms of visitor numbers and the political dimension of an all-island tournament.  It would have considerable tourism potential as it would take place during Ireland's shoulder season for overseas tourism, namely, between the middle of September and end of October.  In terms of tourism earnings and jobs, it would provide increased business for hotels, restaurants and tourism businesses during the shoulder season.  A successful bid for the Rugby World Cup would have the dual advantage of promoting sport and tourism.  I wish the IRFU and the committee charged with lodging its bid every success in the coming months in their dealings with World Rugby and the individual rugby unions, many of which I have met.<\/p><p>I hope I have given the House an overview of the tourism industry, which has a proven track record in creating employment throughout the country and driving growth in the economy.  As I stated, last year was a record breaking year for tourism.  While this performance is encouraging, we are determined that growth will continue in line with the ambitious targets set out in the tourism policy, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025, which was adopted by the previous Minister and Minister of State in the Department, Deputies Paschal Donohoe and Michael Ring.<\/p><p>Brexit is a significant challenge but the tourism sector has overcome great adversity in the past and I am sure it will do so again.  I look forward to working with the tourism industry and all the State agencies, including local authorities, to ensure we build on the achievements of recent years.  As the Senators present will be aware, we take seriously all suggestions made in the Seanad and we are open to Senators' proposals on how we can grow the tourism industry.  I look forward to their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#CC00400","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh diosp&oacute;ireacht &uacute;s&aacute;ideach againn.  I have heard the Minister of State speak many times.  We do not live far from each other and we have encountered one another at several functions to promote tourism.  He is doing a very good job and I compliment him on his performance yesterday in Achill in the Acting Leader's county.  I hope we will see him performing as well in Ballybunion and other places in the near future.<\/p> <p>I will be positive in this debate because tourism is a positive story.  It is important that we try to sing from the same hymn sheet.  While some cracks and flaws are starting to appear here and there, I am pleased to note that the Minister of State is well aware of them.  While I was unable to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport this morning, I followed proceedings closely on the monitor and listened to the Minister of State's comments to my fellow committee members.  He is clearly aware of what may lie around the corner.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State provided a series of figures outlining the good news in tourism.  While I do not propose to repeat them, the 13% increase in visitor numbers in 2015 was a magnificent achievement.  Many other countries that may have as much to offer as Ireland would be very proud of such growth.  The negative side, to which the Minister of State alluded, is the 11% decline in visitor numbers from the United Kingdom recorded in the short period between February and April of this year.  This downturn contrasts with the substantial increase of approximately 25% in visitors from North America.  However, the good news underlines how worrying the bad trend in UK visitor numbers is.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The indications from people in the industry are pretty clear that there is already a softening in UK bookings for the rest of this year.  I come from a county that is heavily dependent on tourism and the anecdotal evidence, as well as the little signs one picks up on the ground, are bad.  When swallows gather in the fall of the year, one knows that winter is coming.  Little things are happening, and other little things are not happening, which indicate that we may have serious problems with UK visitor numbers this year.  We will have to be alert and the people for whom tourism is a livelihood are making plans.  They know how to adapt and, with the Minister's support and the full backing of the Department, we can forestall the worst scenarios.<\/p><p>I accept that the Minister is working with the tourism leadership group and I understand he will have a further meeting with them before long.  Can he outline who is in the group and what does he think of the way they work?  Is there any room for improvement?  I presume the Minister agrees that the three priorities for the Government must be to preserve the common travel area, to avoid a hard Border and to maintain an open aviation regime, the last of which will always be important for us as an island nation.  The devaluation of sterling is an imponderable and who knows what will be the result of the UK election?  All of a sudden, it seems to be quite interesting but it could have a further depressing outcome for us.  The more sterling drops, the more expensive it will be for somebody to spend sterling over here.<\/p><p>I spent a few days touring the east midlands of England, around Nottingham and Lincoln, and I encountered many people.  I was surprised at how many were totally opposed to Brexit, although obviously they had not been in the majority.  I was also surprised by how many loved Ireland and loved coming to Ireland, although they probably will not do so this year for financial reasons.  We therefore have to look at alternatives and at diversification, something I raised at our last debate at which the Minister was present.  I know the Department is working very hard on diversification and there is a huge world out there.  In particular, there is a huge eastern market.  While our share of it is small at the moment, it is growing and people who come from as far away as China stay a lot longer, spend a lot more and tend to travel around the country, rather than just pick one spot such as Dublin, Galway or Killarney.  We need to do more work on the niche markets and one for which we can do even more is the market for the elderly, the people who are in their golden years.  Ireland is an ideal place for them because everything is relatively safe, although no place is safe from global terrorism at the moment.  There is more potential to attract these people than we are exploiting at present.  Speciality holidays and activity holidays are hugely important but we must not forget the golden pound.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to local authorities and I commend the local authorities around the country on taking a hands-on approach to promoting and developing tourism in their respective counties.  We were recently at the launch of the Kerry effort some months ago.  Doing this is not a huge financial burden for councils and small moneys can go a long way in good communities.  I am very proud to be from Listowel and tonight is one of the biggest nights of our year, being the opening night of writers week.  It is not a huge enterprise with a huge budget although we enjoy certain levels of support from the Arts Council and private sponsorship, but the amount of money it will generate in the restaurants, bars and shops over the next few days will be phenomenal.<\/p><p>I am conscious of the issue of regionalisation as, I am sure, is the Minister.  I will not bore people with statistics but approximately 40% of all our visitors will perch in Dublin for some part of their stay.  We in the south west are next at approximately 18% and the west gets 13% but the poor north west gets 5% or 6%.  I do not understand this disparity because there is no more beautiful countryside in the world than Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo.<\/p><p>We have spoken of the price of hotels in Dublin and I did a little survey this week.  I challenge anyone to find a hotel within a half mile from Leinster House where a room costs less than &euro;200.  It is absolute madness and I am grateful that Airbnb is coming up.  I propose that the Minister work with Airbnb to develop it.  It has got some bad press but it is the only thing that is keeping visitors in Dublin at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#DD00200","speaker":"1394","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496223000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about tourism in Ireland.  Working in the hospitality industry myself it is an area with which I am very familiar.  I understand how Government and the industry can work hand in glove to deliver for what is a very important industry to this country.  Tourism is one of Ireland's most important economic sectors, with total tourism revenue for the economy in 2015 of over &euro;7 billion, while employment in tourism in Ireland is estimated at 203,000 jobs.<\/p> <p>As the Minister knows all too well, Great Britain is Ireland's biggest source market for overseas tourists, representing 41.6% of all such visits and 26% of total tourism revenue.  The end of the common travel area between the UK and Ireland would thus be very costly and disruptive to the tourism industry in Ireland.  Moreover, the continued and expected long-term depreciation of sterling against the euro will have inevitable consequences for the number of visitors who come from Great Britain to Ireland.  This is already having an effect and, according to some recently published figures, the number of British tourists was down by 10.7% over the course of the summer.<\/p> <p>The Seanad Brexit committee heard that Tourism Ireland has cut its forecast for the coming year by 6% because of Brexit.  In 2016, tourism in the North of Ireland increased by 26% and tourism in the Border counties increased by 14%.  It is the second biggest industry on the island of Ireland.  The Seanad committee learned that the problem coming down the road relates to who will fund Tourism Ireland in the future.  There has been a reduction in the number of EU visitor numbers in the first three months of this year, which are down 5.5% on last  year.<\/p> <p>The tourism industry is vital to the country but we are in uncertain times with Brexit.  I was very surprised to hear from Tourism Ireland at the Seanad committee that people want to know whether tourists will be safe if there is a Border in two years time, and that this question specifically came up in trade missions to Italy and Germany.  It is vitally important that Tourism Ireland knows where it will get funding as it goes forward, and what level of funding it will get.  Are the Twenty-six Counties to be marketed separately from the Six Counties?  Will Tourism Ireland be selling an island that is partly in the EU and partly out of the EU?  These are the questions which Tourism Ireland asked at the Seanad Brexit committee.<\/p> <p>While many people may view the tourism industry as urban based, tourism is the second largest industry in rural Ireland.  The smaller businesses, whose owners perhaps own farms but rent holiday homes, boats or bicycles to tourists, are suffering from the uncertainty that Brexit has brought.  This uncertainty is affecting not only the industry but the funding of the very State agency that is responsible for bringing people to the island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017053100002#EE00200","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1496223000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
