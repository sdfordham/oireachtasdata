I am aware that Deputy Denise Mitchell is running late owing to a family matter.<\/p> <p>  We are meeting to consider the Revised Estimate for Vote 40 for the  Department of Children and Youth Affairs which was referred to the select committee by order of the D&aacute;il on 14 December 2017.  I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and her many officials whom I thank them for the briefing material supplied.  The proposed format of the meeting is that we will deal with the Vote on a programme by programme basis.  At the outset of the consideration of each programme the Minister can give an overview of it.  We will then take questions from members. <\/p> <p>  I remind members and those in the Visitors Gallery that mobile phones should be switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting and recording systems, even when left in silent mode.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <\/p> <p>  The briefing material supplied in advance on the various programmes has been forwarded to members.  We will proceed sequentially and members will be called in the order in which they indicate.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make an opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018030700002#A00500","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1520415000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to be here, together with my outstanding officials, to discuss my Department&rsquo;s Revised Estimate for 2018.  In my opening statement I will provide a summary of what is included in each of the programme areas and may not need to do so again when we come to discuss each of those areas.  <\/p> <p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I remain completely committed to ensuring the full delivery of the programme for Government commitments.  I want to see an Ireland in which the rights of all children and young people are respected, protected and fulfilled; in which their voices are heard; and in which they are supported to realise their maximum potential now and into the future.  Of course, we all know that if we work to allow them to achieve their maximum potential now, it will influence what happens in the future.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for my Department for 2018 provides for a gross funding provision of &euro;1.383 billion which represents an increase of just under &euro;73 million, or 6%, on its 2017 allocation.  As a result, during 2018 my Department will spend &euro;1.355 billion on current expenditure and &euro;28 million on capital expenditure.  This is a significant investment of taxpayers' money.  My Department and its agencies are charged with the delivery of a complex range of policies, legislation and children's services.  To achieve better outcomes for all children and families, I am sure Deputies will agree with me that we must invest wisely in key services.  I remembered this well in negotiating the Estimate for 2018.  I, therefore placed particular emphasis on ensuring a solid financial base for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, together with priority areas for its development.  I also prioritised continued investment in quality early years education and care services.  These two areas comprise 90% of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  I also prioritised a number of other key elements, to which I will refer. <\/p> <p>  I have allocated &euro;754 million to Tusla, which represents an increase of &euro;40.6 million, or 5.6%, on the allocation for 2017 when the increase on the allocation for the previous year was &euro;37 million.  I have allocated &euro;485 million for early years education and care services, which represents an increase of &euro;20 million, or 4.3%, on the allocation for 2017. <\/p> <p>  The Vote also contains almost &euro;62 million for youth services - &euro;59 million in current funding and &euro;3 million in capital support.  These resources will fund youth services throughout the country, including services for those at risk of disadvantage.  They represent an increase of &euro;1.5 million, or 2.5%, on the allocation for 2017. <\/p> <p>  Other key expenditure figures include &euro;28 million to meet the operational costs of the Oberstown children detention campus.  I wish to say a few words about that investment.  When I visited the campus on Tuesday, I was very impressed by what I witnessed and heard from the seven young men whom I met, as well as the director, Mr. Pat Bergin; the chairperson of the board of management, Professor Ursula Kilkelly, and some of the other members of Mr. Bergin's senior team.  They talked to me about the young men on the campus advisory council, the equivalent of a student council, and what they had achieved.  They had put in place a framework for the council.  This is the first time ever in a detention centre that young men have worked with my Department in identifying standards which will feed into the reform of standards in the Oberstown centre.  They spoke to me about the Gaisce awards they had received.  They also talked to me about the random acts of kindness week in the school.  They mentioned the various fundraising events in which they had participated, be it for the hospice or the Irish Cancer Society.  They raised almost &euro;2,000 in the past year.  I promised them that I would mention this during the debate on the Estimates because I was very proud to meet them.  Yes, they come from troubled backgrounds, but they are beautiful young men.  Based on what I saw, I believe the investment - that is what we are talking about - is paying off.    <\/p> <p>  To return to the Vote, &euro;18 million has been allocated to meet the operational costs of my Department, &euro;9 million for the area based childhood programme, &euro;6 million for the intervention programme for children and young people, &euro;4 million for the Adoption Authority of Ireland and just under &euro;3 million for the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, all of which have seen an increase on the respective provision for 2017.  In each case I am satisfied that the extra resources are justified and that the respective agencies are capable of delivering on the objectives set for them. <\/p> <p>  During the negotiations on budget 2018 I worked hard to achieve increased resources for the priority areas I had identified.  I am pleased that, as a government, we can back up our stated commitment to children and young people with increased resources, targeted at the areas where we want to make a real difference in the lives of children and young people and their families.<\/p><p>During the past few years I have been working to put Tusla on a firm financial footing and to give it the resources necessary to implement some key improvements to services.  The &euro;40 million extra for the agency this year means that it can continue to address a number of major concerns, including implementing the mandatory reporting provisions of the Children First Act, addressing my continuing concerns about unallocated cases, rolling out the national child care information system and supporting critical areas, such as private and residential foster care, and services for domestic, sexual and gender based violence, and child homelessness. <br\/><br\/>I have long been committed to the expansion of Tusla&rsquo;s out-of-hours social work service.  Tusla&rsquo;s financial allocation for 2018 means that this will become a reality.  It involves integrating the three existing out-of-hours services into one national service with a national contact number, and an out-of-hours call centre for all foster carers.  I am pleased that this initiative will ensure that all parts of the country will have access to a social work service on a 24-7 basis. <br\/><br\/>In the area of family supports, which cover prevention, protection and welfare services, I was pleased to able to fund an additional 11 family resource centres, and I will make an announcement about that next week, as well as providing increased funding to expand the excellent services provided by the existing 109 centres as well.  <br\/><br\/>I am placing great emphasis on reforming the school completion programme to ensure that it is organised to best effect with a new governance structure.  I believe that the programme does extremely important work with some of our most vulnerable young people, and I want to ensure that it is supported and developed in the years ahead. <br\/><br\/>In the area of early years, I am pleased that we have been making progress in the supports for parents of young children.  Since my appointment one of my key priorities has been to address the historic under-resourcing in the area of child care. <br\/><br\/>As we are all aware international evidence is clear that investment in children during their early years results in long-term gains to children, families, the economy and society generally.  I could not help thinking about that when I was in Oberstown.<br\/><br\/>In recent years the significant increases in resource provision has enabled my Department to advance a number of key reforms and 2018 represents another significant step forward in ensuring access to quality, affordable, and accessible early years care and education. <br\/><br\/>The ECCE scheme will apply effectively for a full two years from September 2018, and it currently benefits some 110,000 children.  This will peak at about 126,000 children by April this year.  In addition, there has been a huge uptake of the measures I introduced last September in advance of the affordable child care scheme.  In 2017 we had an uptake rate of some 98%, or 68,000 registrations of children.  The most recent figures available to my Department indicate that the registrations have now exceeded 70,000.  I briefed the joint committee on 24 January 2018 on the progress we have been making to introduce the full affordable child care scheme and I will be able to set out a more specific timescale on it after the vendor for the new IT system has been appointed. <br\/><br\/>Among the legislative priorities that I will pursue this year are the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 [Seanad] which passed Second Stage in the Seanad some time ago; the Childcare Support Bill 2017, which passed Committee Stage last week.  I thank members for their co-operation and contribution.  This Bill, when enacted, will give statutory effect to the affordable child care scheme.  The Children (Amendment) Bill which will form the basis for major reforms of the current guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>scheme and service. <br\/><br\/>I know the members of the select committee share my ambition to have all three of these important Bills enacted as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I believe that the significant increase in resources under my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2018 brings great opportunities for a targeted development and improvement of services.  I will work closely with Tusla, my own Department and all of the stakeholders to achieve the best possible outcomes and the best value for money.  We have made very good progress and I look forward to working with members to continue that in 2018 and in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018030700002#A00600","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520415000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I will now call the individual programmes for Vote 40.

To answer the question on the amount that has been allocated for 2018, as in 2017, it is the same amount of money that is being allocated, namely, &euro;24.7 million.  It is important to note the reasons for maintaining that investment at &euro;24.7 million.  As we are all aware, a reform of the programme is required.  I have been working very closely with the Tusla executive, the board, my officials and effectively all the main stakeholders on examining the best way to reform.  We had an event in Farmleigh at which we brought all the key stakeholders together.  We are analysing that.  I am getting more information from Tusla.  I am aware that the school completion co-ordinators particularly as well as project workers and others who work on the programme are deeply concerned about the future, particularly into 2019.  There is a sense of urgency to identify the way we will move forward in terms of governance, human resources and also the programmes they put in place.  While I knew that we would be examining that, we make a similar investment in 2018.  When recommendations are made to me and decisions made, and I ask for this information regularly from officials, we will be in a better position to identify whether we require increases and what those will be for 2019.  I will be passionate and committed to ensuring that we have those increases for 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018030700002#C00800","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1520415000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's honest answer regarding the funding.

If a student is in a school completion programme school he or she has access to counselling, play therapy at primary school level and homework clubs that help students with homework.  The difference that makes to children cannot be measured.

That is a decrease of 44% or &euro;2.7 million on the allocation for 2017.  Why is there that decrease?  It is because there was an overall amount allocated to the commission to do its work, whether it was three or four years.  What it has found, certainly in terms of its work in 2017, is that there is more than enough money.  The Government agreed to extend the timeframe for an extra year, and in light of that agreement, the commission is scheduled to report in February 2019.  The commission still has sufficient money in respect of the overall allocation for its work.  We are spreading it out over a four-year period as distinct from the three-year period.  That is why there is a decrease in 2018.  This was agreed in formal engagement with the commission in terms of its work.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the comment on Tuam.  On Deputy Rabbitte's question on whether the work will be completed by February of 2019, that is what I have agreed with the independent commission in respect of its third interim report and its request for that one-year extension.  As the Deputy is aware, the plan initially was to stagger the three reports - the history report, the investigative report and the confidential committee report of the evidence of witnesses who came before it - and that they would be sequential.  The commission made a decision some time ago, however, when it put out either its first or second interim report, that it needed to put out all of those reports at the same time to provide the best possible picture.  That continues to be the case.  My understanding, as I said, is that its intention is to report then.  That is all I can say right now because it is an independent commission.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the specific question, as the Deputy is aware, to complement its work and add to the transitional justice approach that the commission effectively is engaged in as well, a number of other things have been happening, particularly in regard to key stakeholders and survivors or people who were actually residents in the home.  One of these has been to facilitate a consultative process.  In terms of response to the second interim report, we are now moving towards a more representative facilitative process in which we have identified people to form a representative group to work with Mr. Gerry Kearney to take a look at the requests of the key stakeholders in terms of, for example, health and well-being supports and how to memorialise in relation to all of the mother and baby homes.  That that will begin relatively soon.  I have indicated as well to the people who are initiating this second consultative process that I would appreciate if they could report to me as soon as possible once they have gathered the group, taken a look at its suggestions and formed a consensus on the kinds of health and well-being supports that they would like and find useful.  I have asked that this would be recommended to me for the Government to have a look at it, and this may happen prior to the commission reporting to me in 2019.  It is important to say that.<\/p> <p>  I refer to what is going on in Tuam, which is narrower and distinct from the wider issues in respect of the mother and baby homes commission.  We are now marking a year since the discovery, and that is what the reports are reminding us of.  Since that discovery, we have put in place a process to try to respond appropriately to the terrible tragedy that was discovered and that we witnessed.  We are continuing to do what we said.  We are having a technical group look at the possible options for what can be done in respect of what happened in Tuam and to put that out to consultation.  We have passed that over to Galway County Council.  My understanding is that consultative process has various aspects to its methodology, one of which is to put out a questionnaire for people to respond to.  A second one, equally valid and important, is that the group would meet whoever wanted to meet it.  There was a gathering in Dublin and there will be a gathering in Galway relatively soon.  It is a facilitated process.  I asked that one or two of the members of the technical group be present for that so that there can be engagement.  When that is completed, recommendations will come to me in respect of all of the interested stakeholders who participated in the process.  We will bring that then to an interdepartmental group that my Secretary General, Mr. Fergal Lynch, has been chairing.  It will examine those recommendations, ultimately come to me and I will bring them to Government.  We are doing what we said we would do.  I am aware of how much time is passing and I really do appreciate the feelings as a result of that.  I hope it can continue at the pace that it is doing, that we will get those recommendations as soon as possible and decisions can be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018030700002#D01000","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1520415000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

We know there is significant staff turnover in child care facilities; some estimates put the figure at as high as 30%.  How do we address this high rate of turnover?  The overheads and administrative burdens in individual facilities are increasing.  Can anything be done about that?  Does the Minister have a perspective on how we can address the high rate of turnover, given the high level of qualifications within the sector?  Is there a mechanism to build in possible budgets for individual facilities to account for the increased overhead as a result of administrative costs?  Could the Minister allow for some provision to be made for continuous professional development?  It is a key factor in any career.  I understand some segments within the sector are asking for up to five days for some provision to be made for that.

There has been some controversy - if I can use that term - about the SCU.  It was reported by Hugh O'Connell in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>that on July 9 the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, responded to a memo stating that the child care subsidy scheme being announced by the Government later in the summer should be a key campaign run by the SCU.  He is quoted as saying, &quot;Again, should be a thing the Govt is doing for you, not the Dept of Children &amp;amp;Youth ... I think there should be a campaign run on this throughout August.&quot;<\/p><p>I note the Minister has made some comments in the public domain about possible interaction with the Taoiseach on this.  I want to glean from the Minister who is in control of the Department's communications.  Is it now a function of the SCU?  Will it become a function of the SCU if it is not currently such a function or is the Minister in control of her budget line which, as I understand it, totals approximately &euro;113,000 if the FOI figure is to be believed?  I cannot see the specific figure in the Estimates.  Perhaps the Minister might assist us with that.  I would make the case that the Minister and her Department should be in control of the communications strategy<b>.  <\/b>If the interaction between the sector and all of its constituent parts is close to the Minister in terms of relationships I do not see the need for that to be elevated to the Department of the Taoiseach which is at another remove.  There is a political issue in terms of control and it is more of a political question for the Minister.  <\/p><p>I refer to the allocation for Tusla.  To be fair to the Minister, she has secured some &euro;754 million for Tusla, an increase of &euro;40 million.  In my mind I find it difficult to reconcile the increase in the budget for Tusla and the number of HIQA reports coming into the public domain across a wide range of issues.  I am trying to glean whether the HIQA reports are being acted upon on a regional basis and when we can expect success in respect of the recommendations in each of the HIQA reports.  <\/p><p>I tabled a parliamentary question seeking information on the number of social workers in the system.  The response I got was that there was an average of ten years duration in career length.  It is a tough job and I can understand that there is a high rate of attrition in the sector for all sorts of reasons.  Is there something in the Minister's vision which will speak to the budget lines before us and address the decline in numbers over a longer-term period?  Is the Minister liaising with other Departments to see how we can encourage more people to become social workers and social care workers?  They are key personnel and act as an interface between the challenges the sector faces and outputs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018030700002#E00700","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1520415000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.

In the budget for 2018, there were a couple of aspects of negotiations for the child care programme which I hoped would assist in ensuring increased resources for providers.  My ultimate hope is those resources could be shared with workers, although as the Deputy is aware I cannot make those decisions because I am not the employer.<\/p> <p>  The increase of &euro;20 million in the early years programme, in addition to the repurposing of moneys from 2017 to enable us to do some extra significant things for 2018, will, it is to be hoped, have an impact in terms of the moneys which ultimately get to the providers and workers.  This is by way of response to the question on turnover.  Some turnover is due to difficulties with pay and conditions.  For example, from September 2018 we will have two full years of the ECCE scheme which is why it was so important for me to increase the ECCE capitation from September 2018 because it will mean more money for providers.<\/p><p>We also continue to provide &euro;18 million to providers in recognition of the administrative burden in supporting various child care schemes.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked that we would maintain our investment in ongoing continuing professional development.  I will be meeting the early years forum, which I established, later today to discuss staffing.  I have indicated that in my negotiations into 2019 I have an eye on quality which is a code word for the workforce and supporting it to provide that quality.  We have contracted an independent review of costs.  That work will be completed in plenty of time for me to have the information to negotiate for 2019.  We will see for the first time whether we are investing enough in costs and the examination of pay and conditions of the workforce.  We are substantially assisting services which have been in crisis, some of which has to do with staff.  We are also considering continuing professional development.

I welcomed the Taoiseach's response to those concerns, and we are now in the middle of a debate about what will happen as a result of the review by the Secretary General as well as the independent scrutiny by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, that is expected and by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland.

In 2018, Tusla expects to recruit an additional 45 social workers, 57 social care workers, nine nursing staff and 53 other health professionals, which include early years inspectors, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  That is a significant portion of the breakdown of the 422 extra whole-time equivalent employees it will recruit.  The grade breakdown for the remaining 145 is being finalised.  Family support workers are to be recruited.  The officials and I have been encouraging Tusla to complete its workforce strategy which it will do shortly for this year and for the next couple of years.  That will assist considerably in determining the mix of staff required to do the work of Tusla.  It is not to say that we do not need to continue to recruit the social workers.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we were engaging with other Departments to do that and the answer is yes, especially the Department of Education and Skills.  That is more medium to long-term.  There is continuing engagement between the officials, Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills to establish how many social workers we can turn out through higher education because we need more, not just for Tusla but for other agencies and organisations.  Therefore, it is important to work in the medium and long term to increase the number of social workers available to be recruited but also to be clear and creative about the mix of the overall workforce to respond appropriately to the number of services, referrals and cases, and family, early intervention and prevention work that Tusla does.<\/p><p>The other thing that is a key aspect that will be supportive for Tusla is the fact that there has been a major ICT roll-out - not just the national child care information system but the development of a strategy as well as the increase in something as simple as the number of laptops social workers and other workers will have so that they will be able to do their work more efficiently and get to the work they are intended to do as distinct from the time it might have taken in terms of administrative aspects so it would impact positively on staff productivity.  As Deputies are aware, Tusla established its own recruitment programme to deal with the significant issue of recruiting and the various types of professionals in addition to social workers.  There does not appear to have been significant issues recruiting most other grades with the exception of social workers.  It is important to acknowledge that Tusla has taken a proactive approach with regard to the other professionals it is looking for.  <\/p><p> In response to Deputy Mitchell's question about the open cases, 24,891 open cases were identified as needing a social work service at the end of 2017.  That goes back to a question from Deputy Rabbitte.  Of these, 19,999 had a named allocated social worker so, therefore, 4,892 were awaiting the allocation of a social worker, which represents 20% of the open cases.  I remind members that where a child needs an urgent response, they are dealt with urgently and immediately by the social workers.  The number of social workers at the end of 2017 was 1,466.  We hope that by the end of 2018, there will be an additional 45 so it needs to recruit 214 to achieve this because of those who will be leaving.  It is important to note that in addition to social workers, Tusla also utilises another agency for social workers in order to complete the work.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018030700002#F00700","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520415000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Could the Minister give us a timeframe between when contact is first made and when a child is allocated a social worker?

I appreciate the Deputy's question about the HIQA reports.  Along with my officials, I have on occasion met with HIQA to listen to its general approach regarding working with Tusla.  As the Deputy is aware, HIQA reports include an action plan provided by Tusla to respond to the report.  This is accepted by HIQA.  Usually when those reports come out, Tusla's response is that certain standards have been met, others have not, action plans have been recommended and we are putting in place additional resources to ensure that these actions can be implemented if additional resources are required.  Certainly additional resources are being provided for the record keeping of the NCCIS, ten of whose regional centres are already piloting this new approach.  It has indicated that by June or mid-year, all of the regions will have that new information system working, which will impact significantly the sharing and recording of information and the ability to respond more quickly.  This is not in defence <i>per se <\/i>of Tusla but until that is in place, there will be some things that HIQA will continue to say to the agency that will be difficult to respond to as quickly compared what might happen once it is in place.  Once it is in place, we anticipate significant changes in that regard and that standards will be met.  Additional resources are being provided for family support and prevention services as well as the recruitment work about which we have spoken.  The Deputy asked a question about policy and practice.  Policy and practice are being improved through the roll-out of new practices called Signs of Safety, which will assist in the consistency and quality of the response.  I had the opportunity to work with some of the people in Tusla or at least participate in a conference where they looked at the approach they developed, training in terms of their workforce and Signs of Safety and the research that underpins to ensure that this was a model of best practice to continue the work they are doing.<\/p><p>Deputy Mitchell asked about the timeframe.  As I have already said, all urgent cases are seen immediately.  As the Deputy may be aware, cases are assessed in terms of priority - high, medium and low - particularly concerning the child's need for protection and support.  The length of time is three months, having made those points about any urgent cases being seen immediately and assessment in terms of a case's priority.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018030700002#G00300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1520415000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Three months is a quarter of a year in effect.

As part of the GSAS management team, I have been integral to the introduction and establishment of the analysis service in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Not only has this involved recruitment, structuring, training, the development of systems and processes, progression planning and budgeting, but also gaining acceptance for the use of analysis in the wider organisation.  I have responsibility for crime and policing analysts within headquarters units and special crime operations.  My remit is very broad, ranging from oversight of national assessments of volume crime, such as burglary and assault, through serious and organised crime, for example, homicide, drugs and immigration, to matters concerning national security.  I have insights into the organisation across the spectrum of policing functions and have experience of interacting with personnel at all grades and ranks.<\/p> <p>  Prior to August 2007, I worked as an analyst in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, for nearly six years.  During this time, I supported a multitude of investigations into serious and organised crime and delivered many reports containing operational recommendations, which were used to set organisational priorities and guide significant strategic decisions by senior officers.<\/p> <p>  In July 2016, I received a direct request for analytical assistance from the Garda national protective services bureau, GNPSB.  The request was for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service to conduct a ten-year review of domestic homicide from 2007 to 2016.  The chief superintendent who made this request did so to satisfy particular obligations the GNPSB has with respect to: the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence from 2016 to 2021; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s domestic abuse intervention policy of 2016; the development of a risk assessment tool in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the development of divisional protective services units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet commitments made in the 2016 policing plan and made to the Policing Authority; the EU victims directive of 2015; the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017; and the Istanbul Convention, which is the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  I personally tasked senior crime and policing analyst, Ms Laura Galligan, with this review.<\/p><p>Ms Galligan had significant, relevant experience from her previous role as senior scientist with the Office of the State Pathologist.  I believed this expertise would add great value to the review of domestic homicide.<br\/><br\/>Having been deputy head of analysis with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for nearly 11 years, I have been uniquely placed to understand the organisation and identify areas of concern or weakness which require prioritisation, particularly if the transformation agenda is to succeed.  Throughout my tenure with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, recurrent areas of concern identified by the analysis service have been PULSE recording and data quality.  Although there is no clearly defined process for GSAS to raise issues identified with regard to data quality, we have always escalated our concerns, whether to crime, policy and administration - latterly known as the policy development, implementation and monitoring unit - or the Garda information services centre in Castlebar and frequently to senior Garda management in analytical reports and at management meetings and conferences.<br\/><br\/>Data quality is of fundamental importance to analysis.  A dearth of good data seriously limits the ability of an analyst to conduct complete and robust analysis in any sector.  I voiced my concerns about data quality to Ms Galligan as she embarked on the ten-year review of domestic homicide.  Within a short time, it became clear there was a deficit of information on the PULSE system to enable Ms Galligan to determine whether a homicide was of a domestic nature or otherwise.  Ms Galligan therefore requested permission to liaise with the Office of the State Pathologist in order that she would have independent and verifiable supplementary information to ensure data quality.  I take this opportunity to thank Professor Marie Cassidy and her team for engaging in this collaboration with the analysis service.<br\/><br\/>When Ms Galligan analysed and cross-checked the files held in the Office of the State Pathologist, information held on PULSE and homicide spreadsheets previously produced internally by the analysis service on a monthly basis, she identified inconsistencies which she deemed to be significant.  When she brought this to my notice, I concurred with her views.  I immediately recognised the gravity of the matters raised and the many possible ramifications.  In my view, the issues raised went right to the heart of policing and the ability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to protect and serve the public.<br\/><br\/>While there were concerns regarding the accurate provision of crime data to the Central Statistics Office, the primary concern was with regard to the victims, their families and loved ones.  I could immediately see the very serious organisational risks for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of reputational damage and public confidence.  I asked Ms Galligan to specifically consider a sample period from 2013 to 2015 to expeditiously highlight the main concerns.  I believed it was critical that we establish an evidence base to clearly illustrate the various issues arising.  Ms Galligan undertook this work on the sample period as I had directed.  On 24 November 2016, she emailed me a draft of her report entitled, Comparative Analysis of the Recording and Reporting of Homicide Incidents in the PULSE Database and the Office of the State Pathologist.  Following a specially convened meeting on 28 November 2016, I recommended to management that the Garda executive be briefed immediately.  I am aware that this briefing occurred on 29 November 2016.  We understood at this time that the professional standards unit would be asked to conduct reviews of the cases highlighted.  I had this impression from communications with my management.  The role of the professional standards unit is to examine and review, as directed by the Garda Commissioner, the operational, administrative and management performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels; propose measures to the Commissioner to improve that performance; and promote the highest standards of practice, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services, in operational, administrative and management matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>Subsequent to the briefing of the Garda executive on 29 November 2016, I asked on several occasions whether anyone had been in contact to address the matters raised.  I was concerned that there did not appear to be a sense of urgency to initiate a full review on the basis of Ms Galligan's report.  In mid-January 2017, officers from policy development, implementation and monitoring, or PDIM, commenced a review of 41 cases which had been referenced in Ms Galligan's draft report.  The report had been escalated to management in draft format due to the urgency with which I perceived the need to raise the issues identified.  It had remained in draft format as priority was given to beginning to look at other years.  I did not deem it a time for worrying about perfection in report writing.  For me, the emphasis was on identifying the issues and raising them as quickly as possible.  Issues identified by Ms Galligan ranged from potential misclassification to data quality issues of varying degrees of severity.  Ms Galligan will shortly go through the findings of her analysis.<br\/><br\/>Ms Galligan and I attended meetings with representatives from PDIM on the following dates in 2017: 17, 19 and 24 January; 7, 13, 20 and 21 February; and 2 and 30 March.  We specifically requested the meeting of 30 March.  After the first meeting on 17 January 2017, all relevant reports were forwarded by me to PDIM electronically with the following email:<\/p><blockquote>... As a result of reviewing case files held within OSP a number of potentially serious anomalies were identified which raised the question of whether PULSE had a complete record of all homicides (not exclusively domestic).  As the numbers recorded as homicide in OSP were higher, the systems had to be manually cross-referenced.  This has raised the possibility that certain cases on PULSE may be incorrectly classified.  In addition, a series of other data quality issues were identified.<br \/><br \/>The documents above outline the variety of issues identified.  It is recommended that a review is carried out of each case noted to determine whether there is a consensus that there are matters of concern.  GSAS will happily assist in any way we can.  We would appreciate being kept abreast of developments as this will determine how we proceed with the review of additional years.  2012 is nearly complete and will be disseminated to you shortly.  It is then intended to research 2016 as we now have a complete year of data.  This will give 5 years which have been reviewed.  A decision will then have to be taken as to whether we continue to work back from 2012.  The original domestic homicide review was intended to cover a period of 10 years ...<\/blockquote><p>During the nine aforementioned meetings, cases highlighted between the years 2013 and 2015 were discussed.  These were very robust discussions, not only about each individual case but also high-level issues such as consistency in recording practice across crime types.  We entered into these meetings in good faith and genuinely believed the intention was to fully and independently review each of the cases.  However, as it transpired, there was an apparent reluctance to countenance many of the issues we tried to raise.  We made many attempts to highlight the potential organisational risks, the inconsistencies we were identifying and the absolute need to review the approach to death classification and investigation, not only within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also in collaboration with partner agencies.  We made it very clear at these review team meetings that agreement had not been reached between the parties involved on many of the key matters raised.<br\/><br\/>Although a review of 2012 had already been carried out, we were instructed not to send the related executive summary to PDIM.  We were not permitted to reference cases from outside the sample review period - 2013 to 2015 - even though they were pertinent to highlighting crucial facts.  Every case will have particular nuances to be referenced, some of which may ultimately impact on policy decisions.<br\/><br\/>It was my full expectation that, as Ms Galligan and I had attended all meetings of the review team, we would, in spite of the often tense and quarrelsome debates, be involved in or at least consulted on the drafting of any report concluding the findings of the meetings and putting forward any recommendations.  It was our understanding that our input was necessary given our central role in raising the issue and highlighting the problems.  However, instead of being consulted or involved, Ms. Galligan and I were excluded from the preparation of any report or review document.  We were not consulted regarding our views on how to ensure good data quality that would enable the work of GSAS.<br\/><br\/>On Monday, 8 May 2017, I was handed a 59-page, hard-copy document entitled, Review of specific Sudden Death\/Homicide Incidents recorded during the period 2013 to 2015.  This was a report produced by PDIM officers from the review team.  I had inquired as to the status of such a report on 28 and 30 March and I am aware Dr. Singh, the head of GSAS, had requested on several occasions during April 2017 to be furnished with any such report.  When this report was provided to me by Dr. Singh at 12.20 on the afternoon of 8 May 2017, I was informed that views on it were required by the close of business that day.  This was not possible.<br\/><br\/>In this report, Ms Galligan's methodology was deemed to be &quot;inherently weak&quot;, &quot;confined&quot; and &quot;restricted&quot; and there were repeated attempts to undermine and erode confidence in the findings of the initial sample review.  This was of huge concern to me.  I felt that my integrity and the integrity of my colleague, for whom I have the utmost respect, was under attack.  Our concern was of a professional nature.  We had been tasked with generating a report, as required by a chief superintendent.<\/p><p>In order to undertake the task and provide the report requested of us, we had to adhere to professional standards and norms.  The fundamental and key component part of this, as any data analyst will confirm in any industry, is the underlying data quality as it underpins the analysis.  Bad data will lead to bad analysis.  We were concerned about the accuracy and quality of the data, and to have ignored our concerns would have been to ignore our ethics and professional standards.  No engagement with the review team gave us any assurance regarding the data quality.<br\/><br\/>Over the course of 8, 9 and 10 May 2017, I believe that very significant pressures were brought to bear on Ms Galligan and me, to persuade us to sign off on the PDIM report.  I felt very pressurised in heated meetings which occurred on 9 and 10 May 2017.  I also received a<b><i><\/i><\/b>series of telephone calls on the afternoon of 9 May during which significant pressures were brought to bear.  Professionally, I could not sign off on the PDIM report and made it clear to all concerned that I would not bow to pressure.  On 11 May 2017, I felt compelled personally to transmit my views about it in a five-page letter to several members of senior Garda management.  Within this correspondence I noted:<\/p><blockquote>My position has been very clearly stated on multiple occasions throughout this process, and remains unchanged.  During the meetings between PDIM, Ms Galligan and I, no agreement was reached, either with regard to the classification of individual cases discussed, or in regard to the more strategic issues relating to homicide investigation and death classification.<br \/><br \/>To make sure there is 100% clarity, the report entitled, Review of specific Sudden Death\/Homicide Incidents recorded during the period 2013 to 2015 is, in my opinion, a one sided view of what occurred within the meetings between PDIM, Ms Galligan and I.  I do not agree with many aspects of the report and I therefore cannot and will not be signing off on recommendations contained therein.<\/blockquote><p>At 8.50 a.m. on 12 May 2017, as a direct consequence of the letter I had sent internally the day before, I received a telephone call.  In line with the requirement of the committee that persons are not named or referenced in such a way as to be identifiable, I am unable to say who made this call.  During this call, I was made aware that a report, which I had submitted on 11 April 2017 for onward transmission to the Policing Authority - request 210 relating to the homicide review, had never been sent to it.  I was informed that this report had been discussed among senior Garda personnel prior to a private Policing Authority meeting on 13 April 2017.  If this was the case, then it was known at that time that agreement had not been reached during the meetings of the review team.  This makes it difficult to understand how certain comments were made and assurances given during the public Policing Authority meeting on 27 April 2017.  Several other things were said to me in this conversation, for which I have contemporaneous notes and which I can make available if the committee requires.<br\/><br\/>On the afternoon of 12 May 2017, Ms Galligan and I met with members of senior Garda management.  We were very honest about our views during this meeting.  It was made clear that there had been difficulties during the review team meetings and that we felt we had not been listened to or well treated.  Following this discussion, it was agreed that there still needed to be a firm decision taken on the classification of a number of cases highlighted in Ms Galligan&rsquo;s original report.  During this meeting, and in a subsequent email I sent on 13 May 2017, there was agreement that Ms Galligan and I would be given sufficient time to go through the PDIM report, review the conclusions of this report <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>our own conclusions relating to the 41 referenced cases and provide a response to the report.  There was also to be a meeting convened immediately to address the difficulties which had arisen at the review team meetings.  This meeting eventually took place on 26 June 2017 but unfortunately resolved nothing.<br\/><br\/>On 26 May 2017, a draft response was provided to senior Garda management, which included the agreed review of the 41 cases.  A 123 page final report was submitted to senior Garda management on 7 June 2017.  This final version of the report included 20 pages of recommendations, made on the basis of the findings of the 2013 to 2015 review.  On 30 June 2017, another member of senior Garda management was also briefed by Ms Galligan and me, as the member was to set up a multi-agency working group to deal with policy and governance issues arising.<b><i><\/i><\/b>This group was to include representatives from the Central Statistics Office, the Policing Authority and the Department of Justice and Equality, among others.<br\/><br\/>In the weeks that followed, Ms Galligan continued to produce reports identifying cases of concern for 2017.  These reports were escalated to senior Garda management.  Again, these concerns related to potential misclassification of incidents and broader data quality issues.  Ms Galligan also continued to provide assistance with rectifying issues uncovered with regard to fatal collisions and incidents of dangerous driving causing death.  Ms Galligan also continued to refer cases to the protective services bureau, where we had very genuine concerns that a person may be living in a vulnerable situation.  For example, we made the decision to escalate cases where we felt that a new partner may be at risk.  These were identified as Ms Galligan did her utmost to piece together histories where escalation in the number and severity of incidents pointed to significant risk indicators.  At times this was like stitching together a patchwork quilt, as there were incidents that were correctly classified and then there were those found languishing in inappropriate categories, such as attention and complaints.  I strongly believed that we would never regret referring such instances to the protective services bureau, but we might regret not doing so.<br\/><br\/>I continued to pursue senior Garda management for responses and guidance as to how we should proceed with the review of other years.  I was concerned that GSAS had been tasked with reviewing a ten year period and only four years had been initially reviewed, with much more work required.  Between May and mid-September 2017, we continued to come under pressure to come to agreement regarding the 41 cases.  However, even following adjudication by a member of senior Garda management, agreement could not be reached because the stance was still to insist there was nothing wrong.  In mid-September 2017, Ms Galligan and I were informed that we had indeed been correct all along and that there were cases which had been misclassified.  This gave us an immense sense of relief and confirmed that we had been correct in standing our ground.  However, we have yet to receive any formal guidance as to what is required of us.<br\/><br\/>In particular, the stress and pressure we had been subjected to on a continuous basis from our first raising these issues have not been satisfactorily acknowledged or adequately addressed.  It is my view that we were subjected to severe pressure to withdraw our concerns, to ignore our professional standards and to agree with the views of the sworn members of the review team.  Our integrity, both personal and professional, was undermined and attacked.  We do not know what the motivation of the review team was in disregarding our views, seeking to minimise the importance of the issues and then seeking to force its report on us and have us sign off on same, inclusive of the scant and inadequate recommendations contained therein.<br\/><br\/>On 11 December 2017, Ms Galligan and I requested, by email, a private meeting with senior Garda management due to our ongoing concerns about the lack of progress.  This email seemed to set in motion the appointment of another member of senior Garda management to lead on the homicide review.  Our private meeting with senior Garda management occurred on 10 January 2018.  Ms Galligan and I also wrote to senior Garda management again on 12 January 2018.  While this seemed to promote some further activity, it would seem that recent media coverage of the homicide review and the intervention of the justice committee have led to the most significant progress to date.<br\/><br\/>Such was our level of concern at certain points of the process that we made attempts to engage with the Policing Authority by telephone or in writing on the following dates in 2017: 3 April; 16 May; 30 June; and 19 July.  As outlined earlier, a report was also prepared on 11 April 2017 for onward transmission to the Policing Authority, but I subsequently discovered on 12 May 2017 that this report had never been sent to the authority.  I do not understand the rationale for this, as there was no sensitive, case specific information included.  On 1 August 2017, I was told by a member of management that the member had been informed by a member of the Policing Authority, over the telephone, about the approaches I had made to the authority.  This was raised with me in the context of management trying to ascertain what my thinking was when I did this.  To date, we have met no one from the Policing Authority regarding the homicide review.<br\/><br\/>Ms Galligan and I are fully committed to doing everything possible to brief and support the newly established working group, which met properly for the first time on 19 February 2018.  We may be about to achieve the full and independent review of death classification and investigation that we have been consistently seeking since November 2016.  However, we still have no formal written direction as to what is required of us into the future or clarity as to how this will be balanced with existing demands.  Most notably, Ms Galligan&rsquo;s original methodology, which was the subject of particular attack, will form the cornerstone of the new working group.<\/p><p>We hope that a multi-agency group will soon be established to address the policy, governance and education aspects of the review as raised in our report of 7 June 2017.  We continue to have serious concerns about what will be done to address misclassification and data quality into 2018.  We are unaware of any current monitoring of the issue and, to our knowledge, no process has yet been agreed in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lois West","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520413200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Ms West for a very comprehensive presentation.

I am a senior crime and policing analyst in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I work within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service, GSAS, and have been attached to special crime operations since June 2016.  From 2012 to 2016, I worked in the position of the senior scientist in the Office of the State Pathologist and had sole responsibility for the management and running of the laboratory, where I performed all histopathological tests on samples from State post mortems performed by the State pathologists.  I also accompanied the forensic pathologists to crime scenes and assisted them in post mortem examinations.  My educational background includes a five-year honours degree in biomedical science and a postgraduate qualification in forensic medicine.  I am currently undertaking a professional certificate in governance.<\/p> <p>  In July 2016, my line manager, Ms West, assigned me responsibility for a ten-year domestic homicide review from 2007 to 2016 as requested by the Garda national protective services bureau.  Ms West had from the outset expressed general concerns about the data quality on the PULSE system.  To prepare for the assessment of how the ten-year review could be undertaken, I carried out an initial overview analysis of information contained on PULSE in regard to the homicide categories.  This involved assessing how easy it would be to recognise a homicide with a domestic element.<\/p> <p>  In September 2016, a meeting was held with the chief superintendent of the Garda national protective services bureau to discuss the action plan of the task.  With prior permission from Ms West, I suggested working in collaboration with the Office of the State Pathologist as, from my previous experience, I was aware the records of that office may contain more information on whether there was a domestic element to the death, which would greatly assist me in undertaking the ten-year review.  The suggestion was very much welcomed by the chief superintendent and other members of the Garda national protective services bureau.<\/p> <p>  I had met the State pathologist, Professor Marie Cassidy, to ascertain her interest in the work and wrote to her on 8 September 2016 requesting an agreement to collaborate data and information to carry out the review between the Office of the State Pathologist and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service.  On 14 September 2016, Professor Cassidy wrote to me to confirm her agreement to the collaboration.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Professor Marie Cassidy, Dr. Linda Mulligan, Dr. Michael Curtis, Dr. Margot Bolster and all staff in the Office of the State Pathologist for accommodating the review as well as the professional support and advice they have continually offered me.<\/p> <p>  I compiled a domestic homicide review proposal which was sent to Ms West and the chief superintendent in the Garda national protective services bureau.  I set out the methodology I would utilise to conduct as comprehensive an analysis as possible and designed a template qualitative data sheet.<\/p> <p>  GSAS produces an internal homicide spreadsheet every month.  I was the analyst responsible for the spreadsheet in September to December, inclusive, in 2016.  In the four months I produced the spreadsheet, I noted the absence of a number of homicides from 2016 which were recorded as non-crime incidents of sudden death.<\/p> <p>  I commenced my analysis at the beginning of October 2016, utilising records from the Office of the State Pathologist, information on PULSE and the homicide spreadsheets produced monthly by GSAS for internal use.  When I reviewed the post mortem report and the circumstances surrounding the death, with consultation with the relevant forensic pathologist if required, I scrutinised PULSE for the recording of the death and other data quality parameters.  For no particular reason, I began with the year 2014 but quickly realised that there were inconsistencies evident with homicide and death classification as well as many data quality issues.  I immediately raised my concerns with my line manager, Ms West.<\/p> <p>  Following a period of three weeks in October 2016 when I was abroad on training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I resumed the homicide review in November 2016.  Ms West asked me specifically to consider a period of three years to ascertain any inconsistencies and the varying issues I had identified.  We decided to conclude with a sample of three years as it was pertinent that the issue be raised with Garda management as soon as possible.   On 24 November 2016, I emailed to GSAS management an 87 page report entitled Comparative Analysis of the Recording and Reporting of Homicide Incidents in the PULSE Database and the Office of the State Pathologist.  It regarded 43 cases I identified within the time period of 2013 to 2015, not all of which were potential homicides.  There were many areas of concern in regard to misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues.  I reviewed 524 deaths in total for that period.<\/p> <p>  There were four main areas of concern: deaths that were pathologically considered to be a homicide but recorded in the incorrect crime category and-or a non-crime category; deaths that were recorded at a later date as a homicide and-or recorded as occurring in the incorrect year; deaths deemed suspicious by virtue of cause of death and in which criminal involvement would be determined by Garda investigation but which were recorded in a non-crime category or no category; and deaths that had varying data quality issues such as the deceased not being marked as such on PULSE, an incorrect \"weapon used\" or date of birth being recorded for the deceased, or the incorrect Garda district or division being recorded for the death.<\/p> <p>  In mid-January 2017, a review group comprising myself, Ms West and officers from policy development, implementation and monitoring, PDIM, was created.  PDIM stated that two of the 43 deaths with which I had raised issue in the report from 2013 to 2015 would not be considered in the review for reasons that cannot be publicly disclosed due to legislative frameworks, and 41 cases were, therefore, the subject of review between PDIM and GSAS.  As mentioned by Ms West, nine meetings were held between January and March 2017 attended by individuals from PDIM, Ms West and me.  Robust discussions were had at the meetings and Ms West and I voiced our concerns at what we deemed a very serious issue of the recording and classification of deaths within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, we were not given the professional respect we deserved and, at times, I felt we were belittled and treated very poorly.  At no stage during the nine meetings was the methodology I utilised questioned by members of PDIM or referred to as weak.<\/p> <p>  During those months, I began interrogating the PULSE database to try to determine a little more background on how deaths can be and are recorded in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I identified that there are 16 incident categories on PULSE under which a death could potentially be recorded.  I considered this a significant number of ways to record a death and the categories were extremely varied in their descriptions according to the PULSE creation manual.  I continued to analyse the PULSE database and discovered that there are no identifiable parameters on PULSE for fatal or non-fatal hit-and-run incidents.  On inspection of some fatal hit-and-run incidents, I discovered they were all recorded as traffic collision fatal incidents, which is a non-crime category, but a criminal investigation is initiated from the time of such incident occurring.  I raised these issues among many others during the nine meetings with PDIM but we were quickly told they were not up for discussion and only the 41 cases were to be reviewed.  We felt that the various issues I was identifying were critical to highlighting the facts of misclassification in the recording of all types of deaths.<\/p> <p>  In January 2017, having continued the analysis of deaths in 2012, I wrote an 81 page report on various cases with serious anomalies and sent it to Ms West.  Areas of concern were consistent with the previous report and others identified were: deaths recorded in non-death categories such as missing persons, public order offences and attention and complaints; deaths being counted twice; and deaths not recorded for significant periods of time after they had occurred.  Although this report was completed, PDIM gave strict instructions not to be sent the report as it was not reviewing any more than the 41 cases from the three-year period.<\/p> <p>  Within this timeframe, I identified other issues that I immediately raised to various individuals in management.  I raised an incident of serious concern to the Garda national protective services bureau upon discovering that the partner of a deceased person was in a new domestic violent relationship.  I have since highlighted several such cases to the Garda national protective services bureau and that led to the establishment of Operation Devise, in which I have been involved.  I highlighted an incident that I had discussed with the chief superintendent in the Garda national protective services bureau which was recorded as a non-crime incident but was a domestic murder-suicide incident.  Following inquiries with the relevant division by the chief superintendent, the incident was appropriately reclassified that evening.<\/p> <p>  In February, I had a routine meeting with my manager, Ms West, during which I expressed my concerns at GSAS continuing to produce the monthly homicide spreadsheet in view of our being unable to guarantee the accuracy of PULSE.  It was agreed with Ms West that I would review January 2017, in collaboration with Professor Marie Cassidy and the Office of the State Pathologist, to compare the cases carried out and the corresponding PULSE incident recorded.  In March 2017, I wrote a report entitled Data Quality Issues with Death Classification 2017 which was sent to management.  There were many areas of concern in terms of misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues.<\/p><p>There were three unrecorded homicides as of the end of February 2017.  One of the unrecorded homicides was raised at a senior leadership meeting the next day.  It still remained recorded incorrectly for a further six months, despite being highlighted numerous times.  There were cases with the following concerns: homicides misclassified; suicides misclassified; hit-and-run incidents recorded as non-crime traffic fatal incidents; suspicious deaths under sudden death classification; and natural deaths containing PULSE data quality issue.<br\/><br\/>At the end of April 2017, I was extremely surprised when it was announced in the media that the review into homicides was complete, and the conclusion was that there were only &quot;minor misclassifications&quot;.  It was at the public Policing Authority meeting on 27 April that we became aware that the review team had written a report.  Neither Ms West nor I, as part of the review team, had any input nor were our views taken into consideration in the drafting of the report.  On receipt of the report on 8 May, it became immediately clear why the report was not shared with us.  On reading of the report, I felt very personally insulted by the commentary regarding my work and my methodology.  As previously mentioned, at no stage during the nine meetings was any criticism voiced regarding the inappropriateness of my methodology.  It had now been concluded that the methodology I had utilised in comparing the records of the OSP and the PULSE system was &quot;inherently weak&quot;, &quot;inappropriate&quot;, &quot;confined&quot; and &quot;restricted&quot;.  The days between 8 and 10 May were troublesome, in that PDIM brought significant pressures to sign off on the report that we had only just received.  Like Ms West, I professionally and ethically could not agree to a report I knew was completely inaccurate and misleading.  I remained assured that there were homicides misclassified and incorrectly recorded.<br\/><br\/>In May 2017, I wrote a report entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017: PULSE Categorisation &amp;amp; Office of the State Pathologist Categorisation, which was sent to management.  There were many areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, such as 33 homicides recorded as of May 2017, three of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; six unrecorded homicides recorded as follows: non-crime incidents of person misadventure - sudden death; non-fatal incidents of assault causing harm; and non-fatal incidents of discharging a firearm.  There were a number of fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents in 2017, all of which are unidentifiable in the recording on PULSE.  These incidents are routinely recorded as a non-crime incident of traffic - traffic collision FATAL when a criminal investigation is ongoing.  In the email sending this report, I stated:<\/p><blockquote>There are many victims going unnoticed by this organisation the longer this goes on.  When these cases are being recorded as a non-crime category of Sudden Death or even Discharging a Firearm, is there any follow up with the victim&rsquo;s family or liaison with a FLO.  Is there even a FLO being assigned?  The deceased victims have not been given the respect and duty of investigation into their deaths that they deserve.  Sadly, the majority of 2017 homicides are of a domestic nature, again going unreported. <br \/><br \/>This is 2017 in four months 2013 to 2015 we are now satisfied that PDIM have reviewed, but see nothing but &lsquo;minor inaccuracies&rsquo;, which is completely incorrect.  I am not going to lose my work ethic or determination over this, and one didn&rsquo;t build Rome in a day.  However, I cannot continue to identify incidents of homicide as we continue in 2017 that are not recorded correctly or not knowing whether there is an adequate investigation being carried out into that person&rsquo;s death.<\/blockquote><p>In June 2017, I wrote a report entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017 &ndash; Month Ending May 2017, which was sent directly to senior Garda management.  There were the same areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, as well as new cases emerging that had issues, such as 18 homicides recorded as of May 2017, three of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; six unrecorded homicides, still unchanged from previous report; ten suspicious deaths being recorded under a non-crime classification, although a criminal investigation was initiated; and a number of fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents in 2017, all of which were recorded as a non-crime incident of traffic - traffic collision FATAL.<br\/><br\/>In July 2017, I wrote a report entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017 &ndash; Month Ending June 2017, which was sent directly to senior Garda management again.  There were the same areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, as well as new cases emerging that had issues, such as 20 homicides recorded as of May 2017, three of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; nine unrecorded homicides recorded in non-crime or a non-fatal crime incident type; ten suspicious deaths being recorded under a non-crime classification, although a criminal investigation was initiated; and a number of fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents in 2017 recorded as a non-crime incident of traffic collision FATAL, when a criminal investigation was ongoing.<br\/><br\/>In August 2017, I wrote a report entitled Traffic: Dangerous Driving Causing Death Incidents: PULSE Categorisation analysis 2003-2017, which was sent to management.  There were many areas of concern in the recording of the dangerous driving death incident type over the years 2003 to 2017.<br\/><br\/>I also wrote a report in August 2017 entitled Review of 2006 Homicides &ndash; Murder and Manslaughter: PULSE Categorisation Analysis, and sent this to GSAS management for onward transmission.  This was an overview document regarding the adherence to crime counting rule 3.1 in 2006.  As per headquarters directive 139\/03, section 3.1 states, &quot;A reclassification within homicide occurs where a murder is reclassified to manslaughter when a charge of manslaughter commences or when a murder charge results in a conviction for manslaughter&quot;.  This review analysed conviction records and detection status for all homicide incidents as well.<br\/><br\/>In October 2017, I wrote two reports entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017 &ndash; Month Ending September 2017, and An Analysis of Death Incidents &ndash; September 2017, which were sent directly to senior management.  There were the same areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, as well as new cases emerging that had issues such as 37 homicides recorded as of May 2017, seven of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; six unrecorded homicides recorded in non-crime or a non-fatal crime incident type - a number of the previous highlighted misclassified homicides had been reclassified to a homicide so there were new homicides; 11 suspicious deaths being recorded under a non-crime classification although a criminal investigation was initiated; and six fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents recorded in 2017 as a non-crime incident of traffic collision FATAL.  I also had queries as to why in some deaths with concerning details the State Pathologist was not requested when a crime scene was held at the death.  There were deaths that should be classified as suicide or that had a suicide incident recorded which resulted in double counting of the death, according to the detail in the narrative.  There were varying data quality issues.<br\/><br\/>In November 2017, I wrote a report entitled Homicide and Suspicious Death Incidents 2017 &ndash; Month Ending October 2017, which was sent to management.  There were the same areas of concern continuing in misclassification, under-reporting, over-reporting, delay in recording, and data quality issues, as well as new cases emerging that had issues, such as 40 homicides recorded as of October 2017, seven of which did not occur in 2017 but would be counted by the CSO; five unrecorded homicides, recorded in non-crime or a non-fatal crime incident type; 13 suspicious deaths being recorded under a non-crime incident, although a criminal investigation was initiated; a number of fatal hit-and-run traffic incidents in 2017 recorded as the non-crime incident of traffic collision FATAL; 18 dangerous driving causing death incidents recorded for 2017, four of which did not occur in 2017, one had been invalidated, and one had three fatalities but only one crime incident when there should have been one for each victim; and 95 deaths in October with varying types of data quality issues.<br\/><br\/>I have continued to highlight to the current day cases that I believe are of concern in areas of homicide, traffic fatal incidents, suicide, sudden death and, indeed, homicide attempts.  The classification of death incidents on PULSE requires an urgent review and needs to be simplified.  The review of the classification comparing PULSE and the OSP is based on the pathological classification, but the ultimate arbitrator of the classification of death is the coroner.  Unfortunately, coroners do not publish statistics.  I have been directed to complete a review of all files in the OSP between 2003 and 2017, totalling more than 3,000 deaths, for classification purposes and investigation review using the methodology from the initial review.I will endeavour to complete this as quickly as is possible and also to complete the requested domestic homicide review that was initially requested by the Garda national protective services bureau.  I will continually strive as an analyst in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure every death is recorded correctly, not just for statistical purposes but mainly for the victims and their families.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before committee to provide clarity and context to the work that we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Galligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520413200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Galligan.

As analysts, we are scientists who use data and these are the fields we would use to try to aggregate data to be able to look at particular trends.<\/p> <p>  It has always been difficult for us to do any kind of quality reporting in respect of hate crime and domestic incidents for that reason.  It becomes a very manual process where an analyst actually has to go in and trawl through what is called the PULSE narrative.  A small amount of information is entered into the PULSE narrative about the incident.  Sometimes it might say in there that it is a domestic incident, for example, a husband and a wife.  However, that does not translate into the motivating factor being ticked for domestic and that is really the way the figures are compiled.  That is a big problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#J01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Lois West"},{"type":"speech","time":1520413200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#J02000","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1520413200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Chambers.

It spans very many different areas, from being able to ascertain our crime levels to the deployment of resources, for example.  In this particular work, we were concerned whether, if the incidents were not being captured correctly on the PULSE system as homicide, there were other issues.  Certainly with regard to some incidents, we did begin to raise some concerns that the investigations perhaps needed to be reviewed, just to be on the safe side.<\/p> <p>  As I said to Deputy Chambers, there is a very significant issue when complete and accurate data are not entered on the PULSE system.  We, as analysts trying to use the data at the other end, cannot give a robust and complete analysis if we do not have accurate and complete data.  It becomes very concerning for me in regard to areas such as domestic abuse.  Deputy Clare Daly raised this a couple of weeks ago.  Any research done on domestic abuse points to there being an escalation in incidents in the types of scenarios in question.  Therefore, it is essential to capture even the smallest of incidents where garda&iacute; are called out to a property and where there may be nothing to see there at the time.  It may, however, be the beginning of a pattern or escalation.  In order to be able to protect vulnerable citizens in their own homes across this country, we need to be able to identify where there is an escalation with regard to this type of incident.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Lois West"},{"type":"speech","time":1520413200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>When the data are not accurate, it deprives members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of access to the relevant history pertaining to a potential suspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#K00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520413200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Yes, it does.

I want to pay particular tribute to our witnesses, as clearly enormous pressure and stress was placed on them and I am grateful to them for coming before the committee.<\/p><p>Ms West's statement referred to a phone call on 12 May.  At this committee's last meeting which discussed this issue with Garda management, there was much discussion about the April meeting of the Policing Authority.  That is significant because it was the first time that this was properly discussed in a public forum.  On that occasion the impression was falsely given that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a whole was satisfied with the report, as was the review group.  Ms West has since put on the record that that was not the case, as did Dr. Singh some weeks ago.  However, the explanation given to the committee at that meeting three weeks ago was very much to the effect that it was something of an oversight.  In this regard, Mr. Michael Finn remarked:<\/p><blockquote>I accept that concerns were raised about this.  In the report presented to the Policing Authority in April somebody had reviewed the investigations and clarified that an investigation had been carried out in each of the 41 incidents.  The error, however, was made in that we did not sit down with the analysts and raise or surface the issue of whether the investigations had all been properly classified.<\/blockquote> <p>To a great extent it was presented as an error or oversight.  In the context of this phone call, it is quite clear that the concerns which Ms West and Ms Galligan raised in their report had been discussed among senior garda personnel at a meeting on 13 April, prior to that meeting.  In that context, do the witnesses think it is credible that it was simply an oversight that they themselves were not consulted prior to the report being presented to the policing authority?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#N00100","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520413200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I am not sure I could conclude that it was just an oversight.

It followed on from some media coverage on 1 April which had created an interest in the review.  Ms Galligan was in a meeting that morning, so I pulled together some of the documentation we already had.  It was all at a very high level with no case-sensitive information; we never would have discussed case-sensitive information outside of the appropriate forums.  I included some more up-to-date information about where we were in the review and did a synopsis of the very high-level data quality issues we were finding.  The Policing Authority had requested that report by return on 11 April so I dutifully did the report and sent it up through the chain of command.  The next day I queried whether the report had gone and was told that it had not gone yet but it would go now.  There is a Policing Authority liaison office through which everything destined for the authority goes.  That is for the necessary protections in relation to data, freedom of information and so on.  I had no real reason subsequent to that to think that the report would not have gone to the Policing Authority.<\/p> <p>  There seemed to be some concern over that report.  I am not sure what the concerns were.  My understanding would be that there was perhaps a pre-meeting on 12 April to a private Policing Authority meeting that was due on 13 April.

Later in her statement, Ms Galligan referred to an email relating to her May 2017 report in which she wrote:<\/p><blockquote>The deceased victims have not been given the respect and duty of investigation into their deaths that they deserve. <\/blockquote> <p>Later on, she wrote:<\/p><blockquote>However, I cannot continue to identify incidents of homicide as we continue in 2017 that are not recorded correctly or not knowing whether there is an adequate investigation being carried out into that person&rsquo;s death.<\/blockquote> <p>One of the biggest areas of concern is whether among all the potentially misclassified cases are a number of homicides that were not properly investigated.  That would be the biggest concern for any member of the public listening to this today.  In Ms Galligan's statement, that possibility is raised twice.

I do not want to go into the specifics because I do not want to allude to particular cases but there were certain conversations around policy matters, for example.  A policy cannot be written on the basis of a sample review.  That would be short-sighted because there are nuances in each investigation and there can be differences.  If one writes a policy that suits a particular group of incidents, it may not suit others.  When one is doing something as important as writing policy, it is important that one is cognisant of all the variables when doing that.  It felt at times that there was pressure to rewrite policy there and then as if Ms Galligan and I were the people who had the difficulty with the policy and, therefore, it was incumbent on us to say how we wanted it worded.

There certainly seems to be that misunderstanding around the crime classification.  Ms Galligan and I did work in September with members of PDIM, the policy development, implementation and monitoring, group to put together a more comprehensive clarification of the crime counting rules to try to make the interpretation of them much clearer and easier to follow, so that everybody would be consistently applying the same logic.

There is a culture of making do.  There is a great can do attitude.  Fantastic work goes on in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a lot of that is down to the goodwill of the people who work there and their determination to work very hard to serve the public and to do the best they can, but at times we need to ask for help, whether that is money, external expertise or assistance from other agencies, even others within the Department of Justice and Equality.

When we had the first analysts in in 2008 we hit the ground running.  We have done some exceptional work right from the beginning.  The analysts and the management team in GSAS have always raised a concern about the quality of the data with which we had to work.  When analysts produced a report, they tended to put a section into it outlining the particular data quality issues that were hampering their ability to do a complete and robust analysis.  We have also found that the analysts frequently have to do quite a lot of data cleansing to make the data as workable as possible, which is far from ideal because it is very time-consuming and takes away from the ability to actually do the work.  These concerns have always been raised in these reports, many of which ultimately ended up with senior Garda management, and this issue has been discussed along the way.  I feel there have been many occasions on which we have escalated reports and they may not have got the requisite attention.  That said, I would make a qualification.  We have an exceptionally good working relationship for the most part with the officers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Exceptional support is given to operational work and particular investigations, and we do a lot of work to feed into the formulation of strategies and so on in so far as we can.  For me, this has polarised things quite a lot.  What has happened in this instance is fairly exceptional.  Previous to this, it was perhaps a failure to fully address issues that was raised in reports.

However, I want to go back to the other part of what Ms West said.  It strikes me, listening to the answer she gave - and I do not want to put words into her mouth - that there was effectively a systematic way of disregarding information on the part of management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over these years in that it escalated a matter if it did not like it.  Unfortunately for these members, they got caught this time around in that there are new structures in place - the Policing Authority, etc. - which meant it was not possible for them just to take the stuff and ignore what the analysts were saying.

Therefore, there has been a learning curve over that ten year period, during which officers have become very familiar with our analytical reports and monthly reporting and the various ways in which we can support investigations.  We have also supported the senior investigating officer and detective sergeant training courses.

That could nearly be seen as an optional choice.  What is the difference?  I am sure when they were devised and added to the system, there was a rationale.  Over time the person who asked for that to be added is no longer there and others do not understand why it was added or what it was for.<\/p> <p>  A pattern can be seen where a particular division will be recording in a particular category that no other division really uses.  Again that confuses the issue.  From our point of view, one of the first things that needed to happen was an overhaul of PULSE - to refine that, to simplify and bring down the number of ways a death can be recorded.  As Ms Galligan would say from her professional background, there should really only be four to five categories available for a member or someone in the information services centre to choose from.  As I said earlier, there is a multitude of different reasons these things-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Lois West"},{"type":"speech","time":1520413200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I suppose that is what I am trying to clarify.

Everybody's attention was focusing on that period and the 41 cases but another narrative was running alongside that, which I found particularly frightening.  This related to ongoing concerns the witnesses were attempting to flag.  They said one example involved a deceased person who had been a victim of domestic violence and whose partner was involved in another relationship marked by domestic violence.  They said they subsequently highlighted a number of similar cases.  They described how getting to that stage was like stitching together a patchwork quilt.  From reading that, I conclude that there were people in 2017 who were in danger because of incomplete data.  I put this matter to Assistant Commissioner Finn on the previous occasion on which he was before the committee in terms of that situation and the review that was ongoing.  I specifically asked him whether in the cases of domestic violence death, other incidents of domestic violence on the person's file would be analysed in case there was a missing link so a sign that had been flagged could lead to something being averted.  He told us that a new processes were in place.  I think he said that when Dr. Singh and his team look at the data on domestic violence, they would find that crimes had been classified correctly from the start.  My first question is whether the witnesses found that domestic violence incidents have been correctly classified from the start.  Second, do the witnesses know anything about these new processes Assistant Commissioner Finn told us are in place that will alert the user if the person has been involved in a previous domestic violence incident relating to the person in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#S00800","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520413200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I can answer the first part with regard to the analysis I have already done.

We do not want to cause people panic either but I would suggest that Assistant Commissioner Finn was referring to the victim screen.  A lot of work has been done there in respect of technical fixes to PULSE in order to make the data collection better.  When an incident is recorded now, a victim screen will come up and that will be populated with the detail of the injured party.  I do not think a system exists where it would necessarily flag up when a member or someone in Castlebar went to create an incident.  I do not think any big flag that this has happened before comes up.  We are dependent on the incident being recorded correctly.  We have \"attention and complaints\" and \"domestic dispute with no offence disclosed\" categories.  That domestic dispute with no offence disclosed category was very much created to capture where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is asked to respond to a house because there are reports of a disturbance and garda&iacute; get there and do not find anything but can go in and record the fact that they were called out.  I understand that the victim screen becomes active with domestic dispute with no offence disclosed incidents.  Of course, it would become active if it involved an assault or crime incident as well.  Our difficulty is that there has been a tendency, which I believe to be ongoing, to put some of these incidents in the attention and complaints category.  Therefore, a victim screen would not be activated for that incident.  One could understand how a member would still be recording a call-out to a property as an attention and complaints incident if the awareness is not there of domestic dispute with no offence disclosed.  The victim screen is fairly recent so there would not be that history going back for people who have already been victims of domestic abuse or violence.<\/p> <p>  Again, we come back to the motivating factor as well.  What is supposed to happen if someone is the victim of an assault, be it minor or an assault causing harm?  A box should be ticked to say that this was a domestic incident.  That is the easiest way for us to identify that an incident is of a domestic nature.  Otherwise, we are trawling narratives for many hundreds of assaults in order to try to work out if there is even sufficient detail in the narrative to tell us whether it is a domestic incident.<\/p><p>I still lack confidence in it.  Over time, there have been technical fixes and attempts to put various fixes in place to assist the process but it is still not a complete process.  It is still not one that lends itself to easily identifying an escalation of incidents or people who may be vulnerable.  Ms Galligan has done the best she can in the work she is doing and has liaised very closely with the Garda national protective services bureau.  We referred any cases that Ms Galligan raised as potentially concerning to it.  We felt this was the way they would get the attention they required because that national unit would be able to contact the region, division or district and ensure there was proper attention given which would assist with the proper supports being in place for the vulnerable person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#S01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Lois West","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520413200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Some of the concern is that the witnesses flagged this internally in the organisation.

I have concerns about the structure of posts; the education of members and their understanding of the various crime and non-crime classifications; and the ability of the data quality unit within the Garda information services centre, GISC, to be able to identify where something has been misclassified.  In the course of this year it is intended that the Garda information services centre will be responsible for determining the classification of incidents.  We should get away from the issue we have had where there is a debate about what the incident is between the member and the person in the information services centre inputting the incident.  I hope that if a member makes contact with GISC and says he or she wants to record an incident as \"attention and complaint\" but it is clear to the person taking the call that it is actually a domestic assault, it will go in as a domestic assault.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Lois West"},{"type":"speech","time":1520413200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>In terms of the PDIM group that was set up and the nine meetings that were had, who was the highest level member there?

We were looking for others to come on board with us to get that consensus view as to whether there were issues.

Myself and my colleague will get a phone call asking for analytical support for the investigation.  We have become nearly indispensable to supporting those investigations.  From that point of view, it is clearly recognised that analysts add value to investigations.  It is irrelevant that one is not actually an investigator because everybody has a different expertise and value to bring to an investigation.  My concern with this was as follows.  We recognised early on that we did not have access to the investigation files, and we never claimed to have had that access.  We were concerned, when we saw report on 8 May, that it, perhaps, was not representative of the fact that we had always said, \"Look, we have this and this but we do not have the investigations files.\"  The report was also misleading in that it kind of focused on those being the two solo sources of information that Ms Galligan had when she compiled her report.  In effect, she had access to other information such as coroners' findings and so on either because they were recorded on PULSE or she did a lot of open-source research around these to try to  ascertain information that she could not glean from the PULSE system.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that 15 months have elapsed since Ms Galligan produced the first report in November 2016 and we still have not seen the investigation files, nor have the members of PDIM  seen all of the files.  There may have some requested to clarify particular information.  As of this point, there has not been an independent review of those investigation files.

It is very much a rank-driven organisation, and when an instruction is given by someone in authority , it is followed.  The difference in this scenario is that we did not follow such instruction but, rather, stood firm because we so strongly believed in what we were fighting for.  By virtue of the value systems with which we were raised, we know how to behave ethically, which is what we have done throughout this process.

Certainly, Deputy Clare Daly and Senator Black will concur with me that, on the eve on International Women's Day, Ms West and Ms Galligan are a powerful duo and a credit to their gender and an example to us all, men and women alike, in public service.<\/p><p>I am delighted that we had the opportunity to host the delegates today.  The picture I see is one where denial and obstruction have come into play.  We see a culture that does not want to expose the fault lines at any cost and attention to this or that must be suppressed.  When we had the senior garda&iacute; with us, three weeks back I think, we were assured all 41 cases - I note the figure of 43, but 41 had specifically been pointed to between 2013 and 2015 - had been investigated.  Those who presented were at pains to emphasise that point.  It is a reasonable question to ask whether these cases, or even some of them - even one would be one too many - were appropriately investigated.  It is the key question.  We do not doubt that they have been investigated.  However, the word \"appropriate\" is very important.  We have all noted different reports where a suspicious death, or whatever else, has been reported on the news.  RT&Eacute; and other broadcast and print media will then report that the investigation has been upgraded to a murder investigation.  The word \"upgraded\" has always stuck in my memory and it is the language used.  I have always taken and believe I am right in saying the word \"upgrading\" not only as underscoring the tragedy of what has happened but also as reflective of the upgrading of the process of investigation to meet the needs of the particular case.  Do Ms West concur that that is the key focus?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#X02500","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520413200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  It is one of the fundamental issues on which Ms Galligan and I have been arguing.  Our view is that if a scene is attended to and there is any possibility a person has met with foul play or there are suspicious circumstances, it should, first and foremost, be entered on the PULSE system as a homicide.  I am not sure if there are particular difficulties of which I am not aware that would lead to this not happening.  However, it seems logical to me that the investigation start high and work back.  That would also give confidence to families and the public that absolutely everything was being done within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate such cases.  I agree that there is an absolute difference between an investigation and a full, proper and complete investigation.  I know that the media have picked up on this and want to clarify the position because we do not want scaremongering and the causing of unnecessary concern.  What we always asked for was a full and independent review in order that we would be able to give confirmed assurance that everything was as it should be.  There is no doubt that in the course of our work we did raise questions.  Some have been answered and I am sure some will be as the review process moves into the next phase.  However, I want to get away from the idea of crimes not being fully investigated.  We want to get to a position where we can give assurance that we are satisfied everything is exactly as it should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018030700002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lois West"},{"type":"speech","time":1520413200,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I refer to the newly established working group, towards which the delegates have indicated some positiveness and good hope that things will transpire as they wish them to be.
