Employment rose by 61,000 during 2013, which represents a year-on-year increase of 3.3%. The Government&rsquo;s primary support for activation is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  This strategy is working. <\/p><p>Contrary to the impression given in the question that long-term unemployment has been increasing, it has in fact been doing the exact opposite. Long term unemployment, as measured by the QNHS, has fallen from 196,000 at the end of 2011 to 155,000 at the end of 2013, a decline of over 40,000 in less than two years. As a result the long-term unemployment rate had fallen to 7.2% down from a peak of over 9%.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, despite the progress that has been made, the Government recognises that the both overall unemployment and long-term unemployment remain unacceptably high. Hence, the Government also recognises the need for additional activation measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work <\/i>strategy which is being led by my Department.<\/p><p>As one example of the impact of the strategy, <i>Pathways<\/i>set a target of moving 75,000 of the 180,800 people who were on the Live Register for over a year (long-term unemployed) at the beginning of 2012, into employment by the end of 2015. By the end of February this year, over 45,000 of this group had already moved into employment, 13,000 of whom had taken up part-time employment.<\/p><p><i>Pathways to Work<\/i>includes a wide range of programmes and services to help jobseekers back to employment. I will be making a table available to Deputies which sets out the level of provision on programmes for 2014, indicating also which programmes are particularly targeted at the long-term unemployed. These include programmes such as JobsBridge, JobsPlus and Momentum introduced by this Government and schemes such as Community Employment and T&Uacute;S where we have significantly increased the number of places available. <\/p><p>Furthermore, the Government is putting particular focus on tackling youth unemployment. A cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to get young people into jobs will be the implementation of the Youth Guarantee which was agreed by the EU during the Irish presidency and which will ensure that young people are prioritised for support on the pathway back to employment. This objective is to be achieved, over time, by fastracking Intreo engagement with newly unemployed young people, by allocating extra places on schemes such as T&Uacute;S, Momentum and JobBridge for young people and by reducing the qualifying time for access to JobsPlus for young people.  The Youth Guarantee is already being piloted in Ballymun involving a partnership of key national and local stakeholders. The findings from this pilot, which is being mainly funded by the European Commission, will feed into the national rollout of the Guarantee. <\/p><p>In summary, Pathways to Work sets out a strategy for the full rollout of a radically reformed public employment service by 2015.  I am happy to say that we are currently on target to meet this goal.<\/p><p><b>Table:  Expected participation in activation programmes, 2014<\/b><table><tr><th>Programme<\/th><th><div>Average participation<\/div><\/th><th><div>Inflow of new participants<\/div><\/th><th><div>Aimed at Long Term Unemployed ?<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Youthreach\/CTC<\/td><td><div>6,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,300<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including planned reserve)<\/td><td><div>7,700<\/div><\/td><td><div>13,300<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s<\/td><td><div>7,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>7,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>Yes<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobsPlus<\/td><td><div>4,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>Yes<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Momentum<\/td><td><div>6,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>6,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>Yes<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)<\/td><td><div>18,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>9,300<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTWEA<\/td><td><div>11,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>Yes<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>VTOS<\/td><td><div>5,600<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,800<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FAS\/Solas<\/td><td><div>10,300<\/div><\/td><td><div>25,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>40% target<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports<\/td><td><\/td><td><div>700<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CEB\/MFI micro-loans for young people<\/td><td><\/td><td><div>150<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training<\/td><td><div>250<\/div><\/td><td><div>250<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gateway<\/td><td><div>3,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>Yes<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Employment<\/td><td><div>25,300<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,700<\/div><\/td><td><div>Yes<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><div>105,650<\/div><\/td><td><div>92,000<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600068#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Question No. 10 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Question No. 11 answered with Question No. 9.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Placements","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB00250"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[17733\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she is concerned at the failure of 40% of those who take an internship through JobBridge to secure full-time employment on completing that internship; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

An evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns who finish placements secure employment within five months.  These progression outcomes compare very favourably to those elsewhere in Europe which tend to be at around 30%.<\/p><p>  Accordingly I am very satisfied with the performance of JobBridge.  As at 10th April, 2014, 27,781 internship placements had commenced with over 6,600 participants in active internships and 2,482 internship posts advertised and available on the JobBridge website.  The total cost to the Exchequer of the top-up allowances paid to-date is &euro;29.3 million.<\/p><p>  I believe that this performance is due, at least in part, to the voluntary nature of the relationship between the host organisation and the intern.  A key feature of the scheme is that interns select and apply for internships which they themselves identify from the internships offered by employers.  In this way the internship is designed to be as close as possible to a real employment situation.  In addition host organisations must provide meaningful work experience to interns, commit to a standard agreement detailing expected learning outcomes for the intern, provide mentoring to each intern, submit monthly reports to the Department and, at the end of the internship, complete an evaluation questionnaire and provide each intern with a reference.  All of these factors taken together contribute to the high rates of progression of interns into employment.<\/p><p>  Even in those instances where interns are unable to move directly into employment from a JobBridge internship, the independent evaluation found that interns gain valuable skills and real-workplace experience through JobBridge and that participants themselves found that the scheme boosted their self-confidence and helped to establish useful labour market contacts and networks.  It is therefore a scheme which I am proud to have introduced and one which I would commend to all jobseekers and employers.<\/p><p>  As a further incentive to employers to take on people who are long-term unemployed I have recently launched JobsPlus.  Approved employers may qualify for up  &euro;10,000 cashback for recruiting a person who has been long-term unemployed. This cashback is paid in the form of monthly payments of  &euro;447 per month for each month the jobseeker is in employment for up to 24 months. This is a significant incentive to recruit people who are long term unemployed and I am pleased to report that it is being positively supported by employers with about 2,000 jobseekers, 60% of whom were more than 2 years unemployed, benefitting from the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[17731\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the knock-on repercussions in areas like counties Kildare and Meath where rent supplement cut off levels are exacerbating an already dangerous situation; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that other services of the State are in increasingly high demand as a result of persons not being able to locate suitable accommodation in their areas, in particular homelessness and emergency accommodation services; if her Department has weighed the additional cost of providing these services against the cost of loosening the rent supplement levels and if so, if she will share that data; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[17737\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she has received information to the effect that rent support available to applicants for local authority housing in north Kildare and surrounding area is inadequate to secure accommodation in the current competitive market; if consideration will be given to identification of a formula whereby such applicants can at least source accommodation in the short term or until the housing shortage is alleviated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[17644\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"in view of the severe crisis in securing rental accommodation in the greater Dublin area if a person is in receipt of rent supplement to immediately review the amount and method of paying this allowance.","asker":"1015","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[17712\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"in view of the dramatic rise in rents in urban centres, and in Dublin in particular, when she will review the caps for rent allowance; if she will meet with representatives of the four Dublin local authorities and senior staff from community welfare to discuss the real impact on local authorities and the community welfare service of these rent increases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1005","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 15, 17, 24, 28 and 40 together.<\/p><p>  There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<\/p><p>  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme was introduced in 1977 which provided for the payment of additional supplements, including rent supplement.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients and the maximum rent limits are comprehensively reviewed every 18 months. Following the most recent review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. The purpose of the review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide access to all housing in all areas while ensuring maximum value for money is achieved. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas. <\/p><p>  I am aware of the difficulties facing people in sourcing accommodation and the latest Daft.ie rental report indicates that the number of advertised rental units in Dublin has declined from 6,700 in 2009 to under 1,500 at the end of 2013.  This report also states that rent levels are static in areas outside Dublin, including Cork, Galway and Limerick cities. All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties, particularly in Dublin, which impacts across a number of State services. Increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve this difficulty, due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students. I have no plans to change the revise the maximum rent limits at this time.   <\/p><p>  Department officials administering rent supplement have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential needs. The fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement, of which almost 29,000 are in the Dublin area, 1,908 in Meath and 3,996 in Kildare of which 914 are in North Kildare, shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme in these areas.<\/p><p>  The provision of homeless accommodation services and associated costs is a matter for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. Officials in the Department&rsquo;s community welfare service, including through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit (HPU) and the Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit, work closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless persons to access private rented accommodation. This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports. Officials in the Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department to develop an inter-agency intervention system to identify vulnerable households who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy. I am satisfied with the level of engagement in place between officials from the Department and the local authorities.  <\/p><p>   The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to selected local authorities during the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Payments","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[17650\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600069#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will reverse the cuts to young persons' jobseeker's allowance in view of the EU-wide research report social situation of young people in Europe compiled by Eurofound and in view of the fact that overall social protection spending for the first three months of this year was significantly less than that for which it what had been allocated.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009. Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. This measure aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.<\/p><p>  Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment at a young age can lead to welfare dependency from an early age.  That is why I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  <\/p><p>  The report &ldquo;Social situation of young people in Europe&rdquo; by Eurofound recognises the importance of enhancing the social inclusion of young people who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs).

One of the primary objectives of this strategy is to reduce the number of cash payments where possible.

The Payment Strategy is consistent with wider Government policies. It gives new impetus to the policy first agreed by Government in 2004 to move to a fully electronic payments environment.  It is also grounded in the wider agenda for better public services and more effective e-payments as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan and the eGovernment Strategy 2012-2015.  The Strategy is fully aligned with the objectives of the National Payments Plan which stresses the criticality of moving to electronic payments in order to reduce the exceptionally high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy with its consequential impacts on costs and competitiveness.  In supporting this agenda, the Payment Strategy aims to remove the limits that cash payments impose on clients in terms of making onward financial transactions, availing of cheaper prices online and through electronic payment transfers, and building levels of financial inclusion.  However, I have consistently stressed that those most vulnerable in our society will be protected and that no client will be left without payment if they are not in a position to accept that payment electronically.

In the context of this level of provision, there is a good case to be made to pursue a policy of randomly selecting jobseekers who have been unemployed and not sought to access the range of opportunities provided by the Department and other agencies.  Pathways to Work introduced a new code of rights and responsibilities whereby, in return for welfare support, jobseekers must actively seek employment or engage with employment or training services.  The Social Welfare Acts have been strengthened to provide a number of sanctions if a jobseeker refuses without good cause or fails to avail of any reasonable offer of training or participation in a work placement.

Once I have read the report, I will consider adjusting the Pathways to Work Strategy in light of its findings.  Thus far, most of the targets\/milestones set out in PTW 2013 are either being met or ahead of target.  The key achievements to date are outlined below: A further 26,600 people who had been long-term unemployed at the beginning of 2012 moved into employment in 2013 (exceeding the target of 20,000).  The total number of people from this group who have moved into employment since PTW was launched in 2012 is now over 40,000; 44 Intreo [\"one stop shop\"] offices have been officially opened, with the remaining 16 to launched by the end of this year; Last year, 130,100 unemployed jobseekers attended group engagements, up from 68,600 in 2012.  156,700 people attended initial one-to-one interviews and a further 136,900 follow up one-to one interviews were also completed.  The Department of Social Protection is now offering Group Engagements to all new jobseekers registering with its services; The number of staff deployed on front-line case work duties was doubled at the end of 2013 from c 300 to c 600, leading to an increase in the caseworker\/client ratio from c 1:800 to c 1:400.  The introduction of JobPath, commencing later this year, will further improve this ratio to c 1:200; Every jobseeker client on the Live Register has been profiled to help prioritise and direct interventions.<\/p><p>  With specific reference to youth unemployment, the main strategy of the Government is set out in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan which was launched in January.  Key to our Youth Guarantee is a gradual, targeted approach focusing resources first and foremost on those with the greatest need.  This will include adjustments to the existing engagement process and schemes such as JobBridge and JobsPlus.  These adjustments are designed specifically to address the needs of young people at risk of becoming or remaining long-term unemployed.  As part of the implementation of the Youth Guarantee it is proposed, subject to labour market and economic developments, to review the targeted nature of the Youth Guarantee offer, before the end of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600072#WRE00200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[17645\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600072#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the criteria for the conducting of interviews with unemployed persons to assist them in their job seeking activities; and the safeguards in place to ensure that social welfare recipients are not unduly pressurised or feel intimidated.","asker":"1015","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to providing a professional, inclusive and timely service that is responsive to the needs of its clients, including comprehensive employment support and income support services.

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  Expenditure on FIS for 2014 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;280 million and it is currently paid to some 44,000 families in respect of some 97,000 children.  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.<\/p><p>  However, in the following two circumstances, the weekly rate of FIS can be revised during the year: If a claimant starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks; If a claimant was getting a one-parent family payment and this payment was stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit, then the FIS rate can be reassessed to take account of the loss of their one-parent family payment.<\/p><p>  The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities.  For those who experience a reduction in their income over the course of the year, the rate of payment will be reassessed at the end of the 52 weeks upon renewal of a FIS claim.  <\/p><p>  Creating jobs and reducing unemployment are key challenges facing the Government.  The tax and social protection systems have a part to play by ensuring work is remunerative.  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to develop cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes.  The Group is currently examining the issue of working age supports, including in-work supports such as FIS.

At that time and pending further analysis of the TPPG proposals, I included a much lower savings figure of &euro;250 million in the Budget 2013 arithmetic. That analysis ultimately revealed significant downside risks to the achievement of even this lower level of yield or savings.<\/p><p>  The estimate of the yield from the changes to the SFT regime which I actually announced in Budget 2014 and provided for in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 is &euro;120 million. These changes differ in some respects from those proposed by the TPPG; for example the introduction of age-related valuation factors for the purposes of placing a capital value on Defined Benefit pension rights for SFT purposes which vary with the age at which the pensions are drawn down, thereby improving equity within the regime. They also reflect the requirement, on legal advice, to protect pension rights already accrued at the date of change (i.e. 1 January 2014).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600073#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Resolution Processes","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600073#WRF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[18177\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600073#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in respect of the recent sale of mortgages, by Certus\/Bank of Scotland, to Tanager, if these mortgages will be covered by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears; if Tanager will be subject to the Government's targets on offering sustainable solutions to mortgage holders in arrears of 90 days or more; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>Bank of Scotland plc is authorised in the UK and is providing services into Ireland on a cross border basis.

An additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.  This additional levy will continue to help fund the<i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties.  <\/p><p>The revenues arising to the Exchequer from the levy are, in common with Exchequer revenues generally, not hypothecated to any particular item of expenditure or liability but have been used to help fund the various measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>. <\/p><p>In relation to DB schemes and double insolvencies, agreement has been secured for certain liabilities to be met by the Exchequer, where they arise.  However, it must be stressed that I am not aware of any double insolvencies 'in the pipeline'.  I see this as providing an insurance and it is not expected that there will be a significant draw on contingency funds available.  Rather, the regulatory measures now in place are intended to move underfunded schemes towards an appropriate funding position and further minimise the risk of a requirement to utilise funds raised through the pension levy.  The legislation which I introduced late last year to provide funding in the event of a double insolvency does not provide for the imposition of penalties on the trustees of a scheme in the event of a double insolvency.<\/p><p>You will be aware that I published a 'Report on Pensions Charges' in October 2012.  This is the first comprehensive Government report on this subject.  The purpose of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied to assess whether charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and make recommendations.  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies a number of serious problems.  While the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost free, it is clear that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.  <\/p><p>A Pension Charges Working Group is in place to initiate actions that follow up on the recommendations of the report.  This group comprises the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Board and the Central Bank.   Each has a core role to play in delivering on the recommendations contained in the 'Report on Pension Charges' and work is progressing in this regard.  Improvements in disclosure requirements, including those for pensions, were introduced in the Central Bank&rsquo;s 2012 Consumer Protection Code and these should enhance transparency for those consumers covered by the Code.  There are also various ongoing developments at EU level which should lead to stronger consumer protection over time.  <\/p><p>The imposition of a statutory limit on the amount of fees that a pension fund can charge was not recommended in the report.  The focus of the recommendations is on measures which would increase consumer understanding and provide a better result for the consumer.  The view is that, in principle, it is not good practice to interfere in the price fixing mechanisms of the market, particularly since this could result in unintended consequences which may impact on competition.  However, this will be kept under review with further consideration being given to more stringent options in the future.  <\/p><p>Developments in broader pensions policy needs to be taken into account addressing the issues of pension charges, given that the research clearly identifies the importance of economies of scale in driving down charges.  The proposed introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for all employees may be the most effective way to introduce change and could have a major impact in reducing charges, particularly for those people with small pension funds and reduced pension expectations.  International experience has shown that this type of scheme is extremely successful in providing a simplified and lower cost charging structure and a consistent application across employer.<\/p><p>Last month I announced key appointments to the Pensions Authority and Pensions Council.  These new bodies will strengthen governance of occupational pensions and give consumers greater input into pension provision.  Under the strengthened arrangements, the Pensions Board was renamed the Pensions Authority to better reflect its key role of safeguarding the pensions of occupational pension scheme members and also the provision of information on occupational pensions.  The changes will ensure the system has a far stronger consumer focus, with the Pensions Council there to represent and protect the consumer.  As its first task, I will be asking the Council to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges to tackle excessive fees, and advise me if further actions are needed.<b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600078#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Eligibility","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600079#WRM00150"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[17798\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600079#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to revise the criteria associated with applications for jobseeker's assistance where the applicant has been self-employed; the current application process sees such applications fully means tested with no automatic entitlement to a set period of payment unlike applications from their PAYE counterparts; if she will confirm if she has entered into discussions with ISME in relation to its recent calls for this current method of assessment to be addressed; if she has considered the possibility for self-employed persons or proprietary company directors paying a higher rate of PAYE contributions to ensure they have entitlements to social welfare assistance should their business fail; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.50%).  <\/p><p>  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.  As part of the consultation process the Group invited organisations, stakeholders or individuals who had registered an interest in doing so to make written submissions. Submissions were received from ISME and from the Small Firms Association. <\/p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group also found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  <\/p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  <\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600079#WRM00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":222,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 82 and 83 answered with Question No. 79.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Eligibility","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600079#WRM00550"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[18127\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600079#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the benefits that are available to a person (details supplied) in County Meath who is a full-time carer; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance is a social assistance payment, made to persons who are providing full time care and attention to elderly people or to people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain limits.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <\/p><p>  Following the most recent review of the private rental market undertaken by the Department revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in some areas including Dublin and North Kildare. The purpose of the review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide access to all housing in all areas while ensuring maximum value for money is achieved. <\/p><p>  I am aware of the difficulties facing prospective tenants to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties, particularly in Dublin. Increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve this difficulty and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students. I have no plans to revise the maximum rent limits at this time.   <\/p><p>  The Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department in developing an inter-agency intervention system to identify vulnerable families who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy.

In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  This strategy is working. Employment rose by 61,000 during 2013, which represents a year-on-year increase of 3.3%. The unemployment rate has fallen to 11.8% &ndash; the lowest rate in 5 years &ndash; and is down from a peak of just over 15% in 2011.<\/p><p>Long-term unemployment has fallen from 196,000 at the end of 2011 to 155,000 at the end of 2013, a decline of over 40,000 in less than two years. As a result the long-term unemployment rate had fallen to 7.2% down from a peak of over 9%. Similarly, youth unemployment has also fallen, from 67,700 at the end of 2011 to 48,800 at the end of 2013. As a result the youth unemployment rate had fallen to 24% down from a peak of 33%.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, despite the progress that has been made, the Government recognises that both youth unemployment and long-term unemployment remain unacceptably high. Hence, the Government also recognises the need for additional activation measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee, both of which are being led by my Department.  <\/p><p>Pathways set a target (among others)  of moving 75,000 of the 180,800 people, who were on the Live Register for over a year (long-term unemployed) at the beginning of 2012, into employment by the end of 2015. By the end of February this year, over 45,000 of this group had already moved into employment, 13,000 of whom had taken up part-time employment. <\/p><p>Pathways to Work includes a wide range of programmes and services to help jobseekers back to employment. Below is a table which sets out the level of provision on programmes for 2014, indicating also which programmes are particularly targeted at the long-term unemployed. These include programmes such as JobBridge, JobsPlus and Momentum introduced by this Government and schemes such as Community Employment and T&Uacute;S where we have significantly increased the number of places available. <\/p><p>In summary, Pathways to Work sets out a strategy for the full rollout of a radically reformed public employment service by 2015.  The Government is currently on target to meet this goal.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the unemployment problem is to focus resources on those individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection keeps a detailed breakdown of the profiles of jobseekers. Data on each client&rsquo;s age, past occupation, and his\/her education, is collected at the point of registration for job-seekers&rsquo; payment; these and other relevant data are processed and the probability of exiting the live register is calculated (PEX). This is essentially a predictor of whether or not someone will become long-term unemployed.  The roll-out of the profiling system at the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices implicitly involves age profiling of the long-term unemployed, as age is one of the main determining variables in predicting if someone will become long-term unemployed. As a result, if someone is in an age category that is more likely to experience long-term unemployment, s\/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.  <\/p><p>Summary statistical information on the clients&rsquo; age, duration of unemployment, and last held occupation together with other demographic and regional information is published on the Central Statistics Office website.  <\/p><p>In addition, the Youth Guarantee initiative is specifically aimed at those under 25 who are unemployed with specific targeting of those who are either long-term unemployed or are most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. The implementation of the Guarantee is a medium-term policy of the Irish Government. The guarantee of an offer of training, education or work experience for those aged 18-24 years after a four month period should be implemented on a phased basis. <\/p><p>Starting in 2014, and for completion by the end of 2014, processes and programmes will be progressively rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the Public Employment Services) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months. <\/p><p>During 2014 &ndash; 2015 all long-term unemployed young people under 25 will be engaged by the Public Employment Service and will receive a Youth Guarantee offer if still unemployed after four months of this engagement process commencing. <\/p><p>A breakdown of likely activation places available for 2014 is presented in the table.  The programmes where being long-term unemployed is an eligibility requirement are indicated, as well the expected inflow of young people.<\/p><p>The cost of the Youth Guarantee will be funded, in the first instance, by the Irish Exchequer.  However, it is expected that a number of these programmes will meet ESF eligibility criteria and will be included in the Youth Employment Initiative application for Ireland.

Up to 2009 the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum, whereas in 2012 the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  This has placed considerable pressure on the office.<\/p><p>  Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process to manage this increased workload, reduce backlogs and improve appeals processing times for appellants, while, at the same time, recognising the need to ensure that quality and fairness are not compromised.  An additional 15 Appeals Officers have been assigned to the office over the past three years, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number to 41. In addition, a new operating model has been introduced in the appeals office.  <\/p><p>  These measures have achieved significant improvements. The number of appeals cases processed in 2013 increased by 18%, to over 38,400. The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This overall improvement has continued in 2013 with the processing time reducing to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>  In the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance appeals, the average processing time for an oral hearing reduced from 47.3 weeks in 2010 to 33.5 weeks in 2013 while the average processing time for a summary decision increased slightly from 26.9 weeks to 27.9 weeks.  <\/p><p>  In addition to improvements in processing times, the measures which have been introduced in the appeals office have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in recent years from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress also continues to be made in reducing the number of appeals on hands from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 13,695 at 14 April 2014.<\/p><p>  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals. It is anticipated that with these improvements, the processing times for appeals will continue to improve throughout 2014.<\/p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer and further investigation or medical examination, if deemed necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600081#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":262,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 100 and 101 answered with Question No. 92.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600082#WRP00056"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[18250\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600082#WRP00062","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which the previously self-employed and currently unemployed have been able to access the relevant welfare payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  <\/p><p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may claim means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  <\/p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600082#WRP00068","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600082#WRP00075"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[18251\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600082#WRP00100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which community employment schemes, upskilling or training places are available to those currently on the live register or otherwise available and in need of such schemes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>Community Employment (CE) is an option for those in long-term receipt of jobseeker's payments (for 12 months or more).

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.   <\/p><p>  The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension (contributory) was reduced to 66 years. <\/p><p>  All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Persons aged between 65 and 66 years who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  In the case of a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the job seekers entitlement relating to the second benefit year.  A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseekers assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of job seekers benefit within the past year.<\/p><p>  I was happy to be able to introduce new arrangements in Budget 2014 for older jobseekers, i.e., those aged 62 and over who have left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.

When taking an estate in charge under the terms of this provision, a local authority must take in charge any roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, water mains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.<\/p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of public water services from local authorities to Irish Water. In addition, it provides a mechanism whereby water services infrastructure may be transferred by Ministerial Order to Irish Water. Accordingly, from 1 January 2014, local authorities should continue with the existing taking in charge process under the planning legislation but engage with Irish Water in relation to water services infrastructure such as water mains, water connections and sewers which will subsequently be transferred to Irish Water by Ministerial Order. Contrary to certain misunderstandings that may exist, there is no specific legal impediment to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure by local authorities. The potential to streamline this process for the future is currently under review.<\/p><p>  As stated in Circular Letter PL 21\/13 issued by my Department to planning authorities on 30 December 2013 in the light of the transfer of certain statutory water services functions from local authorities to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014, legislative amendments to further clarify the existing provisions on the taking in charge of housing estates will be made in 2014. As part of this process, my Department will also consider, in consultation with local authorities, whether it is appropriate to make further amendments to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act in relation to the taking in charge provisions generally in the context of the forthcoming Planning Bill, for instance in relation to the time limits for the taking in charge of estates.<\/p><p>  Following the enactment of any amendments to section 180, my Department will issue Guidelines for Planning Authorities in relation to the revised taking in charge provisions and will update the Framework for a Comprehensive Taking in Charge Policy set out in Circular Letter PD 1\/08, issued by my Department to planning authorities in February 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR00750"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[18158\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if contact has been made by his Department with South Dublin County Council in respect of the future local authority accommodation needs in the Tallaght, Dublin 24; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>Housing authorities are responsible for the assessment of social housing need within their administrative areas and for the compilation of strategies and programmes which optimise the delivery of social housing having regard to the resources available across the full range of measures supported by my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP).

Based on the submission received from South Dublin County Council, an allocation of &euro;3.406 million was approved on 11 March in respect of three projects, including the construction of 3 new houses at Belgard Road, Tallaght and 10 houses at Suncroft, Tallaght.<\/p><p>  On Budget Day 2014, I announced details of a new measure with funding of &euro;15 million which will be invested in bringing some 400 vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use. My Department is currently assessing the proposals recently received from local authorities under this programme, including proposals for some 40 houses in South Dublin. I will announce details of the funding allocations as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  I also intend to announce details shortly of the allocations to local authorities under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme for the construction and acquisition of housing for persons with specific categories of need over the 2014-2015 period. Some &euro;35 million is being set aside for this programme which is intended to deliver in the region of 230 new homes.<\/p><p>  My Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) towards bringing suitable NAMA units into social use and to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes. AHB&rsquo;s will also play a key role in the delivery of social housing, particularly, having regard to their capacity to attract external financial investment. It continues to be my objective to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available.<\/p><p>  At the end of February 2014, the Social Housing Leasing Initiative (SHLI) has delivered over 4,700 (4,736) nationally housing units for social housing purposes. Of these, 463 are in the South Dublin County Council area. A further 159 units in South Dublin have been approved for inclusion in SHLI. In addition, repayable capital advances in the form of the Capital A Advanced Leasing Facility (CALF), are available to AHBs to support the acquisition of new units for social housing purposes. Funding of some &euro;3.3 million has been approved by my Department under CALF, to provide social housing in the South Dublin County Council area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Establishment","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[18162\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide full details of public funding from the Exchequer, the National Pensions Reserve Fund or any other sources that have been transferred to Uisce &Eacute;ireann to date; and the projected figures for 2014 onwards.","asker":"1101","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[18163\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to explain the way in which the &euro;490 million from the Local Government Fund diverted to Irish Water will be spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.<\/p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water in 2013 was an integral component of the Government&rsquo;s water sector reform strategy and involves major organisational change, an entirely new funding structure governed by economic regulation, the introduction of domestic water charges based on usage and the roll-out of a national domestic metering programme.<\/p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) had responsibility for most of the deliverables under the Government water sector reform implementation strategy. BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012. They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m, plus &euro;30m contingency, and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources. The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives. In addition, Irish Water has progressed the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT.<\/p><p>  All costs incurred by Irish Water in 2013 were financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), with the exception of a grant of &euro;0.57m for a pilot metering study funded by my Department. No other Exchequer funds or voted Department expenditure was provided to Irish Water in 2013.<\/p><p>  The establishment costs will be included in the overall funding model for Irish Water; accordingly, they will also be examined by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water. I also expect that establishment costs and metering costs will be included in the regulatory asset base for Irish Water.<\/p><p>  In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240m in equity from the Minister for Finance and &euro;486.5m from the Local Government Fund. No funding will be provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from non-domestic water charge revenues of some &euro;190m and from borrowing, which will be the subject of appropriate ministerial consents in due course. The subvention to Irish Water from the Local Government Fund in 2014 will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities; operational costs of providing water services, estimated at just under &euro;730 million, have been removed from the local government sector in 2014. These expenditures were previously met by local authorities from their own resources, non- domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund.<\/p><p>  The level of State subvention to Irish Water from the Fund in 2014 reflects the fact that the costs of operating water services now have to be met by Irish Water and that there will not be revenue from domestic water charges in 2014 as first bills will not issue until 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR01200","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Building Regulations Compliance","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR01250"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[18179\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600084#WRR01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in view of crumbling block work in houses in counties Donegal and Mayo, the remedy he intends to put in place in view of the fact that the National Standards Authority of Ireland was not required to carry out testing for sulphur in quarries.","asker":"1015","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>The Building Regulations 1997 set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings (including houses), extensions to existing buildings as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings and are divided in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M).

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provide for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake this metering programme.<\/p><p>Local authorities are in the final stages of a pre-installation survey of households connected to public water supplies. The survey is providing information to Irish Water on the properties that can be metered. The intention is that a meter will be installed in any household connected to a public water supply where it is technically feasible to do so. Where a suitable boundary box for a water meter has already been installed in a property, this will be identified in the survey. Irish Water has also recently commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. This report was recently submitted to my Department for consideration. Any proposals for the metering of such properties would need to be considered by the Government in the first instance.<\/p><p>It was always anticipated that in the course of installing a meter, pre-existing leaks and other latent defects due to the age or condition of the water pipes would be discovered. Accordingly, where a leak occurs, it is not necessarily the case that it was caused by Irish Water&rsquo;s contractors.  The meter installation programme gives Irish Water a strong starting point for mains rehabilitation by enabling the discovery of pre-existing leaks and helping to target more effective investment in leak repair.  Where a leak is identified on the public water mains, the repairs are undertaken by the local authority, acting as agents for Irish Water, as agreed under the Service Level Agreements. In order to ensure that there was no delay to the metering project and to ensure that no Local Authority was financially disadvantaged by having to redeploy resources, my Department provided funding to contribute towards this expenditure incurred between the start of the metering programme and 31 December 2013. In 2014, the cost of these repairs is part of the operating costs of Irish Water.<\/p><p>Where the leak is identified as being within the boundary of the property (i.e. is identified as being on the customer side of the property) under the 2007 Water Services Act, the repair of the leak has been, and remains, the responsibility of the individual householder. As part of the metering programme, my Department, in conjunction with Irish Water, is currently working on a proposal regarding customer-side leakage, the implementation arrangements for which will have to be worked out with Irish Water.<\/p><p>Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015. The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers. The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services and has indicated that it will be carrying out further public consultations this month . These will include consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties. Further consultations are planned for June 2014 in relation to the water charges plan to be submitted to the CER by Irish Water. Full details of the CER&rsquo;s public consultation plans are available on its website ().<\/p><p>The attendance of Irish Water at the public meeting in question is a matter for Irish Water.

This morning I met with my colleague in the Northern Irish Executive, Minister Mark Durcan to discuss this matter.  While this is a function that is not devolved to the Northern Executive from Westminister, he and his officials are working with us to ensure an appropriate resolution to the difficulties the UK road user levy is creating on our island for hauliers, in particular those from Donegal.  The upgrade of the A5 is expected to bring significant benefits to both economies in the region and I would have concerns that any increased costs levied on Irish operators who are simply transiting Northern Ireland would have a detrimental impact on this economic benefit. \u00a0I will continue to pursue what I believe to be a compelling case for the exemption.<\/p><p>  For the exemption to be effective, it will of course be necessary to also exempt any approach roads that must be used in order to access the A5.  As the Deputy will be aware, the management of road closures on the A5 and the issue of how resulting diversions may affect the administration of the levy are matters entirely for the UK and NI authorities.\u00a0\u00a0The Deputy refers again to the possibility of Irish HGV operators relocating to other jurisdictions. \u00a0While operators are free to make this choice, I believe that when the costs of establishment and the severe limitations imposed by cabotage regulations on operations in Ireland are considered the number of operators who choose to relocate will be limited.  The Deputy will further appreciate and be aware that the Government has made consistent efforts to support the Irish haulage industry.  For example the introduction of the fuel rebate for licensed hauliers was a significant boost for the industry and makes fuelling in Ireland even more attractive for hauliers.  Furthermore, my Department is chairing an inter-departmental working group looking at the issues involved with developing road charging for HGVs in Ireland and this group will be reporting in the\u00a0summer on the feasibility of such.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600093#WRAA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":484,"content":"<p>Question No. 175 answered with Question No. 171.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":485,"content":"<p>Question No. 176 answered with Question No. 170.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coast Guard Services","counter":486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600094#WRBB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[18222\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041600094#WRBB00400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide a total breakdown of spend on Coast Guard equipment and infrastructure for the years 2011, 2012, 2013 in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":488,"content":"<p>The Coast Guard is part of the Irish Maritime Administration in my Department and is responsible for the operation of the marine rescue co-ordination centre in Malin Head and four Volunteer Coast Guard stations in Killybegs, Bunbeg, Mulroy and Greencastle.\u00a0Two significant Coast Guard equipment\/infrastructure projects in County Donegal have been completed in the years the Deputy refers to.<\/p><p>  In 2011 the Malin Head co-ordination centre was extensively renovated, which included construction works and the upgrading of technological equipment costing &euro;152,300.
