This applies at both primary and post primary levels. <\/p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.

Circumstances vary from school to school and from primary to post-primary.

I understand further that the Minister asked the Deputy to provide details of the possible misuse\u00a0and undertook to have the matter examined by\u00a0the Department of Arts, Heritage, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  From an employment rights point of view, Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment protection legislation designed to protect\u00a0employees engaged under different types of employment\u00a0arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 provides that fixed-term employees may not\u00a0be treated less favourably than comparable permanent employees, unless the employer can objectively justify the different treatment.  Less favourable treatment of a worker may\u00a0be objectively\u00a0justified if it is for the\u00a0purpose of achieving a legitimate objective of the employer and such\u00a0treatment is appropriate and necessary for that purpose.  However, any justification offered cannot be connected with the fact that the employee is on a fixed-term contract. <\/p>  <p>  The 2003 Act also establishes a framework to prevent abuses arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.\u00a0 The Act provides that where an employee has been on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the total duration of those contracts may not exceed four years. After this, if the employer wishes to renew the employee&rsquo;s contract, it is deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration\u00a0unless there are objective grounds justifying the renewal of the contract for a fixed term only. <\/p>  <p>  The Unfair Dismissal Act 1977 as amended contains a provision aimed at ensuring that successive temporary contracts are not used in order to avoid that legislation.  It provides that where a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract expires and the individual is re-employed within 3 months, the individual is deemed to have continuous service for the purposes of that Act. <\/p>  <p>  All employers, including those in the film\u00a0industry, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches. Complaints can be made on a single complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website www.workplacerelations.ie.\u00a0 Should the Deputy be aware of specific cases where there are breaches of employment laws\u00a0she\u00a0may wish to contact the WRC directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600059#WRC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[31847\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600059#WRC05400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on whether the refusal of 40 security companies to pay the recent increase set by the ERO for the security industry undermines such orders; the steps she will take to ensure workers receive this increase; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>Deputy as previously advised, the Inspection and Enforcement Services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) monitor employment conditions to ensure compliance with and, where necessary, the enforcement of employment rights legislation. <\/p><p>Prior to 1 June last, SI No. 417 of 2015 Employment Regulation Order (Security Industry Joint Labour Committee) 2015, which came into operation on 1 October 2015 applied in the Security Sector.\u00a0 The following table sets out the detail relating to inspections carried out in the Security Sector between 1 October 2015 and 31 May 2017:<table><tr><th>Security Sector<\/th><th>No. Inspections<\/th><th>No. of Employers in Breach<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Oct-Dec 2015<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017 (to 31 May)<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Employment Regulation Order (Security Industry Joint Labour Committee) 2017 (SI No. 231 of 2017) came into effect from 1 June last and revokes the 2015 Order.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A similar number of inspections will be carried out in the sector this year under the new order as were previously carried out under the 2015 Order.<\/p><p>Employees in the sector who feel that their employment rights have been contravened can make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.

Ireland has a successful track record of competing for, and winning, global foreign direct investment.  One of the key pillars of that success is the growth of the International Financial Services (IFS) sector, in particular over the past 30 years. Ireland is now recognised internationally as a leading global centre for internationally traded financial services.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2015, the Government launched the lFS2020 Strategy, a whole-of-government approach to further driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland.  Implementation of the IFS2020 Strategy and the annual Action Plans is driven by a public sector High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC).  The Minister of State for Financial Services chairs quarterly meetings of the IFS2020 Joint Committee, comprising of members of the public sector HLIC and senior IFS industry representatives.  Brexit is a standing agenda item at these quarterly meetings.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government is keen to maximise on opportunities that arise from Brexit where possible.  The IFS2020 Strategy, the long-term vision for international financial services, was developed and put in place long before the UK decision to leave the EU. \u00a0However, it provides a clear framework to maximise any opportunities that might arise from that decision particularly through the annual Action Plans.  The annual Action Plans enable a tailored response to deal with these challenges and opportunities as they arise.  The IFS2020 Strategy combines long-term strategic thinking with the flexible tools to react to any domestic and international developments occurring over the period.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In January the IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017 was launched, the Action Plan has two sections, the first is a contextual piece in respect of Brexit, and the second section outlines the 40 specific measures to be actioned under the plan and the lead government departments, agencies or industry bodies who lead on each measure. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Also in January, the second annual European Financial Forum was held in Dublin Castle.  The forum, which was hosted by the then Minister of State Eoghan Murphy TD is designed to showcase Ireland's financial services offering to an international audience and highlight the Government's commitment to the development of international financial services in Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The former Minister of State for Financial Services has undertaken a significant number of overseas visits to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment and launch the IFS Ireland banner brand.<\/p>  <p>  The IFS2020 strategy is on track to meet and possibly exceed its job target of 10,000 by 2020.  The first 2 years of the governments IFS 2020 strategy has seen consecutive years of net job gains consisting of approximately 2,500 net job gains in 2015 and 2,000 in 2016.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While some companies have chosen their preferred post Brexit location many others have yet to make a final decision on their post Brexit strategy and associated location choice.  It is anticipated that many of these companies, particularly the large more complex entities requiring extended regulatory lead times will make their decision in the coming weeks and months.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to specify the potential outcome of these companies&rsquo; deliberations as all are closely monitoring the ongoing UK-EU Brexit discussions and with view to assessing the impact on their respective operations in the UK and across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Various state actors including IDA Ireland, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland as a regulator are involved in detailed discussions with numerous companies positioning Ireland as their preferred Brexit location<\/p>  <p>  Over a dozen firms have indicated that Ireland is their preferred choice for their post Brexit operations.  In respect of relocations not every firm will want to make the relocation decision public for commercial and other reasons.

The purpose of the framework was to set a limit on the extent to which the annual costs of PPPs would pre-commit capital funding available to future Governments for investment purposes, in terms of the overall aggregate Exchequer capital allocation projected to be available in any individual year.<\/p>  <p>  The framework applies to the future cost of unitary payment charges in respect of both existing PPPs already in place and new PPPs currently in procurement or planning, together with the up-front Exchequer costs associated with procuring the planned new PPPs.  The current requirement is that, taken together, such future costs in respect of PPPs should not pre-commit more than 10% of the overall aggregate capital funding projected to be available to future Governments in any individual year.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a mid-term review of the Capital Plan is currently underway, the findings of which will ultimately help Government to put in place a new long term Capital Plan which is consistent with the new National Planning Framework to be published later this year. <\/p>  <p>  In that context, Government needs to formulate a strategic view on the extent to which PPPs should be used to assist in delivering additional infrastructure, to complement that provided directly with Exchequer funding. <\/p>  <p>  With that in mind, I asked my Department to review our experience of using PPPs and to advise on the scope for further use of this procurement option in the context of the Government's capital investment plans. <\/p>  <p>  A senior level group has been established to assist my Department in this regard, comprising relevant officials from the Departments with experience of procuring projects by PPP, together with the Department of Finance, the National Development Finance Agency and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.

The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.<\/p>  <p>  Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.\u00a0 In this regard applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the award of a public works contract, the successful applicant is also required to produce a current Tax Clearance Certificate from the Revenue Commissioners. \u00a0Under our national rules, any non-resident contractor being awarded a public contract must provide a Tax Clearance Certificate issued by Revenue confirming that the firm&rsquo;s tax affairs are in order and that it has complied with its tax obligations in this jurisdiction. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0that non-resident contractors are obliged to register for and pay relevant taxes for activities carried out in the State. This includes Value Added Tax, Relevant Contracts Tax, Employers PAYE and, depending on the circumstances, Income Tax or Corporation Tax.<\/p>  <p>  - VAT - all non-resident principal contractors\u00a0(individuals, partnerships and companies) who are engaged in Relevant Contracts in the construction industry in the State must register for VAT and account for VAT under the VAT reverse charge rule. \u00a0Contractors based in Northern Ireland do not have any advantages over contractors based in Ireland. \u00a0Full VAT recovery applies to all purchases wherever sourced and VAT is charged and accounted for on their supplies in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  - Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) applies to payments to subcontractors on construction, operations carried out within the State. \u00a0RCT applies irrespective of whether the Principal or subcontractor or both are resident outside the State. If the work is being carried out in the State, RCT must be operated.<\/p>  <p>  - Employers PAYE - all employers, including non-resident employers, must register for PAYE as an employer and operate PAYE\/PRSI\/USC in respect of income attributable to the performance in the State of an employment.<\/p>  <p>  - Income Tax\/Corporation Tax - a non-resident contractor which has a permanent establishment which lasts for more than 6 months is liable for Income Tax if a sole trader or Corporation Tax if a company, on the profits arising from the Permanent Establishment.\u00a0 Under Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreements the term &ldquo;Permanent Establishment&rdquo; expressly includes a building site or construction or installation project.<\/p>  <p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.\u00a0 It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.<\/p>  <p>  Once awarded, the conditions of the public works contracts require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.\u00a0 Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site.<\/p>  <p>  Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.<\/p>  <p>  Enforcement of tax, social welfare and employment law are matters for the relevant State authorities.<\/p>  <p>  All contractors in assessing the viability of a particular contract have to consider their input costs, these include such things as proximity to the works site, availability of skilled labour and material, etc.\u00a0\u00a0 Exchange rate fluctuation is a risk to be considered when tendering for contracts where payments are to be made in a different currency.\u00a0 Since both domestic and Northern Ireland (N.I.) contractors can source materials in either jurisdiction they are equally able to exploit currency fluctuations to their advantage.\u00a0 Therefore domestic contractors are not necessarily at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis the cost of materials. <\/p>  <p>  Competition can work both ways and it is also important to remember that open tendering is a two-way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. The public procurement market in the European Union is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;1.94 trillion per annum. The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad. EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600061#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Centres","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600061#WRE02800"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[31858\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600061#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will consider reopening the Kiltyclogher heritage centre (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>The Heritage Centre facility at Kiltyclogher is a locally-run initiative and the Office of Public Works has no responsibility for, or involvement in, its management.<\/p><p>The OPW has made funding available to the Centre in 2016 to support a local guide service to the nearby Sean Mac Dhiarmada Homestead and a similar arrangement is available again, if required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600061#WRE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600061#WRE03100"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[31983\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600061#WRE03200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to publish the IMF report on infrastructure provision here; when he expects the report to be completed; the terms of reference for the report; if it considers the role of private capital and PPPs; the cost of commissioning this report; the reason for choosing the IMF to carry out such a report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy's question refers to\u00a0the Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) which is being carried out by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in\u00a0July.\u00a0 The possibility of undertaking a PIMA study was raised with me by the IMF during my visit to Washington\u00a0earlier this year, in the context of a discussion\u00a0on\u00a0capital planning in Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  An IMF PIMA evaluates the design and effectiveness of the institutions that shape decision-making at the three key stages of the public investment cycle: planning investment; allocating investment to the right sectors; and implementing investment.\u00a0 The IMF have carried out 17 such assessments to date which are available on the IMFs website www.imf.org.

The L1 (Language 1, in Irish, Teanga 1) specification is targeted at students in Irish-medium schools and students in English-medium schools who learn one or more subjects (apart from Irish) through the medium of Irish.  The L2 (Language 2, Teanga 2)\u00a0specification is targeted at other students in English-medium schools. \u00a0<\/p><p>The new Junior Cycle specifications for Irish (both L1 and L2) have a strong emphasis on oral language. \u00a0This is particularly highlighted in the main strand of the specifications &ndash; Communicative Competence.  This strand places an enhanced emphasis on Irish as the language of learning and communication in classrooms as well as an emphasis on the skills required to communicate effectively with other users of the language.  Communication, opportunities for use and interaction are central to classroom tasks.<\/p><p>A different type of assessment methodology for oral language skills (and other skills) will be used in the new Junior Cycle Irish specification.  Up to now, there was an<b><\/b>optiona<b>l<\/b>oral language test, taken by a minority of students, and generally assessed by their teachers as part of the old Junior Certificate examination.  Now, as part of the new Junior Cycle Irish specifications, the oral language skills of all students will be formally assessed.  This will be done by means of Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs) which will be reported\u00a0by schools\u00a0to parents at the end of third year in the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA).\u00a0 This emphasis on oral language will ensure students are prepared to undertake the Senior Cycle Programme. <\/p><p>The assessment of oral language skills will no longer be optional.  I am satisfied that the new approach ensures that all students will now have the opportunity to benefit from the experience and the value of participating in the assessment of their oral language skills.  Unlike the current reporting format in which candidates receive one overall grade based on their achievement in Irish in the Junior Certificate, whether they undertake the optional oral or not, the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement will allow students&rsquo; achievement in the CBAs to be recorded independently of the result in the state-certified examination.  This experience should lead to more motivated, confident and independent language learners and users as they embark on the study of Irish in senior cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600061#WRE06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Assessments","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600062#WRF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[31867\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600062#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide access to a child psychologist for a person (details supplied) in County Cork with special needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychology service to all primary and post-primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about his

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. <\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties . Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

The survey showed that teachers and schools are positively disposed to using ICT and are reasonably well resourced in that regard but there remains some challenges in the areas of connectivity at primary level and in training and development.  The four Themes emerged as a roadmap for the embedding of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment.<\/p><p>The implementation of the Strategy is currently underway. A detailed Action Plan for 2017 was recently launched, based on the objectives outlined in the Digital Strategy.  Timelines and lead responsibility have been assigned. Progress on implementation will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and an end of year 2017 progress report will be published.  The Action Plan is available on my Department's website at: .  The Plan for 2017 has some key elements:<\/p><p>- The scoping of an innovative clustering model across the country to innovate, harness good practice and create pathways for accelerated collaborative innovation by schools<\/p><p>- A programme of curriculum reforms will see ICT embedded in all emerging curricular specifications and intense preparation for the phased introduction of Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject option from 2018 <\/p><p>- The localization of the UNESCO ICT Competency Framework though the development of a Digital Learning Framework that will give clarity to teachers and schools around the concept of embedding ICT into teaching, learning and assessment.  This Framework will help schools and teachers to identify training needs that can be targeted  by my Department and its Support Services.  The Framework will be made available to all schools from September 2017.<\/p><p>- Provide information to teachers on innovative ways to use digital technologies more actively in their own teaching, including exemplars of good practice, and facilitating the sharing of such practices amongst teachers.<\/p><p>- All professional development supports provided by my Department's Support Services will embed digital technologies and constructivism both in design, development and delivery<\/p><p>Funding of &euro;210m has been committed towards the implementation of the Digital Strategy.  The first tranche of this funding, &euro;30m,  issued earlier this year to some 3,158 primary and special schools and 666 post primary schools for the upgrade of ICT infrastructure.  The need to provide funding for this purpose was highlighted in the Census analysis.  The criteria for funding provides that each school is expected to draw up an eLearning Plan using a whole school approach and taking account of its context and circumstances.  The Plan will outline the vision of the school for the embedding of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment and incorporates targets and priorities for improvement and development. <\/p><p>Presently, all schools in the country are offered a broadband internet connection to promote and facilitate the use of eLearning Technology.  There is a vast array of internet-based digital tools in use in classrooms, including Interactive Whiteboards, laptops, desktop computers, projectors, tablet computers, software packages and apps, visualisation and mapping tools, digital content and resources. <\/p><p>The decision on which digital tool to use to best support teaching and learning in the implementation of the curriculum is made by each individual school.  The emphasis will now however be on the use of these digital tools to effectively embed ICT in teaching, learning and assessment in line with the Digital Strategy.<\/p><p>The PDST Technology in Education provides a range of support services for schools on the effective use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment through a variety of means including workshops, blended learning CPD courses, good practice videos, advice on ICT equipment and digital learning tools.  It is part of the national support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers and operates under the remit of my Department.  It also manages the Department&rsquo;s on-line Education Portal Scoilnet.ie  which is a key source of online high quality digital content made available for all schools and facilitates sharing of digital resources and good classroom practice between teachers.  The website provides in excess of 12,000 + resources aligned with the primary School Curriculum and the Post Primary Subject Syllabus. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600063#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600063#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[32007\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600063#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which smaller, rural or urban schools under the control of religious authorities are likely to remain protected in line with their religious ethos; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>My Department is very aware of the importance of small schools to rural communities and particularly the most dispersed and remote communities. <\/p>  <p>  To sustain primary schools in these communities my Department has a more favourable staffing schedule for small schools that are more than 8km distant from the next nearest school of the same type of patronage and language of instruction.

The EU collectively, as well as member states working alone, have been working hard to try to improve conditions on the ground. <\/p><p>The political situation in Libya remains complex.  No single government has controlled Libya since the fall of Colonel Gaddafi, and at the present time there are a number of competing governments in Libya, none of which control more than a portion of the territory.  As a result the humanitarian, economic and security situation is precarious and complicates EU engagement with the Libyan authorities, including on migration.  The formation of a functioning government in Libya is therefore a central objective for the EU, and will be a critical step towards addressing the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.<\/p><p>At their summit meeting in March, EU Heads of State and Government set out the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya in their Malta Declaration.  That commitment is broad-ranging including capacity building, training, and the provision of equipment and support for the Libyan national coast guard and other agencies . It also seeks to ensure that there are adequate reception capacities in Libya for migrants, including through working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). <\/p><p>In April, the EU approved a &euro;90 million programme to step up protection of migrants and to reinforce migration management in Libya.  A key objective is to provide multi-sectoral assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in different locations inside Libya, in particular inside detention centres, at disembarkation points and in urban settings.  This programme is being implemented through a number of international agencies including the UNHCR and UNICEF. The &euro;90m is in addition to the &euro;120 million already announced by the EU for migration-related support for Libya.<\/p><p>Individual EU member states are also addressing the migration situation in Libya.  The Interior ministers of France, Germany and Italy along with the European Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, met in Paris on 2 July and agreed, <i>inter alia,<\/i>to enhance support to the Libyan coastguard by increasing training activities and providing additional financial support while at the same time ensuring close monitoring of activities and to provide additional support to the IOM and the UNHCR to enable facilities in Libya to reach international standards in terms of living conditions and human rights.  They also agreed to accelerate the EU Relocation scheme agreed in 2015. <\/p><p>Ireland has been playing its part in trying to address the migration crisis through voluntarily opting into the EU Relocation scheme; giving generous humanitarian assistance to countries housing large numbers of migrants and through our naval presence in the Mediterranean.  As regards Libya specifically, for the past two years Irish Aid has deployed two Rapid Responders from its Rapid Response Corps to the UNICEF Libya Country Office based in Tunis to support UNICEF&rsquo;s work with migrants.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600063#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":343,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600063#WRG03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Status","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600063#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[32053\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600063#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans in respect of advising UK citizens living here about their citizenship status once the Brexit negotiations are complete; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":344,"content":"<p>The outcome of any Brexit negotiations will not affect the citizenship status of persons, including UK citizens, residing in the State.

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. <\/p>  <p>  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  A new contract should be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce.  It should also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency.  I think this will be key in making general practice a more attractive career.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract commenced in January of this year.  Officials from my Department and the HSE meet with GP representatives on a regular basis to discuss a wide range of issues.  The option of salaried GPs for areas where it has proven difficult to attract and retain GP services is one of the issues I expect will be considered in this context.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the discussions taking place are wide ranging and definitely ambitious in their scope.  I think it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that this will not be a straightforward process.  There will no doubt be challenges ahead for all parties involved. I would hope that everyone will remain focused on our common goal of putting suitable new arrangements in place that will work for patients, GPs, and other health care providers in primary care.

Nonetheless, historically and currently a proportion of activity in public hospitals involves the provision of care to private patients and the income generated in this way is a key component of the funding of the public hospital system.  Any curtailment of this funding stream would put further pressure on the Exchequer and the taxpayer in order to maintain service levels.<\/p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General identified in his 2008 Report that for 50% of private patients no private inpatient charge applied, as they were accommodated in either a designated public bed or non-designated bed.  The inability under the law to collect a private inpatient charge in such instances represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and to taxpayers and represented an indirect subsidy to private health insurance companies.<\/p><p>The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 was enacted to address the issue identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General and provided for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of the type of accommodation used.  <\/p><p>When patients are admitted to hospital they always have the option of being treated as a public patient or opting to be treated as a private patient.  Those patients opting to be treated privately have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital in respect of the services that each provides.  The charges applied in respect of private care in a public hospital relate not only to accommodation costs but also costs associated with non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, medicines, blood, medical and surgical supplies, radiology, diagnostics, operating theatres, laboratories, administration and support staff.<\/p><p>The HSE levies the appropriate charge for private patients in public hospitals in accordance with the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  The private patient waiver form to which the Deputy refers has no legal standing in relation to the application of these charges.  <\/p><p>The operational procedures for the management of patients' treatment preferences and the collection of private inpatient charges are a matter for the HSE in the first instance and I have asked the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.  The application of these necessary procedures must be sensitive to the health status of patients whilst in hospital and I want to ensure that patients do not experience upset at such a difficult time.  My<b><\/b>Department is therefore working with the HSE to ensure that the processes in place across the hospital system for implementing the law in this regard are appropriate and that a consistent approach is taken in implementing them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600067#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600067#WRL02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farms Data","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600067#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[31827\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600067#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will review correspondence from an organisation (details supplied); his views on off-farm employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>Off-farm employment\u00a0opportunities are\u00a0crucial to economic sustainability for many farm families.

The UK Government had been intimating this decision for some time now.  It is nonetheless unwelcome and unhelpful as it suggests a signal of the UK intent to take a hard line on fisheries in the context of Brexit.<\/p><p>However, there are no immediate direct impacts for the Irish fishing industry from this action as it will not take effect for two years.  Any longer term impacts will only become clear in the overall context of the Brexit negotiations.  It is the message of intent and the potential implications of that intent in the wider 12 to 200 mile zone that causes concern for the negotiations to come. <\/p><p>The Convention deals primarily with the right of a number of countries to fish in each other's 6 to 12 mile fishing zones based on historic fishing activity. Most of these rights were later incorporated into the Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p><p>Under the Convention, the Irish fishing fleet has access to parts of the UK 6-12 mile zone while the UK fleet has similar access to parts of the Irish zone.  The Irish fleet is not significantly dependant on this limited access. We do however catch significant quantities of fish in UK waters outside of the 12 mile zone.<\/p><p>As Michel Barnier noted earlier this week, the UK decision to withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention will not trigger any immediate change and he is focused on prioritising the fisheries interests of the EU 27.<\/p><p>This will not be a piecemeal negotiation with fisheries isolated from the wider negotiations on a post Brexit EU\/UK relationship.  There is a long way to go yet and nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed. <\/p><p>For this Government there are two clear objectives when it comes to fisheries and Brexit &ndash; the maintenance of our existing quota shares and our existing rights of access.  This has, and will continue to be, my overriding priority. <\/p><p>To achieve these objectives, we must have unity of purpose across the Member States directly concerned and across the fishing industry. Disunity will only strengthen those in the UK that seek to exclude all EU fleets.<\/p><p>As the negotiations develop unilateral sectoral announcements, like this one, will be dealt with, as this will be, within the Brexit negotiation process and there will be no room, or indeed intent, to address issues in isolation.<\/p><p>I am working closely with our fishing industry and held a detailed public discussion with stakeholders just last week in Galway.  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.<\/p><p>I strongly believe that a unified front on these matters is best for Ireland, the EU and the continued sustainability of our stocks.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600067#WRL03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600067#WRL03700"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[31934\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600067#WRL03800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1680 of 20 June 2017, the criteria that apply under European regulations with respect to costs incurred and income foregone basis.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>Article 33 of the Regulation (EU) No 1305\/2013 provides for measures under animal welfare.

This is a major reform as self-employed people will now have access to the safety-net of State income supports, without having to go through a means test, if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability.  Once such a contributor qualifies for the payment, it can be paid on an indefinite basis to pension age provided the relevant person continues to satisfy the medical and other criteria. <\/p><p>Consideration was not given to limiting eligibility for the payment to part of calendar years only.  <\/p><p>While the measure is being implemented without any increase in the rate of contribution paid by self-employed workers in 2017, consideration will need to be given to the funding arrangements in later years.  The estimated 2018 and 2019 costs are &euro;23m and &euro;38m, respectively, and these will rise further in later years.<\/p><p>In addition, Class S self-employed contributors have access since March last to the Treatment Benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids. <\/p><p>The last Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund was published in 2012 and did provide costings of extending two benefits - jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and invalidity pension - to self-employed workers on the same basis as it is paid to class A employees.  It did not provide a cost for permitting self-employed workers to opt to into class A structure paying equivalent rates of contributions for cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p><p>It should be noted, in this regard, that there would not be a direct correlation between the cost of compulsory cover (and the rates of contributions required) for any given benefit or pension for all self-employed and with the costs of an opt in (or opt out) system.  The third report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed published in 2013 examined the extension of additional cover for the self-employed on a voluntary basis and concluded that &ldquo;<i>extension on a voluntary basis, through either an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; or &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; basis, could lead to the selection of bad risks and would undermine the social solidarity and contributory principles that underline the social insurance system<\/i>.&rdquo;  Accordingly, an opt in system would require those who opted in to pay at a higher rate of contribution than would apply under a compulsory system.<\/p><p>The Actuarial Review referred to above was completed in 2012. A new review is now well advanced and is expected to be published next month.  This review will re-examine the projected PRSI contribution rates required to fund individual additional benefits, including invalidity pension and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to self-employed contributors.  Given the improvements in the labour market and the economy generally over the period since 2012, the forthcoming review will provide a more up to date estimate of the costs of extending new benefits to the self-employed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600069#WRN03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600069#WRN03600"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[32024\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070600069#WRN03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason jobseeker's allowance and rent supplement was cut from a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9 leaving them without financial support for the past two months; the reason there was no response to medical correspondence and correspondence outlining part-time employment submitted to her Department on a number of occasions; and if she will reinstate both payments.","asker":"1222","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>Notification was received from the Revenue Commissioners on 3 March indicating that the person concerned had commenced employment.
