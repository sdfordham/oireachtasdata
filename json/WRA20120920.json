In relation to the disbandment of the Western Brigade, the Minister tasked the Secretary General of the Department and the Chief of Staff to bring forward proposals for a reorganization of the Defence Forces within the context of the reduced strength of 9,500 serving personnel.  Those proposals recommended that the Army component of the Defence Forces be reduced from a three brigade to a two brigade structure.  This was on the basis that the three brigade structure, which had originally been designed for a force of 11,500, could not be sustained in the context of maintaining numbers at 9,500, without impacting on the capacity of the Defence Forces to deliver the services required by Government.  The Minister, having considered the matter in detail, accepted the proposals of the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff for the reorganisation of the Army into a two Brigade structure with Brigade Headquarters being located in Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p>  On the transfer of the Mc Kee Barracks staff, the transfer requirement will not become apparent until such time as the implementation process proceeds further and personnel have indicated their preferences in relation to transfer or remaining in their current location.  On reassignment or transfer criteria, as I indicated in my answer to the earlier questions, this will be voluntary as far as possible.  Personnel will be reassigned using the following criteria - <\/p><p>1.  Hold the substantive Rank of the appointment in question. <\/p><p>2.  Where a number of candidates meet the requirement for the appointment the following will be considered in order: <\/p><p>- If the applicant has had to change station due to Barrack closures during the period 01 August 2008 to 01 August 2012; <\/p><p>- Length of Service in the Rank relevant to the appointment <\/p><p>- Length of Service. <\/p><p>  Opportunities will also be given for personnel to retrain and reskill to fill vacancies in their current locations, and this is being incorporated into the Defence Forces Training directive for 2013.  <\/p><p>  The maintenance of Defence Forces operational requirements must be prioritised within the reorganization implementation process.  However, within that context, where possible, all practical alternatives, including reskilling will be explored to avoid or minimize relocation.  Undoubtedly it will be necessary to mandatorily move some personnel whose units are being disbanded or relocated and who cannot be accommodated in their current location.  This cannot be avoided.  It needs to be emphasised that this is not a painless process for personnel serving in the Defence Forces.  <\/p><p>  Serving members of the Defence Forces, officers and enlisted personnel, are being required to make decisions under the current reorganisation which they would not otherwise make or in different times have had to consider.

The Public Appointments Service are currently conducting a competition aimed at filling the post, with interviews scheduled to be completed in early October. Once this process is complete the matter will be submitted to Government by the Minister proposing that the Government recommend to the President that the person successful in the current competition be appointed as the new Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  It is anticipated that this process will be completed by the end of October.  While there will be a short interregnum before the appointment of the new Ombudsman, this is not a major concern.  The staff in the Office of the Ombudsman will continue to process and investigate cases pending the new appointment.<\/p><p>  The primary role of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, which is provided for in the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, is to provide an independent appeals process for members of the Defence Forces who have processed a complaint through the internal Defence Forces redress of wrongs process but remain dissatisfied with the outcome or the manner in which the complaint was handled. The 2004 Act also provides that, subject to certain conditions, the Ombudsman may accept complaints directly from former members of the Defence Forces. There are no plans to change these roles.<\/p><p>  Recent trends show a significant increase in the number of redress of wrongs complaints being resolved within the military system, thus reducing the number of cases being referred to the Ombudsman for investigation, a fact I very much welcome.  In addition, it is anticipated that the new and comprehensive promotion system for NCOs agreed and introduced earlier this year will eliminate the many complaint referrals to the Ombudsman, which account for about a third of the caseload.  Against this background, the post of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was advertised on a part time, three day week basis, subject to ongoing review of caseload and referrals.  The Minister has no plans currently for changes in the role of the Ombudsman or to amend the legislation in relation to the powers or functions of the Ombudsman.  <\/p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to put on the record of the House, the Government&rsquo;s appreciation of the seven years&rsquo; service given to the State by Ms. Marrinan Quinn since she was first appointed as Ombudsman for the Defence Forces in 2005. Her service during this period was all the more noteworthy given that she was the first person to undertake this important role, a fact that necessitated her putting in place all the various operating structures and systems that have served the office so well in the intervening years.

Budgeting and debt advice is also available through MABS which is also funded by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  The &quot;Keane report&quot; made a number of recommendations to tackle the mortgage arrears problem, but it indicated that bankruptcy reform would be a central catalyst to the resolution of the problem and that, in particular, the early introduction of new judicial and non-judicial personal insolvency options is vital.  The 2010 Law Reform Commission Report also took a similar view on the overall personal debt situation and it also made a significant number of detailed recommendations for change.  The Government, having regard to its Programme for Government commitment to fast-track personal bankruptcy reform, took account of these reports in the development of the Personal Insolvency Bill which was published on 29 June 2012 by the Minister for Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Deputy will be aware that the Bill is currently before the Oireachtas and that the Bill has now been considered by the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.<\/p><p>  The provision of a mortgage advisory function is also key.  The Minister for Social Protection has recently launched this service which includes the provision of a mortgage arrears information helpline and the provision of &lsquo;one-to-one&rsquo; independent financial advice by qualified accountants to mortgage holders when they are considering the offer of a long term forbearance\/resolution offer by their regulated mortgage lender.<\/p><p>  This service will tie in with the development and implementation of Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies by lenders as required by the Central Bank.  Under this initiative, mortgage holders are requested to segment their loan book and to put in place a framework for all mortgage holders experiencing difficulty, including those with the most difficult mortgage position and for whom a long term forbearance\/resolution option is likely to be the best option in the best interest of the customer.  In addition the mortgage to rent scheme involving the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and voluntary housing bodies is now in place on a nationwide basis.<\/p><p>  Regarding taxation measures, Budget 2012 provided for significant measures to help mortgage holders including the increase in mortgage interest relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage between 2004 and 2008. Details of any future taxation changes will be a matter for decision at budget time.<\/p><p>  The Government remains very committed to progress measures to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty and the Government committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet.  It is the intention of Government to ensure that those mortgage holders in genuine difficulty will receive appropriate assistance and a high priority has been assigned by Government to the implementation of this broad range of measures to assist those experiencing difficulty on their mortgage across the relevant Departments and agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Clearance Certificates","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRCC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[39915\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRCC02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be issued with a notice of assessment for 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are awaiting the person&rsquo;s Income Tax return for 2011.

Other key skills have also been brought into this office, for example on shared services and external service delivery.  The key role of the Reform and Delivery Office is to lead, support and coordinate the reform programme across the Public Service and good progress is being made in this regard, as set out in the Progress Report published on 6 September.  In addition, each Department \/ major Office has its own Change Delivery Team to manage and drive the reform process at organisational \/ sectoral level. <\/p><p>  In terms of formal governance, the key driver of the reform programme is the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform which provides political direction and accountability for reform.  The Cabinet Committee, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and which I convene, meets on a quarterly basis to consider priority issues and ensure that overall progress is being achieved.  <\/p><p>  An Advisory Group of Secretaries General has also been established, which provides support and advice on strategic \/ policy issues to the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform.  In addition, a Reform and Delivery Board, primarily comprising Assistant Secretaries responsible for leading reform in each Department \/ Office, meets regularly to oversee and monitor the delivery of Public Service Reform at a strategic level and provide assurance to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and to the Cabinet Committee that Public Service Reform is being successfully delivered.  <\/p><p>  In line with best practice governance, Project Boards have been established for many of the projects which are being implemented under the Reform Plan, for example for the various shared services projects.  In addition, each of the actions in the overall Reform Plan is assigned to a lead official, with Senior Responsible Owners appointed to lead the Major Projects which have been identified as being of major strategic importance.  The Reform and Delivery Office in my Department is also working closely with each of the main sectors to ensure that they have appropriate governance arrangements in place to drive and support the delivery of their reform programmes.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, this Government is strongly committed to its ambitious programme of Public Service Reform and I believe that a robust governance framework is in place to ensure its successful implementation.

In addition, new employment permit applications are normally only considered where it is established that a minimum salary of &euro;30,000 per annum is on offer based on a 39 hour week and where the position on offer is one of the occupations currently eligible for a new employment permit. <\/p><p>  Only experienced and qualified chefs are considered for the purpose of granting employment permits in respect of the restaurant sector. Furthermore, it is a requirement that applicants are not resident in the State when applying for an employment permit.

There are currently over 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012.  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>  Where a recipient&rsquo;s circumstances change, they must inform the officer dealing with their rent supplement claim who will determine if the change affects their on-going entitlement to the payment. In the case where a recipient changes address the rent supplement claim is closed and a new application must be made in respect of a new tenancy arrangement.<\/p><p>  Control is an integral part of the day-to-day administration of the rent supplement scheme. There are a number of operational controls in place to ensure that payment of rent supplement does not continue to those who no longer have an entitlement such as regular review of claims and warning reports issuing to officers where there is a change in the recipients circumstances which would prompt a review of entitlement.<\/p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent or is receiving payment in respect of accommodation where they no longer reside.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs at the address provided, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.  I have recently introduced powers of enquiry for appropriate staff to formally request landlords to provide information in respect of their rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and existence of the tenancy.  This measure will improve both the governance and oversight arrangements in place.<\/p><p>  Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non payment of rent by a tenant, s\/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process.  Overpayments of rent supplement are recoverable from the recipient. A departmental debt will remain on the customers&rsquo; records until fully recovered and may result in a reduction of all future entitlements, up to and including state pension and the disbursement of any likely estate upon death.  My Department actively pursues the recovery of all overpayments, including the initiation of civil proceedings, where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[39685\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the basis on which a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5 is being assessed for rent allowance; and the amount they qualify for.","asker":"1021","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>The person concerned is living alone and is renting a one bedroom property for which the rent is &#8364;529.00 monthly.

A period of time in which the applicant was a qualified adult is not included.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately in light of the existing economic situation I am not in a position to consider extending the fuel allowance scheme qualifying criteria.  The number in receipt of the fuel allowance has increased greatly in recent years from 265,000 in 2005 to approximately 400,000 people in 2012.  While of course we want to protect the basic social welfare payments which have very positive economic and social effects, regrettably there is a requirement to achieve savings due to our commitments with the IMF\/EU\/ECB Troika.  There will be an ongoing necessity to curtail overall expenditure in 2012 and in later years.  <\/p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs because of ill health or infirmity.  In addition, exceptional needs payments (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Applications","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRK01200"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[39837\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will provide an update on the status an application for carers' allowance submitted in November 2011 by a person (details supplied) in Dublin 7; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1007","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department is in receipt of an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question.

At present, there are six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population. With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement and the period for which a pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision and for the sustainability of pension provision into the future. In addition to this, spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure and in the context of the current fiscal crisis savings have to be found in the social welfare system.<\/p><p>In this regard, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty that existed in the past. This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &lsquo;risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010. The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%.  The Government has made decisions on a number of changes to State pension provision including the changes to the rate bands which came into effect in September 2012 for new customers.<\/p><p>Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.  From September 2012, additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) will be introduced to more fairly reflect the attachment to the workforce by the claimant.<\/p><p>The maximum rate will remain unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach where those who pay more, benefit more. For information, the new rate bands are included in the table.  In addition, with effect from 6th   April 2012, late claims for the State pension (transition), State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving partner&rsquo;s contributory pension will be limited to a maximum period of 6 months.<\/p><p>The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.  In terms of the changes in the rate bands for determining the level of pension payment, allowing persons affected to sign on for credited PRSI contributions will not automatically guarantee an enhanced rate of pension.  For those due to reach pension age in the near future this is likely to be of marginal or no value.  Allowing retrospective credited contributions bridge any shortfall would remove all budget savings and could potentially give rise to significant additional costs.<\/p><p>An information campaign in relation to all of the changes has been underway since March 2012 and all information can be accessed at <i>www.welfare.ie<\/i><i>  <\/i>.

The availability of SAORSAT means that the first time in Irish television history there is 100% coverage for domestic TV channels.<\/p><p>  In relation to the provision of financial assistance in the context of digital switchover, as I have stated in previous parliamentary question responses, I do not propose to introduce grant schemes for the purpose of digital switchover.  In relation to the requirement for a TV licence, the rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows our public service broadcasters, RT&Eacute; and TG4, to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  The overall aim is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Also it should be noted that 7% of the TV licence revenue goes to the Broadcasting Funding Scheme to assist independent broadcasters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRN00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRN00550"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[39711\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the expert report on the property tax conducted by Dr. Thornhill will be published; if a job impact assessment has been conducted on the introduction of a property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[39832\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he intends to continue with the non principal private residence charge on second homes when the residential property tax is introduced in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1109","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[39835\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the proposed property tax to be introduced next year will recognise and give credit to householders who are paying management charges in housing estates that have not yet been taken in charge by the local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1109","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[39853\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm that there will be eight bands with regard to the property tax and if band A is to take the lowest value of a property at &euro;150,000 if he will explain the position in relation to properties, of which there are many, which will be valued at less than &euro;150,000; his proposals with regard to these properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 to 139, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  An independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable local property tax to replace the household charge.   <\/p><p>The Group recently submitted its report to me and its recommendations will be considered in due course.\u00a0 Proposals will be brought to Government as soon as possible and it will then be a matter for the Government to decide on the exact details of implementation taking into account the modalities involved.

This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension. &#8216;<i>Integration<\/i>&#8217; means that a person&#8217;s entitlement to Social Insurance benefits such as the State Pension is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, the method of integration for military pensioners is actually less severe than in other areas of the public service.  The maximum personal rate of State Pension is currently &#8364;230.30 a week (if under age 80).  This is considerably greater than any reduction that could arise under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces&#8217; pension arrangements on qualification for the State Pension.<\/p><p><br \/>  The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions. <\/i> Its final report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to these retired NCOs and Privates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRQ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":483,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[39719\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the facilities or procedures available to army personnel (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":484,"content":"<p>The provision of assistance to a family of a deceased member of the Defence Forces to help meet bereavement costs is provided for in Defence Forces Regulations A10 (New Series) Ceremonials and Funerals.

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s fishery protection legislation and its obligations as a member of the European Union.  In its fishery protection role the Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time. It should be noted that responsibility for the prevention of drug-trafficking and people trafficking rests primarily with the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na respectively.  However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this work.  In this regard all Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol. These activities assist in countering all form of smuggling and illegal fishery activity.<\/p><p>  Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft which were acquired in 1994 under the terms of the 1991 to 1995 Fishery Protection Programme.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. The EU has provided funding towards the cost of purchase and upgrade of these aircraft.<\/p><p>  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities.  There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.<\/p><p>  Funding is available from the EU under the Fisheries Control Programmes to strengthen fishery surveillance systems in Member State countries.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps through my Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, apply on an annual basis for EU funding for projects that enhance their fisheries surveillance role.  In recent years, my Department has received &euro;0.325m (2010) and &euro;1.073m (2011). The ship replacement programme accounted for &euro;0.9m of the 2011 funding.  <\/p><p>  In relation to maritime surveillance generally, an Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Working Group, chaired by the Department of Transport, was established under the auspices of the Marine Co-ordination Group.

This was the sixth in a series of reports based on data collected by the NEWB on non-attendance in primary and post-primary schools through the Annual Attendance Report. This data can be used to monitor the levels of attendance, exclusions and suspensions across all of the country&#8217;s primary and post-primary schools. The series of reports is available in full on the website of the NEWB at<i><\/i>.  Data for the schools years 2010\/2011 and 2011\/2012 are currently being collated and verified with schools by the NEWB. <\/p><p><br \/>  The data gathered describe absences reported to the NEWB in specific circumstances such as where a child is absent for 20 days or more, where a child is expelled or suspended for six days or more cumulatively, or where the school generally has concerns about the educational welfare of a child in accordance of the statutory requirements of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. Accordingly, the Board advises that data are not collated in such a way as to allow all the breakdowns requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NEWB advises that when a young person is referred to the Board by a school, parent or another agency the initial work of the Education Welfare Officer is to assess the nature, scope and depth of the problem.  This action taken then falls into two distinct categories.  The first is a brief intervention whereby low level intervention proportionate to the need of the individual case can often effectively resolve the issue, thus preventing attendance problems escalating. For example, this work includes assistance with finding a school place and advice and support around Section 29 Appeals, suspensions and expulsions. In 2011, the Board reports that it worked with 12,062 children and families in providing assistance at this level. <\/p><p><br \/>  Problems of poor school attendance that are the manifestation of more complex and deep rooted difficulties can take significant time, expert help and on-going support from the NEWB to make progress. Such work can involve developing a plan with the family, young person and school to address the various barriers identified. These intensive interventions are used when brief interventions have not been successful, or are not appropriate in the circumstances. In 2011 there were a total of 3,845 children who received an intensive intervention from the Educational Welfare Service.  I have requested the NEWB to forward a copy of the 2011\/2012 analysis of school attendance data in primary and post-primary schools to the Deputy when it is available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRS02150"},{"type":"question","counter":556,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[39715\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding free child care in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick","asker":"1056","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":557,"content":"<p>The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September 2010 and is implemented by my Department.

Savings are being achieved through on-going off-patent price cuts; the pricing mechanism for new products has been changed; and we now have a review mechanism that takes account of price reductions in other countries. Since 2010 these actions have achieved savings in the region of &euro;250 million. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, regulations made under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 have reduced margins and mark-ups in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The combined full-year savings from these measures are &euro;154 million.In addition, I announced on the 18th June 2012 that an interim agreement had been reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) to reduce the price of certain off patent medicines. This is expected to deliver savings of &euro;10 million in 2012 (&euro;20 million in a full-year). These price cuts were accepted in advance of further discussions which are expected to deliver more significant savings. Negotiations are ongoing between officials of the Department\/HSE and the IPHA since the interim agreement was reached. These discussions are expected to reach a conclusion shortly.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 was published on the 13th of July 2012.

Generic substitution allows pharmacists to substitute a cheaper generic equivalent, at the patient&rsquo;s request, when a more expensive product has been prescribed. Reference pricing involves setting a common reimbursement amount for selected groups of medicines. Only the reference price is reimbursed by the State. Eligible patients can avoid out-of-pocket payments by opting for a generic medicine at or below the reference price. <\/p><p>  Reference pricing coupled with generic substitution provides patients with an incentive to opt for the cheapest available product, but does not impose any unavoidable additional costs on patients. As more medicines come off patent, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing will ensure that both taxpayers and patients will benefit from increased competition in the pharmaceutical market.  Savings will be achieved by limiting reimbursement to the reference price, allowing patients to opt for less expensive versions of the prescribed medicine, and promoting price competition between the manufacturers of interchangeable medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01050"},{"type":"question","counter":675,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[39863\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the recent development whereby the Health Service Executive has introduced a cut in removing the facility in which persons that were in district hospitals or community hospitals and needed to go to a larger hospital to meet consultants or have tests done, transport which was previously organised by the HSE is now left to the families to organise the transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":676,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":677,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01250"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[39866\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":680,"content":"<p>Question No. 251 answered with Question No. 209.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01550"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[39906\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an urgent hearing test can be arranged for a person (details supplied) in County Cork who was supplied with an unsuitable hearing aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":684,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01750"},{"type":"question","counter":685,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[39913\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000044#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider amending the requirement for persons with genetic rare disorders to regularly re-apply for medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":686,"content":"<p>I have asked the Health Service Executive for a report on the issue raised by the Deputy.

Mortgage holders who are in difficulty with their mortgage obligations in respect of their primary residence have significant protections available to them under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. In addition, the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s mortgage interest supplement scheme also provides for direct support to mortgage holders that have had to avail of social welfare support.  Budgeting and debt advice is also available through MABS which is also funded by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  The &quot;Keane report&quot; made a number of recommendations to tackle the mortgage arrears problem, but it indicated that bankruptcy reform would be a central catalyst to the resolution of the problem and that, in particular, the early introduction of new judicial and non-judicial personal insolvency options is vital.  The 2010 Law Reform Commission Report also took a similar view on the overall personal debt situation and it also made a significant number of detailed recommendations for change.  The Government, having regard to its Programme for Government commitment to fast-track personal bankruptcy reform, took account of these reports in the development of the Personal Insolvency Bill which was published on 29 June 2012 by the Minister for Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Deputy will be aware that the Bill is currently before the Oireachtas and that the Bill has now been considered by the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.<\/p><p>  The provision of a mortgage advisory function is also key.  The Minister for Social Protection has recently launched this service which includes the provision of a mortgage arrears information helpline and the provision of &lsquo;one-to-one&rsquo; independent financial advice by qualified accountants to mortgage holders when they are considering the offer of a long term forbearance\/resolution offer by their regulated mortgage lender.<\/p><p>  This service will tie in with the development and implementation of Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies by lenders as required by the Central Bank.  Under this initiative, mortgage holders are requested to segment their loan book and to put in place a framework for all mortgage holders experiencing difficulty, including those with the most difficult mortgage position and for whom a long term forbearance\/resolution option is likely to be the best option in the best interest of the customer.  In addition the mortgage to rent scheme involving the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and voluntary housing bodies is now in place on a nationwide basis.<\/p><p>  Regarding taxation measures, Budget 2012 provided for significant measures to help mortgage holders including the increase in mortgage interest relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage between 2004 and 2008. Details of any future taxation changes will be a matter for decision at budget time.<\/p><p>  The Government remains very committed to progress measures to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty and the Government committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet.  It is the intention of Government to ensure that those mortgage holders in genuine difficulty will receive appropriate assistance and a high priority has been assigned by Government to the implementation of this broad range of measures to assist those experiencing difficulty on their mortgage across the relevant Departments and agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000046#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Clearance Certificates","counter":768,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000046#WRCC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":769,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[39915\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000046#WRCC02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be issued with a notice of assessment for 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":770,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are awaiting the person&rsquo;s Income Tax return for 2011.

To this end, in November last year, I established a dedicated Reform and Delivery Office in my Department, led by an externally recruited Programme Director who has many years experience in leading change in the private sector.  Other key skills have also been brought into this office, for example on shared services and external service delivery.  The key role of the Reform and Delivery Office is to lead, support and coordinate the reform programme across the Public Service and good progress is being made in this regard, as set out in the Progress Report published on 6 September.  In addition, each Department \/ major Office has its own Change Delivery Team to manage and drive the reform process at organisational \/ sectoral level. <\/p><p>  In terms of formal governance, the key driver of the reform programme is the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform which provides political direction and accountability for reform.  The Cabinet Committee, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and which I convene, meets on a quarterly basis to consider priority issues and ensure that overall progress is being achieved.  <\/p><p>  An Advisory Group of Secretaries General has also been established, which provides support and advice on strategic \/ policy issues to the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform.  In addition, a Reform and Delivery Board, primarily comprising Assistant Secretaries responsible for leading reform in each Department \/ Office, meets regularly to oversee and monitor the delivery of Public Service Reform at a strategic level and provide assurance to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and to the Cabinet Committee that Public Service Reform is being successfully delivered.  <\/p><p>  In line with best practice governance, Project Boards have been established for many of the projects which are being implemented under the Reform Plan, for example for the various shared services projects.  In addition, each of the actions in the overall Reform Plan is assigned to a lead official, with Senior Responsible Owners appointed to lead the Major Projects which have been identified as being of major strategic importance.  The Reform and Delivery Office in my Department is also working closely with each of the main sectors to ensure that they have appropriate governance arrangements in place to drive and support the delivery of their reform programmes.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, this Government is strongly committed to its ambitious programme of Public Service Reform and I believe that a robust governance framework is in place to ensure its successful implementation.  Reform of our public services is an ongoing process and my Department will regularly evaluate these governance structures with a view to achieving maximum delivery of the reform programme over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000048#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":831,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000048#WRE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":832,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[39889\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000048#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide the name of the Assistant Secretary on Reform appointed from each Department assigned.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":833,"content":"<p>Following the publication of the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan last November, a Reform Delivery Board was established to oversee and monitor the delivery of Public Service Reform at a strategic level and provide assurance to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and to the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform that reform is being successfully delivered.

There are currently over 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012.  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>  Where a recipient&rsquo;s circumstances change, they must inform the officer dealing with their rent supplement claim who will determine if the change affects their on-going entitlement to the payment. In the case where a recipient changes address the rent supplement claim is closed and a new application must be made in respect of a new tenancy arrangement.<\/p><p>  Control is an integral part of the day-to-day administration of the rent supplement scheme. There are a number of operational controls in place to ensure that payment of rent supplement does not continue to those who no longer have an entitlement such as regular review of claims and warning reports issuing to officers where there is a change in the recipients circumstances which would prompt a review of entitlement.<\/p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent or is receiving payment in respect of accommodation where they no longer reside.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs at the address provided, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.  I have recently introduced powers of enquiry for appropriate staff to formally request landlords to provide information in respect of their rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and existence of the tenancy.  This measure will improve both the governance and oversight arrangements in place.<\/p><p>  Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non payment of rent by a tenant, s\/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process.  Overpayments of rent supplement are recoverable from the recipient. A departmental debt will remain on the customers&rsquo; records until fully recovered and may result in a reduction of all future entitlements, up to and including state pension and the disbursement of any likely estate upon death.  My Department actively pursues the recovery of all overpayments, including the initiation of civil proceedings, where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000049#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":865,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000049#WRF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":866,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[39685\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000049#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the basis on which a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5 is being assessed for rent allowance; and the amount they qualify for.","asker":"1021","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":867,"content":"<p>The person concerned is living alone and is renting a one bedroom property for which the rent is &#8364;529.00 monthly.

At present, there are six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population. With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement and the period for which a pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision and for the sustainability of pension provision into the future. In addition to this, spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure and in the context of the current fiscal crisis savings have to be found in the social welfare system.<\/p><p>In this regard, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty that existed in the past. This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &lsquo;risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010. The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%.  The Government has made decisions on a number of changes to State pension provision including the changes to the rate bands which came into effect in September 2012 for new customers.<\/p><p>Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.  From September 2012, additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) will be introduced to more fairly reflect the attachment to the workforce by the claimant.<\/p><p>The maximum rate will remain unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach where those who pay more, benefit more. For information, the new rate bands are included in the table.  In addition, with effect from 6th   April 2012, late claims for the State pension (transition), State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving partner&rsquo;s contributory pension will be limited to a maximum period of 6 months.<\/p><p>The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.  In terms of the changes in the rate bands for determining the level of pension payment, allowing persons affected to sign on for credited PRSI contributions will not automatically guarantee an enhanced rate of pension.  For those due to reach pension age in the near future this is likely to be of marginal or no value.  Allowing retrospective credited contributions bridge any shortfall would remove all budget savings and could potentially give rise to significant additional costs.<\/p><p>An information campaign in relation to all of the changes has been underway since March 2012 and all information can be accessed at <i>www.welfare.ie<\/i><i>  <\/i>.

Also it should be noted that 7% of the TV licence revenue goes to the Broadcasting Funding Scheme to assist independent broadcasters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000056#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":1048,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000056#WRN00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":1047,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000056#WRN00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1048,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[39711\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000056#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the expert report on the property tax conducted by Dr. Thornhill will be published; if a job impact assessment has been conducted on the introduction of a property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":1049,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[39832\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000056#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he intends to continue with the non principal private residence charge on second homes when the residential property tax is introduced in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1109","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":1050,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[39835\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000056#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the proposed property tax to be introduced next year will recognise and give credit to householders who are paying management charges in housing estates that have not yet been taken in charge by the local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1109","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":1051,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[39853\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000056#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm that there will be eight bands with regard to the property tax and if band A is to take the lowest value of a property at &euro;150,000 if he will explain the position in relation to properties, of which there are many, which will be valued at less than &euro;150,000; his proposals with regard to these properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1052,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 to 139, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  An independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable local property tax to replace the household charge.   <\/p><p>The Group recently submitted its report to me and its recommendations will be considered in due course.\u00a0 Proposals will be brought to Government as soon as possible and it will then be a matter for the Government to decide on the exact details of implementation taking into account the modalities involved.

The 21-year pension consists of the following elements, all of which are payable for the person&#8217;s lifetime: (a) basic flat-rate pension that varies according to rank; <i>plus <\/i>(b) an addition in respect of military service allowance (MSA) equal to 40% of the MSA rate where discharged since August 1990; <i>and <\/i>(c) if applicable, fixed percentage additions in respect of certain other qualifying payments such as technician pay.<\/p><p><br \/>  An &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is also payable at a flat rate for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years.  This increment is increased, where appropriate, by the top-up at (c).  Where maximum pensionable service is 31 or more years, the MSA top-up is 50% of the rate of MSA (rather than 40%).  However, the additional increment ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 under the Social Welfare code for a State Pension (Contributory), or if they become entitled to a State Pension (Transition) at the earlier age of 65. At the same time, the 50% MSA top-up reverts to the 40% rate.<\/p><p><br \/>  These arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension. &#8216;<i>Integration<\/i>&#8217; means that a person&#8217;s entitlement to Social Insurance benefits such as the State Pension is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, the method of integration for military pensioners is actually less severe than in other areas of the public service.  The maximum personal rate of State Pension is currently &#8364;230.30 a week (if under age 80).  This is considerably greater than any reduction that could arise under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces&#8217; pension arrangements on qualification for the State Pension.<\/p><p><br \/>  The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions. <\/i> Its final report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to these retired NCOs and Privates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000059#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":1166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000059#WRQ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1167,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[39719\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000059#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the facilities or procedures available to army personnel (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1168,"content":"<p>The provision of assistance to a family of a deceased member of the Defence Forces to help meet bereavement costs is provided for in Defence Forces Regulations A10 (New Series) Ceremonials and Funerals.

In this regard all Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol. These activities assist in countering all form of smuggling and illegal fishery activity.<\/p><p>  Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft which were acquired in 1994 under the terms of the 1991 to 1995 Fishery Protection Programme.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. The EU has provided funding towards the cost of purchase and upgrade of these aircraft.<\/p><p>  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities.  There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.<\/p><p>  Funding is available from the EU under the Fisheries Control Programmes to strengthen fishery surveillance systems in Member State countries.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps through my Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, apply on an annual basis for EU funding for projects that enhance their fisheries surveillance role.  In recent years, my Department has received &euro;0.325m (2010) and &euro;1.073m (2011). The ship replacement programme accounted for &euro;0.9m of the 2011 funding.  <\/p><p>  In relation to maritime surveillance generally, an Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Working Group, chaired by the Department of Transport, was established under the auspices of the Marine Co-ordination Group.  The Group is working towards the creation of a common information-sharing environment to enhance safety and security within the Irish maritime domain.<\/p><p>  Ireland along with other EU Member States participate in the EU Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC-N).  This Centre has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea.  MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000060#WRR01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":1195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000060#WRR01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Imports","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000060#WRR01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[39825\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000060#WRR01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the quantities of vegetables and carrots that were imported into this State in 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1196,"content":"<p>Imports of fresh vegetables into Ireland for the year 2011 and the period January-July 2012 are presented in <bu>Table 1<\/bu>   below.

This was the sixth in a series of reports based on data collected by the NEWB on non-attendance in primary and post-primary schools through the Annual Attendance Report. This data can be used to monitor the levels of attendance, exclusions and suspensions across all of the country&#8217;s primary and post-primary schools. The series of reports is available in full on the website of the NEWB at<i><\/i>.  Data for the schools years 2010\/2011 and 2011\/2012 are currently being collated and verified with schools by the NEWB. <\/p><p><br \/>  The data gathered describe absences reported to the NEWB in specific circumstances such as where a child is absent for 20 days or more, where a child is expelled or suspended for six days or more cumulatively, or where the school generally has concerns about the educational welfare of a child in accordance of the statutory requirements of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. Accordingly, the Board advises that data are not collated in such a way as to allow all the breakdowns requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NEWB advises that when a young person is referred to the Board by a school, parent or another agency the initial work of the Education Welfare Officer is to assess the nature, scope and depth of the problem.  This action taken then falls into two distinct categories.  The first is a brief intervention whereby low level intervention proportionate to the need of the individual case can often effectively resolve the issue, thus preventing attendance problems escalating. For example, this work includes assistance with finding a school place and advice and support around Section 29 Appeals, suspensions and expulsions. In 2011, the Board reports that it worked with 12,062 children and families in providing assistance at this level. <\/p><p><br \/>  Problems of poor school attendance that are the manifestation of more complex and deep rooted difficulties can take significant time, expert help and on-going support from the NEWB to make progress. Such work can involve developing a plan with the family, young person and school to address the various barriers identified. These intensive interventions are used when brief interventions have not been successful, or are not appropriate in the circumstances. In 2011 there were a total of 3,845 children who received an intensive intervention from the Educational Welfare Service.  I have requested the NEWB to forward a copy of the 2011\/2012 analysis of school attendance data in primary and post-primary schools to the Deputy when it is available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000061#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":1239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000061#WRS02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1240,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[39715\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000061#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding free child care in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick","asker":"1056","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1241,"content":"<p>The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September 2010 and is implemented by my Department.

Savings are being achieved through on-going off-patent price cuts; the pricing mechanism for new products has been changed; and we now have a review mechanism that takes account of price reductions in other countries. Since 2010 these actions have achieved savings in the region of &euro;250 million. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, regulations made under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 have reduced margins and mark-ups in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The combined full-year savings from these measures are &euro;154 million.In addition, I announced on the 18th June 2012 that an interim agreement had been reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) to reduce the price of certain off patent medicines. This is expected to deliver savings of &euro;10 million in 2012 (&euro;20 million in a full-year).

Generic substitution allows pharmacists to substitute a cheaper generic equivalent, at the patient&rsquo;s request, when a more expensive product has been prescribed. Reference pricing involves setting a common reimbursement amount for selected groups of medicines. Only the reference price is reimbursed by the State. Eligible patients can avoid out-of-pocket payments by opting for a generic medicine at or below the reference price. <\/p><p>  Reference pricing coupled with generic substitution provides patients with an incentive to opt for the cheapest available product, but does not impose any unavoidable additional costs on patients. As more medicines come off patent, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing will ensure that both taxpayers and patients will benefit from increased competition in the pharmaceutical market.  Savings will be achieved by limiting reimbursement to the reference price, allowing patients to opt for less expensive versions of the prescribed medicine, and promoting price competition between the manufacturers of interchangeable medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1359,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[39863\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the recent development whereby the Health Service Executive has introduced a cut in removing the facility in which persons that were in district hospitals or community hospitals and needed to go to a larger hospital to meet consultants or have tests done, transport which was previously organised by the HSE is now left to the families to organise the transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1360,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1362,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[39866\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1363,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1364,"content":"<p>Question No. 251 answered with Question No. 209.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1366,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[39906\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an urgent hearing test can be arranged for a person (details supplied) in County Cork who was supplied with an unsuitable hearing aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1367,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1369,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[39913\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/answers2012092000065#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider amending the requirement for persons with genetic rare disorders to regularly re-apply for medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1370,"content":"<p>I have asked the Health Service Executive for a report on the issue raised by the Deputy.
