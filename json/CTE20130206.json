The committee will have received copies of my speaking note.  Copies of the report have also been provided to the committee.<\/p><p>  My name is Patricia Murphy and I am the principal officer in the pensions policy section of the Department of Social Protection.  I am accompanied by Mr. Robert Nicholson, assistant principal, pensions policy, Mr. Andrew Nugent, assistant head of policy at the Pensions Board, Mr. Joe Morley from the Central Bank and Mr. Niall McGrath from PricewaterhouseCoopers, who provided support in the report's preparation.<\/p><p>  The report was requested by the Minister for Social Protection to gather information on the levels of pension charge levied on private and occupational pension arrangements for the purpose of assessing whether charges are reasonable and transparent, and to report on the findings and make recommendations, as appropriate, to the Minister and the Government.  This is the first comprehensive Government report on the subject.  The work was led by the Department of Social Protection with a steering group that included representatives from the Pensions Board and the Central Bank.  Assistance throughout was provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers.<\/p><p>  A primary objective of the research was to undertake a fact-finding exercise on the charging structures that apply across the various pension arrangements and provide an insight into the breakdown of charges and costs relating to pension provision in Ireland, with the goal of enhancing the understanding of the impact of such charges on the investments of pension scheme members and policy holders.  The scope of the research focused on costs arising during the pension saving cycle from initial set-up to the point of retirement.<\/p><p>  In undertaking the research, pension arrangements were divided into two main categories: employer-sponsored pension arrangements, which included defined benefit schemes, defined contribution insured schemes, defined contribution non-insured schemes, and public sector AVC schemes; and individual pension arrangements, such as retirement annuity contracts, executive or one-man pension plans, standard personal retirement savings accounts, and buy-out bonds.<br \/><b><\/b>Pension charges can be broadly categorised as disclosed or non-disclosed, which also is implicit.  Disclosed charges vary in nature and include items such as an annual management charge, allocation rate, policy fee, bid-offer spread, exit fee and cost of commission distribution.  Non-disclosed implicit charges relate to underlying costs of investment management, such as custodianship fees.  These types of additional cost will have an impact on long-term pension values to differing degrees and are not typically disclosed to individual pension savers.<\/p><p>  During the research, questionnaires were issued to the following: occupational pension scheme trustees, for those pension arrangements where trustees are in place, with 340 out of 1,015 responding; life assurance companies, for those pension arrangements in which life assurance companies were the predominant provider, with 12 out of 14 providers responding; investment management, with 8 out of 9 responding; and pension advisers, who often provide the link between trustees, employers and individuals and pension providers, with 37 out of 60 responding.<\/p><p>  With regard to conclusions, the report highlights a wide range of issues with regard to pension charges and identifies a number of serious problems.  It is recognised that the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost-free.  It is also clear that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency.  <\/p><p>  On reasonableness, the report concludes that there is a considerable variation in the range of charges imposed.  Some schemes and individuals appear to be paying more than they need to.  Smaller occupational pension schemes and individual pension arrangements appear to be comparatively expensive.  A member of a defined contribution scheme with a final pension fund of &euro;400,000 could lose up to 15%, or &euro;60,000, in charges.  An individual with a final pension fund of &euro;400,000 could lose up to 30%, or &euro;120,000, in charges.  The research indicated that, as a rule of thumb, every 0.25% increase in the reduction in yield, which is the annual cost of all charges applied to the fund, results in a decrease of 4% in the final projected value of the pension fund.<\/p><p>  With regard to transparency, the report concludes that there are deficiencies and inconsistencies in current practices and a culture of providing clear information in a simple manner is not evident.  It also concluded that improvements in disclosure requirements, including those for pensions, were introduced in the Central Bank's 2012 consumer protection code and these should enhance transparency for those consumers covered by the code.  There are also various ongoing developments at EU level which should lead to stronger consumer protection over time.  The report may also be of interest to other agencies that have a role in market regulation and consumer protection.<\/p><p>  Developments on broader pensions policy could also have a significant impact given that the research clearly identifies the importance of economies of scale in driving down charges.  For example, the proposed introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for all employees may be the most effective way to introduce change and could have a major impact in reducing charges, particularly for those people with small pension funds and reduced pension expectations.<\/p><p>  The research also observed that the number of occupational pension schemes with legacy pension charging structures is small.  A key finding is that scheme review and amendment, known as re-brokering, is significant in the case of occupational pension schemes and is also relatively common in individual pension arrangements.  <\/p><p>  The practice of applying commission is prevalent in defined contribution insured schemes but is particularly widespread within individual pension arrangements.  There is no standardised approach to providing information on the impact of commission payments and the research shows that the various approaches used will affect members differently depending upon circumstances - for example, their age and period to retirement.<\/p><p>  The recommendations in the report are principally focused on what can be achieved relatively quickly by improving regulation and best practice in disclosure.  A summary of the recommendations is set out on pages 19 and 20 of the report and include the following proposals: develop approaches to improve consumer, employer and trustee awareness and knowledge of pension charges, which should ensure that information is clear and concise, with charges standardised where possible and based on best practice; develop a communications action plan on pension charges; review occupational pension disclosure regulations specifically to provide for the issuing of an annual statement to all deferred members, improve the information provided in the statement of reasonable projection, and review the need for focused detail; monitor developments and continue efforts to develop a single standard measure that would assess all costs and charges and thereby enable easier comparisons to be made; continue to monitor the implementation of the 2012 consumer protection code; conduct further research on the drivers behind consumer choice of individual pension products, with particular reference to PRSAs; ensure data on charges is collected on a periodic basis, with three-yearly intervals considered appropriate; and evaluate the impact of this report, these recommendations and future EU developments after two years and assess whether further and more stringent recommendations are required.<\/p><p>  Individuals and bodies have been given an opportunity to consider the report and its recommendations and respond at the end of January.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting the Department here today.  My colleagues and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600003#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1360155600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murphy for her presentation and I commend the people who compiled the report.

It is an issue that has annoyed many people who, when considering their pension, have an idea about how much they will hopefully receive when they avail of it and are suddenly confronted with charges, hidden charges and whatnot.  There is a great deal of work ahead of us in that regard.<\/p><p>  There is a series of recommendations.  There is also the issue of changes that have been introduced in the Central Bank legislation and possibly other legislative changes.  Can some of the recommendations and changes be imposed retrospectively or do they only apply to all new pensions?  The difficulty for us, as legislators, is that we are told we cannot apply something once somebody has signed a contract, even when that contract contains hidden charges.  Some of the changes mentioned are quite simple and I hope the industry will agree to and adopt them on a voluntary basis.  If not, can it be forced to disclose in full the fees and charges that have remained hidden from its customers?  This is particularly relevant nowadays when people are trying to decide whether they should continue to contribute to a pension fund.  Many people are in dire straits and if they see that the final figure is much lower than they anticipated, they might pull out.  Some of them are putting themselves under a great deal of financial strain just to continue making payments in the hope of receiving a pension at the end of it.  It is similar to the health insurance issue.  People continue to make the payments because they have paid in for so long.<\/p><p>  The glossary associated with the report is longer than the recommendations, which is an example of how complicated it is.  It is not an area in which I have expertise.  I will definitely go through the report to tease out a few more questions as the changes and recommendations are progressed.  There is a degree of urgency about this, but we must also ensure we get it right, especially if the Minister, as she has said, is moving towards auto enrolment.  Again, that is a separate pension scheme and it will have its own fees and charges, but, because the State will be involved, they will be up-front and above board.  Perhaps that will also force the industry to try to compete with that new model.  It is not one with which I fully agree, but if it is going to be put in place, it will have to be a model that will make the private industry reach its target.  There is a job of work to be done in that regard.  The report is well done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600004#E00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360156200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their comments on the report, the scope and purpose of which are really fact finding.  We acknowledge the issue is very complex and the length and detail of the report reflect the topic dealt with.<\/p><p>  A number of points were made by the Deputies.  With regard to implicit charges, it is acknowledged in the report in respect of the non-disclosed element of the charges that it would be helpful if in the future some consistent way of providing for these charges could be determined.  On the recommendations, their focus was on what actions could be taken reasonably quickly to promote transparency.  The lack of transparency was seen as one of the major difficulties.  The recommendations focused on identifying gaps in the existing disclosure regulations to provide more information for scheme members and on looking at how the consumer protection code, introduced last year by the Central Bank, was operating with regard to providing more complete and full information for consumers in order that they could see what charges they were paying.<\/p><p>  The issue of price regulation is discussed in the report.  The view of the steering group was that initiatives to promote transparency might be more successful at promoting competition initially, but if that was not seen to work, perhaps more stringent action might be taken.  PRSAs have their price fixed by regulation, but that price effectively operates as a maximum.  One of the recommendations made in the report is that we look at how they are operating for consumers who might need them.  Also, the consultation is just coming to an end and we will be looking at the submissions that arrive and reverting back to the Minister and the Government for their views about the implementation of the recommendations made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1360156800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome the panel.  This is a fine report.  The level of charges is madness and I concur with the comments of Deputy O'Dea.  Why is there such a difference?  Both levels of charges are huge.  Why is there such a difference between 30% on individual pension schemes and 15% on occupational pension schemes?  Is it because occupational pension schemes are doing more of the work?<\/p><p>  What can we do to reduce these costs?  The panel has made a number of recommendations on transparency.  How can an individual find out if he or she is paying too much?  With regard to the report's recommendations, who must carry these out?  Is it the underwriter of the pension scheme, such as Irish Life or Standard Life?  In what way do these companies liaise with the Minister for Social Protection?<\/p><p>  The panel surveyed quite a few groups to produce this report.  Did the possibility arise of taking out money from pensions funds to help individuals meet current commitments?  Did it come up as an add-on comment?  The panel may not have been looking for a view on it but may have heard it raised.<\/p><p>  Ms Murphy referred to not collecting set information on commission structures, yet there is a clear question on page 263: \"What factors typically influence the type of commission structures you typically choose for such pension arrangements?\"  The panel asked a very clear question on PRSAs, personal retirement bonds, executive pensions, approved retirement funds and groups.  What were the findings and what is the level of commission?  It used to be very high, 60% on a personal pension fund.  I am keen to get answers to help people who have decided, in the case of individual schemes, to invest in these pension funds.  Anyone with an occupational pension scheme has no choice but to invest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600005#F00100","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1360156800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>On a point related to the matters raised by Deputy O'Dea and Senator Healy Eames, is the industry in Ireland making super-normal profits?

What flexibility do pension schemes have in respect of how they apply the levy?  I refer to the pension scheme of the airline based in the middle of my constituency.  People have received letters to say that the funds have not applied the 0.6% levy over the past two years but it is their intention to apply a 1.2% levy on those funds permanently.  In terms of the flexibility of schemes to do such things, it seems to be against the thrust of the intention of the levy.  I am interested in the comments of the panel in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600005#F00200","speaker":"1013"},{"type":"speech","time":1360156800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>On that point, it has been said to me that some companies seem to charge the pension fund levy to customers.

Has the panel examined the allocation of the pension levy and whether this is being done fairly?  Has the panel come across cases where the levy seems to be charged to individual customers?  The person who mentioned it to me anecdotally suggested it was being described as a Government levy the customer was paying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600005#F00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360156800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I will respond to the questions in order.  With regard to the difference in price between the occupational schemes and individual arrangements, the cost is split in occupational schemes between employers and individual members.  What comes through from the findings is that individual arrangements are more expensive.  Some of that can relate to scale because one of the key findings of the report is that the bigger the employer, the lower the cost.  For an individual, costs will be higher.<\/p><p>  With regard to transparency, and the question of how an individual can find out if he or she is paying too much, it is quite difficult.  Asking questions of the adviser is critical.  The report wanted to set out the facts in this area and to present information.  We used a reduction in yield to quantify costs.  Someone dealing with the scheme can ask about the reduction in yield in respect of the arrangement the person is in and can then make a comparison in terms of how they fare on the variability of charges that apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600005#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1360156800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Is there a responsibility on the pension company to let the individual know the charges?

We have a long track record of working on Traveller and Roma issues both in Ireland and at a European level since our foundation in 1985.  We have had a dedicated Roma project since 2000.  Today we will focus on the impact of the habitual residence condition on the Roma community in Ireland, and my colleague Ms Siobhan Curran will outline the actions we would like to see happen to address the concerns we will outline.  Ms Gabi Muntean will outline her personal experience and the consequences for Roma community members who cannot access social protection in the State.<\/p><p>  Pavee Point is not naive and does not suggest that Ireland should be responsible for resolving the problems of all the Roma living in the European Union.  We propose that the Government take both a humanitarian and a pragmatic approach in addressing the concerns of the Roma living in Ireland that we will highlight.  We believe there is a need for an European-wide co-ordinated approach in addressing Roma issues and we welcome the European framework for national Roma integration strategies.  However, it is most unfortunate that the Irish Government has totally ignored the existence of the Roma community living in Ireland and Roma are invisible in the Irish strategy.  The mindset of the State appears to be one of ignoring the Roma community and hoping its members will go away.  The reality is that Roma are a part of Ireland now and have been since the mid-1990s, and Pavee Point believes that we need to proactively address their needs.<\/p><p>  There are an estimated 12 million to 15 million Roma living in the European Union.  Official policies against the Roma during the past 70 years have included containment and forced assimilation, while in the worst period during the Second World War, between a quarter and half a million Roma were exterminated by the Nazi regime.  After the Second World War the predominant policy in many states was forced assimilation of Roma.  Since the fall of the Communist regimes in eastern Europe in 1989, the situation of Roma has for the most part worsened.  With the transition to a market economy, Roma have become increasingly marginalised.  Openly anti-Roma attitudes suppressed under Communist systems have re-emerged in more virulent and sometimes violent form.  In the first half of 2012 alone, the European Roma Rights Centre highlighted media reports of at least 20 attacks across four countries, including ten deaths of Romani people.  The response of authorities to such abuses has often been characterised by a failure to investigate racist crimes, in some cases even blaming the victims, while in others the authorities are the perpetrators.  Because many central and eastern European countries continue to fail to address anti-Roma discrimination or provide protection against violent attacks, some Roma seek a better life in western European states, including in Ireland.  There are no accurate data on the Roma population in Ireland, as we do not disaggregate data on ethnicity.  However, we estimate there are about 5,000 Roma living here.<\/p><p>  We want a humanitarian, pragmatic and common-sense approach to the needs of Roma living in Ireland.  Otherwise, the alternative will be the creation of a permanent underclass of Roma where poverty, exclusion and racism are the norm.  Resources are being used for negative measures such as policing, criminalisation and hospitalisation rather than positively for Roma development and inclusion.  The former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, in a report concerning Roma and social security which was published last year, said that Roma are being denied access to services or given reduced assistance, that there is discriminatory application of social assistance programmes and that the use of certain regulations and policies have the effect of rendering Roma ineligible for regular social services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600008#J01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ronnie Fay","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360159200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>As Ms Ronnie Fay has noted, we wish to bring to the attention of the committee the significant impact of the habitual residence condition.  This matter has been raised as a major concern by Roma and by people working in the HSE, the education sector and the wider NGO sector.  The HSE in particular is very concerned about the issues facing Roma.  To this end, Pavee Point and the HSE organised a number of seminars to discuss the issues facing Roma in Ireland.  The major theme at these seminars was that the habitual residence condition is resulting in serious issues of child poverty and destitution for Roma in Ireland.  For example, social workers have reported concerns about young babies whose parents have no means to support them.  Forced poverty is causing serious child protection issues.  Social workers report that they are forced to consider taking a child into care simply to provide access to basic services.  Social workers are frustrated that this is the only option for looking after these children.<\/p><p>  Education and welfare officers are also noting the impact of the habitual residence condition on access to education and the ability of Roma parents to send their children to school.  There is also a significant health impact.  Pavee Point has received reports of Roma who are not entitled to medical cards on the basis that they are unable to provide evidence of means.  The HSE has reported that children with serious medical conditions are unable to receive medical cards.  Pavee Point receives calls from statutory representatives from Dublin, Galway, Athlone, Limerick, Donegal and from all over the country because of problems encountered in developing responses to the issues facing Roma.<\/p><p>  The effect of the habitual residence condition cannot be under-estimated.  For example, a Roma man was claiming entitlements but his payments were cut off because he did not fulfil the habitual residence condition.  He became homeless and a few months later he died on the streets of Dublin.  The impact of this habitual residence condition is very severe and can be fatal in some cases.<\/p><p>  I refer to the financial cost of the habitual residence condition.  The impact of these policies is bringing Roma into contact with the State in all sorts of different forms.  They are dealing with social workers, educational workers, education and welfare officers, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the emergency health services.  This involves expenditure which could be avoided if people were to be provided with basic financial supports in the first instance rather than allow them fall into destitution.<\/p><p>  We propose a humanitarian response for Roma who have no access to supports.  We need a response urgently to ensure that Roma are not living in destitution.  We argue that the Roma in Ireland and across Europe constitute a special case.  Roma have experienced discrimination and racism over generations and this has impacted on their access to education, training and employment.  We need to develop a response that takes this into account.  We suggest that funding be made available for training and supports specifically tailored for Roma so that they can gain employment.<\/p><p>  We ask for an impact assessment to be conducted on the habitual residence condition.  Other groups have also called for such an assessment.  The special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights has also recommended it in her most report in 2012.  A proper assessment of the impact of the habitual residence condition is required.  We believe these measures would pave the way for the inclusion of Roma in Irish society as well as reflecting a commitment to human rights.  As the current holder of the Presidency of the European Union and as a new member of the UN Human Rights Council, this is an opportunity for Ireland to show leadership in the area of human rights.  <\/p><p>  My colleague, Ms Gabi Muntean, will speak about the impact of the habitual residence condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600009#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Curran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360159200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I came to Ireland in 2000.  In 2007 I applied for child benefit.  I was told I was not habitually resident in Ireland.  I had been living in Ireland since 2000.  My son and my husband were living with me and I was engaged in a lot of voluntary work.  Finally, in 2007, after seven years living in Ireland, I received notice that I was regarded as habitually resident.<\/p><p>  I would like the committee to understand how difficult it was for me.  My family and I were very insecure because our application was pending.  We were not sure if we would be eligible for supplementary welfare allowance from week to week.  We were extremely lucky to receive the payment but this is no longer available to others.  One week we received no payment and I was terrified.  I thought I would be unable to survive in Ireland and I ended up in hospital.  It is very hard to go through this experience.  One of the biggest worries was that I would be refused child benefit.  My son was going to school and I could not afford to buy his uniform, his books or his lunch.  I have only one child but many Roma families have three, four, five or seven children.  Even with one child I find it very difficult to cope.  I ask the committee to imagine how difficult it is for larger families with lots of children.  They often cannot cope.  Sometimes they are unable to send their children to school.  In some cases, parents will send two or three children to school and keep the rest at home.  They need support to at least send the children to school.<\/p><p>  Some Roma have no income and they are forced to beg.  Begging is not our culture.  If they do not beg they will not be able to eat.  Children are living in extreme poverty and this is of concern to social workers who take the children away from their families in some cases.<\/p><p>  People should not be ignored just because they beg.  People have nothing and they have no entitlements.  They need to be given support.  We should not send people back to places where they may be in danger.  Roma need to be supported to find employment.  Some Roma are not well educated.  They may be illiterate and unable to speak fluent English.  These people need to be supported. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013020600009#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Gabi Muntean"},{"type":"speech","time":1360159200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank Ronnie, Gabi and Siobhan for their presentation.

Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about the number of Roma and how we address the fact that we do not have accurate statistics.  It is clear that in the census, for example, we need to ask a question about Roma and therefore an ethnic identifier should be included on the form.  That must happen across all systems including health, education and so on.  We must have ethnic identifiers across those areas.<\/p><p>  In the immediate term what could happen is a containable research project where we would map out where Roma are living in Ireland.  It is quite easy to do.  There are other models that could be followed where people try to get a census of homeless people in Ireland.  We could try to map where people are located.  We need the funding to do that but if we are to address the issues facing Roma in Ireland we must start developing evidencebased policies which would help us know who is here, where they are located, the needs they are expressing, and their rights.  That is the way we develop sensible policies.  That is clearly articulated in the common basic principles of the European Union.  They outline ten principles on working with Roma, the first of which is on evidence based policy making.  Any efforts in that regard and any support from the committee in trying to access the funding or ensuring that is done would be helpful.<\/p><p>  The Deputy spoke about the dedicated Roma project in Pavee Point.  Unfortunately, we received a cut to our local training initiative which is now gone.  That was a local training initiative specifically for training Roma participants.  The cut was absolute and therefore the training programme is no longer in operation.  People call in regularly to Pavee Point asking about a training programme for Roma in which they can engage.  A trust in Pavee Point has been built up over time that we must not lose sight of and must capitalise on because there are Roma people who want to engage with the structure of Pavee Point, and if we had a training programme they would engage with it.  <\/p><p>  We have submitted a proposal to F&Aacute;S for a primary health care programme for Roma.

Irish people who were away for a number years but who have returned to care for an elderly relative, for example, are encountering problems owing to the clause.  While it presents a difficulty, one must appreciate why it was put in place.  The Irish social welfare system has been quite generous.  If we did not have such a clause, the floodgates would open.  There is no doubt about that.  Having said that, the clause does not excuse circumstances in which any child must live in poverty.

They often move for several weeks, sometimes for several years, between the two jurisdictions, whether it is in the North or England.

This is based on the evidence from the all-Ireland Traveller health study which was undertaken by University College Dublin for the Department of Health and published in 2010.  The census gives a figure of 29,000 but the Central Statistics Office would recognise some of the weaknesses in its figures because some enumerators may have been afraid to go on sites and Traveller families living in double-upped accommodation who may not been counted.  The 36,000 figure is probably the more accurate.  We estimate the Roma population is 5,000.  If Travellers are 0.5% of the entire population, what does that make the Roma?  This has also to be seen in the context of the European Union population of Roma which is 15 million.<\/p><p>  We are saying that we need to invest in inclusion measures now rather than creating a separate sub-culture of poverty which will cost us more in the long run.  The bull must be taken by the horns now and integration should be proactively supported.  We mean that in the best possible sense.  We do not mean assimilation but respecting the different cultures.  We need to hold on to what is good in the culture and challenge what is negative.  Like all cultures, there are good and bad dimensions.<\/p><p>  In common with the groups that Senator Moloney mentioned, the HRC is having a negative impact on many other people other than who it was intended to affect when it was initially introduced.  It was designed to address welfare tourism which never materialised as the numbers are very small.  If one thinks about austerity and how Ireland is perceived in the European Union, I do not believe we are going to be awash with people coming to Ireland.  We need to be pragmatic and adopt a common-sense approach to this.  Several years ago, the HRC was a major issue for Travellers but those numbers have reduced.  Many Travellers are now staying in Britain or going there because they have no chance of development in Ireland.  The HRC is set down across the European Union.  How can Irish Travellers in Britain qualify for social welfare in Britain when they cannot in the Irish context?  I believe there are broader issues at play.<\/p><p>  It needs to be recognised that we need to build confidence among the Roma community when it comes to collating data on it, the same way we had to with Travellers.  The nationality data was used to exterminate Roma in concentration camps in the past.  Accordingly, they have a particular fear around data collection on ethnicity and nationality.  One has to work with the community on this and they have to understand the value of the data which will inform evidence-based policy, counter discrimination and develop new initiatives.

However, I wish to challenge the change made by the commission in its report of the name of the constituency from Dublin South-East to Dublin Bay South, and I do not believe this challenge undermines the independence of the commission.  Dublin South-East was established in 1947 by the 13th D&aacute;il.  It is a constituency made up of well-known townships and includes Ringsend, Sandymount, Donnybrook, Rathmines and Terenure among others, and all have a sense of place in the constituency.  The area the furthest from Dublin Bay is 6 km away and the constituency has only approximately 2 km of seafront.<\/p><p>  If we wanted to change constituency names, perhaps Carlow-Kilkenny could be named river view.  It has more kilometres of a river view than Dublin South-East has of Dublin Bay.  Ingrained in the proposed constituency name change is the suggestion that Dublin South-East does not have a sense of place, but it has.  I know the Minister believes strongly in county jerseys.  Dublin is made up of several communities with clear identities, but this proposal does not recognise the identity Dublin South-East has and its long association with that name.  The constituency had two former Fine Gael taoisigh, John A. Costello and Garrett FitzGerald.  It also had Noel Browne and former party leaders, such as John Gormley, Ruair&iacute; Quinn and Michael McDowell.  The area has a very strong identity and no submission was made to the Constituency Commission for a change of name.<\/p><p>  The only criteria for changing the name to Dublin Bay South seems to be to provide a balance between the north side of the city and the south side.

The delegation represents trade union views and the experience of our members in broadcasting and publishing newspapers.  I will give an overview of the freedom of information legislation and Mr. Dooley will go into more detail.<\/p><p>  It is the view of the NUJ that for freedom of information to work, every society and public body needs to make a decision to overcome a legacy and ethos of secrecy.  We inherited this legacy with a very organised Civil Service from the British authorities on our independence.  The \"do not tell, do not reveal and obfuscate\" ethos is in the DNA of official Ireland.  Perhaps it goes back to the playing of hide-and-seek with the body of Richard III, but the idea of telling, openly revealing and being forthright is not one we inherited or created in our society.<\/p><p>  A previous review of the legislation by senior officials and the Minister was a little self-serving, to put it bluntly, and it brought us back to many decades prior to the 1997 Act.  An example of this is that many bodies do not publish online information they have already released under the freedom of information legislation, and if another journalist or member of the public seeks the same information they are sometimes told to submit a freedom of information request for it, even though the information has already been gathered and is already in the public domain.<\/p><p>  We welcome the extension of the list of bodies to be included in the Bill, but we think it regrettable that commercial semi-State bodies are excluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Curran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360143300,"counter":184,"content":"<p>The American lawyer and biographer James Huneker once stated: \"Lawyers earn their bread in the sweat of their browbeating.\"  It strikes me that, in this environment, politicians and journalists also have this in common.  Today is the committee members' turn to question the questioners, particularly the practitioners.  Ms O'Kelly, Mr. Brennan, Mr. Foxe and Mr. &Oacute; Mong&aacute;in are more regular users of the Act than I am as a full-time official, although I use FOI legislation as a union official.<\/p><p>  Our submission deals with the proposed legislation on a head-by-head basis.  Rather than going through our written submission, which the committee has read, I will deal with one section in particular and explain our thinking on the matter.  We have dealt at length with the issue of fees.  Our strong preference is for the abolition of fees.  Access to information, personal and public, is a feature of a modern functional democracy.  Eithne FitzGerald, in drafting the original legislation, was clear that freedom of information was a right, not a privilege.  Over the years, this culture has been reversed.<\/p><p>  In the past 24 hours, we have learned - not for the first time - some of the lessons of what can occur when the State and powerful institutions collude in secret under cover of darkness.  It is no coincidence that the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, campaign, that led to the first Act was called \"Let in the Light\".  Freedom of information is an ethos.  It is not legislation or an administrative mechanism.  In this context, the total abolition of fees would be our preferred option.<\/p><p>  I am a trade union official, though, and we sometimes deal in compromises, but only sometimes.  We realise that, in the current environment, abolition may be a difficult argument to win.  If winning is not possible, I suggest that there should be a public interest element that would enable the waiving of fees where the query was demonstrably in the public interest.  The reality is that many organisations, on a grace and favour basis, use a common-sense approach, but common sense is a commodity not always guaranteed.  Therefore, we need to consider a public interest defence with a possible appeal where an organisation refuses.  What do I mean by this?  There are people around this table, Mr. Foxe being an example, whose work was clearly in the public interest, but the organisation should not have been required to pay to serve that interest.<\/p><p>  The current fee structure, particularly the insistence on up-front payments, is a problem for freelance journalists, small independent organisations and regional newspapers.  If the committee needs an example of the value of small media organisations or freelance journalists working with the power of a media organisation, I will provide one name - Ms Mary Raftery, who did much to highlight the abuse of vulnerable women.  Ms Raftery was a freelance journalist who, in making freelance queries over the years, was required to pay for information.  Who would have doubted that the information she used in her daily work was in the public interest?  We represent people like her throughout the country.<\/p><p>  The editors and reporters of regional newspapers with whom I have spoken in the past week admit that the current charging structure and the up-front nature of the payment - this was one of the changes brought about by the \"Cheltenham Two\" when they introduced the amendment before heading off to the Cheltenham races, leaving a Cabinet colleague to present the Bill despite the work of Deputy Sean Fleming and other Members on the previous committee - act as disincentives.  Our members in the regional and national media as well as online journalists are united on one issue, namely, that the current charging structure is a disincentive.  Coupled with the ethos, one is buying a pig in a poke.  Sometimes, one cannot even find the pig.<\/p><p>  Due to the deadline, our submission does not deal with every section of the Bill, but I reiterate Mr. Curran's concerns about the exemptions regarding commercial bodies.  For example, we do not believe that Irish Water should be exempt from public scrutiny.  The Act makes provision for commercial sensitivity without the imposition of a blanket exclusion.  I cannot understand why communications between Irish Water and a regulator cannot be deemed to be in the public interest.<\/p><p>  The initial legislation was the result of widespread consultation with stakeholders.  The establishment of a users' group was a valuable mechanism for giving stakeholders, including the NUJ and citizens' groups, a forum for feedback.  It enabled the promotion of training in the use of FOI, and sometimes training in the need not to use FOI.  It gave users a role in monitoring the Act's implementation.  The users' group was never abolished.  Surreally, it just disappeared.  When the Act was amended, we raised the issue - in this room, I believe, under the then chairmanship of Deputy Fleming - of why the groups had not been consulted.  The former Deputy Conor Lenihan blamed the group for a failure to be convened.  Without access to FOI, I tried to get the minutes of the group.  Surreally, even some of those cannot be found.<\/p><p>  I ask the committee to give consideration to restoring the group.  I hope the committee will raise the matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  The group would be a useful way to monitor on an ongoing basis the use of the Act, including its unnecessary usage, and to assist in the development of the ethos to which Mr. Curran referred.<\/p><p>  While FOI legislation is useful for journalists, it is not designed for them.  Rather, it is designed for all citizens.  The mechanisms and procedures involved in the appeal systems mean that it is not the most efficient method of securing public information in a 24-hour media environment.  As a trade union official and someone who deals with community groups and is involved in civic society, I am aware of the potential value of FOI as a tool of citizenship, but my comments on charges also apply to those who may be deterred from making requests concerning information about their local communities because of costs.<\/p><p>  The proposed changes are welcome despite our stated reservations, but without an ethos of open government that permeates the system of public administration, journalists and citizens will continue to encounter barriers in accessing information that by definition, as they are citizens of a republic, is their property.<\/p><p>  We will now take questions from members of the committee.  Questions would more usefully be directed to the users, but Mr. Curran and I are also available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1360143300,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Curran and Mr. Dooley.

I will put some observations and questions to them because we are more interested in their views than they are interested in listening to us.  We can express our own views at subsequent meetings and we have many people to meet.<\/p><p>  There is a practical issue with regard to fees.  It was mentioned in the submission that the Office of the Information Commissioner had fees of approximately &euro;5,000 last year.  I am sure the cost of establishing the administration system, programming computers, setting up an accounts, receipts and acknowledgement system, along with an auditing system, was a multiple of the &euro;5,000 which was received.  Public bodies at local level may get four requests in a year, with income of less than &euro;100; nevertheless, the cost of processing the requests may have run to several thousand euro.  I know some bigger organisations deal with more requests.  I am inclined towards the view that the cost of processing the fees in many organisations is higher than the fee income received.  Perhaps the witnesses may be correct to reconsider the view of not having fees.<\/p><p>  There is an undercurrent in what has been said about fees.  By and large, journalists never indicate that there are no fees for personal information.  We have heard much about the fees but there was a reduction in requests for personal information when the legislation was introduced some time ago, notwithstanding the fact there was no fee for personal information.  The barrage of publicity through the NUJ gave the clear impression that fees existed, which put people off.  I ask the witnesses to consider putting the other side of the equation out there, as people have been put off making individual requests.<\/p><p>  With the likes of NAMA, the Minister holds the view that commercial State organisations working in competition should not have an arm tied behind their back.  An example of such competition would be RTE and TV3, as TV3 is not covered by freedom of information legislation.  If there is a State monopoly, as there is with Irish Rail, EirGrid and Irish Water, with no competition issues, is there any question that they should be included?  Mr. Foxe seems to have indicated that even organisations in competitive business should be automatically included in the freedom of information umbrella, and exemptions could arise afterwards that deal with commercial sensitivity.<\/p><p>  One facet of the legislation has not been addressed in the debate.  All Departments are subject to freedom of information legislation but there are exemptions in every Department for a variety of reasons.  A request could be made to several Departments but it could be refused because of an exemption.  Has the NUJ run into that issue?  There are dozens of exemptions.<\/p><p>  We can have more transparency but less information.  If people believe their thoughts will be placed in the public sphere, they may commit less information to the record.  I am somewhat concerned that we could have full transparency but little substantive information.  What is the view of the witnesses in that regard?  For example, there has been discussion of a banking inquiry taking place through the Oireachtas, and the people most resistant to the idea are public servants.  Some former colleagues may not emerge in a good light and they may not want to be exposed when they leave office.  Politicians would have no problem speaking in public, as they have always done.  The \"Sir Humphrey\" process is alive and well in that regard, and politicians tend to be more open when officials do not have a hold on them.<\/p><p>  Do the witnesses agree that most of the work done in the NAMA name is not carried out by the agency but rather by receivers, administrators or individual property owners who sell by private treaty with the consent of NAMA?  The beneficial interest would be the taxpayer.  If the beneficial interest of the Irish taxpayer is involved, should the likes of receivers, administrators and private treaty sellers of property be included?<\/p><p>  There is the question of legal protection for freedom of information requests, which we all know about.  There is legal protection by issuing information through the freedom of information process but there may not be the same legal protection if the issue is raised by means of correspondence.  Do the witnesses agree that the anomaly should be eliminated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600005#F00800","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1360143900,"counter":194,"content":"<p>We have much to get through and if there is a litany of questions to be followed by a litany of answers, it will be difficult for journalists to report and the broadcasting unit to cover it.

There are ways to reduce the cost of information, with one being the placement of the information on websites, reducing the necessity for freedom of information requests.  Putting more information on websites would reduce the number of freedom of information requests.<\/p><p>  Placing basic information - including information relating to Members of these Houses - on a website would have certain effects.  The information would be more easily available and as a result, some information would cease to be news.

I agree that if a substantial amount of material was published in the first instance, there would not be any need for freedom of information requests.  I will give an example I was discussing before coming to this meeting.  Several years ago, I submitted a request to the Department of Education and Skills seeking information on what was being taught in religion class in certain schools in west Dublin.  One would expect that it would be simple to find the information I was seeking as it was documentation on the design of the curriculum.  However, it took me almost two and a half years to obtain it as my requests were refused at every stage.  Interestingly, I was initially informed by the Department that I would need to submit freedom of information requests to the vocational education committees to obtain the information I sought because they were running the schools in question.  However, as I knew the VECs were not subject to freedom of information legislation, I wondered if the person who gave me this direction - it may not have been the same person to whom I spoke - also knew that I would not be able to obtain the information by contacting the vocational education committees because legislation had not been passed and the Minister was still the patron.  I persisted but the information was refused and refused again on appeal.  I took a case to the Ombudsman and eventually received the information solely because I made it known to the Department that I planned to do a story on the fact that I could not get it.  At that point, after almost two and a half years of trying, I was given the information.<\/p><p>  Exemption seems to be the rule.  Seeking information is almost like navigating a maze.  One must anticipate the exemptions that will put in place and try to figure out a way around them.  We would like this culture to change.

We accept, however, that a compromise position may be necessary.  The cost of processing freedom of information requests is very high and the time required to process cheques is very long.  There is no easy way to pay for a request.  A simple, straightforward process should be introduced for payment, perhaps through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While we hope fees will not be applied, if they are applied, payment should be made as easy as possible for journalists and others.  A simpler system would also assist the public service as one would not have a freedom of information officer sending out a letter on headed notepaper requesting payment and then sending back an acknowledgement on receipt of the cheque, all of which takes time and is probably a waste of money.  Surely in the modern era, we can find a better way of doing this.<\/p><p>  In regard to Deputy Sean Fleming's point on receivers, in some ways NAMA is a commissioning body and it has people doing all kinds of work.  We hope the Act will cover all the information that flows back to NAMA from the people in question.  While I expect the Act will not be extended to receivers, all of the information that flows from them to NAMA should be covered.  As Mr. Dooley indicated in respect of the contracts NAMA has in place, it is a vast piece of work for people.  We do not have any information other than that gleaned from replies to parliamentary questions tabled by Deputies.  These are the prime source of information on NAMA.  An extension of the Act is crucial to help journalists and members of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1360144500,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I will tease out two of the points made by Mr. Brennan.

When we examined the matter in user groups we found that one person was clogging up the system and appropriate action was taken, through the legislation, to deal with him.  Provisions are in place to deal with vexatious users.  The way to deal with excessive use of freedom of information legislation is to make information available outside the Act and provide regular training for citizens.  The NUJ, in co-operation with the Department, used to provide training on the use of the Act, but this has not been provided in recent years.<\/p><p>  While I accept Deputy Fleming's point on personal fees, we take that as a given.

As Mr. Foxe stated, the Department of Justice and Equality often does not publish all of its reports.  One could request a report which has been lying on the shelf for a year or two and one might still be refused.  There is quite a secretive attitude within the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of many matters.<\/p><p>  If one wants to discover what is happening with the Vatican Embassy and whether there is a chance of it reopening, one's requests in this regard will be blocked for reasons of diplomatic immunity.

If one seeks details from a State agency as to why someone was paid &euro;90,000 or &euro;100,000 in compensation by the Department of Education and Skills in respect of an accident in a school, one will usually receive minimal information on the grounds that such information is personal in nature.

For example, the banking inquiries that have taken place to date were backstopped at the date of the announcement of the guarantee at the end of September 2008.  The fog which has fallen into place since then constitutes a type of FOI shield.  For example, FOI requests cannot be submitted in respect of NAMA, the NTMA or certain meetings with the ECB and the EU.  Pertinent questions relating to landmark points, and pivotal decisions and actions taken, along the route from September 2008 to the present cannot be asked.  For example, the final tranche of senior secured debt within in the IBRC was literally redeemed on the day on which the guarantee expired, namely, 30 September.  That was the same day on which those in the banks had begun to admit the losses that had been made.  The figure in this regard was not the final one.  When I made attempts over a period of three weeks to obtain information with regard to who was approving what and why there was no public debate in respect of the redemption of these bonds, the telephones at the Central Bank, the regulator and the IBRC went dead.  That was not good enough because the payment involved amounted to &euro;7.9 billion and it was made with exceptional liquidity assistance.  Again, this was only made legal and allowable through the creation of a promissory note.

One of the difficulties we as parliamentarians have is when one tables a question on a matter such as the National Transport Authority which extends beyond the immediate remit of the Minister concerned, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, one will receive a reply to the effect that this is a matter for such an agency.<\/p><p>  It is not appropriate to make reference to the officials but, to take the approach of Sir Humphrey, I have heard the mental reservation response been used to such requests.  Whenever I hear that type of response it reminds me of Peter Sellers in the sketch \"Does your dog bite\" where he said, \"No, my dog does not bite\".  Eventually the man walked up to the counter and dog bit him and he said, \"I thought you said your dog does not bite\" to which he replied, \"That is not my dog\".  The mental reservation response is different from deliberate obfuscation, deliberate hiding or deliberately removing files or destroying them knowing that a request for the information will be submitted.  If such practices were to be found out, there are sanctions and penalties to be applied.  Would the witnesses have ideas regarding the mental reservation response which is a response we would get to information sought in parliamentary questions?  I refer to where the questioner would know the intent of the question and even though it does not fall specifically within the remit, they would deliberately avoid giving a response to it.

If one submits a question, the public servant should not say that the person has sent in the wrong question or that the question should be referred somewhere else, but there is a system in place whereby if a question goes to the Department of Communications, Energy and National Resources and it should have gone to another Department, that request is forwarded.  In other words, this goes back to a culture and the onus here is that the freedom of information request needs to be seen as something that one facilitates rather than obstructs.  An army of public servants on a daily basis deal efficiently with freedom of information requests and they do exactly what I described.

I am sure it is similar for TDs and Senators who pursue the same course of action.  In that respect, it is being done in the public interest.  The dissemination of information is also in the public interest.  The media is commercial but it just happens to be in the business of information.  It is a logical knock-on that some benefit is derived from it.  However, as regards some of the information that Deputy Mathews was talking about - including the minutiae and a forensic building of the picture that might be needed - there is no splash as a result of that.  Ironically, that is the kind of public interest information that is hard to get at and which makes the least front-page noise.

Would they outline the practice in other countries, if they know it, or have they a view on it?<\/p><p>  This is what I would call the broader societal impact of freedom of information.  The conversation on this issue in which we have been involved so far has been dealing with public bodies.  The only reason we are dealing with public bodies is the Government runs the country, but such bodies are funded by the taxpayer.  If the taxpayer pays for an organisation, there should be public accountability and information.  Government activities are only a fraction of public life.  I refer to broader society.  Many organisations have a much greater impact on the public than have some public bodies.  I seek their view on how we should proceed on freedom of information on private companies, whether it be the food sector, banking, financial and, especially, the private media, whether print or electronic.  For instance, there is not a house in Ireland that has not got mobile phones, a landline and television.  The major private companies have a greater impact on daily life than have some Departments and quangos.  Church, sporting and cultural organisations have a major impact.  Citizens' right to information on how major organisations in the country affect their lives is as important.  All such organisations are excluded merely because the taxpayer does not fund them.  Now that I am listening to this debate, I realise it is a very narrow one.  I should be entitled to information about how, for instance, the GAA and the church run their business if I think it is relevant, or how Vodafone decides not to provide a signal somewhere, not to waste money or to put it somewhere else.  Such issues are as important to citizens' daily lives as whether the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine issued a veterinary inspection to somebody or whatever the case may be.<\/p> <p>Has Mr. Dooley a view on that issue?

My perspective would be similar to that of the previous witnesses from the National Union of Journalists.  I work as a journalist and also as a transparency advocate.  I will give members some background information on the website I am representing here today.<\/p><p>  In 2009 myself and a friend, Mr. Mark Coughlan, set up the <i>thestory.ie<\/i> website with a view to systemising the approach to accessing information.  Our idea was that we would begin submitting FOI requests at a more systematic level than was the case previously.  We decided to approach it from a getting information point of view rather than a getting stories point of view.  We decided to systemise the approach to FOI and to, for example, ask the same question of multiple authorities and try to obtain better information.  In the first year we focused very much on obtaining data as opposed to documents.  In the first instance, we were focused on getting expenses data because at the time, the scandal about former Deputy John O'Donoghue was unfolding and Mr. Ken Foxe of <i>thestory.ie<\/i> was involved with that.  We were interested, not necessarily in salaciousness or in getting stories but rather in the idea that public authorities should actually be publishing a lot of this information proactively.  We felt that if we could get data efficiently and then put that information into the public domain, perhaps more people would see what is going on within those authorities.  When I say people, I mean the general public as well as those working in the public authorities.  <\/p><p>  Within the first few weeks of setting up the website, the public came to us and asked what they could do to help and obviously the fees are the biggest issue.  We have submitted more than 140 FOI requests in the last three years under the Act.  We have spent in the region of &euro;4,500 on those requests and have published a very large amount of documents and data obtained under the Act.  That has led to stories in newspapers but has also led to engagement with our own relatively small readership.  The value of the website is that people can see the original documents as released and make their own judgments, in some cases, about the merits of a story.  We have published a very large database of Government expenditure, for example, which allows people to see spending data from individual Departments.  I believe that the Departments themselves could probably publish that data.  In many cases it is not difficult to obtain the data or to publish it.  <\/p><p>  On the proposed amendment, one of the issues that relates closely to what we do is expenditure.  Fees play a big role in how we approach the legislation.  We do not just submit FOI requests to Irish public authorities but also to authorities in the UK and the European Union.  We have submitted a very substantial number of requests to the European Central Bank on the promissory notes and on what was said, or not said, by Mr. Jean Claude Trichet to former Deputy Brian Lenihan in November 2010, for example.  We also take a very systematic approach to the appeals process and have taken a number of appeals under the FOI legislation to the Office of the Information Commissioner.  We have also used regulations which are not directly related to the freedom of information legislation to obtain information, most notably the Access to Information on the Environment Regulations 2007, as amended in 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600012#N01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Sheridan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360148700,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Can I draw Mr. Sheridan out on this point?

While there was a time when it simply would have gone into a filing cabinet, it now gets scanned into the computer and is logged with the constituent's details.  However, there is a degree of effort and work involved in turning a regular document into a PDF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600013#O01200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360148700,"counter":315,"content":"<p>There is and what the Act, as it currently stands, provides for is the information should be given in the format requested, if that is not more difficult to do than in another format.  I certainly do not wish to attribute malice to any of this.  I would say it is done because it often is not known.  In other jurisdictions, if one asks for a particular format, one will get that format.  As the Chairman has pointed out, a table is not very useful if it is just a table on a PDF file.  I cannot really do anything with it.  I cannot carry out simple calculations like pivoting the table within the spreadsheet and cannot analyse, for example, spending data within the spreadsheet.  This certainly is an issue and while it already is covered in the Act to an extent, the provisions could be strengthened.<\/p><p>  This comes back to a larger issue, which is records management in general within Government authorities.  This brings in the reason the fee structure was introduced in the first place - or the purported reason it was introduced - which was that it was a burden on the Department to answer requests.  I was in Scotland last week to speak at a conference on freedom of information and I spoke to the Scottish information commissioner on the same subject.  She is cognisant of the fact that there is no fee structure in the United Kingdom or in Scotland for upfront fees.  They simply take an approach that if one creates better record management structures within government, it becomes more efficient for people to ask for information.  Moreover, because there are no upfront fees, it almost forces the hand of the Government to try to be more organised about how requests are handled.  If the Government authorities are better organised in respect of their filing systems, it is much easier for them to give out information and they can manage their own records much more efficiently.  I studied the 2011 figures from Emily O'Reilly in respect of fees and under the non-personal section, the Government collected &euro;87,000.  One issue with that is that the &euro;15 fee actually is costing more to manage itself----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600013#O01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1360148700,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Did Mr. Sheridan submit an FOI request on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600013#O01400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360148700,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Well, I looked at other analyses and spoke to people in Scotland, where they have conducted analyses on how much, for example, an invoice costs to process when it comes into a Government authority.

However, the Minister admitted that an analysis has never been done here.  No analysis has ever actually been carried out to ascertain how much the fee structure costs.  On balance, it is a punitive charge and seems to constitute a block to members of the public.  They do not have cheque books and are not used to printing out stuff.  They cannot just send an e-mail asking for information.  This is a huge issue because the upfront &euro;50 fee has no net benefit.  When I send in the &euro;15 to a Department, on its arrival the officials could simply burn it, as the cost of administering the cheque is lost in the actual processing thereof.  It is important to note that were there an allowance for electronic submission and were the &euro;15 fee to be removed to allow this to happen, the public would have greater participation in democracy.  I also made the point in my submission that arguably, under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, I have a right to freedom of expression.  In recent rulings of the European Court of Human Rights, a connection has been made to the right to freedom of expression under Article 10.  How can one have full freedom of expression unless one has access to information?  This connection has been made in a couple of court cases and my argument is that in a way, the infringement of my rights to information also is an infringement of my rights to freedom of expression.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600013#O01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1360148700,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sheridan for his attendance and wish to tease out a few points on which I seek his views.  On the issue of search and retrieval, we concentrate a lot on the fees and there is an emerging consensus, although it might not yet have landed on the desks of those officials who are drafting the legislation, that most people now accept the cost of processing the application fee is far greater than the value of the fee.  Consequently, it actually is a net cost to the Irish taxpayer to have that fee in place to start with.  However, I will move on to the second aspect pertaining to the search and retrieval fee.  I produced draft legislation last summer, namely, the Freedom of Information (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  The Minister accepted it in principle and it fed into the process in which we now are engaged.  Last February, I tabled a series of parliamentary questions about the search and retrieval fees.  The reason was that something came up in the budget announced more than a year ago and I was interested in the reason the Minister made a statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600013#O01800","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360149300,"counter":322,"content":"<p>There are several issues connected with search and retrieval fees.  First, once a person puts in a request an estimate comes back from the public authority.  That estimate may often mean the death of the FOI request because it is so large.  We have been submitting them fairly regularly for three years and I have noticed that the fee estimates have started ramping up in the past 12 months.  I am not sure whether a decision was made to start doing that.  It is worth noting that when the search and retrieval estimate comes in and the FOI request fails, that fee is not collected.  I have received search and retrieval fee estimates of &euro;29,000 for what I thought was relatively innocuous information that could easily have been retrieved.  The ability to argue one's case around the search and retrieval fee estimate is fairly limited in the legislation.  One can try to appeal it to the Information Commissioner.  It is not entirely clear whether one should pay the &euro;75 internal review fee to see whether the fee was there or whether it should or should not be there.  Should we pay the &euro;75 to get the internal review to see if the fee is there?  I have received various answers, even from the Office of the Information Commissioner, as to whether the &euro;75 charge should be there at all for that process.  It is not clear whether it should be charged.<\/p><p>  Search and retrieval fees are a huge barrier.  I know from the legislation that the Oireachtas has considered adopting the UK-style cap on search and retrieval fees.  In the UK, upfront fees have been considered, but the decision was not to charge them.  It has been decided that there should be free time and if a request takes longer than that time and the fee is &pound;600 or above, the request fails.  I would not be averse to that.  Search and retrieval fees are becoming quite high and often I do not think this is legitimate.  We could have some provision to limit the process.  The legislation has exemptions which work really well if they are applied correctly.  For example, section 10(1)(<i>c<\/i>) is a volume issue; one has asked for too much.  Under section 10(2) I can say I am prepared to narrow the scope to reduce the volume.<\/p><p>  Sometimes when we receive a fee estimate we are told it will take 40 hours to search and retrieve this information.  How is that calculated?  If the FOI officer is providing reasonable assistance, as he or she is obliged to do under the Act, it must depend on how the record is held.  Is it held efficiently?  Do I have to pay for an inefficiently held record in a search and retrieval process?  That is not fair.  If the records are held efficiently it should not be that hard to get them.  Search and retrieval fees reinforce the notion that accessing information is a privilege rather than a right.  I have to pay for access to something.  While I accept that there might be fees involved, I do not think those fees should be prohibitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600014#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1360149300,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Sheridan tell me about the exemptions in the legislation?  In most or maybe all Departments there are items of legislation in which exemptions are listed stating that certain information cannot be released.  Although, for example, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is subject to the FOI Act, there might be items on which one wants information but an exemption prevents disclosure of specific information.  That has not featured sufficiently in our debate.  The Information Commissioner and the committee are obliged by law to review those every five years.  I think we did it once.  I was involved in it on one occasion.  These exemptions have flown under the radar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600014#P00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360149300,"counter":324,"content":"<p>The exemptions generally start from section 19 in the legislation.  For section 19 the proposed amendment is to lengthen Cabinet access.  In the 2003 amendment Act that Fianna F&aacute;il brought in, the five-year rule for access to communications and Cabinet records was increased to a ten-year rule.  The proposed legislation proposes to bring that back from ten years to five, which is a good thing.  The most commonly used exemptions in my experience are section 27, which is commercial sensitivity, and section 28, which is personal information.  Unfortunately, I increasingly see the exemptions applied incorrectly.  I may get a reply from an FOI officer saying that certain records have been exempted for personal information reasons, but I may have submitted the same request before to another Department which said it was not personal, or I may have successfully appealed the issue to the Information Commissioner but that did not trickle down to the FOI officer, so I have to appeal it again.  I go back through the &euro;15, &euro;75 and &euro;150 process but I do not get any of that money back.  The &euro;75 goes, whether I am successful or not.  The &euro;150 to the Information Commissioner comes back only if one reaches a settlement with the Government authority.  If one cannot reach agreement at settlement one loses &euro;150 through the process and the Information Commissioner will make a decision at some point.  It can take six months to three years to get a decision because of the resources available to the Information Commissioner.<\/p><p>  The exemptions are generally applied inconsistently.  That goes back to the issue of whether there is adequate training for FOI officers in all Departments and agencies covered by the Act.  Maybe when the Act is extended as proposed under this legislation it should make a point of stating that training should be done consistently and regularly across the public service, because I increasingly see that sections are not applied correctly.  Often spurious refusals are made and one is left in the invidious position of wondering whether to spend the &euro;75 and &euro;150 fees just to make a point.  If the upfront fees did not exist, the process would be much more efficient.<\/p><p>  On a related point, a &euro;37,000 bonus was handed back as a result of a journalist's FOI request and story.  Does that &euro;37,000 count against all the future FOI requests from that journalist?  No, it does not.  The taxpayer, however, obtained a net benefit from that process because money was returned that probably should not have been paid.  These issues with regard to the approach to accessing information need to be factored in.  A total of &euro;90,000 a year is brought in as fees but much of it is lost in administration.  That is not very effective and does not take into account the broader benefits of better records management.  It is the job of journalists to hold authority to account and money comes back to the State as a result of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600014#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1360149300,"counter":325,"content":"<p>My last point is the one I raised at the very end of our meeting with the NUJ, the broader societal right to information.  All of the debate on this legislation and everything that has been written and presented to us about it concerns freedom of information in Government bodies, agencies and public bodies, excluding some commercial semi-State companies and matters of commercial sensitivity and personal information.  It is as if the legislation deals only with organisations funded by the taxpayer, but there are many organisations that have more impact on the daily lives of citizens than some Government bodies.  Within the private sector, for example, there is the banking and financial sector.  If those institutions are in private hands they can have much more impact on people's lives than any Government body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600014#P00500","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360149900,"counter":327,"content":"<p>They are covered in the sense that the Data Protection Act, as it stands at the moment, allows individuals to access information about themselves from private companies.  One can ask any company that has information that relates to one'self to release that information.  The Deputy asked about broadening the scope of the freedom of information legislation.  The Government is saying it will not include semi-State organisations in this legislation for reasons of commercial sensitivity.  I do not think that holds any water because the original Act has a commercial sensitivity provision.  If that provision were applied to these organisations, we could just go through the normal process.  The NAMA authorities have argued strongly for a special exemption to be made for NAMA.  I think it is incorrect that the public interest test will not apply to section 27.  The law should stand or fall on its merits.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's suggestion that the freedom of information regime should be broadened to private companies, there is an international movement to make large international non-governmental organisations more transparent.  That does not necessarily involve the use of the stick approach of legislation.  The carrot approach involves trying to convince large organisations that take money from the public to some degree, including non-governmental organisations and charities, that they should be more transparent about what they spend that money on.  The World Bank, for example, has made a large push in the last two years to become more proactive in its publication of large amounts of data that nobody could access until recently.  The same argument applies to many charities and non-governmental organisations, including Amnesty International.  The current campaign aimed at standardising the approach to such organisations is underpinned by the idea that one should be able to ask them certain questions about what they are doing.  At the moment, the contents of such organisations' annual reports mark the limit of what we know about what is going on in them.<\/p><p>  I am not sure about the case for extending the freedom of information regime to individual private companies like mobile telephone companies.  There would be a cost attached to that.  We have spent a large part of this meeting talking about fees.  I think there is merit in what the Deputy is saying.  I am not sure how it could be implemented practically.  I suggest that industry would ask what the benefit of a changed approach would be.  Companies would want to know whether it would cost them money.  Would the company mentioned by the Deputy increase its mobile telephone bills in order to fund the process of people asking questions?  I suppose I would be neutral on the issue of providing for a much broader remit.  Certainly, I do not see why non-governmental organisations that are publicly funded should not be subject to freedom of information.  This approach is certainly being considered in many other jurisdictions.  Serbia probably has the best freedom of information legislation in the world because requests are entirely free and 60,000 public authorities are covered by it.  The Serbian authorities have taken a very broad view of what is a public authority.<\/p><p>  I would like to mention the access to information on the environment regulations in this context.  It is not envisaged that a waste management company in Dublin, which is technically a private limited for-profit company, will be covered by the new freedom of information legislation.  Under the access to information on the environment system, which is related to this legislation, such a company can be deemed to be carrying out a public service - waste management - on behalf of a public authority and to have a contracted relationship with that authority.  One could argue that such a company is technically a public authority because it does an act for which a public authority is responsible.  I would certainly go that far.  I would broaden the definition of a \"public authority\" to make it much more general.  I would make it clear that a company which is doing things of this nature should be subject to some kind of scrutiny by the public, in terms of how information can be accessed from that company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600015#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1360149900,"counter":328,"content":"<p>That is an interesting observation because this country's waste management strategy is based on the idea that the role of the Government and the local authority system should be to develop policy in this area before contracting out the implementation of that policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600015#Q00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360149900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>It is worth noting that governments around the world are increasing their use of public private partnerships and developing their relationships with companies that are carrying out things that Governments would previously have carried out.

Proactive publication and good record management are good for everybody, not least from a public relations perspective.  If the Government published all of its spending data on a quarterly basis, journalists would not get that many scoops because all of the information would already be in the public domain.  If such information was published routinely, the journalists would not have to send in as many freedom of information requests.  On the question of the future of the legislation, I suggest that we have an opportunity to provide for a much more fundamental reform of the Act.  It is a little unfortunate that it seems this opportunity might be about to be missed to some degree.  We need to examine international best practice and consider what has been learned in other jurisdictions.  If we study our closest neighbours, we can see how Scotland and the rest of the UK are adjusting, not just in terms of what the legislation does but also in terms of its implementation, which is extremely important because it leads to a better right of access for the public.  The involvement of the media is tangential.  As we move on, there will be a greater overlap between a person asking a body for information and that body making its own decision to publish that information.  I think we should have both.  The Government should have an open data policy whereby large volumes of data on things like spending are put into the public domain.  At the same time, if something is contentious, I should have the ability to ask for information on it and, if it is refused, go through the appeals process at a minimum cost.  In such circumstances, a neutral third party like the Information Commissioner should make a ruling on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600015#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1360149900,"counter":332,"content":"<p>The perceived concern is that when information is provided under freedom of information in its original format, which may be a financial cost table, spreadsheet or database, such a record might reveal more than what the applicant is actually looking for.

I live in one of its centres with my three children, one of whom is almost grown up.  We need to know how children in asylum centres are affected by the children's rights referendum passed last year.  For example, does the Government bear full or part responsibility for these children, or are their parents responsible for them?  Their social development is bad.  There are always complaints about how unsocial they are at school, but everybody forgets where and how they are growing up and about the confined spaces in which they are living.  Many such families do not have or know what a microwave oven is because the space in which they are living is so small that there is no room for one.  I am concerned about food, living conditions and health and safety at the centre in which I have lived for the past seven years, as it is infested with rats and cockroaches.  Some residents, including me, try to keep the centre clean, including the outside spaces, and would like to know who is responsible for all of these issues.<\/p><p>  On the Geneva Convention, we need transparency on whether Ireland complies with it in full or in part.  Another issue of concern is the number who have died while in direct provision accommodation.  We need to know how many have died, the causes of death, the centres at which they died and about the care they received while there.  In 2008 I helped to care for a sick woman at my hostel until she was taken to hospital, where she later died.  What is the point of people being granted refugee status when they are being buried in Ireland and what should happen to children in places such as Africa whose parents are buried here?  <\/p><p>  I would like to tell a little of my story.  I am not sure if I am crossing the line because I am subject to a petition order of remand, but I do not really mind what the outcome will be.  What I do mind about, however, is what happens when one tries to report a matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When I first came to this country, I went to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to report how I had been brought here and so on.  I could not tell it at the time that I was seeking asylum.  I was so fearful I could not even speak to people staying at the hostel.  I later managed to come out of my shell and go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tell it I had discovered where the person concerned was staying.  When I asked for help, I was asked if he had been abusive or beaten me.  Did I have to be beaten to be listened to?

The residents in Eyre Powell hostel in Newbridge, County Kildare, last year contacted the local media about conditions in the hostel, including the food provided.

The security firms subcontracted to mind the centres were mentioned.  It is a little bit like a 21st century equivalent of the Magdalen laundry experience.  It is a tightly chaperoned type of experience when the children go to school and where they do two thirds of their living.  Approximately eight hours of the day might be spent at school or otherwise while two thirds, or 16 hours, are spent within the confines of the centre.<\/p><p>  It is timely and relevant that we get visibility of these centres.

Hopefully, one thing that will come out of this first engagement with the Oireachtas is that they might go on and try to be heard by other committees dealing with some of the other aspects of the situation they are in.  Our particular job is to identify how we can mend the draft legislation in such a way as to assist and shine a light on the refugee and asylum process, which the witnesses have described as a process that really needs to be looked at and be much more transparent.  However, what we need to know is what we have to do to this legislation to achieve that end for them.  It is absolutely clear to me - and, I suspect to most of the committee members - that this needs to be done.<\/p><p>  My view is that there is a total veil of secrecy over this process because it essentially keeps those concerned away from the rest of the community and facilitates deportations in the dead of night.

Do they believe it is not stated clearly enough and that because it is not clearly stated or because there are exemptions or limitations on the information currently, it is allowing this veil of secrecy to continue?

I have had first-hand experience of this in my previous job when I was very involved in setting up English and basic computer classes in centres in Cork city.  I was always fascinated at how one could survive on &euro;4 a week, which is one fiftieth of the social welfare payment for a non-dependent adult.  When I worked in the prisons in Cork and Spike Island, the most popular class among prisoners was the cookery class because this was the one bit of independence they had in that they could cook their own dinner.  What really struck me was the significance for prisoners in the Military Hill and Airport Road centres in Cork that cooking the food that they would eat gave them autonomy.  Mr. Bukha painted a very vivid image of children never seeing their parents cooking food.<\/p><p>  My colleagues who are still involved in that area ask me to table parliamentary questions to the Department of Justice and Equality and it seems to be an anomaly that if one asks questions on prisons and service activities, one will get a very detailed response on what is happening in the prisons.  I am concerned that when similar questions are being asked about the people in asylum centres, and the people in these centres are not convicted of a crime, the information is not available.<\/p><p>  In order to make progress on this issue, we may look at two different areas, the official avenues in which information can be provided under the freedom of information inquiries and the brokered tendered areas in which freedom of information inquiries can be made.  I know that under the FOI legislation, the NGOs and organisations that are funded by the Exchequer should come within the scope of the FOI, for example, that might mean the NGOs from Concern and Tr&oacute;caire.  We might need to reconsider whether that could mean tendered private organisations acting on behalf of the State in the area could come under FOI.  The purpose of so doing is to ensure there is a uniform standard, even if the standard is very low, that there is uniformity and consistency around the centres.  Senator Barrett and Deputies McDonald, Boyd Barrett and Mathews called for substantiated information such as the questions they have put to the Department of Justice and Equality to which it has not responded in full as this would greatly assist us in pursuing inquiries under FOI.<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Bukha provide the committee with the correspondence to the Department on the number of deaths and the evidence of the absence of a response from the Department?  In regard to the four or five departmental heads, such as the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, I am sure it is not every aspect of the section on which they are looking for information under the FOI but particular functions of the Department that should come under the remit of the FOI.  If he can provide that to the committee, we will certainly include it in our deliberations. <\/p><p>  The Anti-Deportation Ireland, ADI, group has come before this committee but our engagement with your group does not conclude when you go out the door.  There will be opportunities for ADI to feed in further information to the committee.  Will the group provide the committee with the information within a two-week period, as this will assist us in our deliberations?  On the specific issues regarding death notices, I am not too sure if it is an issue for the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or whether we should refer it directly to the Minister for Justice and Equality as an issue that came to our attention.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

I reiterate that I very much welcomed the commitment contained in the programme for Government to restore the Freedom of Information Act to what it was before the 2003 amendments and extend its remit to other public bodies.  The proposals outlined in the draft heads will go a long way towards restoring the confidence of members of the public in the Government's commitment to optimising openness, transparency and accountability.  Some very positive additional measures are proposed, such as the automatic application of freedom of information legislation to all newly formed public bodies.<\/p><p>  I was also very pleased that my officials were afforded the opportunity of consulting extensively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the draft heads.  As the joint committee will note, I published a commentary in 2007 which contained detailed recommendations aimed at improving the operation of the Act.  As the majority of these recommendations have been incorporated into the draft heads and given that the explanatory notes to the draft heads reflect, in the main, my office's position on the amendments, I will keep my opening address brief.<\/p><p>  Members will note that I focused on three specific areas in my written response, namely, the review of non-disclosure provisions in other legislation, the exemption relating to security, defence and international relations and the partial application of the Act to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other bodies.  Section 32 of the Freedom of Information Act provides for the mandatory refusal of access to certain records whose disclosure is prohibited, or whose non-disclosure is authorised, by other enactments.  Section 32 is a very important provision because it subordinates the access provisions of the Act to all non-disclosure provisions in statutes except for those which are cited in the third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act.  The Act provides for the review by this committee every five years of the operation of any enactments that authorise or require the non-disclosure of records to determine whether they should be amended or repealed or be added to the third Schedule. <\/p><p>  While I can fully appreciate that the committee has a very heavy work schedule, it remains the case that the most recent such review was conducted in 2005 and a further review is now several years overdue.  The reports of individual Ministers which have been made available to my office show that, since the Freedom of Information Act became law in April 1997, many new non-disclosure provisions have been introduced in individual enactments.  The non-applicability of the Freedom of Information Act is appearing as a standard component of many new Acts and the number of non-disclosure provisions being introduced in individual enactments is increasing.  Departments are reporting approximately 230 enactments containing non-disclosure provisions, of which 50% became law since 1 January 1998.  This means that as many non-disclosure provisions have been introduced since 1997 as were introduced in the preceding 75 years.  The current proposals to amend the freedom of information legislation present an opportune time for the committee to conduct a review of the operation of section 32 and incorporate in the Bill any changes proposed arising from that review. <\/p><p>  On the matter of the exemption relating to security, defence and international relations, the 2003 amendment Act introduced a mandatory class exemption for records containing such matters.  The amendment made the protection afforded by the exemption absolute, regardless of the sensitivity of the records or nature of the harm that might be occasioned by their release.  While the draft heads provide for a number of the changes introduced in 2003 to be reversed, the amendments proposed fail to fully restore the exemption to its pre-2003 state, in that a number of records remain protected as a class.  For example, records containing information which was communicated in confidence between Ireland and an EU body will remain protected as a class of exempt records, even though the information contained in the records may have since lost its quality of confidence.  In the 1997 Act, such records were protected only where the public body considered that access could reasonably be expected to give rise to one of the harms identified in the exemption.  The protection of records as a class is generally not warranted and it would be preferable if some form of harm test were to be re-introduced.  I am also conscious that section 25 of the Act provides an absolute safeguard against release of any record to which section 24 applies through the power of a Minister to certify such a record as exempt from release. <\/p><p>  I have previously expressed my views that the exemptions contained in Part III of the Act are sufficiently robust to ensure the protection of records where release would be likely to give rise to any of the harms which the exemptions seek to protect.  As such, I question the need to restrict the application of the Act to the extent suggested for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In my opinion, if it is accepted that the exemptions contained in Part III are sufficiently robust to ensure the protection of records where release would be likely to give rise to any of the harms which the exemptions seek to protect, a strong case can be made for full application of the Act to all relevant bodies, including those where partial access only is now proposed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600026#BB00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1360155300,"counter":407,"content":"<p>The Information Commissioner's most recent engagement with the Department on the freedom of information legislation was in 2005.

The committee has had discussions with the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  My position remains the same.  The fee is an impediment to the public seeking records.  The fee does not go anywhere near to covering the cost.  The total amount of money, between research, search and retrieval and fees, amounts to &euro;85,000 in a year.  The reason the fee was introduced was precisely to dampen people's ardour for seeking public records and it certainly worked.  We carried out a report after the amended Act had been a year in operation which showed a drop of 75% in applications.  The media certainly lost interest because of the barrier of the fee.  However, in spite of the fee, once the recession kicked in there was a significant re-engagement with FOI because people wanted to know what had happened and why it had happened.<\/p><p>  I know the Minister is of the view that the fee acts as a break on people who might be using the Act in a frivolous way and thereby engaging public bodies with vexatious requests.  A section in the Bill deals with such requests.  In our view, officials can be a little fearful of using that element to stop a person making a frivolous request.  They are reluctant to decide they will not process such a request because it is trivial or vexatious - this is the language used in the Act.  They will need to become bolder in this regard.  I am also aware that the Minister is conducting a review into the operation of the Act and this review is being carried out by the senior official involved in drafting the Act in the first instance.  In my view this would be a suitable issue for the investigating or for the review body to wrestle with.  Public bodies are liable to receive vexatious requests but I do not think the solution is the imposition of a fee.  There need to be other solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600028#DD01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1360156500,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I have a question on the topic of search and retrieval fees, which I have raised on previous occasions.  Last July I published a freedom of information (amendment) Bill which proposed a cap on search and retrieval fees.  I submitted parliamentary questions last year requesting the average and the maximum level of search and retrieval fees in each Department.  I give the Department of Social Protection full praise.  It is one of the busiest Departments but it does not charge any fee for anything.  Fair dues to it.  Other Departments charged average fees of &euro;48.  Last year following a budget I submitted a request for background information on the persons who had submitted FOI requests.  I was informed the fee was &euro;1,300.

Many people who were seeking public records lost their appetite to do so because many of the more important or relevant public records were taken off the table.  That had a huge impact on matters.  In general, public bodies behave well in respect of it.  As Mr. Rafferty explained and as I stated earlier, issues have arisen in respect of training and capacity.  For example, some decisions can be very poorly drafted.  There are instances where the public body involved may have forgotten the need to consult a third party or that there was a public interest potential override with which it was obliged to deal.  That is why I stated that it can become sloppy on occasion.<\/p><p>  When we consider the statistics at the end of the year - I refer to all freedom applications in this regard as opposed to those which come to us for review - we find that the further away one goes from the centre of power, the more records are released.  The lowest percentages would be in respect of central government and the higher percentages would relate to local authorities and other public bodies.  The further away one gets from where the game is at, the more records are released.  When the original Act was amended, one heard anecdotal complaints to the effect that it was taking longer for records to be released.  People were wondering whether this was being done deliberately.  There were also many complaints about the search-and-retrieval fees and people wondered if these were being used in a particular way.  Whenever we examined this matter, we did not find systemic issues as such.  However, with respect to the many excellent officials who deal with this matter, it would be fair to say that there was a general lowering of standards across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013020600029#EE02500","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1360157100,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Ms O'Reilly referred to section 37.

The purpose of our meeting is to hold a discussion with an important representative from the European Union, namely, the Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis.  I met Mr. Lambrinidis briefly this morning in advance of his meeting with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, and I understand he is on a whirlwind tour.  We are delighted that he is able to appear before the committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Roberta Dirosa, personal assistant to the special representative; and Mr. Colin Wrafter, director of the human rights unit of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p><p>  The special representative took up his post in September and comes to the job with an impressive CV, copies of which have been circulated to members.  Of the ten special representatives appointed to support the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, he is the first to have a thematic mandate as opposed to a geographic one.  The establishment of this important position is evidence of the commitment of the high representative to develop an effective and coherent EU policy approach to promoting and protecting human rights.  We look forward to discussing with him the objectives for his tenure as special representative and, in particular, his priorities during the Irish Presidency.  He was only appointed last year and, as everyone in this House is aware, it takes time to get into a job.  <\/p><p>  I acknowledge the excellent work that Mr. Wrafter has done on human rights at the Department.  I am sure the unit is working diligently during the Irish Presidency to support the special representative and the European external action services, as well as meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by Ireland's accession to membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council.  This is a busy time for him.<\/p><p>  Before I ask the special representative to make his presentation, I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee meeting.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence in regard to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  As this is the normal information we give to witnesses appearing before the committee, do not get frightened by it.<\/p><p>  I ask the special representative to address the committee for ten minutes.  I am sure members will have a number of questions for him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013020600002#A00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360161000,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting me to address them.

It is also an opportunity for me to congratulate Ireland at a time when it is in the midst of human rights debates.  It was no small feat to be elected to the Human Rights Council and Ireland is also chairing the European Council.  However, Ireland's election to the Human Rights Council and the Nobel Peace Prize that the EU was awarded some months ago are just the beginning of a process because both Ireland and the EU more broadly must prove that we deserve the honours we have received.<\/p><p>  Many people around the world look to us with great expectations.

My position was the result of major debate within the EU and, in my view, the peaceful revolution in human rights which occurred in June and July 2012.  The EU decided unanimously to adopt a new strategic framework for human rights in which the highest common denominator was achieved, as opposed to the lowest which people might expect when the EU speaks with one voice.  In every EU policy, whether in trade, development, the environment or counter terrorism, member states committed to putting human rights as the silver thread guiding action, always speaking out when human rights violations occur and working closely with international multilateral organisations and each other to achieve our goals.  An action plan was unanimously approved which sets out 97 actions to be implemented in a number of areas and particular human rights themes over the next three years, with specific deadlines and specific people, institutions and member states made responsible for them.<\/p><p>  The decision was also made as part of this peaceful revolution to appoint a Special Representative for Human Rights, and I was deeply honoured to be selected for the post by Catherine Ashton and member states.  My mandate reflects what the EU considered to be the challenges facing the new policy.  I am tasked with increasing the coherence and effectiveness of human rights policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013020600002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360162200,"counter":581,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Mr. Lambrinidis.

We understand from correspondence that in regard to some of the NGOs working in Syria the aid they are providing is routed to the government controlled areas and not to the opposition controlled areas so that the people in those areas are not getting anything like the assistance they need.  The Chairman rightly pointed out the awful situation in Syria.  More than 60,000 lives have been lost, 2 million people have been displaced internally, 2 million are in need of humanitarian aid and huge numbers have been driven not only out of their homes but out of their country.  I do not know if the European Union has done enough to pressurise Russia and China on the politics they have been playing at the United Nations.  In a crisis such as this,  it is not a time for politics as usual.  In correspondence we receive from concerned citizens in our country, people express their sheer disappointment at the lack of progress in trying to deal with a very difficult issue.  The international community must do more.  I welcome the fact that last week the Government provided &euro;5 million in additional humanitarian aid following a conference with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe Costello, attended.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Lambrinidis mentioned that the EU is rusty in its approach.  If the witness had the opportunity to draw up a template for the European Union how would he brush away that rust?  He also mentioned a considerable lack of uniformity in approach to NGOs.  Is there a lack of uniformity within the 27 member states of the European Union in dealing with NGOs?  I was glad to note that Mr. Lambrinidis laid particular emphasis on the important role of the work of NGOs in partnership with governments throughout the world.  He referred particularly to Russia.  He highlighted the importance of ensuring that NGOs were given the space to do the important work they can carry out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013020600005#D00300","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1360162200,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I will take one more question from Deputy Crowe before inviting Mr. Lambrinidis to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013020600005#D00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1360162200,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Cuirim c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh Mr. Lambrinidis and his colleagues.  Is the role of the EU Special Representative a fine balancing act between current human rights abuses and past human rights abuses?  Yesterday we heard the awful word \"renditions\".  A report suggested that some of the rendition flights went through Ireland and other countries in Europe.  There must be a balance between what we are saying internationally and what we are doing locally.  For the countries affected it undermines our moral voice if we allow that to happen.  How important is it to look back on issues such as that which may have been a policy of the past?  This committee adopted a very strong position on the illegal settlements and recommended a ban on illegal goods in the Israeli-Palestine situation.  Is that helpful?  We encouraged our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to raise the issue during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.<\/p><p>  Clearly something needs to be done in this area.  In the past two months there have been 10,000 more new settlements and the problem is getting worse.  The chances of a two state solution is being undermined by the illegal settlements yet at the same time there is a special agreement with the Israeli Government.  On the one hand we say this is wrong but when it comes to trade and other issues we appear to have a different view.  One could look at other parts of the world where the European Union has a special trade agreement.  The witness mentioned countries in transition.  Recently the Columbian ambassador appeared before the committee and mentioned many positive things on the issue.  There are difficulties in that part of the world for human rights defenders, trade unionists and so on.  There is also the issue of using trade as a lever for positive change.  Which should come first, jobs at home or what is happening abroad?  I would like to hear the view of Mr. Lambrinidis on the matter without focusing on a specific country.  Certainly, in the Middle East one is talking about the powerful and the powerless.  In the Palestinian situation there is no balance and the Americans are not getting involved.  The other power broker is ourselves, the European Union.

I do not know where to start because Mr. Lambrinidis's work is so vast and there are so many other competing forces on human rights right across the board, from the United Nations to the OSCE, as well as human rights defenders, etc.  I am trying to get a handle on how Mr. Lambrinidis, in a relatively new and small office, hopes to engage with organisations such as those he mentioned, including the Arab League and the African Union, as well as peripheral countries and emerging democracies.  Given the existing forces, perhaps he would explain what kind of hat we will wear as Europeans.  For example, as Mr. Lambrinidis will be aware, the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights is doing a particular job with regard to human rights, trafficking and strengthening institutions through development aid.  It is such a vast area.  How does Mr. Lambrinidis want to relate, for example, to Russia?  It is suggested that Russia is placing very severe restrictions on the funding of NGOs.<\/p><p>  Today's committee's agenda includes issues from the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE with regard to Sergei Magnitsky, of whom, presumably, Mr. Lambrinidis will be aware.  Then, of course, I have been exposed to the issue of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, of whom, presumably, Mr. Lambrinidis will be aware as well.  At the committee, we debate many issues such as whether the human rights of Ukraine's former Prime Minister, Ms Tymoshenko, are being impinged upon.  We constantly hear of the possibility of anti-gay laws being introduced in Uganda, with severe ramifications there.  How far can the Special Representative for Human Rights, as an office of the European Union, extend his remit?<\/p><p>  I will concentrate particularly on a pet subject of mine that is covered in Mr. Lambrinidis's document, in which he speaks about universality and his belief that the European Union should make a greater effort to underline the universality of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.  The reference to cultural rights has me fascinated.  Cultural rights can be, for example, the rights or the beliefs of tribal people in Sierra Leone, where 60% of girls suffer female genital mutilation.  The comparable right in Ireland, for example, as a holy Roman Catholic society, would be with regard to girls celebrating their first Holy Communion.  Then one looks at the composition of some of the Muslim states where Sharia law is in vogue and amputations are the norm.  What is Mr. Lambrinidis's role in addressing cultural norms in these places, and religious beliefs in others, which would be deemed by our standards to run counter to normal human rights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013020600007#F00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1360163400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I have a not dissimilar question.  I congratulate Mr. Lambrinidis on his post.<\/p><p>  I have a particular interest in gender equality issues as an aspect of our foreign policy.  I was particularly interested in what Mr. Lambrinidis stated about the growth in denial of the universality of rights and the denial of rights on the basis of different value systems, different religions, different cultures or different stages of development.  Such denials are particularly invidious.  They are much worse than targeting a particular group of people or individual women who rock the boat because it is a justification for targeting and denying rights to half the population.  How does Mr. Lambrinidis deal with this?  It is frustrating when witnesses appear before the committee who, if one raises these issues, will state how much they respect their women.  The reality is that these women are denied every right.  Under the guise of protection, they are denied economic rights, legal rights and sexual rights.  All of their rights are denied them on the basis that they are so respected that they themselves could not possibly make any use of these rights and, basically, they will be protected by men.  How does one move from this position?  It is not something that will be changed overnight, but how does one even begin to deal with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013020600007#F00300","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1360163400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests, and I congratulate Mr. Lambrinidis on his appointment and wish him well.  He identified a number of important issues.  First, there is the need for universal recognition of the role of, and necessity to comply with, international criteria on human rights, something that is diminishing rapidly.  Of course, this is not new.  In the aftermath of the French Revolution many asked whether this was what they had fought for.  The Russian Revolution was not spectacular in its adherence to human rights either.  There is nothing new in that.<\/p><p>  The question that we and Mr. Lambrinidis must address throughout society in each member state in the European Union, collectively and individually, is the degree to which there can be recognition of the authority of the human rights organisations and the NGOs in this regard.  If the human rights messenger is disregarded or not allowed to function in whatever environment, there is nothing as demeaning and as bad for morale.  Human rights apply to governments, opposition, those who feel they are downtrodden and those who are in authority, whether or not they are abusing that authority.  They apply universally.<\/p><p>  The five key points Mr. Lambrinidis raised at the European Parliament committee on this issue are correct.  Recognition is important.  Visibility, as he himself stated, is important, but not as key as the other parts.  So too is coherence, universal application of the rule and universal acceptance of the need.<\/p><p>  The weight of the European Union and the authority that goes with it must be recognised internationally as well.  It has a significant population bloc, a considerable area of influence and responsibility, a significant area of democracy and a considerable weight of authority.  Mr. Lambrinidis now carries that authority with him right throughout the globe.  It is important that such authority is recognised universally.  If not, then the efforts of Mr. Lambrinidis will be made difficult, both for him and for those who wish to back him up.  There are some cases where it is not possible for NGOs to operate without some kind of back-up.  I wonder to what extent there is a need for supportive back-up of a peacekeeping nature to allow the influence of the NGOs and of Mr. Lambrinidis's office to flourish.<\/p><p>  As I set out at the beginning, there is a need for member states within the European Union to take ownership of the concept that has been mentioned by all members, on both the Government and Opposition sides, including those who were in authority previously and those who were not.  We can think of numerous instances in the past ten, 15 or 20 years where, in the flurry of activity following the demise of unacceptable dictatorships, there were actions that were not in accord with the best principles of human rights and could never be excused as being understandable or necessary.  There is always the danger, when the downtrodden get their hands on the reins of power, that they will treat those who did damage to them previously in the same fashion.  That does not resolve any problem at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013020600007#F00400","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360164000,"counter":595,"content":"<p>The Council of Europe is important to me for a number of reasons, including because many members of the council who are not members of the European Union are a focus of mine.  To be able to engage with them on the basis of the commitments to which they have agreed or what has been asked of them by the institution to which they belong, namely, the council, as opposed to stating what the European Union thinks, can be effective.  Second, the Council of Europe has expertise that can be welcomed in countries in transition.  I refer in this regard to European Union support for the Council of Europe to open offices in north Africa and the Venice Commission's engagement in discussions on a number of new constitutions.  This engagement has attracted a lot of good will on the part of many countries in the region which view the Venice Commission as an objective, scientific-type body, as opposed to being political.  That is the capacity building I want to continue.<\/p><p>  Other organisations, including the African Union, were mentioned and on which I will touch.  First, I thank members' for their congratulations.  Most people wish me good luck.  <\/p><p>  On the question of how I engage with the African Union, I will give a classic example.  First, we engage in dialogue.  Second, there are a number of important issues which the Africa Union promotes around the world that are also important for us.  For example, there is positive promotion by the African Union as an institution of the issues of tackling violence against women and female genital mutilation.  The African Union also has a number of institutions in the area of human rights, including the African Court on Human and People's Rights, the African Commission for Human and People's Rights and the African Expert Group on Children's Rights, the only children's expert group in the world that can give binding opinions to member states of the African Union.  All of these institutions receive a tremendous amount of support from us.  It is important for us to be able to engage in a way that empowers others around the world who wish to establish human rights institutions to do so.  We do not engage in telling them what to do with these institutions but support them in setting them up.  We do this not only in the African Union but worldwide.  We have much to learn from some of these institutions, including from the African Expert Group on Children's Rights which I mentioned.  It could be argued that in this regard the African Union is ahead of other countries. <\/p><p>  On my engagement with countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Uganda and others, I am not willing to be lenient in my negotiations on human rights issues.  It is my job not to do so.  It is the job of others to be a little more <i>realpolitik<\/i> about it.  Members will understand I do not approach this job wearing rose coloured glasses but with absolute consciousness of the difficulties experienced in many countries in approaching human rights issues, the specific arguments and circumstances in that regard and the leverage the European Union may have on human rights issues in terms of being listened to, which, again, will differ from country to country.  One, therefore, needs to adjust one's approach.  At the end of the day, I must ensure human rights are at the centre of the debate rather than a foot note and that not only what I say should happen but also what is in the strategic framework for human rights agreed to by the 27 member states should happen.  <\/p><p>  I have engaged extensively with Russia and intend to continue to engage with it.  It has many disturbing laws in relation to NGO and human rights activists, including on the funding of NGOs which are funded as foreign agents which in Russia carries a negative connotation; the imposition of fines for demonstrating and the recently introduced law on treason, under which any person who consults a foreign state in a way that violates the security interests of Russia can be accused of being a traitor.  This is so broad and could be used against any Russian official or member of the Russian Duma who speaks about anything to anybody that it causes me to wonder why those who voted for it did so.  Many NGOs are afraid that it will be used against them.  The collective effect of all these laws, whether they are or how they are applied in practice, is the creation of a chilling environment, a chilling of speech, interaction and suspicion.  This is counterproductive and a terrible way to deal with NGOs in a democracy.<\/p><p>  As I stated previously, NGO space is shrinking and we must defend it.  The true test of a democracy is not whether it is perfect in terms of its human rights record because no country is, although some are worse than others, but if it can give to people who criticise and suggest changes therein the space to do so without intimidation or the threat of imprisonment.  On behalf of the European Union, I will be fighting for this around the world, with as much commitment as I can give.  Sharia law, female genital mutilation and freedom of religion and beliefs are big and difficult issues.  Guidelines on freedom of religion and belief are being developed at European Union level.  There are in place EU guidelines on eight major topics, including violence against women, human rights defenders, the death penalty, human rights dialogue and how embassies around the world should address particular issues.  The guidelines on freedom of religion and beliefs are the ninth set of guidelines.  It is a complicated topic to address.  As stated, there are people travelling around the world saying their religion tells them they must treat women in a particular way.  In most cases, this is not true.  This is a case of religion being used as legitimate cover for traditional discriminatory practices that everybody, having signed the human rights agreements in place, considers to be illegal.  There can be many arguments about what is provided for in a particular religion, but there is no human right that can be imposed in violation of others' human rights.  That is one of the principles of human rights universality and inter-relatedness.  No one can say his or her religion states women must be beaten every day and that this is okay under international human rights law.  It is not.<\/p><p>  On what I propose to do about women's rights, on assuming office, I put this question to a number of NGOs, Members of the European Parliament, EU ambassadors and Foreign Ministers.  I underlined it as a major issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013020600008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360164600,"counter":597,"content":"<p>What is Mr. Lambrinidis's relationship with the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013020600009#H00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360164600,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I delivered the keynote address at ODIHR.

The OSCE system must re-engage at human rights level and focus on the application of the commitments which have already been agreed.  Commitments are agreed and then people move on to the next issue.

I am smothered by a dose.  I will confine myself to the Syrian issue.  I spent the weekend visiting some refugee camps in Lebanon, including at al-Jalil close to the Syrian border.  The stories we heard were horrendous.  We also met the President of Lebanon and the EU's representative in Lebanon.  Given the conditions, a number of side issues and the total number of refugees inside its borders, Lebanon is concerned that a fissure might open within itself.  What practical action is the EU undertaking to resolve these issues?  We saw 16 people living in a small room with a galvanised roof in a place that reached -5&deg; Celsius at night.  It was inhumane.  We sometimes get sidelined onto other issues that are not as fundamental as human rights.  What can Europe do in this regard?<\/p><p>  The EU has an association agreement with Israel.  What types of human rights violation will need to occur within the settlement areas for the EU to consider suspending that agreement?  The committee has resolved to ask the Government to ban the importation of goods from settlement areas and to use its influence within the EU to ensure the same.  Those imports support the continuation of settlements, aggravating the situation to a point at which a two-state solution is no longer feasible.

I strongly recommend to the Irish EU Presidency a full briefing of the EU's presence in Syria, whether directly or through other organisations that we may or may not be funding, and an extensive discussion with the European Commission, particularly the Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department of the European Commission, ECHO, which deals with humanitarian aid.<\/p><p>  Our involvement is active.  There are problems.  Some can be discussed broadly, but others cannot.  The Syrian conflict is an issue of deep concern.  I would address it for its human rights and humanitarian elements.  The situation of the many people, including children and women, in the camps is extremely bad at times, with abuses and rapes.  The political implications include the destabilisation of neighbouring countries and so forth.  We are involved in major issues.  A separate briefing is almost needed on them.<\/p><p>  Where we might see success in the next few years is in the coherence of policy.  If everyone in the EU - the Commission, the Council, geographic desks and human rights people - began talking to and co-operating with one another to incorporate human rights as a central element in all of our foreign policy as opposed to a footnote to be compromised away, my position could become irrelevant.  If no one needs me anymore, I will have succeeded.  Let us say that, in terms of cohesion, my political suicide would be my success.<\/p><p>  I would also be successful if, in one year's time, people believed that the presence of a human rights envoy for the EU to difficult strategic partners around the world had made a difference, had focused our partners better and had managed to push them towards being more respectful of human rights.  There are more ways to bring human rights and our collective punch together.  Perhaps one person can do this in the right way.  There are more opportunities in having such a person than in not.  Internally, I wish to become irrelevant.  Externally, I wish that whoever follows me in my job can deal with the issue of universality and turn countries around in defending it; can deal with the issue of NGOs and ensure that they stop being threatened and persecuted around the world so that they can become legitimate, constructive partners with governments for positive change; and can deal with issues of economic and social rights, housing, labour rights and corruption - in a sense, this brings me to the question on tax, which I will come to shortly - which can be a significant multiplier of inequality.<\/p><p>  I keep getting the message that we must go, but must we really?

I am looking, in particular, at the ways in which legislation on prostitution could be enhanced to deal more effectively with emerging trends in the prostitution industry.  While we are happy to assist the committee in whatever way we can on the operational policing aspects of the matter, it would not be appropriate to answer questions on Government policy.  That would include an expression of views on any legislative model which it might be appropriate to apply in the future.<\/p><p>  The Garda has targeted on-street prostitution, particularly following the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 1993 which criminalised soliciting, importuning and loitering for the purposes of prostitution or the commission of sexual offences in public places.  The legislation has reduced dramatically the number of persons engaged in on-street prostitution in the past decade.  Organised prostitution - or off-street prostitution - has advanced, with the expansion of technology to the extent that the majority of the industry relies on the Internet and mobile phone technology to facilitate the smooth running of illicit operations.  The faceless nature and mobility of these technologies have created difficulties for investigating garda&iacute;.<\/p><p>  In the past decade the Irish escort industry has become a destination of choice for working prostitutes, mainly on foot of the economic boom and the expansion of the European Union.  During this time, people engaged in the prostitution industry in Ireland were earning three times the rate for those working in other European jurisdictions.  This resulted in an estimated 800 female prostitutes advertising their services via the Internet on a daily basis within the jurisdiction.  Prostitution services are offered and available in every county within the jurisdiction.<\/p><p>  Criminal proceedings and conviction rates under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are as follows.  In 2010 there were 65 prosecutions, leading to 21 convictions in respect of the offence of brothel keeping; seven prosecutions for organising prostitution, resulting in three convictions; 102 prosecutions for soliciting and importuning prostitution, with 19 convictions; 21 prosecutions for loitering for the purposes of prostitution, with 12 convictions; and seven prosecutions for living off the earnings of prostitution, with one conviction.  In 2011 there were 62 prosecutions for brothel keeping, with 17 convictions; three prosecutions for organising prostitution, with one conviction; 107 prosecutions for soliciting and importuning prostitution, with 19 convictions; 35 prosecutions for loitering for the purposes of prostitution, with 17 convictions; and four prosecutions for living off the earnings of prostitution, with one conviction.  In 2012 there were 47 prosecutions for brothel keeping, with eight convictions; one prosecution for organising prostitution and one conviction; 46 prosecutions for soliciting and importuning prostitution, with three convictions; 16 prosecutions for loitering for the purposes of prostitution, with no conviction to date; and two prosecutions for living off the earnings of prostitution, with no conviction to date.<\/p><p>  By its nature, prostitution affects the wider community because of the manner in which it is conducted, particularly when conducted in public places.  However, the main source of advertising for prostitution is the Internet, while one-to-one contact between prostitutes and potential clients is conducted via the mobile phone network.  It is suspected this may evolve to social networking sites or other communications media in the near future if it has not already happened.  The Department of Justice and Equality discussion document on the future direction of prostitution issued in August 2012 seeks responses on how the criminal law on prostitution addresses the rights of communities and society generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013020600004#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360160100,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I open the floor to any member or witness who wishes to ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013020600005#L00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1360160100,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Mr. Maguire's statistics were staggering.

There is no identification required, whereas abroad, in some jurisdictions, when one buys a pre-paid phone or a SIM card for a pre-paid phone, one is required to show one's passport.  The shop is required to make a photocopy of the passport which ensures a record is kept of the phone sold.  Difficult as it might be, every mobile phone should be shut down and people should have a period within which to register.

I am not here to comment on legislation, but to judge from what the superintendent said, mobile phones play a huge part in the operation of prostitution and other forms of crime.

It was amazing to see that a number used in one town would be used in another and that almost a similar number would move in the reverse direction.  Some of the women concerned might have had two or three profiles such that when they moved they took their profiles with them.  The number could have been slightly smaller, but the fact is that there were significant similarities in the move from A to B and B to A in any instance across any town or city.  In the immediate aftermath of the showing of the television programme the number of individual profiles advertised on the Internet actually reduced, but in advance of today's meeting we revisited the website for a couple of days and the number is higher now; it is possibly closer to the number the superintendent quoted - 800 profiles which are advertised on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  Deputy Finian McGrath asked if I had spoken to any of the women involved.

One case that comes to mind is that of a person who thought she was coming to Ireland to work as a hairdresser, but when she and others arrived here, their papers were taken from them and they were put into an apartment on the afternoon of their arrival and told it was prostitution.  In other cases, Irish nationals were forced into prostitution.

There was one very organised group along with some individuals.  The group consisted of up to 15 people and up to 16 or 17 on some occasions.  They were being moved four or five in a car.  Every week the individual organising these women and moving them from location to location would start at 2.30 a.m.  He would drive from Dublin city to Athlone, from Athlone to Ennis, from Ennis to Dundalk and back to Dublin.  On one occasion this individual covered somewhere in the region of 1,200 km in a 22-hour period.  That was a regular occurrence every week.  Some of the women to whom we spoke were told they were required to move from place to place and to purchase their own train ticket out of the money earned from selling themselves.  In many cases we found that people were being moved as opposed to moving themselves.  In that way those organising the moving of the women had more control over the women.  Deputy O'Brien asked about those who get out of the business.  A person travelling by train may have an opportunity to escape if that was what she wanted to do but if she is being moved by car I imagine there is more control over the individual and fewer opportunities for escape.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013020600008#O01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1360162500,"counter":700,"content":"<p>What type of properties do they use?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013020600009#P00100","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360162500,"counter":701,"content":"<p>Rented apartments in most cases.

I propose to make some opening remarks on the complex issues which the Ombudsman previously highlighted to the committee and the considerable efforts being made to address these issues.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for disability, mental health and older people will talk in more detail about the schemes, their history and how they operate.  She will also outline for the committee the significant cost implications which have been identified so that members can understand in more detail the considerable challenge facing us in addressing this matter.<\/p><p>  The motorised transport grant and mobility allowance were established in good faith and with the best of intentions in 1968 and 1979, respectively, to meet mobility and transport needs of a particular group of people with severe physical difficulties.  The transport and mobility needs of these individuals were not adequately catered for at that time.  Were we to try to meet the mobility and transport needs of people with physical, sensory, intellectual and mental health disabilities today, it is extremely unlikely that we would establish schemes of this type.  This is especially important in terms of the general policy of mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities.  Clearly, these schemes in their present form do not comply with that policy.<\/p><p>  The recommendations of the Ombudsman in regard to how these schemes have been operated are clear and neither I nor my Department has disputed the position she has taken.  The Department has previously acknowledged the inequalities in the schemes as they currently operate.  However, the direct costs in terms of expanding the eligibility criteria for the schemes as they now operate are completely unaffordable for the State.<\/p><p>  In seeking a solution which will address the transport and mobility needs of all those who require supports, we are mindful of the group of people who are currently benefitting under the schemes but, importantly, we must equally consider the broader group whose needs the Ombudsman has found must be looked after on an equitable basis.  We have no dispute with the Ombudsman in that regard.  <\/p><p>  However, it is imperative that all members understand the financial implications.  Funding for both these schemes, as they operate currently, is &euro;10.6 million per annum in total.  Any solution to this issue must be delivered within that resource capped budget.  Widening the eligibility criteria, as required, will mean that many multiples of additional claimants will have to be paid out of that allocation of &euro;10.6 million.  Based on the Department's best estimate using data from the census and the disability databases, this would mean reducing both the allowance and the grant to a level which would severely limit the benefits to all recipients.  This does not even factor in the increased administrative cost.  Were we to increase the budget for the schemes, this additional funding would have to be taken from front-line services for disabilities, mental health and older people and I do not consider that option to be either practical or fair when one considers the sums involved into which I will go in a minute.<\/p><p>  I am continuing to consider the recommendations of the Ombudsman in regard to both schemes very carefully.  It must be acknowledged that an extension of either scheme, as recommended by the Ombudsman, without a dramatic reduction in the monthly payment or grant, would create serious financial pressure on the health budget in the current climate and would be unsustainable.  The estimates we have are &euro;200 million over three years for the motorised grant and &euro;100 million per annum for the mobility allowance.  That would mean a &euro;500 million additional spend over three years.  That would be much greater than the current home help-home care packages' budget, and when one considers the size of the fair deal budget, that would be more than 50% of it.<\/p><p>  However, I am happy to discuss the matter with the committee and, in particular, I would be most interested to hear any ideas the members may wish to propose as to how the matter may be addressed in the best interests of all, within the severe financial constraints imposed on us.  Following our discussion today, which I sincerely hope will be productive and positive in terms of proposing solutions to this matter, I will take further advice with a view to making proposals as to the future of both schemes following further discussion with my Cabinet colleagues and ministerial colleagues but not before a full dialogue with service users who must be to the fore of our concerns.<\/p><p>  In short, the difficulty we face is to meet the needs of those with disabilities whose very independence is dependent on these grants.  To put this in context, this could mean the difference between being able to get into one's own car and going where one wants to go when one wants to go, something we all value, and having to call and wait on someone else, no matter how kind, obliging and efficient the person.  We must look after the needs of the people who need this grant yet stay within the law and have an affordable scheme.  I will hand over to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600003#C00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1360167000,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I echo the thanks expressed by the Minister to the committee for the opportunity to discuss the issue today.  As he outlined, the issues with these schemes are complex and ultimately resource limited.  While we are continuing to work on these issues I too would sincerely welcome any constructive input the Members of the committee may wish to propose as to how the matter may be resolved.  It is not just the committee that we will consult as outlined by the Minister.  It would be helpful to talk in more specific detail about the schemes in terms of the number of beneficiaries, how they operate and the implications of a broadening of the criteria for the financing and administration of the schemes.<\/p><p>  The mobility allowance was established in 1979 as an administrative scheme by way of departmental circular.  There have been two further circulars in 2002 and 2007 but the basic eligibility criteria for the allowance remains.  The person must be unable to walk or be in such a condition that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous to their health. The allowance is payable by the Health Service Executive, subject to a means test, to a person with a severe disability.  Applicants must be 16 years or older and under 66 years.  The allowance was designed to help eligible people to benefit from a change in surrounding, for example, financing the occasional taxi journey.  The mobility allowance is paid monthly and the current rate is &euro;208.50 per month.  There are in excess of 4,700 recipients of mobility allowance at an annual cost of &euro;9.3 million.  The allowance is targeted at the transport needs of those with a severe disability.  As it is a payment that is unvouched there is no evidence that the monthly payment is applied to meet a person&rsquo;s transport needs.  I am sure that it is often used for other things as well but in a way that enhances the person's life.<\/p><p>  The motorised transport grant is also an administrative scheme.  It is a means tested HSE payment to enable a person with a severe disability to purchase or adapt a car where that car is essential to retain employment.  The maximum grant is &euro;5,020 payable once in any three year period.  More than 300 people receive the grant each year at an estimated cost of &euro;1.3 million.  Eligibility for the motorised transport grant may also be considered in exceptional circumstances other than for employment retention, for a person with a severe disability who lives in very isolated circumstances and where their disability prevents them from using public transport.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health originally signalled its intention to review the mobility allowance scheme in late 2009.  In April 2011 the Department accepted the Ombudsman's findings and recommendation to review and revise the mobility allowance scheme so as to render it compliant with the Equal Status Acts.  The Department also noted that the Ombudsman, in a footnote to her recommendation, expressed no view as to the terms of the revision of the scheme other than that the revised scheme should be compliant with the Equal Status Acts. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the Department&rsquo;s commitment to meet the six month timescale laid down by the Ombudsman in her report, entitled Too Old to be Equal, it has since proved extremely difficult to resolve the matter.  A number of policy options have been considered in the intervening period.  These have raised significant issues including the feasibility of extending eligibility under the scheme due to the potentially significant cost implications; creating a new scheme available to all those with clear mobility needs because of their disability and keeping within current spending &ndash; the resultant payments to the people eligible would be so reduced as to make them almost meaningless; and the inappropriateness of extending or formalising schemes which no longer accord with the Government&rsquo;s mainstreaming policy on disability, and where alternative transport options are increasingly available for people with mobility difficulties under the relevant State agencies. <\/p><p>  The Department is not in a position to amend the circular related to the mobility allowance, as recommended by the Ombudsman, without significantly reducing the amounts payable to each person under the scheme.  The recommendations, if implemented without a reduction in the amounts payable, would ignore the serious financial constraints on the Department, the HSE and the State generally.  Implementation of the recommendations would create liabilities that the State simply cannot afford.  These additional costs would have to be met from current expenditure and would result in a reduction of front-line specialist disability, older people and mental health services to people who need them.<\/p><p>  Similarly, the Department is not in a position to amend the circular related to the motorised transport grant, as recommended in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, without reducing the amounts payable to each person.  Expansion of the definition of disability would impose serious financial constraints on the Department, the HSE and the State generally. The recommendations, if implemented as outlined would, similar to the mobility allowance, create liabilities that the State could not afford.<\/p><p>  The Minister has already outlined that we are conscious of the 4,700 people who receive the mobility allowance and the 300 people who receive the motorised transport grant each year.  Unfortunately it is not possible to expand these schemes in such a way to achieve compliance with the Equal Status Acts without incurring direct additional costs estimated at &euro;100 million per annum for the mobility allowance and &euro;200 million over a three year period for the motorised transport grant.  It is important to note that there will be a large indirect administrative cost to and burden on the HSE at a time when back office resources are expected to decrease.  Meeting such costs would result in severe service cutbacks in the disability, older people and mental health services.  By way of an example to the committee, removing this level of funding, at an average of &euro;170 million per annum, from front-line services would eliminate all day, residential and personal assistant services for people with physical disabilities; or it would reduce employment levels by approximately 3,400 staff or 14% of all staff; or remove around 2,200 residential places for people with disabilities, a quarter of all residential places; or cut around 10,000 day places for people with disabilities which equates to half of all day places.  Another alternative would be to reduce payments within the available budget.  This would reduce them to such an extent as to render the payments almost meaningless, particularly in the context of meeting transport needs.<\/p><p>  If the schemes were extended to the widest possible category of persons with disabilities, and the level of available funding remains as it is the mobility allowance could be reduced from &euro;208.50 per month to &euro;12.20 per month.  The motorised transport grant could be reduced from a maximum of &euro;5,020 in any three year period to a maximum of &euro;67.50 in that three year period.  The committee will agree that such changes would be meaningless in view of the costs incurred.  Clearly severe reductions of this nature would not serve to best address the type of supports the schemes were intended to put in place.<\/p><p>  As the Minister outlined, the Department continues to seek a solution that will best meet the aims of supporting the transport or mobility needs of those who most need them while remaining within the budgetary cap.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the matter with the committee.  I am anxious to hear the comments of the Members present as I know that they have a particular interest in the topic.  If this matter was easy to resolve we would have done it long ago but it is particularly difficult.  The one thing that everyone at this table is conscious of is that at the heart of all of this are people who depend on the funding to gain access to the outside world.  We are very conscious of that and is why we are still putting in place a mechanism that will address this difficult and complex problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600004#D00100","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1360167000,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State and I call Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600004#D00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1360167000,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I shall be brief as there is a good crew of Members who wish to comment.

The Minister's Department has been found to be in contravention of the Equal Status Act and that must be rectified.<\/p><p>  Does the Minister have any detail on whether the Department has had to make settlements with any individuals who were unfairly treated because the Department was in breach of the Equal Status Act in this particular scenario?

This is a unique occasion.  The one thing I see wrong with the matter is that every day the people must comply with different regulations.  I listened to the Minister of State's views on the subject.  She was a bit cross and said we do not have the money.  I appreciate and respect her position and the difficulties in which she and the Minister find themselves.  We must think, however, of the people who must comply with all types of regulations, such as the farming and business communities.  What if a farmer said he could not fully comply with regulations because he did not have the money to erect a slatted tank?  What if he apologised for not complying but that he must operate illegally?  He cannot do that.  Since 2000, and long before it was in the Minister's gift, the Department operated illegally.  What sort of message are we giving hard-pressed people whom we want to be compliant with rules and regulations?  The message from today's meeting is that Ministers past and present have operated for years under the watch of a Department - the heavy hitters and permanent government - which knew about the problem and allowed it to go on.  That is wrong - very wrong.<\/p><p>  I am not being political about the matter and I am not pointing my finger at the Minister and Minister of State present.  I am talking about past Administrations as well.  I am also talking about the permanent government which oversaw the matter for many years.  How can it be explained to the public?  How can one get it across to the public that it is okay for the Department of Health to operate a scheme illegally but the rest of the population must be compliant no matter what sector they belong to?  If one is in the PAYE sector, one must pay taxes.  Farmers must comply with everything.  God knows, farmers have their hands tied behind their backs from when they get up in the morning until they go to bed at night complying with EU regulations and Irish departmental regulations.  They will hear this story being broadcast loud and clear that the Minister and Minister of State told us here today that they knew it happened, knew it was illegal and do not dispute what the Ombudsman has said.  They know they are operating illegally but the reason given is they do not have the money.  On the next day that somebody arrives at my clinic because they are in trouble, I will agree with them that they are in trouble but tell them they are okay because they have no money.  That is some message to give people.  I am shocked.  The matter came to the attention of the committee and the Minister of State told the committee that they do not have the money.  That is not good enough.<\/p><p>  We must find a solution and I am more than willing to put my shoulder to the wheel to help.  I shall return again to the Minister of State saying they do not have the money.  Where do we go from here?  We must be clear.  We cannot say to the people who are already in the scheme that they must leave it in order to cater for others.  One option is to divide up the money thus ensuring everyone receives a smaller amount but it is spread further.  Another option is to follow Deputy Boyd Barrett's suggestion to remove the constraint of working within a certain pot of money and enlarge the budget. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600007#G00700","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360169400,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I must stop you, Deputy.

Part of what we hope might arise from today is that perhaps with the fresh eyes Deputy Peter Mathews mentioned we will get additional insight into how we can resolve this.  I am aware that farmers go through a tough time and that things are tough at present.  Each year they must deal with the weather and the market and they must operate within regulations.  As the Deputy and I know, the law changes and sometimes that has unforeseen implications.  People are often given time to become compliant.<\/p><p>  I do not dispute, and never have disputed, what the Ombudsman has said or her findings.  However, I keep returning to the difficulty we have.  We are dealing with taxpayers' money on the one hand and, on the other, a group of people whose need is clear and obvious and whose independence in many cases is dependent on this.  We all acknowledge what independence means, as opposed to having to depend on somebody else.  We want to facilitate that for people where and when we can.  We are trying to expedite an extraordinarily complex and difficult issue.  There is also the fact that if we were to expand this in its current form, it would obviously have enormous consequences given the funding we have in the health budget.  We do not have a huge amount of money that can be taken from elsewhere within the system.  If we do that, it will have a negative impact.  The country's budget does not allow us to take it from outside the system.  I realise others will have a different view on that, and that is fair enough.  However, the reality we must deal with is that the money we are spending every day on health is borrowed money and comes with terms and conditions.<\/p><p>  I am being very frank.  We are here as much to seek help on how we solve this problem as to tell the committee how we will solve it.  As Deputy Kathleen Lynch said already, if it were easily solved, we would have solved it some time ago.  It is extremely difficult.  On the one hand, we must act within the law and within our budget while, on the other hand, we do not wish to have a negative impact on those who have this grant and for whom it is such an integral part of their ability to live an independent life at home.  I hope the committee will accept our bona fides that we want this resolved and we want to do it with full input from all quarters, most particularly from those who use the service, with regard to how the moneys we have can be best used to support them while still acting within the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600008#H00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1360169400,"counter":783,"content":"<p>What about the questions the Minister did not answer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600008#H00500","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1360169400,"counter":784,"content":"<p>What questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600008#H00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1360169400,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I asked about the permanent government.

We are informed by the national disability strategy and the Disability Act 2005.  We consistently seek to put their rights at the forefront of our policies and their implementation by the HSE.  The recently published value for money and policy review of disability services puts the implementation of new person-centred approaches to service delivery at the centre.  We are concerned about our clients and we want to be helpful and supportive of them.  Unfortunately, the evolution of specific aspects of policy and their implementation has not always been consistent with wider legal development, and legacy issues can arise from time to time.  In that regard the points made in the document, Too Old to be Equal? A Follow-up, about addressing the upper age limit for the motorised transport grant in 2008 and its implications for the age limit in the mobility allowance scheme are noted.  However, in addressing these issues the Department has had to have regard to the best use of available resources and to ensuring that those resources are targeted at those most in need of assistance, including people with disabilities who have mobility and transport issues.<\/p><p>  There have been major developments since the introduction of both schemes, which I believe are relevant to the discussion: free public transport for people with disabilities and a companion; improved accessibility of public transport; tax concessions for drivers, passengers and voluntary groups; a rural transport programme that provides a total of 1.2 million passenger journeys annually; funding from the State for Vantastic and similar schemes in the Dublin region; transport provided by voluntary service providers funded by the HSE, St. Michael's House, the Irish Wheelchair Association and Muscular Dystrophy Ireland.

At the end of her remarks, she acknowledges that the wrong had been put right and that compensation was paid to those affected.  In the context of the Travers report on wrongful charging, she gave an outline of the report and the history of the wrongful charging of public patients in long stay care.  Once again, she acknowledges the steps taken to address the situation, notably the establishment of the health repayment scheme.  On both issues, I agree the State erred and mechanisms were put in place to right the wrongs of the past.  These issues are historical and have been well aired at this stage.  People are well aware of them.<\/p><p>  The third issue is the report, entitled Who Cares?, published in 2010.  I do not agree with the fundamental position advanced by the Ombudsman.  She stated that, since 1970, health boards had an obligation to provide long stay care for older people.  The Department of Health and the many Ministers who have served in the Department since then have never agreed with that position.  The essential argument made in the Ombudsman's report is that statutory duties imposed on health boards and the HSE under the Health Act 1970 in respect of inpatient services  including nursing home services, are not subject to resource limitation.  Adequate resources have never been provided to honour these obligations in a transparent and accountable way.  The Government is not aware of any country in the world where health and personal social services are provided without some form of prioritisation, which reflects the reality of resource limitations.  The reality is that access to health services has always been determined by a combination of clinical and other professional judgments within an overall resource availability envelope.  Although people may be eligible to receive inpatient services under section 52 of the Health Act 1970, any entitlement to receive the services in a particular case has always been subject to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the availability of adequate resources.  The obligation to provide services prescribed in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas is clearly subject to the resources made available by the Oireachtas to provide those services.  The Ombudsman has clearly misunderstood and mischaracterised the position of my Department and the requirements of legislation enacted by the Oireachtas in this regard.  The Ombudsman has also failed to recognise that it is a matter for the Government to determine the manner in which resources are to be prioritised and allocated.<\/p><p>  The Department has also expressed serious concern about the Who Cares? report and the manner in which it was undertaken.  One of the most seriously and fundamentally untrue allegations in the report is that the Department refused to co-operate with the investigation by the Ombudsman.  As shown conclusively by the correspondence published by the Ombudsman and by the Department, we always made it clear we were fully willing to co-operate with any investigation by the Ombudsman conducted within the parameters of the Ombudsman Act 1980.

When one considers that to avail of these schemes one must have the disability and then undergo a means test, that is restrictive.  I think the officials have overestimated the numbers.  If one considers that few people over 66 years are working, the number who are trying to get transport to work is not that large.  May I request that committee members receive information on the level of means necessary to qualify for the grant in the first place and the description of a severe disability?  I understand the spirit of both schemes.  My daughter has a travel pass and avails of care-accessible transport.  That is quite sufficient for her needs and she does not need a mobility allowance or any other allowance.  I agree with Deputy Harrington that it is critical that the advocacy and disability groups are consulted as to what is best.  I think we must drill down to find what is best for each individual client.  A global scheme does not work.  I could give the names, although I will not do so publicly, of 20 different friends of my daughter each and every one of whom has a different transport need.  If we are to put a scheme in place, I think we need to get down to considering individual need.  As a partial solution, we could certainly extend the car renewal period from three years to five years.  I would have no difficulty with that given the quality of the cars available.  I know that only a small amount of money is at stake, but it is a step in the right direction.  However, we will have to put more money into the scheme to make it work for those with a disability.<\/p><p>  I know for a fact that those who shouted loudest in the past got the benefit of these schemes.  Perhaps it is time to review the recipients of all schemes, in particular in the intellectual disability area.  What I would like to see is the development of a person-centred scheme.  The Secretary General rightly pointed out that the information on different schemes in the community should be disseminated.  Things have changed dramatically since the introduction of the schemes and now young adults with an intellectual and physical disability are availing of the scheme.  I know of up to 23 young adults coming out of Shannon every morning on those schemes.  Should any one of them have a mobility allowance?  Absolutely not.  Should any one of them have a motorised transport allowance?  Absolutely not.  These young lads are mobile; they may well have an intellectual or physical disability, but they are well and able to travel with their colleagues on the buses.  If we were more person-centred in seeking solutions, we could resolve the problem.  I do not think the current allocation is sufficient but we certainly do not need hundreds of millions extra to come up with a solution.  We need to be more innovative.  We could further support the rural transport schemes.  It is a no-brainer to extend the period of car renewal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600010#K00300","speaker":"1134"},{"type":"speech","time":1360170600,"counter":812,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mulcahy for his contribution.

It is being operated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is very much about having a national scheme that is operated locally.  It ties in with rural transport systems that are operated by the HSE.  As the Minister, Deputy Reilly, mentioned earlier, service providers such as the Irish Wheelchair Association are also involved.  It fits very well within the mainstreaming policy for people with disabilities.  People need local solutions to local access problems, essentially.  I think the project has operated a couple of pilot schemes so far.  It is still at a reasonably early stage.  The most recent feedback we have received suggests that it is operating very well.  It uses conventional and non-conventional transport systems.  Not only does it address local need, but it also ensures that people with disabilities are not segregated from the rest of society.  Many people who happen to have physical or intellectual disabilities are part of the ordinary lives of their local communities.  Rather than isolating them, we need to make sure they are further integrated.  That can involve ensuring such people live together rather than in isolated accommodation.  This project ticks a number of the boxes in our disability strategy.  It provides local solutions for local people.  The national framework ensures there is some measure of access equality in all of these things.  It is in its early stages, as I have said, but it is looking pretty good so far.  There is a huge level of co-operation in the areas where it is in existence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600011#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cate Hartigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1360171200,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials.  Obviously, this is one of the times when we get to see the chickens coming home to roost.  It is very sobering to hear that the financial state we are in means we cannot actually do this, as has been explained.  Our budgetary constraints mean that we are under a great deal of pressure across many headings in the Department of Health.  It is one of the toughest portfolios in this regard because it is demand-led.  We want to look after people who are sick, dying or disabled.<\/p><p>  The problem has been described as having been going on for quite some time.  Dr. McLoughlin said he has been in his position for just a few months.  Can anybody else tell us why the issue of equality was not addressed when there was money in the country, as part of the operation of this scheme by the Department of Health?  It seems that money was found for everything else at some stage - I do not suggest that was right either - but this was not funded.  What was the rationale that allowed this to be ignored for so long?  The Equal Status Act came into being when there was money in the country.<\/p><p>  I am not quite clear on the interaction of the mobility allowance.  A number of my constituents who have disability issues are having difficulty getting to medical appointments.  A lot of begging and pleading has to be done before they are transported to essential medical appointments.  Many of the people in question live in rural areas.  I applaud the rural transport scheme and all the other initiatives.  They work well for people in certain demographics and certain circumstances.  It is difficult to understand why people with disabilities who cannot get to medical appointments have to ask Deputies to make representations for them.  I do not know why we do not have a better system.  I know there have been cutbacks in the ambulance transport service.  I am sure that can be done more readily in some areas than in others.  People with disabilities who are in particular hardship are stressed because they do not know how they can make their appointments.  I wonder about the link between the two schemes.  It should be pretty essential.  If it is possible to accommodate people on the rural transport scheme when they are collecting their pensions every week, why can they not be brought to their medical appointments?<\/p><p>  Two Deputies raised the possibility of raising more taxes.  We have probably gone past that point now.  In all fairness, the property tax is being introduced.  People are being pinched in every direction.  Many of the rich people we hear about have big houses with mortgages in negative equity.  They are just as pressed as anyone else.  I do not know of many sectors in our society that are not pressed.  There is a tendency for one sector of pressurised people to look to another sector of people to see who has it easier and who can be curtailed further when more cuts come around.  The idea that people are not paying enough through direct or indirect taxes, which is constantly repeated, is a daft one.  I would like to know who these wealthy people are, for example, in my own town.  It needs to be analysed.  I do not know who they are.  Maybe people are referring to those with the trappings of wealth.  If so, I suggest that those trappings could be causing a lot more misery than happiness at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013020600011#L00300","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1360171200,"counter":816,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question has two parts.

Different issues can arise when people have to find various pieces before they can attend medical appointments, etc.  This type of transport is not needed on every occasion to meet the mobility needs of these people.  It is clear that some help is needed in respect of journeys of a certain distance.  It strikes me that this applies to various budgets in many areas, including this area.  The HSE is paying huge sums of money for taxis for vulnerable children.  The point I am making about the sort of budgetary control we do not have applies right across the board.  People can talk all day long about those who expect us to raise taxes.  This is the Department of Health.  We do not control the types of taxes that are imposed, or whom they are imposed on.  We have to work within our budget.  It is as simple as that.  The Secretary General is the Accounting Officer.  We have to work within our budget.  Everyone saw the difficulties we had last year when those budgets were not kept to.  We desperately hope to keep to them this year.

Before that time there were wider Government issues around whether the Department of Health should be in the business of making payments that are in the nature of allowances at all.  The HSE is not equipped to pay income or allowances on a monthly basis to people.  That is not part of our core competency.  The community welfare officers were transferred to the Department of Social Protection with that form of allowance that used to be part of the old health boards.  The administrative systems and also the policy on people with disabilities were evolving during this period, when they were not regarded as a sector apart.  There was also the whole principle around mainstreaming.  The question we are trying to grapple with is not how to pay supports to all of these people but, in the context of mainstreaming, how to provide a transport system that people with any type of disability, whatever their age, who require the system can access.<\/p><p>  Deputy Peter Mathews asked about the limitations.  One of the key limitations is the figure of &euro;10 million and another is that it must be done in a fair, equitable and legal way.  That is the question that appears clear in its import but when one tries to tease it out that is where the difficulty arises.  We need to arrive at solutions, as the Minister of State said, that will be at local level, using all of the systems currently in place.  For example, last year alone the Department paid &euro;400,000 to various organisations for specialised transportation for those with disabilities and older people.  All of the individual supports need to be coalesced into something meaningful that fulfils a policy of mainstreaming in order that people with disabilities, whatever their age, can access them when they need it.  It also takes account of the fact that people get special assistance if they need to go to hospital.  There is special transport for people to access education.  Many of these supports are in place.

I commend the Government on the establishment of this committee because it is a positive development and it is a good day for democracy that an issue such as this can be brought forward.  However, there are consequences to such things, and this is one of them.  As much as I want to be sympathetic to the plight, is it not the case that what the Minister of State is telling the committee is that the budget cannot be broken but the law must be broken?  That is really what she is saying.  I ask her to confirm that the budget cannot be broken and, therefore, the law must be broken, and that this will continue for at least another six months.  Is it the position that the Minister of State will continue to break the law - I know she does not want to do it - for six months and deny people their rights and entitlements under the Equal Status Act because looking at the budget is not an option?  That is not acceptable.  That is on the legal side.  I think she is trying to square a circle that is difficult if not impossible to square.  Deputy Harrington said that perhaps we need to look at the equality legislation.<\/p> <p>I can see, because of the thinking running through this, why one might think that, but it is very dangerous to believe that the way to resolve this is to begin to unravel equality legislation.  I urge the Minister of State not to even consider doing that.<\/p><p> It seems the Department is faced with looking at changing eligibility criteria.  This is serious, because that implies that some of the people who are currently eligible for grants do not actually need them.  It is a serious road to take to suggest that might be the case.  Is it not a matter of equality that if some fully able people are allowed to drive cars, those who are disabled should get grants in order that they can drive cars also?  The use of language such as \"mainstreaming\" and other jargon does not get away from the fundamental fact that people with disabilities have the right to drive cars and should get grants for that.  I do not believe we should try to unravel that.  I put this to the Minister of State, but I will think further on the issues.  First, is it acceptable for the Minister of State to continue to break the law for the next six months?  Second, can she seriously tell us there is any other way of dealing with this other than by looking at the budget caps?

There is a potential case here of up to at least &euro;229 million, according to the Department's figures.  Was the Minister of State made aware of that?

If we know the facts and the low, medium and highest estimates, we have a sensitivity analysis of the exposure.  There is an irony with regard to this issue.  The mobility allowance was introduced in 1979, when in public thinking and society in general we were becoming more conscious about giving people with disability the chance to go to work and to have an occupation.  Buildings were refitted with ramps and lifts to provide for people with physical disabilities.  The introduction of the mobility allowance was well motivated.  Since then, a purer definition of equality has come in and it has trumped and leapfrogged over the initial moves to make society more equal with allowances.  This is a stricter definition and we cannot avoid facing it.  We are doing that bravely and well today.<\/p><p>  The conundrum we face is the overall resource and budget constraint for the Government.  We are trying to ensure a fairer distribution and support to people who need it - people between the ages of 16 and 66 who need to be able to go to work and have an occupation.

We will highlight three or four specific examples of our concerns.  The overall concern is that EASA, for reasons that have never been explained to us, continues to ignore the recommendations of its own scientific appointees, not just in the recent 12-month period of this continuing process but also in a previous process when scientific results were ignored.<\/p><p>  The position of the airline pilots' associations across Europe is that we do not come to these discussions with anything other than the use of the scientific evidence that was procured by EASA itself.

I will give a brief explanation of fatigue and why it is a problem.  As pilots we work in a 24-hour business, around the clock.  We work irregular schedules involving night-time work, early starts, late finishes and time zone changes.  Some of our duties are quite mentally demanding.  Flight time limitations dictate how a pilot's roster is structured, defining the duty limits for a day, a week, a month, a year.  The ICAO, the United Nations agency concerned with civil aviation, has stated that the sole purpose of flight time limitations, FTL, is to limit the working hours of pilots in order to minimise the threat of pilot fatigue.<\/p><p>  Fatigue is a physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability.  It impairs a crew member's alertness and ability to operate an aircraft safely or to perform safety related duties.  It is caused by sleep loss or extended time awake, circadian rhythm disturbances - one's body clock - or mental or physical workload.<\/p><p>  Much is known about the relationship between pilot fatigue and accidents.  From 1991 to 2005, nearly half of all aircraft accidents had pilot error or cockpit crew as a contributory factor.  The scientific consensus is that a large proportion of these accidents were related to pilot fatigue.  The US National Transportation and Safety Board has stated that 20% to 30% of all transport accidents have fatigue as a contributory factor.  Up to 20% of all aviation accidents have fatigue as a contributory factor.<\/p><p>  The first case where fatigue was diagnosed in a fatal accident was in 1993.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013020600003#D00400","nonspeaker":"Captain Paul Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360144800,"counter":870,"content":"<p>I thank the Irish Airline Pilots Association, IALPA, for its presentation.

Mr. Philip von Sch&ouml;ppenthau of the European Cockpit Association in Brussels will deal with the technical aspects of EASA.<\/p><p>  With regard to the jobs opportunity, unfortunately, the vast majority who want to do what we do in Ireland need &euro;100,000 for basic training and a further &euro;30,000 to obtain a simple rating on a Boeing 737 or A320 jet aircraft.  A significant feature of the Irish Aviation Authority's meeting with the committee was concern about what had happened in Waterford.  The authority described what was occurring as a Ponzi scheme.  What is regrettable about what happened in the school in Waterford is that it is not the first time it has happened.  It is the third time, but nothing has been done about it.  In the 1990s there was a school of aviation in Cork.  A young pilot whose parents had remortgaged their house handed over &pound;38,000 to start his training, but the school went bankrupt the following day and he did not get back one penny of the money.  There were similar stories in Waterford last year when students were left high and dry.  I do not know why young people are being exposed to this and why there is not more regulation and oversight to ensure they are not exploited.<\/p><p>  There are students who will not make it through the course.  There seems to be no rule stipulating that a school which is taking money from students must tell students their chances of making it through training.  All the schools want is the money, as dreadful as that sounds.<\/p><p>  Traditionally, becoming a pilot involved a different process.  The three pilots present were cadets.  We were selected through a programme in third level colleges and then went through a cadetship with one of the airlines.  That system is no longer in place.  The other source of pilots at the time was the military.  Since the end of the Cold War, some of the military training budgets for pilots have been slashed by 98%.  One can imagine what that did to the flow of pilots from the military sector into the commercial sector.  The current trend involves self-sponsored young people using money derived from parents' mortgages.  On qualifying, they proceed to airlines and are paid little or no salary as they operate as co-pilots.<\/p><p>  The issue of the home base arises.  Many of the young pilots are told from week to week that they are operating from a different airport.  The current rule allows for the airline to define its new home base on a weekly basis.  Therefore, it does not have to provide hotel or subsistence accommodation.  It would be like telling Members of the D&aacute;il that their home base would be Brussels for one week and that, as a consequence, they would not have to be provided with a hotel, expenses or a flight, and that at the end of the week the home base would again be Dublin.  In the aviation industry this happens to young people weekly.  They have already had to go to the banks and their parents for &euro;130,000.  They have no permanency of place.  This practice is rampant in the industry, particularly in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013020600006#G00200","nonspeaker":"Captain Evan Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1360145400,"counter":882,"content":"<p>This is discouraging young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013020600006#G00300","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360145400,"counter":883,"content":"<p>In its soundbites the Irish Aviation Authority states it adopts the highest standards from Europe.  In fact, from a flight operations perspective, it operates at the minimum standard permissible under international aviation law.  It actually operates to the lowest denominator.  Let me give an example concerning flight time limitations.  Aer Lingus is commencing a Heathrow operation involving domestic routes within the United Kingdom.  From our writing of the rosters, we know it was intended that the operation would be crewed as per Irish laws and rules.  Aer Lingus is operating this joint venture for Virgin Atlantic which has insisted on it being operated to UK standards.  This has meant an increase of almost 15% to 20% in the number of pilots required to do the work.  The cost advantage associated with the manner in which Irish regulations are implemented, by comparison with the manner in which regulations are implemented in the United Kingdom, is very clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013020600006#G00400","nonspeaker":"Captain Evan Cullen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360145400,"counter":884,"content":"<p>On the questions put by Deputy Dessie Ellis, we are very unhappy about three key issues.  There are actually more than three, but we are focused on three today.  The European Cockpit Association has a shortlist of seven.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned stand-by pilots being woken up.  This is one of the problem areas.  If one is on long-term stand-by, called \"reserve stand-by\", there is no mechanism to protect one's rest periods and sleep opportunities.  One could be called in the middle of an afternoon sleep or early in the morning, thus ruining one's sleep.  One cannot get the sleep needed to operate later.  There are a number of other issues, but these are really the key ones that have been mentioned today.  <\/p><p>  I was asked whether there was an opt-out mechanism.  There is not.  The new rules will apply all over Europe.  The idea is to harmonise them across Europe.  It is legally possible for individual member states to keep stricter or more protective rules at national level if they wish to.  This allowed the United Kingdom to keep the significantly stricter CAP 371.  Worryingly, however, under the EASA rules, this possibility will end.  Therefore, countries which today have stricter rules in general or specific areas will be forced to downgrade their safety standard to the new EU-wide standard.  We in Brussels are very much trying to safeguard the principle of non-regression, or what we call the safety-enhancement principle, in order that countries will be able to maintain or introduce stricter standards at national level if they wish to.  This battle is not yet won.<\/p><p>  Scientific evidence has been ignored.  We asked EASA once and the Commission twice to meet scientists again to consider the latest proposal, published in October 2012.  On two occasions we received a negative answer and did not get an answer to our last request.  Therefore, neither EASA nor the European Commission wants to have the latest proposal subjected to another scientific review to determine whether the new package is safe.  The package could be safe, but the scientists should be allowed to have another look in order that member states and the European Parliament which will have to deliberate on it will have all the information necessary to make a judgment.  It would be better to do this because, if it is not done, there could be a legal case.  The European Cockpit Association is examining very carefully the possibility of challenging these rules at the European Court of Justice, but we all know it will take between three and five years for the court to take a decision.  In the meantime, the rules will have entered into force.  It is better to listen to scientific evidence, make the system safe right away and apply the precautionary principle, which is very important.<\/p><p>  When I examined the transcript of the committee's hearing with the Irish Aviation Authority, the authority's position was not entirely clear to me.

On shortcuts, we have for the last 12 months been dealing with a situation involving a pilot who was put through a disciplinary process for calling in fatigued and refusing to take a flight.  His roster complied with the legislation and rules but a number of experts found that the roster was what they called desynchronising.  In other words, he was being flipped from an early start to a late start the following day.  Just as his body clock was getting used to getting up at 5.30 a.m. and working until 3 p.m. he would be switched to a 2 p.m. start.  As he had woken up at 5.30 p.m. and could not sleep, his body was slowing down.

The European Cockpit Association launched an online safety petition on this issue and in a relatively short period of time we collected 100,000 signatures which we handed to the European Commission and Parliament two weeks ago.  This indicates that members of the public feel concerned once they know about the issue.  However, the problem is that pilot fatigue is not visible in the statistics.  Fatigue often goes unreported by pilots.  Only between 20% and 30% of pilots file a report when they are fatigued.  Many others do not bother because they are too tired at the end of a shift or they fear negative repercussions.  Several of our member associations carried out fatigue surveys among pilots, the results of which are summarised in our publication.  They confirm the earlier comments about pilots falling asleep and being tired.<\/p><p>  We have repeatedly confronted EASA with our arguments and the arguments of scientists.  EASA argues that the scientists got it wrong on a number of issues and that as they do not understand the operational environment in Europe, it had to reinterpret the results and sometimes disregard them.  We said that is fine but the scientists should be asked whether they agree with EASA's reinterpretation and doubts before it comes to a conclusion.  EASA is aware that it disregarded scientific evidence on a variety of issue but it claims to know better.

That glass, and not only bigger pieces of glass, is one of the main drivers in terms of safety and the environment.  From a safety point of view, bigger pieces of glass give better visibility for the driver.  From an environmental point of view, using glass, which is a strong material, allows for less metal or steel in the vehicle and brings down weight.  Manufacturers rely on the glass to give some level of roof crash resistance in the event of a roll-over, for example, but also it imparts some torsional rigidity; without the glass the vehicle does not drive straight.  The wheels are not necessarily parallel and do not necessarily sit flat on the road, and the glass, with the bond and adhesive used, ensures that the stiffness of the vehicle is retained.<\/p><p>  The other opportunity glass provides is that it allows for the airbag to inflate properly, particularly for the passenger side, because the steering wheel is in front of the driver and when the airbag inflates it closes a gap.  In the event of an accident, the driver is moving forward, the air bag fills that space and provides a cushioning to slow down the acceleration experienced by the body.  The passenger does not have close proximity to anything, so he or she relies on a very big airbag to fill the space, and to inflate properly that airbag relies on the windscreen being bonded properly into the vehicle.  If the glass is not bonded properly it does not allow the occupant to strike the airbag in the correct position, and the acceleration process is modified greatly.<\/p><p>  The final point about the importance of a windscreen in keeping the occupants within the vehicle is that there is a good deal of historic research which shows that if someone is ejected from the vehicle in the event of an accident, his or her risk of significant injury or fatality is increased three- or fourfold.  Seat belts help to keep occupants within the vehicle but the airbag has a part to play.  If a person is not wearing a seat belt and the windscreen is not there, occupants are not kept within the vehicle.  I will show the members some images of what a correctly fitted screen should do in an accident.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013020600008#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Davies","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360146900,"counter":911,"content":"<p>Let me outline how we highlighted this issue.  When we saw these cases, we spoke to the Road Safety Authority.  It stated we were the experts and the only ones who could do something about the problem but that it needed to be addressed by way of an independent study.  We mandated work with TRL, a transport research laboratory and the biggest expert in transport research in Europe.  It works with famous brands and also bodies such as the European Commission, the Department for Transport in the United Kingdom and even the International Automobile Federation.<\/p><p>  Let me refer to our methodology.  We carried out an audit of all the windscreens we had replaced.  The study lasted 14 weeks and covered the entire Republic of Ireland.  During the period over 5,000 windscreens were replaced.  We found that 500 of them had been replaced previously.  This constituted the base of the study.  Shockingly, we found that over 35% exhibited some quality or safety issue.  More worryingly, over 14% of these showed serious safety issues, meaning that if the driver had been in an accident, there could have been serious health implications or even a lethal outcome.  We accumulated and extrapolated the figures for the past five years and concluded that between 60,000 and 90,000 vehicles on the road could have serious safety issues.  This is a source of major concern for us.<\/p><p>  We spoke to the major stakeholders and received some very positive feedback and support from the Irish Brokers Association, the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Institute of Automotive Engineer Assessors, which was very surprised by the issue.  We were also in contact with the Road Safety Authority and the Institute of the Motor Industry, which also offered support.  We all believe it is urgent that the problem be addressed.  Windscreens are being replaced with others of poor quality.  Windscreens are much more complex than they used to be and are integral to the strength of a car.  Airbags are an essential part of the safety system.  Cars are becoming older in Ireland, meaning the chances of having one's windscreen replaced are becoming greater.  Furthermore, the recession might lead people to make the wrong choice and go to a cheap supplier who does not do quality work.<\/p><p>  The first solution is the acknowledgement of the problem.  I again thank the committee for affording us an opportunity to speak about it.  As the police do not collect the relevant data, however, another solution is to record accident data.  A minimum standard needs to be introduced.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has a role to play in validating the training of personnel, the use of quality products and the standardised processes.  Our last recommendation is for a monitoring system to protect the consumer.  The Irish Insurance Federation has a role to play in this regard.  As over 70% of drivers are insured for windscreen damage, it is possible to have influence in this area.  The NCT, at a later stage, also has a role to play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013020600009#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Heiner Herz"},{"type":"speech","time":1360146900,"counter":912,"content":"<p>My questions will be very brief because Mr. Herz, in his final summation, has answered them.

As Mr. Davies explained, windscreen replacement is a very complex chemical process.  If one step of the process is missed, it can pose a problem.  The root of the problem is that there are no standards; no training is provided and up to now the problem was invisible.  The National Car Testing Service, NCT, makes a visual check and inspects to see if the E-mark is on the glass.  However, this will not identify any underlying problems with the windscreen.
