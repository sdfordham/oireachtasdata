Many of these infections are difficult to treat as they involve antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where the infectious agent is resistant to a treatment to which it was previously sensitive.   <\/font><font color=\"#002041\">Current evidence shows that while antimicrobial resistance in MRSA has continued to decline. Over the last five years MRSA infection among people with the infected agent has declined from 40% to 23.5%. However, resistance in other organisms, such as E Coli, is rising. In relation to the incidence of infection, there has been a decrease in central IV line infection and a decrease in C. difficile infection.  There has been a minimal increase in peripheral line infection.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#002041\">A national clinical programme, under the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (RCPI) and the HSE, is in place to address this issue.  This will be run through a multidisciplinary clinical advisory group under RCPI governance, with joint working groups on prevention of surgical site infection and critical care and hospital-acquired infection.  An HSE implementation group will be chaired by the National Director for Patient Safety, Dr Philip Crowley, and the programme operated under the Regional Directors of Operations. The issue is also being addressed outside the acute system, through initiatives in primary and long term care.<\/font><font color=\"#002041\">The programme aims to ensure that healthcare workers focus on three areas every time they care for patients.  These are:<\/font><\/p><p> -  <font color=\"#002041\">Hand hygiene compliance <\/font><\/p><p>-  <font color=\"#002041\">Appropriate use of antimicrobials <\/font><\/p><p>-  <font color=\"#002041\">Prevention of medical infections associated with medical devices such as intravenous lines and urinary catheters.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#002041\">Because treatment of these infections is complicated by antibiotic resistance, emphasis is being placed on better antimicrobial use and on hygiene-related measures in hospitals, with compliance in this area audited on a regular basis. <\/font><font color=\"#424282\"> <\/font>The most recent data shows that compliance with certain measures are at appropriate levels, and that increased effort is needed in other areas.  For instance,<font color=\"#002041\">hand hygiene compliance has improved, with the most recent hand hygiene compliance audit (June\/July 2012) indicating an increase to 81.6% (below the 2012 target of 85%). Nursing\/midwives scored the highest (86%) with medical staff the lowest (69%).  I recognise that there is a need for further improvement in this area and in particular in relation to aseptic tasks, such as inserting an intravenous (IV) line, where compliance is at a sub-optimal rate of 80%.  <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#002041\"> I am very much aware of this issue, and will continue, as will my department, to monitor measures being taken by the HSE and the compliance audits of these measures. While this issue requires ongoing clinical vigilance, I am satisfied that current measures are having a positive effect, as is evident from a decrease in incidence of infection and decline in AMR in relation to MRSA.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800045#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800045#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[48745\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800045#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the planning application of the Simon Community, Ushers Quay, Dublin, in relation to a transfer of services from the Rowan Ward in Cherry Orchard, Dublin; if he is satisfied with the way the transfer of services has gone to this point; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1032","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>A review of the Rowan Ward HIV respite service found that when the Rowan Ward was set up in 1990 its purpose was to provide end stage palliative care to AIDS patients.

Given these changes in the Rowan Ward service model the review outlined alternative care pathways for the Rowan Ward client base within the homeless\/addiction sector.<\/p><p>  Following the review, the HSE proposed to close the Rowan Ward and to locate the service in an existing service in the homeless\/addiction sector.  This was accomplished by the creation of eight dedicated beds for the Rowan Ward patient group within an addiction\/homeless service currently provided by Dublin Simon in Ushers Island.  The transfer of Rowan Ward clients to the Ushers Island facility commenced on 1st September 2012, overseen by a steering group consisting of statutory and voluntary service providers.  The new service provides a more amenable care pathway for the Rowan Ward HIV patients and the staff in the Ushers Island complex will be better positioned to manage clients with addiction associated issues.

The Report found that, not withstanding the commitment and initiative of dedicated staff and management, there were a significant number of people still experiencing institutional living conditions where they lacked basic privacy and dignity, living their lives apart from the community and families.<\/p><p>  The HSE has established a National Implementation Group on Congregated Settings under its National Consultative Forum on Disabilities comprised of representatives from the HSE, disability umbrella groups and service user representative organisations.

Under UHI, every citizen will be insured and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premia for those who qualify for a subsidy.  I want to assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to the introduction of a universal health insurance model and is of the view that this model of healthcare will deliver the necessary reform of our healthcare system.  <\/p><p>  In designing the precise model of care on which universal health insurance will be based, I want to ensure that it meets the needs of the Irish system and achieves the best outcomes for patients.  This requires that we carefully plan and sequence the reform programme and that we give detailed consideration to the most appropriate structures for delivery of different services.  We also need to look at the relationships between services, and at best practice in healthcare reform.<\/p><p>  To help us in this work, I established an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance in February of this year.  The Group is tasked with assisting the Department of Health in developing detailed and costed implementation proposals for universal health insurance and in driving the implementation of various elements of the reform programme. The Group consists of a mix of those with executive responsibilities within the health service and external expertise, including international experts. <\/p><p>  The Implementation Group has already met on five occasions and has advised the Department in relation to its work on some of the core building blocks for UHI, including the introduction of a Money Follows the Patient funding system and the creation of Hospital Groups. <\/p><p>   The Group will also assist my Department in preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.  The White Paper will outline details of the UHI model in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance.  <\/p><p>  Preparation of a White Paper is a complex and technical process. It will require significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise.  Officials in my Department, in consultation with the Implementation Group on UHI, are putting in place a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into the Department&rsquo;s preparation of the White Paper.  This work is ongoing at present with a view to ensuring that the White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&rsquo;s term of office.  <\/p><p>  To complement the work of the Implementation Group on UHI, I also established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum in February of this year.  The Forum comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.  <\/p><p>  This Forum has been established with a view to generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. Its core focus is on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.<\/p><p>  Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800045#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Court Recommendations","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800045#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[41678\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800045#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure that there are standard contracts with detailed terms and conditions for workers in the home help sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1032","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[48945\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800045#WRA02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans regarding the continuing refusal of the Health Service Executive to provide contracts to persons employed as home helps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[41676\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800045#WRA02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure that there are standard contracts with detailed terms and conditions for workers in the home help sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[41677\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800045#WRA02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns being raised by home helps with regards to their lack of contracts and conditions of employment; his plans to take action regarding same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 21, 23 and 55 together.<\/p><p>  On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning home help contracts and that in the event that there are any outstanding issues, they may be referred back to the Court.

A special allocation of &euro;35 million was provided in Budget 2012 for mental health, in line with commitments in the Programme for Government.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children&rsquo;s mental health services by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.  Of the 414 posts approved to implement the &euro;35 million package, 150 will be allocated to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams. The National Recruitment Service of the HSE is currently working to recruit the necessary personnel and the posts are at various stages in the recruitment process.  It is hoped that the bulk of the appointments will be made by the end of the year.  <\/p><p>  It is envisaged that the completion of the multi-disciplinary profile of current teams will facilitate further progress on the reduction in the waiting lists for CAMHS services.  It is worth noting that despite an increase in demand for such services, the number of children waiting for an appointment reduced by 12% in the 12 month period to June 2012.<\/p><p>  In terms of in-patient facilities, psychiatric bed capacity for children and adolescents has increased from 12 beds in 2007 to 44 at present - 12 in Dublin, 12 in Cork and 20 in Galway.  Work on the second phase of the Child and Adolescent Unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview has recently been completed and this will increase capacity from 12 to 18 beds in Dublin by the end of 2012.  The increase in bed capacity in recent years is reflected in an almost 50% decrease in admissions of children to adult units since 2008.  <\/p><p>  The Linn Dara Child and Adolescent Mental Health Facility at Cherry Orchard, Dublin has recently opened and a number of Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams have moved in to the new premises.  It is expected that the Day Hospital will be in operation by the end of the year. Thj HSE is also seeking tenders from contractors as part of the process to develop a 22 bed Child and Adolescent in-patient facility on the Cherry Orchard site. The closing date for receipt of tenders is 22nd November.<\/p><p>  Finally, a 10 bed Child and Adolescent Forensic Mental Health Unit will be provided as part of the National Forensic Mental Health Project.

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. Reform across the three domains of access, quality and resources is not achievable unless there is real clinical and managerial accountability at hospital level.<\/p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals. It is about the bringing together groups of hospitals to form single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery. With specific regard to the South East there remains full commitment to the retention of Waterford as one of the 8 existing national cancer services with all the associated services required in the hospital. The Trauma Centre at Waterford will also be retained. The provision of other services at any hospital site will, of course, primarily be determined by the appropriate clinical programme for that service, taking account of the population which the hospital serves and services provided by other hospitals which are within a reasonable commute.<\/p><p>  Last June I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups.

The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry Scheme (HIPE) system is the largest system providing information on hospital care in this country.  <\/p><p>With this in mind, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department has been working on a report entitled <b><i>&#8216;Health Care Quality Indicators in the Irish Health System: Examining the Potential of Hospital Discharge Data&#8217;<\/i><\/b>.  This includes the measure of recorded 30 day in-hospital mortality rates following heart attack.  <\/p><p>The work to date demonstrates the value of using HIPE as a tool to derive knowledge and understanding of health care quality.  However, this work has also uncovered variation in the accuracy of data as reported through the HIPE system.  Some individual hospitals have looked into the origin of this variation and attributed it to inaccuracies in both the medical chart and the subsequent coding of information that is then inputted by individual hospitals in the HIPE system.  <\/p><p>I am concerned about this finding in relation to data quality given its potential patient safety implications. I believe that, arising from this, there is a duty on all hospitals to address measures that can ensure that the information which they record and report is accurate.  <\/p><p>Concerns have been raised by certain hospitals and clinicians that the report, which seeks only to examine quality of data, could be either inadvertently or deliberately misinterpreted as making inferences on quality of care.

It is essential that all hospitals provide care in the right way, at the right location, and in a manner that ensures a safe, high quality service for all.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to securing and further developing the role of our smaller hospitals which will see them provide more, not fewer services.  The challenge is to make sure that they provide services, which can safely be delivered in these settings, in order to maximise the benefit to patients.  All hospitals, irrespective of size, as well as associated GP and community services, must work together in an integrated way. There have already been very significant developments recently in health care delivery, particularly in the context of shifts to day surgery and ambulatory care, and the centralisation of low volume high complexity care into larger centres. In this context, it is necessary that we redefine the role of the smaller hospitals so that they continue to play a central part of the Irish Health care system.<\/p><p>  The Framework for Smaller Hospitals defines the role of the smaller hospitals. It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together. The Framework outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within the smaller hospital.  It defines the need for the smaller hospital to be supported within a group of hospitals in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff and the safe management of patients who present with varying levels of complexity. It also sets out to address the categories of services that should transfer from the larger to the smaller hospitals and <i>vice versa<\/i> within a Hospital Group so that services are delivered in the most appropriate hospital.<\/p><p>  Work is in progress on developing a detailed plan for service enhancements in each of the nine smaller hospitals that are covered by the Smaller Hospitals Framework.  These plans are based on detailed local analysis of the services in place and what can be provided in the future.<\/p><p>  I am determined to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely and appropriately in smaller, local hospitals. On this basis, the organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the ongoing development of the HSE Clinical Programmes.  With this in mind the Framework will set out what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospitals in the interest of better outcomes for patients.<\/p><p>  The Smaller Hospitals Framework is currently being examined in the context of the overall reorganisation of the health services.   The HSE is in the final stages of a consultation process to help inform the details of the service changes.  This consultation process has sought feedback from all stakeholders, including local communities and health professionals in each hospital who deliver the service, and their feedback will be captured as input to the change process. Until this process has been fully completed I do not think that it is appropriate to comment on individual hospitals at this time.<\/p><p>  It is my intention to publish the Framework when this process has been completed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800046#WRB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800046#WRB01250"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[48750\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800046#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress that has been made in the Health Service Executive West region since the introduction of standardised ambulance response times; the steps being taken to improve ambulance response times in the region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800046#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Staff","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800046#WRB01450"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[48937\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800046#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to make health service employees work longer hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>There are no plans at present to require health service employees to work longer hours.

As a result, reliable data for 2008-2010 cannot be provided.<\/p><p>  In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant\/home support hours were provided to persons with physical and\/or sensory disability.

Service efficiencies around the provision of Personal Assistant services are currently being achieved through a process of negotiation with service providers around the unit cost of providing the service, rather than reducing the number of PA hours.  In this context, the National Disability Unit is engaging with each HSE region to identify models and approaches in place pertaining to Personal Assistant and Home Support Services as well as cost, such as hourly and daily rates, involved in providing services.

The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways: -Health-funded rehabilitative (life skills) training (RT);<\/p><p>  -Health-funded day services;<\/p><p>  -F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training;<\/p><p>  -Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.<\/p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. In 2012, almost 700 school-leavers required RT places or day services and the position in 2013 is expected to be similar. Budgetary constraints and the moratorium on staff recruitment give rise to challenges in service provision. In addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. However both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner so as to be as responsive as possible to the needs of this cohort. While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services or RT places to school-leavers with special needs, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver. The HSE is currently reviewing the outcomes for 2012 school-leavers in terms of placements achieved and scoping out the likely requirements for  2013.<\/p><p>  There is evidence that an accelerated move towards a new model of individualised, person-centred service provision in the community can help to achieve efficiencies, particularly in relation to services for those with mild or moderate intellectual disability. The HSE has established an implementation project team to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult y Services. The report, published in February 2012,  titled 'New Directions', proposes that day services in the future take the form of a menu of 12 individualised, outcome-focussed  supports which will provide adults with disabilities with the support necessary to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes, aspirations and needs. The guiding principle for the future is that supports will be tailored to individual need and will be flexible, responsive and person-centred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800048#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Cost","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800048#WRD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[48939\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800048#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the latest increase in VHI prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to the recent VHI announcement that it is to increase prices by between 2%-3% across most of its plans with effect from 22 November 2012.  <\/p><p>  VHI sets its own premiums and I am not legally empowered to direct the VHI in any way in relation to its prices.

The report examines the strengths, weaknesses and challenges presented by the regulatory framework that protects older people in nursing homes.  It concludes that, overall, the standards are viewed positively and have increased the quality of and confidence in care provided in the nursing home sector.  The Government remains committed to supporting older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  This report is a valuable contribution that will inform our thinking in respect of developing policies and services in relation to long term care for older people.  Their safety and well being is and will continue to be of paramount importance.

The Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible and is also strongly committed to protecting community rating, whereby older and less healthy customers should pay the same amount for the same cover as younger and healthier people.<\/p><p>  To support the principle of community rating, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market. I was pleased, therefore, to recently publish the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 on 18 October, to give effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) to be applied from 1 January 2013. An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  <\/p><p>  There can be little doubt that price increases will make it more difficult for persons who hold private health insurance to renew their policies. I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers. I will continue to focus strongly on this issue. <\/p><p>  I am keen to explore all available measures to limit the costs related to health insurance.  In February of this year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum has been established with a view to generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. Its core focus is on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.  <\/p><p>  In this regard, VHI has commissioned consultants to carry out an external review of their claims.  The review is nearing completion and will look at the opportunities and costs involved in possible reductions in utilisation that can be achieved by implementing appropriate utilisation management approaches. <\/p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800048#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Dementia Strategy","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800048#WRD02250"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[48944\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800048#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which the National Dementia Strategy will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government gives a commitment to develop a<i> National Strategy on Dementia<\/i> by 2013<i><\/i>which will increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention, and enhance community based services for people living with this condition.<\/p><p>  The first stage of the process was to assemble the research and evidence upon which the strategy will be developed.

This comprehensive body of legislation recognised the new status of civil partnerships for tax purposes and set out the various rights, entitlements and obligations that apply to civil partners with regard to taxation.

However, when providing these services to members, credit unions must ensure that they comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including the requirements of the Credit Union Act, 1997. It is also incumbent on credit unions to ensure that they are operationally capable of providing such services without placing undue risk on members&rsquo; savings.  The Central Bank has stated that it cannot comment on matters in relation to individual credit unions.

The issue of the introduction of a rebate scheme for users of marked gas oil has been addressed in previous parliamentary debates.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a change to a system of this nature would involve the establishment of an expensive repayments system and would give rise to significant costs and place an administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners.  It would also pose significant cash-flow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.  Marked gas oil has a wide range of uses such as the propulsion of trains, the operation of agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and for commercial and home heating purposes.  Any change in the existing system would therefore impact across a wide range of users.<\/p><p>  Fuel laundering is a priority for the Revenue Commissioners who are tackling the problem on a number of fronts. For example, new and enhanced licensing provisions have been introduced for the sale of marked gas oil and auto-fuel. In addition, from January 2013, all fuel traders will make monthly returns to Revenue on their fuel stocks and transactions, enabling Revenue to identify unusual or suspicious patterns of activity.  Revenue is also collaborating with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs in the UK to ensure we tackle the problem in a consistent and complementary way and the two administrations are working together to seek a better marker.  Revenue continues to enforce the regulations actively at all stages of the fuel supply chain, targeting those involved in producing and selling laundered fuel. Since 2010, these interventions have resulted in the closure of 24 fuel laundering plants, the closure of over 70 fuel retail outlets and the seizure of over 2 million litres of fuel, together with associated equipment and transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Relief","counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":276,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[49180\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who are in receipt of mortgage tax relief at present for loans taken out in or after 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[49181\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRF01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total cost of mortgage tax relief in 2012 for loans taken out in or after 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[49183\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost in tax forgone of increasing mortgage interest relief for all loans taken out in or after 2004 by 1%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 99 and 101 together.<\/p><p>It is estimated that the total number of mortgage interest relief claimants in 2011, the latest year for which information is readily available, is about 488,000, of which some 266,000 are estimated to be first-time buyers.

We continue to review all cost categories with a view to achieving savings where possible.   The Department of Finance has always been a strong adherent to the need for efficiency and has a track record of implementing change and reducing headcount. Some of the initiatives undertaken in this regard are highlighted below:<\/p><p> - The Department acts as a sizeable shared service centre for the Civil Service as outlined in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure of 2011.  The work of the Department in this area will already have allowed considerable cost and headcount efficiencies in client Departments or bodies.  The Department remains supportive of further developments in this area and would expect further efficiencies in client locations as the shared service concept is implemented more widely.<\/p><p> - Headcount in the Paymaster General Banking section has fallen from 18 in 2004 to 4 today, arising from automation and payable order reduction.<\/p><p> - The headcount in the combined pensions and salaries sections of 38 today compared to 34 in 2004 represents only a 12% increase, whereas \tthe number of salaries and pensions being paid has risen by almost 85% from 16,400 in 2004 to 30,200 today.  Over 50% of this growth is due to the Department, payroll, as well as payment of pensions to VEC retirees, allowing headcount reductions in these client entities.<\/p><p> - The Department has also actively sought to augment its resources on a pro-bono basis through secondments from the private and public sectors.  Currently, the Department benefits from the services of eight individuals in this way without cost to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> - The Department is phasing out the issuance of paper payslips to pensioners.  This is expected to yield savings in the order of &euro;200k p.a.  The Department is also phasing out the use of payable orders which is expected to yield savings.<\/p><p> - The Department is targeting savings on the overtime bill in comparison with 2012 of some &euro;100k p.a.<\/p><p> - The Department has reorganised accommodation requirements, resulting in the termination of one lease which will generate savings of the order of &euro;0.45m per annum for the Exchequer.  We are also reviewing procurement arrangements with a view to introducing efficiencies and securing reduced rates \tfrom suppliers on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>  However, we must also ensure that the Department of Finance is adequately resourced to address issues as they arise in the banking sector and to deliver on the considerable goals set out in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2011-2014. In particular, bank and debt restructuring work is driven by developments in Europe and the primary objective of that work is to ensure that the State optimises its position. We are entering a critical phase of potential restructuring based on the European political commitments expressed during the summer, with potentially very significant benefits to the national finances and therefore the related costs need to be considered. Furthermore, the economic planning initiatives of my Department, the fundamental objective of which is to improve the growth potential of the economy so as to reduce the level of unemployment, also carry an element of additional cost.  All of the above are currently under active consideration in the context of the appropriate allocation of the scarce resources of the State in the forthcoming budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRF02650"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[49268\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reduction in tax expenditure that would be achieved from abolishing tax relief for medical and dental insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>It should be noted that relief for qualifying dental insurance policies is allowed as part of the general relief for medical insurance since 2004 and is not identified separately for statistical purposes.

The SEIS provides a higher rate of relief for qualifying investments in early stage enterprises, than is available under EIS and was introduced with effect from the 6th of April this year.   We have a similar incentive to the EIS called the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII), which commenced on 25 November 2011, following the receipt of State Aid approval from the European Commission. The EII provides tax relief of 30% on investments made in small and certain medium-sized enterprises, including early stage enterprises, with the possibility of a further 11% in tax relief at the end of a three year holding period. The incentive was previously known as the Business Expansion Scheme and was significantly amended to target limited Exchequer resources towards job creation. As part of these changes, access to the incentive was made available to the majority of small and medium-sized companies (SMEs).<\/p><p>  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that the level of funding raised by SMEs under the Business Expansion Scheme has been declining since 2008. This could be related to the economic downturn or to a lower appetite for risk among investors. It is too early to say whether the changes brought about by the introduction of EII will have the desired affect and halt such decline. However, the peak period for raising investments under EII is November\/December and a better picture of the impact of the changes should be available next year.<\/p><p>  The introduction of any scheme that would provide higher tax relief for investments in certain companies could have the capacity to skew investments towards such companies. This could work to the detriment of other equally deserving companies that need to raise risk capital investments. Ultimately, the priority of the Government is to incentivise investments where they are most likely to create jobs. Therefore, I am inclined to be cautious as regards implementing further changes to the tax incentives available for such investments at the current time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRH02150"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[49352\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will outline any additional payments, made by the covered banks to their employee pension schemes since 2007 that fall outside of normal employer contributions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":370,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Banks that unfortunately this it has been impossible to collate this information within this short timeframe.

The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.  The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.<\/p><p>  Every school therefore must have in place a policy, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.<\/p><p>  In terms of other training I am very aware of the importance of appropriate teacher training and support in this and other aspects of teachers' day to day work with children.  In this regard, initial teacher education plays a huge role in training our teachers and ensuring that they are aware of the developmental and emotional needs of their students.  As part of their lifelong journey, teachers engage in ongoing professional development (CPD) and this will become a statutory requirement in the near future. CPD helps to ensure that teachers are aware of current research and best practice in working with young people.  In the area of anti-bullying, the Deputy will be aware that my Department currently funds the Social Personal &amp; Health Education (SPHE) Support Service which provides support for post primary schools including training courses on positive strategies for managing bullying issues.  Schools are also supported in the review of their anti-bullying policies and practices.<\/p><p>  At primary level, my Department's support services provide ongoing training and support to teachers and principals in the implementation of SPHE and the Stay Safe Programme, which includes a specific module on bullying.<\/p><p>  In addition to these support services, individual schools have autonomy to determine whether they wish to supplement or support the school's work in the area of anti-bullying with other external resources\/materials as appropriate.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy knows, I am very aware of the need to tackle bullying and it was for that reason that an Anti-Bullying Forum was held in May this year.<\/p><p>  As a follow on to that Forum, I invited the stakeholders and any other interested parties to submit their views on this important topic to my Department by 29th June 2012.  I understand that the Anti-Bullying Campaign has made a submission as have many other interested parties.  <\/p><p>  I have also established a working group to address the issue of tackling bullying in schools, including cyber-bullying.  During the course of its work, the working group will be considering the outcomes from the Anti-Bullying Forum together with the submissions received.  Over the last few months, the working group has been consulting with a range of stakeholders and with counterparts  in Scotland and the UK.  The Group is working on an action plan recommending further measures that can be taken to effectively tackle bullying in schools.  The Group expects to complete its work by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRK02150"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[49304\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the date on which a teacher would have had to have graduated from a Masters degree course and have commenced a Masters degree programme to be eligible for the qualification allowance which has been discontinued.","asker":"1110","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>People who were first employed in a teaching post (qualified or unqualified) in the public sector on or before 4 December 2011 and who have completed a course of study which commenced on or prior to 4 December 2011 only will be eligible to apply for allowances for that course of study.

The pay range profile has been updated since my reply to reflect the significant reductions in the numbers of public servants in the 1st quarter of 2012 and the current pay data profile (based on 292,000 whole time equivalent public servants) is referenced in detail in my replies to Question Nos. 39603, 39605 and 39606\/12 of 19 September 2012 and 41225\/12 of 27 September 2012. <\/p><p>  Based on the current numbers and pay range profile available to my Department, the estimated full year gross saving in the Exchequer and Local Government pay bill arising from a cap of &euro;100,000 is &euro;290m. The estimate takes account of the reductions in pay arising from the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, 2009, but does not take account of any offsetting reductions in taxes and levies. As the combined effect of the estimated marginal tax rate and the pension related reduction at a pay level for a public servant of &euro;100,000 p.a. or higher is at least 62.5%, the estimated net savings would be reduced to less than &euro;110m<\/p><p>  Estimates are based on basic salary range (excluding premium pay and allowances) but include employer&rsquo;s pay related social insurance. The Exchequer pay bill estimates include public servants serving in the Health Service Executive, Vocational Educational Committees and non commercial State agencies\/bodies.

The Working Group also recommended that periodic payment orders should only be made where the court is satisfied that continuity of payment under the periodic payments order is reasonably secure.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>The successful operation of a statutory scheme for periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure. In this regard the Working Group recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate. Alternatively it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed. The NTMA has concluded an actuarial review on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security of payment principle. The NTMA report is being considered in consultation with the Minister for Finance with a view to the development of legislative proposals.<\/i><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRT00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRT00550"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[49245\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the gross and net additional expenditure savings that his Department is seeking to achieve in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>These matters are currently under discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and as the Deputy is aware, details of the estimate provision for my Department will be published in conjunction with the forthcoming Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRT00750"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[49316\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide in a tabular form the total list of quasi-Governmental organisations and agencies under his remit; if he will provide a list of quasi-Governmental organisations and agencies under his remit that have been abolished since March 2011 or are scheduled to be abolished and the date on which they are due to be abolished; the date on which the body was created; the name of the body; the 2012 Budget for the body; the number of employees of the body in 2012; the names of any outside consultants hired by the organisation since March 2011 and what future plans he has for the body.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the information he requested is set out in the table below and in he associated footnotes.

This minimum stocking requirement equates with a stocking level of one ewe per hectare.

The number of health service staff has fallen from a peak of 111,000 in 2007 to less than 103,000 now.  As we are all aware, the country still faces serious challenges in respect of the public finances, and in order to meet the targets agreed with the Troika, there will be further reductions in the level of resources allocated to the health sector.<\/p><p>  The 2010 Budget for the health services provided for &#8364;659m in pay savings and &#8364;400m in non-pay savings.  The <i>pay savings<\/i> of &#8364;659m took account of general pay reductions, and higher reductions for those on higher pay on foot of the Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration along with savings associated with the moratorium on recruitment and promotion. The <i>non-pay savings<\/i>   of &#8364;400m concentrated on areas which would not have a significant impact on front-line services, such as reductions in drugs costs, further economies in areas such as procurement, and improved private income collection by public hospitals.  In 2011 further price reductions were applied in relation to pharmaceuticals, to achieve full year savings of &#8364;200 million in the cost of drugs.  Further reductions in GP fees under the Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 were applied, and the charge for treating private patients in public hospitals was increased by 21%.  Along with further procurement economies, and reductions in pay as a result of the voluntary exit schemes, the objective was to mitigate as far as possible against affecting front-line services. <\/p><p>  Expenditure plans for 2012 were set in the context of stabilising the fiscal situation whilst protecting services to the greatest degree possible. As with other sectors, the Health sector incurred a reduction in the resources allocated to it. The gross current budget for the Health Sector for 2012 was some &#8364;183m less than the 2011 allocation. However, the underlying reduction was greater because of the need to provide for unavoidable cost increases in areas such as superannuation, demand-led schemes and Fair Deal. There was also a need to commence implementation of some priority commitments in the Programme for Government. The HSE's National Service Plan indicated that in order to meet the Government's targets and to provide for unavoidable pressures, savings of &#8364;750m will need to be achieved in 2012. <\/p><p>  The HSE is overspent by &#8364;374m to the end of September.  There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the excess expenditure.  In the short term, to address the 2012 position, I have instructed the Executive to impose cash limits on agency and overtime. Furthermore, there will be more rigorous management of absenteeism, travel and subsistence will be limited, and stock management will be intensified in order to better manage cash. Other measures are also being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget, including the use of capital to fund revenue and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis. <\/p><p>  As I have outlined in this House on previous occasions, I have instructed the HSE that efficiencies must be achieved in the first instance before patient services are affected and in this regard, patient safety must be paramount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRX01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Hospital","counter":878,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRX01550"},{"type":"question","counter":879,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[49143\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRX01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has satisfied himself as to the availability of the most suitable readily accessible site for the provision of the proposed new Children's Hospital; if he has examined the merits of a greenfill site for the project; if the preparatory consultancy and research costs to date are likely to be more beneficial in a greenfield site situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":880,"content":"<p>Following the refusal of planning permission by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of planning permission for the new children's hospital on the Mater site, I established a Review Group chaired by Dr Frank Dolphin (the Dolphin Group) to advise on next steps. Their report was presented to me on 8 June last. On Tuesday, I announced the Government&rsquo;s decision to develop the new children&rsquo;s hospital at the campus of St James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin. In identifying the new site, the Government has carefully considered the report of the Dolphin Group along with detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.<\/p><p>  This decision has been made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations being of paramount importance. It is essential that the new children&rsquo;s hospital can deliver best clinical outcomes for our children. Co-location with an adult hospital has been deemed essential by the Dolphin report, and by all previous reports on this issue, while tri-location with a maternity hospital is optimal. Greenfield sites do not offer this opportunity and therefore the Dolphin report excluded greenfield sites from consideration. Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.<\/p><p>  I intend to move quickly now to put in place all the necessary structures and governance arrangements to enable the delivery of this project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality.

The Council (also known as CORU) was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act.<\/p><p>  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31 May, 2011. A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16 December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future. Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board,  the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board are currently in the process of establishment and it is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.<\/p><p>  All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015 or 2016 at the latest.<\/p><p>  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. e name of every registrant will be published in the register, which will be accessible on-line.  Only those registrants who have satisfied the registration board for their designated profession that they hold an approved qualification and are &quot;fit and proper&quot; to engage in the practice of the profession will be entered on the register.<\/p><p>  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) and will continue to do so on a reducing basis to end 2015.<\/p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees and in doing this it is mindful of the requirement for it to become self funding by end 2015. <\/p><p>  The current fee structure is as follows:<\/p><p>  -  A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;<\/p><p>  -  An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax which compares favourably with fees levied by Union and professional bodies where no tax relief is applicable.<\/p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income. e greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing,  for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum. Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act,  registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the bare minimum required to enable the Council to operate. The fee is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. <\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:<\/p><p>-   Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grand-parenting, the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grand-parenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grand-parenting. is concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;<\/p><p>-   The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;<\/p><p>-  Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system. is will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":917,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRY01450"},{"type":"question","counter":918,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[49216\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800050#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason no replacement for a specialist surgeon in a hospital (details supplied) has been hired in over 18 months;

The supports provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to people with HD involve a multi-disciplinary team approach to the provision of health and personal supports and incorporates assisted living services, including Personal Assistant Services, Aids &amp; Appliances and hospital, primary care and community services.  <\/p><p>  The Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland (HDAI), provides consultation, information and individualised support to those diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, their families and their health care team.  The HSE is committed to working in partnership with voluntary disability service providers, including HDAI, to ensure that all of the resources available for people with disabilities are used in the most effective manner possible.  The HSE recognises the valuable contribution of the HDAI and approved a grant of just over &euro;68,000 for 2012 to support the work of the organisation.  The HDAI is a member of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and the Disability Federation of Ireland.  Both umbrella organisations provide support to the HDAI and are supported by the State through funding from the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p>  I established a National Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and a patient centred approach.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the EU Council Recommendations on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  It is envisaged that the main added value of European Reference Networks and therefore of the Centres of Expertise will be to facilitate improvements in access to diagnosis and delivery of high-quality, accessible and cost-effective healthcare in the case of patients who have a medical condition requiring a particular concentration of expertise or resources, particularly in medical domains where expertise is rare.

The SEIS provides a higher rate of relief for qualifying investments in early stage enterprises, than is available under EIS and was introduced with effect from the 6th of April this year.   We have a similar incentive to the EIS called the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII), which commenced on 25 November 2011, following the receipt of State Aid approval from the European Commission. The EII provides tax relief of 30% on investments made in small and certain medium-sized enterprises, including early stage enterprises, with the possibility of a further 11% in tax relief at the end of a three year holding period. The incentive was previously known as the Business Expansion Scheme and was significantly amended to target limited Exchequer resources towards job creation. As part of these changes, access to the incentive was made available to the majority of small and medium-sized companies (SMEs).<\/p><p>  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that the level of funding raised by SMEs under the Business Expansion Scheme has been declining since 2008. This could be related to the economic downturn or to a lower appetite for risk among investors. It is too early to say whether the changes brought about by the introduction of EII will have the desired affect and halt such decline. However, the peak period for raising investments under EII is November\/December and a better picture of the impact of the changes should be available next year.<\/p><p>  The introduction of any scheme that would provide higher tax relief for investments in certain companies could have the capacity to skew investments towards such companies. This could work to the detriment of other equally deserving companies that need to raise risk capital investments.

The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.  The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.<\/p><p>  Every school therefore must have in place a policy, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.<\/p><p>  In terms of other training I am very aware of the importance of appropriate teacher training and support in this and other aspects of teachers' day to day work with children.  In this regard, initial teacher education plays a huge role in training our teachers and ensuring that they are aware of the developmental and emotional needs of their students.  As part of their lifelong journey, teachers engage in ongoing professional development (CPD) and this will become a statutory requirement in the near future. CPD helps to ensure that teachers are aware of current research and best practice in working with young people.  In the area of anti-bullying, the Deputy will be aware that my Department currently funds the Social Personal &amp; Health Education (SPHE) Support Service which provides support for post primary schools including training courses on positive strategies for managing bullying issues.  Schools are also supported in the review of their anti-bullying policies and practices.<\/p><p>  At primary level, my Department's support services provide ongoing training and support to teachers and principals in the implementation of SPHE and the Stay Safe Programme, which includes a specific module on bullying.<\/p><p>  In addition to these support services, individual schools have autonomy to determine whether they wish to supplement or support the school's work in the area of anti-bullying with other external resources\/materials as appropriate.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy knows, I am very aware of the need to tackle bullying and it was for that reason that an Anti-Bullying Forum was held in May this year.<\/p><p>  As a follow on to that Forum, I invited the stakeholders and any other interested parties to submit their views on this important topic to my Department by 29th June 2012.  I understand that the Anti-Bullying Campaign has made a submission as have many other interested parties.  <\/p><p>  I have also established a working group to address the issue of tackling bullying in schools, including cyber-bullying.  During the course of its work, the working group will be considering the outcomes from the Anti-Bullying Forum together with the submissions received.  Over the last few months, the working group has been consulting with a range of stakeholders and with counterparts  in Scotland and the UK.  The Group is working on an action plan recommending further measures that can be taken to effectively tackle bullying in schools.  The Group expects to complete its work by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800054#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":1125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800054#WRK02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1126,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[49304\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800054#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the date on which a teacher would have had to have graduated from a Masters degree course and have commenced a Masters degree programme to be eligible for the qualification allowance which has been discontinued.","asker":"1110","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1127,"content":"<p>People who were first employed in a teaching post (qualified or unqualified) in the public sector on or before 4 December 2011 and who have completed a course of study which commenced on or prior to 4 December 2011 only will be eligible to apply for allowances for that course of study.

Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.<\/p><p>The following table gives a breakdown of the control savings and reviews recorded up to end Sept 2012.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Achieve to end of September 2012 (YTD)<\/th><th>Annual Savings Target   &#8364;M<\/th><th><div> Amt. of savings YTD  &#8364;M  <\/div><\/th><th>Annual Reviews  <br \/>Target<\/th><th>No of Reviews YTD<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker Allowance &amp; Benefit<\/td><td><div>&#8364;102.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;64.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>194,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>174,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit &amp; Medical Review Assessment<\/td><td><div>80.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;44.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>154,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>100,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance\/Invalidity Pension\/DCA<\/td><td><div>39.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;23.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>30,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>23,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension Non Con &amp; Estates<\/td><td><div>&#8364;61.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;54.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>8,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension Con.\/Transitional Pension<\/td><td><div>&#8364;63.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;63.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>11,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>One Family Parent<\/td><td><div>&#8364;116.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;92.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>90,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>73,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widows\/Widowers\/Survivors &amp; Civil Partners<\/td><td><div>&#8364;30.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;37.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>8,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maintenance Recovery Unit<\/td><td><div>&#8364;4.000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;2.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>4,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Child Benefit<\/td><td><div>&#8364;72.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;70.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>247,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>335,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carers<\/td><td><div>&#8364;12.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;12.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>4,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>17,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Family Income Support<\/td><td><div>&#8364;12.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;14.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>26,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>23,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Free Schemes &amp; Others<\/td><td><div>&#8364;24.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;6.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>20,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>15,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PRSI                                                             <\/td><td><div>&#8364;4.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;6.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>7,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SWA<\/td><td><div>&#8364;26.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;14.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>200,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>122,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><div>&#8364;645.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;501.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>985,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>917,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Under the Fraud Initiative 2011 - 2013, the Department plans to undertake at least two fraud and error surveys each year.  These surveys highlight the risk of non-compliance with the rules of the schemes being surveyed at a particular point in time and enable the Department to target those schemes for stronger control measures, where necessary.  Results are presented in terms of the net rate of fraud and error which refers to the position after account is taken of decreases or increases in weekly rates, termination of payments, transfers to other payments and the position following appeal of any cases affected.<\/p><p>Fraud and Error Surveys were published on three schemes in 2012 - Jobseekers Benefit, Disability Allowance and One Parent Family Payment and the results were as follows:<\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px\">-Jobseekers Benefit<b> - <\/b>  the net cost of fraud and error in the claims surveyed was found to be 1.6% of expenditure.

This compares with 5% prior to the levy&rsquo;s introduction.  My Department also monitors per capita usage of leviable plastic bags.

The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of my Department and the administration of the Authority is vested in a Board whose membership includes industry representatives.  The key responsibilities of the Authority are to licence and regulate those providing security services and to improve and maintain standards in the provision of these services.<\/p><p>  I am informed that the Authority issues two types of licence, both of which are valid for a period of two years.  Contractor Licences are required by companies, partnerships and sole traders.  Individual Licences are required by all those working in the security sector within the State whether employed by a licensed contractor or directly by a business as in house security personnel.<\/p><p>  Regulations were recently introduced to extend licensing to contractors providing security services installing CCTV and access control systems with effect from the 1<sup>st<\/sup> October 2012.  In accordance with these regulations, all contractors installing and maintaining CCTV and access control systems must be in possession of the appropriate licence(s) or have an application lodged with the Authority.  In order to obtain a licence, a contractor must prove compliance with national and European standards, be tax compliant and undergo criminal record checking.<\/p><p>  The provision of a regulatory environment understandably leads to cost implications for the industry but the public and the industry itself both benefit from regulation.  The Authority has made every effort to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum and has introduced an instalment payment option to assist contractors with paying for their licence.  The PSA's licence fee structure is monitored by the Authority on a regular basis and I am advised that the Board of the Authority is, in fact, currently reviewing the licence fee.<\/p><p>  The introduction of regulation to a previously unregulated industry will always present challenges for both the regulator and the industry.

The Working Group also recommended that periodic payment orders should only be made where the court is satisfied that continuity of payment under the periodic payments order is reasonably secure.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>The successful operation of a statutory scheme for periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure. In this regard the Working Group recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate. Alternatively it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed. The NTMA has concluded an actuarial review on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security of payment principle.

The number of health service staff has fallen from a peak of 111,000 in 2007 to less than 103,000 now.  As we are all aware, the country still faces serious challenges in respect of the public finances, and in order to meet the targets agreed with the Troika, there will be further reductions in the level of resources allocated to the health sector.<\/p><p>  The 2010 Budget for the health services provided for &#8364;659m in pay savings and &#8364;400m in non-pay savings.  The <i>pay savings<\/i> of &#8364;659m took account of general pay reductions, and higher reductions for those on higher pay on foot of the Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration along with savings associated with the moratorium on recruitment and promotion. The <i>non-pay savings<\/i>   of &#8364;400m concentrated on areas which would not have a significant impact on front-line services, such as reductions in drugs costs, further economies in areas such as procurement, and improved private income collection by public hospitals.  In 2011 further price reductions were applied in relation to pharmaceuticals, to achieve full year savings of &#8364;200 million in the cost of drugs.  Further reductions in GP fees under the Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 were applied, and the charge for treating private patients in public hospitals was increased by 21%.  Along with further procurement economies, and reductions in pay as a result of the voluntary exit schemes, the objective was to mitigate as far as possible against affecting front-line services. <\/p><p>  Expenditure plans for 2012 were set in the context of stabilising the fiscal situation whilst protecting services to the greatest degree possible. As with other sectors, the Health sector incurred a reduction in the resources allocated to it. The gross current budget for the Health Sector for 2012 was some &#8364;183m less than the 2011 allocation. However, the underlying reduction was greater because of the need to provide for unavoidable cost increases in areas such as superannuation, demand-led schemes and Fair Deal. There was also a need to commence implementation of some priority commitments in the Programme for Government. The HSE's National Service Plan indicated that in order to meet the Government's targets and to provide for unavoidable pressures, savings of &#8364;750m will need to be achieved in 2012. <\/p><p>  The HSE is overspent by &#8364;374m to the end of September.  There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the excess expenditure.  In the short term, to address the 2012 position, I have instructed the Executive to impose cash limits on agency and overtime. Furthermore, there will be more rigorous management of absenteeism, travel and subsistence will be limited, and stock management will be intensified in order to better manage cash. Other measures are also being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget, including the use of capital to fund revenue and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis. <\/p><p>  As I have outlined in this House on previous occasions, I have instructed the HSE that efficiencies must be achieved in the first instance before patient services are affected and in this regard, patient safety must be paramount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800067#WRX01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Hospital","counter":1576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800067#WRX01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1577,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[49143\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800067#WRX01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has satisfied himself as to the availability of the most suitable readily accessible site for the provision of the proposed new Children's Hospital; if he has examined the merits of a greenfill site for the project; if the preparatory consultancy and research costs to date are likely to be more beneficial in a greenfield site situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1578,"content":"<p>Following the refusal of planning permission by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of planning permission for the new children's hospital on the Mater site, I established a Review Group chaired by Dr Frank Dolphin (the Dolphin Group) to advise on next steps.

On Tuesday, I announced the Government&rsquo;s decision to develop the new children&rsquo;s hospital at the campus of St James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin. In identifying the new site, the Government has carefully considered the report of the Dolphin Group along with detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.<\/p><p>  This decision has been made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations being of paramount importance. It is essential that the new children&rsquo;s hospital can deliver best clinical outcomes for our children. Co-location with an adult hospital has been deemed essential by the Dolphin report, and by all previous reports on this issue, while tri-location with a maternity hospital is optimal.

The Council (also known as CORU) was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act.<\/p><p>  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31 May, 2011. A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16 December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future. Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board,  the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board are currently in the process of establishment and it is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.<\/p><p>  All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015 or 2016 at the latest.<\/p><p>  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. e name of every registrant will be published in the register, which will be accessible on-line.  Only those registrants who have satisfied the registration board for their designated profession that they hold an approved qualification and are &quot;fit and proper&quot; to engage in the practice of the profession will be entered on the register.<\/p><p>  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) and will continue to do so on a reducing basis to end 2015.<\/p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees and in doing this it is mindful of the requirement for it to become self funding by end 2015. <\/p><p>  The current fee structure is as follows:<\/p><p>  -  A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;<\/p><p>  -  An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax which compares favourably with fees levied by Union and professional bodies where no tax relief is applicable.<\/p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income. e greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing,  for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum. Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act,  registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the bare minimum required to enable the Council to operate. The fee is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. <\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:<\/p><p>-   Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grand-parenting, the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grand-parenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grand-parenting. is concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;<\/p><p>-   The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;<\/p><p>-  Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system. is will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800068#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":1615,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800068#WRY01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1616,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[49216\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012110800068#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason no replacement for a specialist surgeon in a hospital (details supplied) has been hired in over 18 months;
