The President of the European Commission and all European Commissioners are in town and we spent the morning having very constructive dialogue, not only on our Presidency agenda but on matters which are very important to the country, and I greatly appreciate the Chairman facilitating my late arrival.  We will take the speech as read.<\/p><p>  The Bill is one of a suite of reform measures that the Government is determined to introduce to change how public business is done, and the committee has already debated some of them.  The Freedom of Information Act is bedrock legislation which underpins public access to the way the people's business is done.  The aspects I will deal with are the reforms I seek, why they are required and how we will bring them about.<\/p><p>  I was a member of the Government that introduced the original Freedom of Information Act and I remember the very detailed debate when the then Minister for these matters, Eithne Fitzgerald, steered the Bill through the Oireachtas.  Significant restrictions have been imposed on this ground-breaking legislation, primarily by an amending Act introduced in 2003.  The objective I have set out in the draft heads is to reverse the restrictions put in place in 2003 and to extend the Act to the widest possible definition of public bodies and also to non-public bodies significantly funded from the public purse.  Members will recall the approach we took in dealing with the remit of the Ombudsman was that not only public bodies <i>qua<\/i> public bodies should be subject to oversight but also those substantially funded from the public purse.<\/p><p>  Severe restrictions were placed by the amending legislation to access to information as set out in the original Act.  Significant high-profile bodies that exercise very important public functions have been excluded from the Act and there is a need to address the gap that was created.  Deputy Donnelly, who is sitting across from me, and others have an interest in the financial institutions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, refugee and asylum agencies and a number of qualified judicial and regulatory bodies which will now be brought under the remit of the freedom of information legislation.<\/p><p>  The original Act has been in place for 15 years and in any event it is timely to review its functioning and consolidate and simplify it, based not only on what we have learned from how it has worked in this jurisdiction but on an examination of best international practice.  We have taken advice on this from the Information Commissioner, which we have also incorporated in the reforms laid before the committee.<\/p><p>  The reforms seek to ensure greater access to official information, which is fundamental to the operation of any democratic institution.  They also seek to create genuine openness and transparency.  I know people often tire of this phrase, but it is important to how the Government and public bodies do their business.  The reforms also seek to ensure Ireland's freedom of information regime is restored to the top tier of legal frameworks internationally for facilitating access to information, and to ensure the culture and practice of secrecy in public bodies is set aside for good and replaced with a basic legal presumption that the public has a right to know.<\/p><p>  I am happy to answer any particular questions committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000002#A00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1357828200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I understand the Minister will be with us until 4 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000002#A00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1357828200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000002#A00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1357828200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I will try to divide up the time evenly.

We in Fianna F&aacute;il welcome the legislation.  The Minister referred to my introduction of a Private Members' Bill last July.  It was one of the few Private Members' Bills in the past year that the Government accepted in principle.  The Minister deferred Second Stage because he was working on legislation of his own.<\/p><p>  This Bill is substantially in line with my proposals and has taken account of the debate on this matter in recent years.  I welcome the extension of the legislation's measures to, for example, the administrative functions of the Garda, the NTMA, NAMA, the Central Bank and vocational education committees, VECs.  People are probably amazed that VECs were not previously encompassed in the provisions.<\/p><p>  I will put a few points to the Minister.  He might not have the answers, but the purpose of today's meeting is for us to express opinions that he can take into account.  He does not need to accept or reject them now.  Rather, he can consider some of our points.  I welcome his preliminary response.<\/p><p>  Regarding fees, a great falsehood was told about changes to the freedom of information legislation.  When fees were introduced for requests for non-personal information, people claimed that doing so destroyed the original Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000003#B01300","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357828800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fleming for his questions and for taking the considerable trouble of drafting his own Bill, which was helpful in terms of allowing debate on the issue prior to finalisation by Government of its own Bill and in pushing the hands of Government, which is a useful thing to do on issues of importance.  I was glad to be able to accept it.<\/p><p>  My officials will take note of everything said today.  On fees, the bulk of applications are for personal information in respect of which no fees accrue.  Some 70% of all applications fall into that category.  As such, only 30% of freedom of information requests accrue a fee.  I will have my officials check the fees' value and so on.  In 2011, the totality of fees divided by the number of actual FOI requests which were non-personal generated an average charge of &euro;23.  The actual cost - these are not absolute figures - of providing that information was &euro;640 per request.  As such, the fee charged covers only 4% of the cost of providing the information.  Whether fees should be open is a moot point.  There are people who stay up late at night submitting numbers of freedom of information requests on their computers, which often overwhelms systems.  In my view some level of break is reasonable.  However, I am willing to hear views on the issue.  I believe the initial fee system, which is modest, remains appropriate.  I am more concerned about fees in the appeals mechanism, which, in my opinion, ratchet up too quickly.  This is a definite disincentive to people whose requests are refused making further requests.  I propose to significantly modify the fees that apply in respect of appeals.  I believe that is the sensible way to go.  As I said, the views of everybody on these matters will be taken into account.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's point about search and retrieval, I believe he made that point rather effectively when introducing his Bill.  I am minded to agree with him that fees should not be allowed to be ratcheted up to such an amount which discourages people.  I am not adverse to supporting the notion of a cap in this regard.  For information, I will provide the Deputy with the data on this.  In 2011, the average search and retrieval fee charged for non-personal data was &euro;7.42.  Obviously, one gets very little actual public service time for &euro;7.42, which is less than the hourly minimum wage rate.  A realistic and modest fee should be charged.  However, the Deputy's point, in terms of a cap, is well made.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also made a valid point in relation to exemptions, which I will look at again.  On his point in regard new bodies automatically coming within the scope of FOI, we are in this legislation adopting the approach taken in the ombudsman legislation which means new public bodies will be presumed to be encompassed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000004#C00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1357828800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I welcome this legislation.  A big disservice was done in 2003 to good government and transparency in government by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Administration.  That said, the Labour Party gave a commitment in respect of the abolition of fees.  The Minister has provided us with information which reflects that the charge levied meets only 4% of the cost involved, which as he stated is a tiny amount.  I would like to come at this from a slightly different angle.  What is the cost of administering that fee?

I do not want the systems to be overwhelmed by people submitting reams of freedom of information requests.

We are now in a situation where we want administration in general to be efficient and not overwhelmed with freedom of information requests, and even the hundreds of parliamentary questions that come to the Department, for information that is readily available on the website if people would just refer to it.  We live in a very transparent world and we can put more information on the website about our activities.  I put the minutes of the management committee meetings of my Department on the website as well as information on all acquisitions over &euro;20,000, invoices and so forth.  More information is available but it is still sought in freedom of information requests.  Incidentally, 15% of the non-personal requests are from the media and quite often one will see a large headline in a newspaper over information that has been on the website for the last six months.  It is already in the public domain if anybody bothered to look for it.  They think, however, that if they leverage it through a freedom of information request it adds a certain spice to it.

The plan is to continue to do that, which is fantastic.<\/p><p>  There are a few points I wish to raise for the Minister's consideration as he proceeds from the heads of the Bill to the draft Bill.  The first is the bodies that are included.  It is fantastic that the previous exclusions are being included.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, has been discussed at this committee many times.  The level of secrecy around it is very unhealthy.  The same applies to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  I understand that while they will now be included there will still be a set of exemptions for them.  Deputy Fleming referred to this.  In my view, the Bill, perhaps with the exception of security, the Garda and defence, should provide sufficient protections for any organisation and certainly bodies such as NAMA and the NTMA.  In the case of NAMA, for example, commercial sensitivity would already be included.  I would prefer a situation where these bodies do not get exemptions, with the exception of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  Second, what enforcement powers does the Minister envisage for the commissioner?  Will they have the power to sanction or fine bodies which they deem to be non-compliant?<\/p><p>  The third issue is commercial sensitivity, which I believe has been abused by one or two State bodies from which I tried to seek information.  Bus &Eacute;ireann, for example, refused to give me passenger numbers.  It was making some very important changes and was extraordinarily unhelpful.  It refused to give me basic information by hiding behind commercial sensitivity.  It is absolute nonsense but it was able to hide behind it.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials would look at the potential abuse of commercial sensitivity and how that could be addressed through the legislation or guidelines from the commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000005#D01300","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357830000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I have already responded to the exemptions issue, which we will examine.  In terms of enforcement, there are no administrative sanctions but it is a criminal offence and there are criminal sanctions against breaches of the Act.<\/p><p>  Regarding commercial semi-State bodies, we had this debate in the context of the Ombudsman.  Senator Barrett was of the view that no one should be exempt from anything in terms of oversight, which is a legitimate perspective.  As someone who supports the semi-State sector, I want it to operate on a level playing field with the non-State commercial sector.  The semi-State sector should not be disadvantaged to the extent that its commercial decisions are subject to an oversight or an intrusion in the public domain that hampers its capacity to operate on a level playing field with the non-State commercial sector.  We debated it in the context of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill and we may have the opportunity to debate it here.<\/p><p>  With all the legislation I want to introduce, I want it to be discussed by the committee at an early stage.  Any constructive ideas Deputies have, including drafting new sections, will be genuinely considered by me.  It is important to get this right.  This is more the business of the Oireachtas than of the Executive.  I do not regard the Executive as having proprietorial rights or all wisdom on these matters.  I will be genuinely open to constructive thoughts on this point.<\/p><p>  We have had an open discussion about fees and I set out what I believe.  I hear what Deputies are saying.  Section 10, which deals with vexatious requests, is not regarded as very effective and it is a matter we are reviewing.  In my 30 years of public life, I have come across people taking a down on a particular public servant.  Everything the person does is subject to a freedom of information request as a means of torment.  It can go on for weeks, months or years as I have seen in individual cases.  We must have balance in all of this and I am willing to see what is the right balance.  I will be approaching this and the other legislation, such as that on whistleblowers, as a means to build consensus across the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000006#E00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1357830000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Can I ask a quick follow-up question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000006#E00300","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1357830000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy Donnelly again later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000006#E00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1357830000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I also meant to mention NAMA.

Should it be calculated over a period of time?  If a sports club receives a substantial capital grant, I am not minded that it could be suddenly subject to freedom of information legislation.

As I have said, this is simply couching.  It is one thing to speak in a theoretical way, but it is another thing to actually provide for a practical regime that does not over-burden systems, such as the local government system, that are already under pressure.  If one wanted to make a point about some aspect of the local government system - I am not suggesting one would do so maliciously - one could submit never-ending freedom of information requests, which would impose a significant administrative burden on the system.  That is just a practical consideration.  I would be interested to hear the committee's views, on a cross-party and collective basis, on whether the principle of a no-fee regime would be a superior requirement.  We have looked at this carefully.  At the beginning, our general disposition was to have a no-fee regime.  As I have said, my own discernment as of now is that a fee of 4% of the actual cost of the work that needs to be done is a tokenistic one.  It is like the argument in favour of a prescription charge, which started in Britain before migrating here.  People will beat me up for introducing that matter into the debate.  The argument was that any charge at all focuses people's attention on the fact that a real cost is associated with the service - it is not all free.  I am willing to hear the committee's view on the matter.  I think the balance I have suggested is reasonable.  It involves a modest initial fee of 4% of the average actual cost in 2011, with a significant reduction in the cost of appeals.  The fact that an appeal can cost &euro;150 makes it prohibitive for people to go further.  I do not think that is fair.  That is why I am proposing a substantial reduction in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000007#F00100","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1357830600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I was pleased to hear him say he intends to change how business is done because that is very necessary.  According to the comments that were circulated on behalf of the Minister, \"the diplomatic efforts underway in relation to banking debt highlight the need for a careful and delicate balance\".  Surely banking is one of the areas that should be more exposed, in light of the difficulties it has caused for this country.  If the Minister has an exemption in mind for banking, he should bear in mind the problems that were caused by a club of people comprising the commercial banks, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  Information should have been available long before the rubbish was dumped into the Government's lap on 28 September 2008.<\/p><p>  In the part of the Minister's speech dealing with section 46, it is made clear that his proposals will \"retain the exemption for records provided to Ministers for the conduct of parliamentary business\".

In that book, the authors argue that the provision of deliberately misleading answers by the Department of Agriculture, in response to questions asked by Deputy Des O'Malley, led to the beef tribunal.  It seems to me that one would not wish such a custom to continue.

The book by Dr. Maurice Manning and Dr. Muiris MacCarthaigh mentioned that an inquiry into railway signalling, the cost of which had increased from &euro;16 million to &euro;64 million, was one of the victims of the Abbeylara judgment.  It is now frozen.  I appreciate that the Minister has always tried to counteract that judgment.  I understand that a sizeable percentage of the cost of joining the two Luas lines would be spent on new signalling between Lansdowne Road and Howth Junction.  CIE can say that is a commercial decision, but I think the Oireachtas must know what is going on.  We seem to have a particular problem with signalling.  I think the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Kelly, wanted to answer the questions we were asking him.  Although these bodies are commercial, they know very well where to find the Minister, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, when they are looking for money.  In that regard, they are somewhat like the other non-governmental organisations that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform wants to include in the freedom of information regime.  If I were him, I would tell them that if they want a lot of money for signalling, they will have to be able to tell the Parliament whether the signals in question are gold-plated or normal.

However, we also need to move beyond the culture where people need to submit freedom of information requests to obtain information.  While the Department is doing significant work in this regard in terms of the information it makes available on its website, this approach is not replicated across the public sector.  This issue must be addressed.<\/p><p>  The Minister is correct that when people have to submit freedom of information requests to extract information from government, it has implications.  Unfortunately, however, this is the case for many people.  To cite one example, members of my local authority and the public are not privy to the contents of the contract for a pay parking scheme in my home town.  We are consistently informed that this is a commercially sensitive matter.  While I am sure that it the case in respect of certain aspects of the contract, it is unacceptable that democratically local representatives and citizens are not granted access to such contracts.  Local authorities, in particular, tend to use a broad brush of commercial sensitivity.  Similarly, citizens and public representatives have not been allowed to view the contract for a public private partnership to develop a harbour.  The Minister needs to examine how local authorities behave in this regard. <\/p><p>  To pick up on and extend a point made by Deputy McDonald on retrieval costs, I am very sceptical that the level of the retrieval costs for freedom of information requests indicated are the actual costs.  I am also sceptical about the costs associated with parliamentary questions.  Certain set costs apply to administration and should not be added when providing information.  This issue needs to be examined.<\/p><p>  Another issue to be examined is the manner in which records are maintained in the public sector.  Some of the retrieval costs and difficulty in retrieving information is due to the failure to keep good records, particularly in local authorities.  In other words, the agencies involved must try to dig out the information requested.  It would make a significant difference if they maintained the information in a more transparent and accountable manner. <\/p><p>  I echo Senator Sean Barrett's point in that it does not sit comfortably that commercial semi-State companies are automatically excluded from freedom of information legislation.  On the one hand, bus companies and so forth are seeking bailouts involving significant sums of public money while, on the other, they are stonewalling in the matter of answering questions.  The Freedom of Information Act is a tool for obtaining information in cases where semi-State companies refuse to answer questions at parliamentary committees.  This issue should be noted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000008#G00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1357831200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I agree entirely with Deputy Harris that extracting information is viewed as scoring a great victory, even where the information is often readily available, and freedom of information legislation is often viewed as a means of prising open an organisation to obtain information.  This should not be necessary as information should be routinely available except where there is a compelling reason not to make it available.  Once this principle has been established, recourse to freedom of information legislation will probably diminish.<\/p><p>  I accept the point the Deputy made regarding his experience of local authorities and it is one we will examine.  I have responded on the issue of commercial semi-State companies.  One cannot have a company placed in a commercially much weaker operating position that a competitor in the private sphere on the basis that it is largely or partially State owned.  We cannot give private competitors all sorts of access that one would not otherwise give.  If the Deputy has any ideas or would like to craft amendments that could meet his requirements in this regard, I will examine them. <\/p><p>  One proposal in my Budget Statement which did not receive much attention was that Ireland join the Open Government Partnership, which was launched by President Obama at the margins of the United Nations General Assembly.

That is a positive development.<\/p><p>  We must, however, take open, transparent and accountable government as far as we possibly can.  We have an appalling history of secrecy and cover-up which has had devastating effects on our society.  That culture must be completely demolished.  It is, unfortunately, still present in many areas.  Our overriding objective must be to open up government and remove any impediment to the ordinary citizen getting information about how the money he or she pays in taxes is used to administer the State, its agencies and any institution it funds.  <\/p><p>  In terms of that broad objective I ask the following questions.  First, I do not see any justification for fees.  I do not see any justification for exemptions.  One might say this is a very radical position.  There may be exceptions but they should be framed in the legislation precisely as exceptions.  I ask the Minister to respond to the following point.  The rule should be free and open access to all information for all public bodies, semi-State bodies and all bodies that receive substantial funding.  If any of those bodies wants to make a case for information to be withheld in particular instances it should have to make that case.  The case can then be subject to appeal.  We start with giving information.  That should be the rule.  If a body wants to say information is, for example, particularly commercially sensitive and its publication would be particularly damaging to the interest of a semi-State body it should have to say that and make that case.  <\/p><p>  Currently, commercial sensitivity is a catch-all term used to block citizens from getting information about things they have a right to know about.  I am at my wits' end trying to get information about D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.  I cannot accept that the inability to get information about that entity can be justified on the basis of so-called commercial sensitivity.  There are huge questions about how public contracts are given out.  Often, one cannot get this information because of commercial sensitivity.  The secrecy of public private partnerships is an outrage.  Significant amounts of money are being put into projects and because we are in a partnership with some private entity all information is blocked out because it is commercially sensitive.  That has to stop.  The public body in question, or the private body with which it is working in conjunction, should have to explain to us why they are not giving the information, or be legally enforced to give it. <\/p><p>  Deputy McDonald has already referred to the issue of vexatious requests.  We could work on a formula whereby a particular body could make the case that some requests, which will be a tiny minority, are vexatious.  That could be subject to a review process.  If we include exemptions or fees in the legislation they will become a more general blocker that can be used to inhibit ordinary citizens who have legitimate questions from making reasonable requests.<\/p><p>  On the question of what is substantial and significant State funding, percentages and so on, I am particularly concerned about the issue of the banks.  Percentages will not work there because we put a lot of money up-front into the banks.  I want the legislation to put us in a position where we can question the Bank of Ireland, which got billions, or any of the banks that got large amounts of public money in detail about what is going on, what their decision making processes are and so on.  We need to think about that.<\/p><p>  We need to open the area of the asylum process, direct provision and deportations.  It is a human rights issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000009#H00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1357831800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with the principle Deputy Boyd Barrett set out.  It mirrors what I said in my opening statement.  We then come to what is practical.  We can be aspirational when we are not actually crafting a law that has impact.  We have to be practical.  We also have to look at what works elsewhere.  We are not so unique that we do not look at Sweden, Canada or New Zealand to see how they operate practically.  They, practically, have exemptions.  There are matters that the greater public interest requires not to be disclosed.  They should be rare but they must be there.  That is why we have exemptions at all.  We have, however, minimised those.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that in all the legislation I have brought through, such as the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill which hugely expanded the powers and scope of the Ombudsman after 40 years, the focus was always on what I was not doing.  The proposed Bill will undo a harm that was done in 2003.  It will go further than that because it will take on board many of the recommendations of the Information Commissioner.  I brought the Bill early to the committee so that I could hear practical views of what we can do.  <\/p><p>  Fees were brought in because the search and retrieval regime put a notional cost on the burden of providing the information.  Deputy Fleming is right.  That has got out of kilter now.  To abolish fees and impose a reasonable search administrative cost would be dangerous because the cost of that would be prohibitive.  We have to be careful what we ask for.  My general view is that there should be a modest entrance fee to submit a freedom of information request, the search and retrieval fee should not ratchet up if the search is complicated but there should be a cap on it.  That is something I am willing to look at.  <\/p><p>  I have dealt with the issue of exemptions.  In any international regime, in countries that do transparency rather well, or in advices from Transparency International or others there are always exemptions.  There are matters of State security and so on which require one, within reason and balance, to have an exemption.  One then has an independent authority outside of Government to make the balanced choice between the public's right to know and the potential to do harm to the State or to the Irish people.  The Information Commissioner is the person who does that balancing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000009#H00300","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357832400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to enforcement and criminal charges.

Honourable members, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to be here today.  I thank members for the invitation to debate tax issues with them.<\/p><p>  I wish to extend my best wishes in respect of the Irish Presidency of the EU.  Like many of our European partners, I am of the view that this Presidency will provide a great opportunity to foster our European agenda and advance important issues for the EU.  I also wish to congratulate Ireland on the important anniversary it celebrates this year, namely, its 40 years as an EU member state.  Ireland has undergone a radical transformation since 1973, developing a modern, open economy that is driven by high-tech industry and global exports.  It has been an example to many of the benefits that can be derived from EU membership.  It might be easy to lose sight of this in the current difficult times.  Even in hard times, however, Ireland has shown that working with its EU partners and implementing the necessary reforms can pay off.  Although there is still a way to go, confidence is returning.  Irish exports are strong and the forecast of a growth rate of 1.1% for Ireland this year is higher than that for the overall euro area.<\/p><p>  Maintaining the stability of its currency and financial system, creating the conditions for sustainable growth and jobs and enabling younger generations to be more confident in the future are top priorities on the European agenda for 2013.  I was happy to discover during our discussions with the Irish Government this morning that these are shared priorities.  As members are aware, 2013 will be another challenging year.  The Commission's economic forecast shows that the EU remains in a fragile economic situation and unemployment is expected to remain very high.  Although the task is huge, the Commission is confident that Ireland has the will and capacity to lead the European family towards good progress and results during the first half of the year.  In that context, I wish to say a few words on how tax policy can contribute to the EU's consolidation and growth agenda and on how Ireland can both benefit from and contribute to stronger tax co-ordination in the EU.<\/p><p>  In recent years fiscal policies have primarily been driven by the need to bring public finances back to sustainable paths.  Consolidation on the scale currently required cannot be achieved through spending cuts alone.  As a result, many national reforms have resulted in tax increases.  The primary role of taxation is undoubtedly to raise revenues.  However, through the European semester the Commission has urged member states not to lose sight of the impact that tax policies also have on wider economic and social objectives.  We have recommended that member states shape their tax reforms in the most growth-friendly manner possible - that is, away from labour and towards consumption, environmental or property taxes, which are known to be less harmful to growth - broaden their tax bases instead of increasing tax rates, thereby ensuring simplicity and neutrality of tax systems; reduce corporate tax bias towards debt-financing and tax schemes which increase the debt bias of households in order to avoid financial risks; and take<\/p><p> steps to improve the fight against fraud and evasion as a fair and efficient way to raise expected revenues.<\/p><p>  For Ireland, the European Council's only recommendation in 2012 was to implement the measures laid down in the joint EU-IMF programme.  The winter 2012 review of the economic adjustment programme clearly states that Ireland continues to make good progress, having met all of the quarterly fiscal targets so far under the programme.  I am aware that - as has been the case with many other member states - the budget presented by the Government in December includes some significant tax measures designed to allow Ireland to meet the agreed budgetary objectives.  Elements such as broadening the personal income tax base, reducing general tax expenditures, introducing a property tax and increasing excise duty are well in line with what the Commission recommends for quality tax reforms.<\/p><p>  The approach we have taken with the European semester clearly leaves the main responsibility for tax reforms with member states.  As long as they comply with EU law, they retain full sovereignty to adapt their tax systems and set their tax rates according to their own national needs.  I assure members that there is no European threat to the tax sovereignty of any member state.  However, with our extremely interconnected economies, working in isolation does not pay off.  It undermines national reform efforts, creates tensions and loopholes between member states' systems and weakens the Single Market.  I, therefore, strongly believe that progress on tax co-ordination at EU level is in the best interests of every member state.  In that context, I wish to comment on how the Irish Presidency can be of assistance in ensuring progress on major tax matters on the European agenda.<\/p><p>  Our European social model involves combining economic dynamism with social fairness.  Taxation plays an important part in this model.  Fairness lies in all member states being able to collect the taxes they are due and all taxpayers paying their legitimate share.  Tax evasion and avoidance are clearly an attack on this principle.  Not only do evasion and avoidance deprive member states of up to &euro;1 trillion each year, they also mean that honest taxpayers shoulder a heavier burden in order to compensate for the evaders.  With this in mind, in December I presented an ambitious action plan to combat tax evasion.  This was accompanied by two recommendations to member states on how to treat tax havens and how to deal with aggressive tax planning.  This package sends a strong signal to the world that the EU is serious about the fight against tax evasion.  We can also highlight the need to work more closely together at international fora, notably the OECD, in order to combat this serious problem.  I count on the Irish Presidency to ensure that these proposals will be endorsed by the Finance Ministers and that the issue will be properly debated in the context of the G8 and the G20.  I also call on the Presidency to ensure rapid progress on the improvement of the saving tax directive, which is still facing opposition from two member states on the Council.<\/p><p>  Fairness is also about each sector of the economy making an equitable contribution to public revenue.  In this context, the financial transactions tax, FTT, is the epitome of fair taxation.  Ireland, as much as any member state, has felt the effects of the financial sector's role in the current crisis.  However, this sector carries a disproportionately lower tax burden than others.  The FTT can redress the balance and ensure that the financial sector makes a fair contribution to public finances.  Unanimity on the FTT could not be reached at EU level.  Therefore, 11 member states have decided to move ahead together with a harmonised FTT.  Although Ireland is not one of the 11 member states which signed up to the FTT, I am confident that it will facilitate progress during its Presidency.  The European Council and our citizens have high expectations for quick results.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with competitiveness.  Improving the tax environment for businesses is central to EU competitiveness.<\/p> <p>Investors need stability, legal certainty, a lower administrative burden and lower compliance costs.  Eliminating unnecessary complexities and mismatches, which create tax obstacles for businesses in the Single Market, must be our focus.  Already, we have made some progress.  For example, cutting red tape and improving business cash flow is at the centre of our ongoing VAT reform.  Certain important measures have already been delivered, such as new rules on electronic invoicing and cash accounting for small businesses.  Other substantial improvements are in the pipeline and I am happy Ireland has made VAT one of its tax priorities for the Presidency.  I would also like to see progress on the revision of the energy tax directive, which, if adopted, would avoid double taxation for businesses subject to the emissions trading system and encourage development of the green economy.<\/p><p> The common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, is a crucial proposal for creating a business-friendly Single Market.  Its fundamental objective is to make it cheaper and easier to do cross-border business in the European Union, be it by an SME seeking to expand or a multinational investor.  The CCCTB has nothing to do with tax rates and Ireland has nothing to fear in this regard.  Member states must remain free to set rates, and this flexibility allows a healthy degree of tax competition to be maintained.  Bearing this in mind, I hope the Irish Presidency will help in pushing forward the CCCTB as a tool for greater EU competitiveness.<\/p><p> The European Union is currently working towards deepening the euro and forging a genuine economic and monetary union.  Taxation cannot be avoided in this debate.  Member states can, and must, retain their sovereignty on tax matters.  This is essential for them to meet their specific national needs, but there must be recognition that the day of isolated tax policy is over.  Coming closer together as a union on tax matters does not threaten member states' sovereignty; on the contrary, it reinforces their position at home to take the necessary measures for efficient growth-friendly and fair taxation.  It helps our business and attracts investment by improving the Single Market and it strengthens our common position when addressing international challenges and spreading the principle of fair taxation abroad.  I strongly believe, therefore, that for taxation, as for other policy areas, the answer to our current challenges lies in more Europe, not less.  Let us move in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011000013#M00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Algirdas &Scaron;emeta","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357834200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

It is not only a question of a communication but also of two very concrete recommendations on how to address issues.  One is on tax havens.  For the first time in the history of the Union, we have provided a definition of \"tax haven\", and we also proposed a blacklisting of tax havens.  Blacklisting has consequences for the countries concerned.  The second recommendation concerns aggressive tax planning.  We proposed a general anti-abuse rule and also a renegotiation of double tax agreements between member states and third countries to reinforce the anti-abuse provisions in those agreements.  We also proposed the governance structure for this, the so-called good tax governance platform.  We intend not only to recommend but also to monitor the implementation of the recommendations.<\/p><p>  Taken together, the two recommendations will, if implemented in member states, allow us to address issues discussed in the House of Commons.  In the coming weeks, I will visit the United Kingdom to discuss this issue bilaterally.  It is very important that EU member states co-ordinate efforts in respect of the OECD, which is currently preparing a proposal for a G20 meeting to take place in February in Russia.  The work is ongoing.  Addressing this issue is a strong priority for the Commission and me personally.  We will push forward in that regard.<\/p><p>  With regard to carbon taxes, we proposed an energy taxation directive which introduces the carbon dioxide element in the energy taxation system.  The issue of border tax has been analysed.  Our conclusion is that, at present at least, it would be too complex and burdensome for businesses if one tried to introduce a border-related measure.

The Irish authorities have made good proposals on how to improve the technical side of the proposal.  I hope during the Irish EU Presidency there will be a political debate at the ECOFIN Council about CCCTB.  It has already between discussed fully by technical experts but now it is time to discuss it politically.  I consider CCCTB as a pro-business tool.  It will create a new tax system which will significantly reduce the administrative burden on businesses.  At the same time, it could be a tool to deal with tax fraud and evasion by large multinationals.  This issue can also be discussed at the ECOFIN Council.<\/p><p>  Regarding tax evasion and EU tax havens, we have all the necessary instruments to identify harmful tax practices.  The Deputy referred to the code of conduct on business taxation.  This code is designed with the objective of eliminating and preventing harmful tax practices.  If any member state believes another member state is engaged in harmful tax competition, it can apply to the code of conduct group and present its case which will have to be analysed and concluded on whether the practice is harmful or fair.  We have everything in place in Europe in this regard.  Member states do not use the full possibilities of the provisions of the code.  With our communications we hope to create a new momentum in a more active use of the code.<\/p><p>  In the communication of 6 December 2012, we proposed to expand the scope of activities of the code of conduct group to include the issue of wealthy individuals and tax exile.  If the Council agrees to adopt the expansion of the code, this issue will be analysed specifically by the code of conduct group.  We have to be careful because the powers of the EU in personal taxation are very limited.  It has almost no powers in this area.  It means we should use the code of conduct as a tool to address this problem.<\/p><p>  Regarding safeguards for Ireland with the FTT, when we received the request from 11 member states to launch enhanced co-operation, we had to make an assessment of its impact on various matters such as non-participating member states.  Our report is publicly available and concludes enhanced co-operation will not have a negative impact on non-participating member states.  Enhanced co-operation is, by the way, an open procedure so Ireland can join at any time.  Some other member states, including my own country Lithuania and the Netherlands are examining joining it.

I find unusual his remark that enhanced co-operation does not limit sovereignty.  Whereas there have been some positive experiences with the European Union, the one very negative contribution that would be shared, not totally across the board but by a large swathe of political opinion, is that the greater levels of co-operation and integrated have limited extremely the sovereignty available to the State.  We, as parliamentarians, are aware of that because we are in the Chamber every day dealing with matters forwarded by Brussels, some of which are not so good.  There has been considerable restriction in the amount of our manoeuvrability.  The Commissioner spoke about it in the context of economics.  He who pays the piper always calls the tune.

We must look at the specific situations of member states in terms of their tax systems.  Property tax would be treated as part of the wealth taxes.  Our analysis shows that the property tax is probably the most growth-friendly tax among all other taxes.  As I stated, however, we cannot use the approach that one size fits all.

A property tax is one of them and could work in a growth-friendly way.

Taxation cannot solve all the problems.  If there are social problems, a system of social benefits and direct supports could be used in specific areas.  Unfortunately, sometimes, we use taxes as a social tool when in many cases, it is better to use them as a revenue raiser but then provide direct social supports to those who are vulnerable.<\/p><p>  In assessing Ireland's performance, the troika is very clear that Ireland is doing a great job.

As for Dr. Monaghan, the clerk intends to make contact with him this morning with a view to discussing his e-mail.  Moreover, if members are agreeable, we will discuss it as a committee in our regular meeting next Thursday.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  I welcome everyone to this public session of the joint committee.  As always, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting of proceedings.  You are all welcome to this eighth session in a series of hearings conducted over a three-day period by the joint committee to discuss the implementation of the Government decision following the recent publication of the expert group report into matters relating to the cases of A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland.  On the first day of our hearings, we discussed medical issues and yesterday we heard legal argument and legal opinion.  The information we have received has been beneficial in our deliberations.  I will take this opportunity to thank all the witnesses to date for their thoughtful and considerate submissions.  I also thank members of the joint committee and Members of the Oireachtas for their sensitive handling of the matter with which we have engaged over the past three days.  Such measured engagement has been highly positive and has ensured that our discussion has been constructive and informative.  As we commence the final day of hearings, I ask that we all continue to engage in a manner that is respectful, tolerant and understanding, as was the case over the first two days and for which I thank everyone.<\/p><p>  At the commencement of today's final sessions of the joint committee's three-day hearings, I will set out again the background and intended role these hearings are playing in this important discourse.  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the implementation of the Government decision following the recent publication of the expert group report into matters relating to A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland by way of legislation and regulation within the parameters of our current constitutional provisions.  The Government has stated that its aim is to ensure clarity and legal certainty in the process for determination of whether a termination of pregnancy is permissible in cases where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a woman as a result of a pregnancy.  In doing so we must ensure that we take full account of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  Members have elicited much information from medical and legal experts over the past two days and today, we have an opportunity to build on this detail and to hear of other issues which should be considered when preparing the heads of the Bill on foot of the Government decision.  In today's first session, we will hear from representatives of the religious groups and churches, as well an atheist organisation.  This will be followed by two sessions in which we will hear from advocacy groups.  I welcome our representatives this morning and if I may, I will single out Fr. Timothy Bartlett, who was a former classmate of mine in Maynooth.<\/p><p>  Before we commence, I remind witnesses of the position regarding privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  I now invite Bishop Christopher Jones from the diocese of Elphin to make his opening remarks.

I am here on behalf of the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference and am joined by Fr. Timothy Bartlett from the conference secretariat who, as an adviser on this matter, will be happy to answer questions.  We welcome this opportunity to engage with members of the joint committee.  We also welcome the calm and dignified manner in which the discussions have been conducted by the joint committee in recent days.  With you and with others, we want to develop a society that is truly worthy of the dignity of every person, a society in which all are equally cherished and respected.  As public representatives, you carry a heavy responsibility.  In making this presentation to you this morning, I am thinking in particular of the many women in our parishes across the country who are deeply concerned about the decision to legislate for abortion.  We hope you will take account of these concerns in your decisions over the coming weeks and months.  We share your concern to ensure that any young girl or woman who finds herself in crisis pregnancy receives all the love, care and support she needs to cope with that situation in a life-giving way.  Cura, the crisis pregnancy agency of the Catholic Church in Ireland, is dedicated to providing compassionate and expert support to any woman who finds herself in this situation.  Compassion, understanding and respect should be central to any discussion about responding to a situation of crisis or difficult pregnancy.<\/p><p>  As a church, we also want to see mothers and their unborn children receive all the medical care and life-saving treatment they need during pregnancy.  There is nothing in current Irish law, in current medical guidelines or in Catholic ethics that prevents such treatment from being given.  The doctors, nurses and midwives in our hospitals show an extraordinary concern for the life and well-being of mothers and their unborn children during pregnancies.  These medical professionals deserve our deepest appreciation and respect.  In Ireland, we have one of the lowest rates of maternal mortality in the world during pregnancy.  This is something of which we should be proud of as a nation.  It is something we should do all in our power to cherish and protect.  Any suggestion that Ireland is an unsafe place for pregnant mothers because we do not have abortion is a complete distortion of the truth.  It also is gravely unjust to the doctors, nurses and midwives in our hospitals who have achieved such internationally celebrated standards of maternity care.  We believe these high standards of maternity care have been influenced in no small part by the recognition in Article 40.3.3&deg; of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann that a mother and her unborn child have an equal right to life.  This coincides with our belief as a church, based on human reason and affirmed by sacred scripture, that the life of a mother and her unborn baby are both sacred.<\/p><p>  The Catholic Church has never taught that the life of the child in the womb should be preferred to that of the mother or the life of the mother to that of the child.  Moreover, there clearly is considerable confusion about the terminology being used in the discussion about medical intervention to save the life of a mother.  The Catholic Church recognises a vital moral distinction between medical intervention to save the life of the mother and abortion.  Abortion, understood as the direct and intentional killing of an unborn child in the womb, is never morally permissible.  This is because directly and intentionally taking the life of any innocent person is never morally acceptable.  This is different from medical treatment to save the life of the mother where there is no other option or where the intervention does not directly and intentionally seek to end the life of the unborn baby.  Every effort is made in this situation to preserve the life of both mother and baby throughout.  This position, which is ethically sound, represents best practice in Irish hospitals today.<\/p><p>  However, legislating for the X case removes the obligation to make every effort at all times to preserve the life of both mother and unborn baby.  It allows for abortion, for the direct and intentional killing of the baby in the womb.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Reverend Christopher Jones","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357810200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Jones.

This presentation reflects our personal views, but it is also based on positions the Church of Ireland has taken in response to previous Oireachtas and Government requests for a Church of Ireland input in this difficult and sensitive area.<\/p><p>  The position of the Church of Ireland on abortion is summarised in an addendum to the paper we submitted to the joint committee earlier this week.  We recognise, however, that the judgment in the A, B, C <i>v.<\/i> Ireland case and the decision of the Government to progress the matter through a combination of legislation and regulations has moved the issue on.  Thus, we will confine most of our presentation to the issues raised by the expert group report.   Suffice it to say the Church of Ireland opposes abortion but recognises that there are exceptional cases of strict and undeniable medical necessity where it is and should be an option.  There are a wide variety of sincerely held and conscientiously undertaken views within the Church of Ireland as to what constitute such exceptional cases.  However, there would be agreement that they include cases where the continuation of the pregnancy poses a risk to the life of the mother.<\/p><p>  In the X case of 1992 the Supreme Court held that an abortion was constitutionally permissible under Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup> in circumstances where the continuation of the pregnancy constituted a &quot;real and substantial risk&quot; to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother and the risk can only be averted by the termination of a pregnancy.  The circumstances of the case made clear that this included a credible risk of suicide.  The Church of Ireland welcomed the judgment at the time as the wording &quot;real and substantial risk to the life of the mother&quot; was very similar to the &quot;strict and undeniable medical necessity&quot; criterion the church has generally held to be appropriate.  However, the legal situation has not been clarified and statutory provisions, particularly sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, remain in effect and provide for severe criminal sanctions both for women and those who assist abortion.<\/p><p>  In the context of the Church of Ireland's previous comments on the issue, we agree that the position in the State is very unclear and that this is unsatisfactory and unfair to pregnant women and medical professionals who deserve to be able to make critical, clinical decisions in a secure and well regulated legal and medical framework.  We, therefore, strongly welcome the decision by the Government to seek to provide clarity on the issue.<\/p><p>  Introducing the principles behind its paper, the expert group said the following:<blockquote>There is an existing constitutional right, as identified and explained in the X case judgment of the Supreme Court.  The State is entitled and, indeed, obliged to regulate and monitor the exercise of that right so as to ensure that the general constitutional prohibition on abortion is maintained.  However, the measures that are introduced to give effect to this constitutional right should not act as obstacles to any woman who is legitimately entitled to seek a termination on lawful grounds.<\/blockquote>We agree with this general approach.  The expert group went on to highlight the sensitive issue of what should happen in the event that a foetus was viable, or potentially viable, but the continuation of the pregnancy posed a &quot;real and substantial risk&quot; to the life of the mother.  This highlights the need for an effective decision-making procedure.<\/p><p>  Chapter 6 of the expert group report outlines the tests to be applied in the light of the Supreme Court decision in the X case.  This should include the question of whether it is practicable to preserve the life of the unborn in the process of terminating the pregnancy without compromising the right to life of the woman.  The Church of Ireland submission in 1998 to the interdepartmental working group on abortion made clear the church's position on the right to life of the unborn.  We, therefore, agree with the approach outlined and the requirement that the diagnosis needs to be made expeditiously and should be formally notified to the woman.  Such a device needs the protection of legislation as Medical Council guidelines on their own will not necessarily have this effect.<\/p><p>  The expert group also raised the issue of whether there should be special provision for the rare occasions where the risk to a woman's life was real, substantial and imminent.  Our view is that there should be special provision for such circumstances in the light of the provisions of the 1861 Act which make the termination of pregnancy subject to severe criminal sanction.  We do not consider it is appropriate for a medical professional faced with an emergency, where a woman's life is in danger, to be constrained in giving necessary treatment in good faith by the risk of criminal conviction.<\/p><p>  Turning to chapter 7 and the options for implementation, as a group, we welcome the Government's decision to seek to implement by means of legislation and regulations, which is in keeping with the statement made by the church in 1998.  This approach allows for easier alteration as developments in medical science change in the context of decision making.<\/p><p>  I want to quote from a significant women's group within the Church of Ireland because I am conscious that we have two men representing the total church.  This is from the Mother's Union and my final comment: <blockquote>For the moment we must continue to keep the lines of communication open, listen - really listen - as well as talk, inform as well as undertake to be informed as we can be from as many different sources and viewpoints as possible, trust in our medical and trained professionals, and try and pick our way through the maze, whilst at the same time recognising that one size does not necessarily fit all, and that any decisions and way forward may have to be regularly reviewed as our world continues to grow and evolve around us. <\/blockquote>Thank you very much, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Most Reverend Dr. Michael Jackson"},{"type":"speech","time":1357810200,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Jackson.

Our contribution wants to address the law and the ethical considerations on any further decisions on abortion.  Abortion has been practised for thousands of years but the three great faiths - Christianity, Islam and the Jewish faith - have always upheld the principle of the sanctity of human life.  This has been the very bedrock of our civilisation.  It is reflected in our Constitution and law, specifically in the Offences against the Person Act 1861.<\/p><p>  We believe there are three general ethical principles which ought to influence any government action.  The first responsibility of government is the protection of human life, care for the weak and vulnerable.  That includes the unborn child.  Second, we believe it is not necessary to engage in metaphysical or theological debate on the status of the embryo and personhood.  The embryo should be treated as a person.  Third, in a healthy society, the strong make sacrifices for the weak.  So, we are of a very strong opinion that, in demonstrating compassion and support for women, the State, the churches and society have clear responsibilities in this area.<\/p><p>  Those basic ethical principles lead us as a church to commending to the committee a strong pro-life position.  We are opposed to any question or suggestion of abortion on demand.  Accordingly, we have resisted any extension of English legislation into Northern Ireland.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the expert report and the exceptional circumstances of a threat to the life a mother, we believe there are a number of ethical factors at play.

The Koran states clearly: &quot;<i>Wala Taqtulunnafsa Al-Lati Haram Allah<\/i>&quot;, &quot;Take not life which Allah has made sacred.&quot;  This meaning is reiterated in another place in a way that should deter people even from thinking of killing as, on unlawful killing, Allah stated: &quot;<i>Man Qatal Nafsan Bighairi Nafsin Fakaannama Qatalannasa Jamian<\/i>&quot;, &quot;whosoever killeth human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind.&quot;  The justice comes afterwards&quot;.  &quot;<i>Wa man Ahiaha Fakaannama Ahiannasa Jamiyan<\/i>&quot;, &quot;whoso saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind.&quot;<\/p><p>  The Koran warns people against considering abortion if they are not sure they can provide for a child.  It states:<blockquote>Say: &quot;Come, I will rehearse what Allah hath (really) prohibited you from&quot;: Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;- We provide sustenance for you and for them;- come not nigh to shameful deeds.  Whether open or secret; take not life, which Allah hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom.&quot;<\/blockquote>Although maternal health care should strive to obtain the best possible outcome for both mother and baby, in the unlikely event that a group of competent and trustworthy physicians confirms that the continuation of pregnancy jeopardises the mother's life, then abortion could be conducted as the last and only option to protect the mother's life.  This permission is based on the principle of the lesser of the two evils.  In this case, one is confronted with two forbidden things: either abort the unborn child or let a living woman die.  Obviously, the latter is of greater importance than the former; therefore, abortion is allowed to save the mother.  Abortion is regarded as a lesser evil in this case because the mother is the originator of the baby; the mother's life is well-established; the mother has family duties and responsibilities; the mother is part of an essential part of the family; and allowing the mother to die would also kill the baby in most cases.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, if the mother threatens to commit suicide, such a claim cannot be deemed as a ground for abortion.  The experience of pregnancy and delivery is hard and could lead to depression.  The Koran recognises this fact and promises greater reward for mothers in return.  As Allah says:<blockquote>We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: In pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth.  The carrying of the [child] to his weaning is [a period of] thirty months.  At length, when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years, he says, &quot;O my Lord! Grant me that I may be grateful for Thy favour which Thou has bestowed upon me, and upon both my parents, and that I may work righteousness such as Thou mayest approve; and be gracious to me in my issue.  Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I bow [to Thee] in Islam.<\/blockquote>The Government should think of social and economic means to reduce suicide, but certainly not at the expense of others' lives.  Otherwise, it would be saving one human being by killing another.  Financial, psychological and physical assistance should be given to assist women who, while pregnant, find themselves in challenging situations.  Society should be there to assist women in difficult situations.<\/p><p>  Women who have been victims of rape deserve due sympathy and help, but a child conceived in this unfortunate situation still has the right to live.  Of course, the continuity of such a pregnancy places a heavy burden on the mother which may drive her, similarly to many other economic and social scenarios, to think of terminating the pregnancy, but killing the foetus is not the right solution.  In fact, it is a crime against this innocent human being.  It is terminating the innocent's life, while the real perpetrators enjoy their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ali Selim"},{"type":"speech","time":1357811400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I want to point out to the committee that the representative of the Irish Jewish community, Rabbi Zalman Lent, is on his way.

That should be the absolute minimum rock-bottom ethical standard that we should automatically assume from our health system.  A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland requires the Oireachtas to vindicate this right, but it does not require it to limit itself to only doing this.  The committee should not ignore the suffering of pregnant women whose health is at risk, who are victims of rape or incest, or whose foetuses have a fatal abnormality.  As well as its other work here, the committee should recommend removal of the 1983 constitutional amendment so that the Government can democratically decide, in the absence of such restraints, on public policies that are appropriate for the Ireland of 2012.<\/p><p>  As atheists, we ask the committee to respect our human right to freedom of conscience.  As atheists, we form our own individual ethical beliefs, including on issues such as abortion.  However, there is one belief which unites us, which is that we do not get our morality from gods and therefore our laws should not be based on what other people believe the creator of the universe is telling them to impose on us.  For example, Cardinal Brady has explicitly told the Members of the Oireachtas that, as legislators, they should remember that the right to life is conferred on us by the creator.  The committee members should think about the enormity of that claim and the lack of evidence to support it, and its irrelevance to the committee's deliberations and their duties as legislators - as opposed to in their personal lives - because, even if one believes that there must be a creator, as many of the members do, there is no pathway from that belief to the taking of any particular specific ethical position on these issues.  One cannot argue that the universe had a beginning and therefore it must have had a creator and therefore we cannot legislate for abortion.  There is no relationship of cause and effect between those ideas.  We do not get our morality from religion; we apply our own natural morality to religion.<\/p><p>  What we, as Atheist Ireland, are asking the committee to do in its deliberations is to ensure that whatever laws the Oireachtas passes are based on human rights and compassion and on the application of reason to empirical evidence.  We ask the Oireachtas to respect the idea that individual ethical decisions should be made on the basis of personal autonomy and individual conscience, with respect for the rights of others, and to respect the idea that individual ethical decisions on the issue of abortion and pregnancy should be made by pregnant women in consultation with their medical teams.<\/p><p>  We also ask the Oireachtas to consider specific human rights issues with regard to the matters the committee is discussing.  In Attorney General <i>v<\/i>. X and others, the court stated that the risk to life must be &quot;real and substantial&quot; but it need not be &quot;inevitable or immediate&quot;.  In A, B and C <i>v<\/i>.

We have made no proposal to overturn the constitutional protections for the unborn.  Our role is not to make a decision but to facilitate the flow of information.  Yesterday an eminent witness spoke about what he described as the discredited Supreme Court judgment and asserted that the process was flawed because no psychiatrist had been consulted.  However, on Tuesday we were addressed by five of the most eminent consultant psychiatrists in Ireland, including the only three perinatal psychiatrists in the country.  Although the law of the land by case law, as confirmed in the guidelines from the Medical Council, confirms the option for intervention in the event of the life of a woman being at risk due to suicidal intent, in the collective experience of these psychiatrists an intervention has never been undertaken in these circumstances.  Why does Reverend Jones believe the Government's intention to progress what many view as confirmatory legislation will change that situation?<\/p><p>  As Deputy Kelleher noted, the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference states in its submission: \"We believe the option of a further constitutional referendum on this issue should not be ruled out.\"  It was clear from Reverend Jones's oral contribution, however, that he would go further than ruling it out.

We were very much upset and surprised by the ruling of the Supreme Court in its judgment.  We feel it was unsound.  We feel also that there was no psychiatrist available - an expert in that field, especially one dealing with teenagers - to give advice on the whole issue of suicide and mental health.  For that reason, we feel any legislation that will be based on or introduced in light of that unsound judgment would not be sound.  Therefore, our first option would be to have the medical guidelines enhanced so that doctors and nurses have no fear whatever in providing every single possible treatment that is available for the help of the mother whose life is at risk.  We would welcome that.<\/p><p>  What we regret very much, if we go down the road of legislation, is that it is inevitably the road to abortion.  That will change our whole two-patient model.  The life of the mother and the life of the unborn child will be no longer equal because we will be giving the right to someone in certain situations to literally take the life of the unborn.  That we cannot do.  We believe totally in the equal right of mother and child.<\/p><p>  In response to one of the statements made, I might add that we do not depend on religious reasons or scripture reasons for that.  We believe that the mother and the unborn child have equal rights by virtue of their common humanity, which is accessible to human reason.  Of course, we believe the Gospel enhances the whole dignity of the human person and our understanding of human life, but we do not depend on that, and we would never want to impose our understanding from the Gospel on any other religious group or on any atheist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Reverend Christopher Jones"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357812600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his warm welcome.  It strikes me, as a I listen to the various contributions this morning, that we work together very closely as churches and as faith communities.  Rev. Dr. Michael Jackson and I have debated very honestly and openly in public fora about faith, the challenges to faith and so on.  The thread that has been running through all of our contributions and which I think unites everybody in this room, is our shared desire for a compassionate, caring, humane and just society.  It is always worth coming back to that.<\/p><p>  What is at issue is how that can be best achieved in legislation in this particularly complex and sensitive area in medical practice.  As Bishop Jones pointed out, we have to keep coming back to the fact that life-saving treatment for women in pregnancy is available at the moment, and the Catholic ethical position has no opposition to that.<\/p><p>  However, to come back to the specific questions and to supplement some of the responses Bishop Jones has given, on the issue of the two previous referenda to overturn the inclusion of suicide, the Oireachtas all-party committee of 2000 looked at the 1992 referendum in terms of a response to the X case, and it acknowledged that the 1992 referendum was incredibly confused and that people on both sides of the argument voted to defeat the referendum.  It was not a clear - to use the shorthand - pro-choice or pro-life result.  Similarly, as we all know because it is an easier one, in the defeat of the 2002 referendum the margin was extremely tight and there was evidence that large numbers of pro-life people voted to defeat it as well.<\/p><p>  Beyond all of that, I suggest there is a reason we hold our judges and courts, in particular the Supreme Court, in the highest esteem and we treat seriously and very gravely any judgment that they give.  However, we do not have judges and lawyers running the country, or, indeed, framing legislation.  That is the responsibility of the Members here, a responsibility that, as churches, we respect and seek to assist in terms of, as we have been invited to do, offering our views.  In that regard, however, the Members here are free, as legislators, to consider the wider issues.<\/p><p>  The Supreme Court looked only at the legal issue and evaluated the situation in terms of law.  As Bishop Jones pointed out in his opening presentation, there are psychiatric developments that need to be now taken into account and there are moral issues, in particular the inability to equate the possible but not certain and preventable death of someone in suicide, as opposed to the certain death of a child.  Our response to that is to ask, in the 21st century, what reflects a compassionate, humane and intelligent society.  Is it not that we provide the best possible care and support to help someone to make a life-affirming decision?<\/p><p>  Finally, for the record, in response to Deputy Conway, no one from the Catholic Church has ever said in any official role or responsibility, or in any statement, that we believe women will somehow try to mislead.  We have never said that.  The jeopardy arises from the experience in other jurisdictions which are trying to legislate in this area in that there is a real danger of sincerely unintended consequences, as well as the difficulty of simply trying to limit legislation in the context of the breadth of the X case judgment.  Any attempt to limit in principle could be challenged.  That is why I would suggest trying to address the legitimate concern to ensure that doctors, for example, can act freely in the ethical way we have described and that they currently do - with the protection of guidelines, by the way, and they are not in jeopardy if they follow the guidelines.

It is an incredibly difficult and painful decision to have to terminate a pregnancy, but in certain cases Jewish law may permit a termination to take place.

I have a number of rather focused questions and wish to direct them to Dr. Jones and Father Bartlett.  We do not have exact figures, but it appears approximately 30 terminations of pregnancy are conducted annually in Ireland for reasons of threat to the life of the mother.  It is likely none of these have been because of suicide, although we are not sure.  It is also the general consensus of the obstetricians who testified to us that under the current constitutional situation they are not aware of any case where a woman has been denied a life-saving termination because of an ethical or religious scruple on the part of the doctor.  Given the fact that medicine is getting a bit better - I know mothers are getting a little bit older - it is likely we are dealing with a phenomenon which under the legislation to be proposed under the current constitutional and judicial framework will apply to approximately 30 people per annum.<\/p><p>  In truth, most of the objection being raised comes from Roman Catholicism, through the organised church and sincere members of the laity who subscribe to its teachings, and it is that somehow this number will increase dramatically.  However, the witnesses have stated to us they do not believe there will be an abuse of the system by women spuriously claiming to be suicidal or by doctors spuriously diagnosing suicidality to impose social abortions.  What is the mechanism the witnesses believe will lead to this incredible increase in abortion?  I am troubled to know what it is.  I cannot work out hypothetically what it would be because I do not believe the Supreme Court, given what we already have in our Constitution and what will come onto the Statute Book, will interpret it differently.<\/p><p>  I would also like each of our esteemed guests in turn to tell me on behalf of their organisations, the Roman Catholic Church, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism, Methodism, Sunni Islam and Orthodox Judaism, whether a woman is allowed to rise to the top job in the organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000010#J00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1357814400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>That is outside of our remit.

It is impossible to address every question and answer it in detail in the time allowed, so I will do my best to touch on several threads running through them.  Someone mentioned that life is not always as straightforward as we would like it to be.  This is absolutely true and no one in this room does not know this, has not experienced it and has not had to deal with it.  As professionals involved in this area, the clergy and faith leaders of all traditions operate in this territory on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  Just as it would be wrong to caricature anybody else in this debate I appeal to people not to caricature those in churches, whatever their positions in those churches, as somehow unhuman and unfeeling and detached from their own families and the real circumstances of life including nieces, nephews, and sisters who may have to face these situations.  I ask people to accept this.<\/p><p>  What we say comes from the midst of this messy situation and is not detached from it in some abstract way.  When we confront a messy situation it is then in particular that moral values, laws for society and, in our case, our faith, are critical to guide us through the complexities.  In this regard I wish to come back to a question that was raised.  It was suggested that if there is a risk of even one woman taking her life in suicide that legislation must be introduced.  We need to respond to this with absolute compassion and the greatest professional care possible to protect the person from harming herself and, indeed, another.  However, if we believe in the equal right to life of the unborn, as stated in Article 40.3.3&deg;, we should be equally concerned about the direct and intentional killing of an individual human person.<\/p><p>  With respect, this brings me to the core of the concern of the Catholic Church in this matter and the concept of widening the possibilities.  It is a fundamental human right, not based on faith but based on our very shared humanity and common dignity inherent to us as human beings, that we have a right not to be harmed by another if we are an innocent person and to have our life and its integrity completely respected.  The cause of our reaction is the move away from the principle that it is absolutely wrong in any circumstance to directly and intentionally take the life of an innocent person, which is what the X case judgment opens up.  This is the dangerous territory opened up in terms of appeal and challenge to any legislation the Oireachtas tries to impose to restrict the terms of the X case judgment.  This is our concern.  Once this line is crossed morally as a guiding principle then it opens up, and with respect we see this everywhere not least in the State, the pressures and possibilities of other scenarios, such as end of life care.  This moral principle is precious, but sometimes moral principles and laws are challenging and difficult.  They hold us back from doing what we might think is most compassionate, best or most expedient.  This is the thread at the heart of our concern about the X case.  It crosses this line in principle.  When one starts to legislate one must legislate for this possibility.  This is at the heart of it.<\/p><p>  With regard to a doctor who might fear going to prison and the issue of guidelines, as we stated in our submission it is possible in Irish law to produce professional guidelines which are reviewable by the courts without getting into the necessity to legislate.  I want to say to my colleagues who speak about legislating to give doctors security that in principle there is nothing wrong with this, but once legislation is built on the X case judgment the scope of that judgment must be taken into account and the line will be crossed, because if it is not crossed the legislation will be open to challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Fr.

The 1959 UN Declaration on the Rights of the Child states: \" ... the child ... ,including appropriate legal protection, both before as well as after birth ... \".  By 1970, things began to change.  The Declaration of Oslo provides that therapeutic abortion may be performed in circumstances where the vital interests of the mother conflict with those of the unborn child.   The amended Declaration of Geneva 1983 states: \" ... I will maintain the utmost respect for human life ... \".  This means that by the year 2000, in the Royal College of Gynaecologists in Britain, abortion is seen just as a basic health care need.  In giving these quotations, I am providing a description of the change of climate and culture that is taking place.  The fear is that when legislation is passed it will contribute and add to this and create a context which will be detrimental to the sanctity of human life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Trevor Morrow"},{"type":"speech","time":1357815600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>The 60 minute time limit for questions from members of the joint committee has elapsed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000012#L00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1357815600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I asked for clarification on legislation under which regulation could be introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000012#L00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1357815600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>We will come back to that during the questions and answers session.

Is it accepted that legislators should be expected to validate the decisions of the medical profession when faced with situations whereby, as already pointed out, there may be a question as to whether the life of the unborn may be sacrificed in order to protect the life of the mother or is it anticipated that such situations might be determined in a further referendum given the experiences of the past?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000012#L01700","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1357816200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>My first question is for Bishop Jones and Fr.

These are all variations on a theme that reflects the <i>status quo<\/i>.  However, the <i>status quo<\/i> is underpinned by the Medical Council guidelines which state in respect of abortion: &quot;Abortion is illegal in Ireland except where there is a real and substantial risk to the life (as distinct from the health) of the mother.  Under current legal precedent, this exception includes where there is a clear and substantial risk to the life of the mother arising from a threat of suicide.  You should undertake a full assessment of any such risk in light of the clinical research on this issue.&quot;  Is the church effectively saying it is happy to have the current <i>carte blanche<\/i> arrangement as envisaged for treatment of the threat to the life of the mother, unfettered by any legislation or regulation that, for example, imposes an obligation on medical practitioners to consult or seek a second opinion or impose restrictions regarding the time limit within which a termination can take place?

Is that opposition not based on an underlying belief in the innate deceitfulness of women, and misogyny?  Second, they spoke this morning about compassion.

I will try to get a thread running through them.  Are we asking legislators to legislate for a Catholic morality in this country?  The simple answer is \"Absolutely not\".  As I said earlier, the principle of the right to life is a human rights principle.  That is the starting point of all of this discussion.  Somebody asked about the distinction we make between licit medical intervention and abortion.  Medical intervention to save the life of the mother is possible, as we clarified in the opening statement.  The member might not have been present at the time.  The Catholic Church has never taught that the life of the mother should be preferred over that of the child or that the life of the child should be preferred over that of the mother.  We have stated repeatedly this morning that medical intervention to save the life of the mother is morally licit, as long as every effort is made to continue to protect and save the life of the child even if in practical circumstances that may lead to the unintended death of the child.  Some people have suggested that this distinction between direct and indirect and intended and unintended is some type of Catholic moral principle.  Go to our courts.  Our law acknowledges that moral culpability or legal consequence is weighed up against intent and direct or indirect consequences.  This has nothing, in that sense, to do with specifically Catholic moral theology.<\/p><p>  With respect, this is the first stage of this debate in which I have been caricatured.  As I mentioned earlier, we should avoid that type of caricature.  It might surprise members to know that I know many women and there are many women whom I love dearly in my life, and if they had to face these circumstances I would feel deeply about it.  I ask members not to caricature us, just as I and Bishop Jones have not caricatured anybody else.

It is a great privilege and an honour to be allowed to contribute to the committee's discussions on this important matter.  Like many others, I have been listening closely on the Internet to the proceedings over the past few days and if anything has become absolutely clear, it is that the Government's argument that suicidality could be addressed by abortion, has been completely demolished.  The testimony that we have heard over the past two days has completely demolished any argument that suicidality can be addressed by abortion, even during crisis pregnancy.  Professor David Fergusson, in the <i>British Journal of Psychiatry<\/i>, states, &quot;There is no evidence ... that suggests that abortion reduces the mental health risks of unwanted or mistimed pregnancy.&quot;  That being the case, why are the legislators even contemplating passing legislation against the medical evidence?  The answer is because they believe they have to because of Attorney General <i>v<\/i>. X and others and they are being told that they must do so because of what the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland decision of the European court has required.  I will come back to that in a moment.<\/p><p>  What would be the impact of passing this legislation?  First, psychiatrists would be asked to propose a procedure for which there is no psychiatric justification, obstetricians would be asked to terminate the lives of healthy babies in physically-healthy women and legislators would have violated the most basic human right for a reason which cannot be justified.  Society would perceive that the right to life of the unborn is not that important and we are not really serious about protecting it.  After all, it can be violated on an entirely irrational and unjustifiable basis.  After a time, this would become received wisdom and that would be the end of the culture of life and the beginning of the culture of abortion.  If one surrenders the principle of the right to life of the unborn, that sends a message to society which, in turn, produces a cultural change.  Then other cultural questions emerge.  What other rights will one overwhelm when their subjects are not very important?  Some people refer to this as the slippery slope argument.  Whatever one calls it, it is certain that ideas such as these have real consequences.<\/p><p>  Why do so many of the doctors who have addressed the committee want legislation?  The pro-choice advocates, some of whom frequent this Chamber, understand the possibilities for their agenda and have welcomed the proposed legislation as an important first step and a beginning.  However, most of the doctors who have come here want something quite different.  They want to know, in the words of the master of the National Maternity Hospital, &quot;that I will not go to jail&quot;, and that they are free to make appropriate clinical judgments for their patients.  The reasons for this fear are somewhat puzzling.  It is not sufficient to hinder the doctors in their practice of medicine as they all have stated that they have never refused an intervention or withheld any treatment because of any fear of the law.  The Irish Medical Council has not received any criticism or request for clarification of its guidelines from any doctor or representative body regarding the practice of obstetrics.  There have been no prosecutions of doctors.  I have no doubt that those fears are sincerely held by some doctors and that we must address this perception, but the real question is whether these fears well founded.  Obstetricians are not lawyers.  Perhaps they do not appreciate the mental element required to prove a crime.  A jury must be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that a doctor has acted deliberately intending to carry out an unlawful abortion.  The doctor who acts in good faith, ethically, with due care and in a manner in which another doctor of similar expertise might be expected to act in a similar circumstance, has nothing to fear from the law.  Doctors make judgments all the time.  They will not always be right, but that is not negligent and it is certainly not criminal.<\/p><p>  The European court decision in A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland recognised that Ireland may make whatever policy it chooses regarding abortion and the right to life.  It does not require us to legislate for Attorney General <i>v<\/i>. X and others.  It gives no direction regarding the content or form of action we take.  It requires that we have accessible procedures by which people can know the law and know where they stand.  That is entirely reasonable and justice demands it.<\/p><p>  Legislating in this area would not be problematic were it not for the decision in Attorney General <i>v<\/i>. X and others, and here we come to the nub of it.  The court heard no medical evidence.  There was no psychiatric evidence.  There was no duty of care to the unborn.  Then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay, considered that suicidality in pregnancy could only be avoided by abortion against his test and that abortion could not be postponed in order to monitor the woman's condition unlike the case for physical risks to the woman's life.  However, on psychiatric intervention, perinatal psychiatrist, Dr. John Sheehan, has told the committee, &quot;It is exactly the opposite to the medical intervention and ... the notion of carrying out an emergency termination is completely obsolete in respect of a person who is ... suicidal.&quot;  After this week, we know that abortion will never address the suicidal woman's actual needs and it might very well harm her.  It is, therefore, unthinkable that we should legislate for abortion to address suicidality.<\/p><p>  Ultimately, a referendum will be required to deal with the difficulties posed by Attorney General <i>v<\/i>. X and others.  In the meantime, we propose that the Medical Council should draw up guidelines to deal specifically with the issues surrounding medical interventions for physical complications during pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000015#O01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Simons","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357818000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I would like to share my time with Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill of the Life Institute.<\/p><p>  My name is Dr. Eoghan de Faoite.  I am a medical doctor and a member of Youth Defence, a pro-life group.  I have been involved in pro-life activities since my late teens and I thank everyone for the inviting me to address the committee on the current debate.<\/p><p>  First, the 2010 decision of the European Court of Human Rights on the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland case is, largely, the reason we find ourselves in this room today.  Contrary to many media reports and some statements made by Government officials and others on the ruling, the European Court of Human Rights did not demand or even require that Ireland legislate for abortion.  In fact, no legal right to abortion exists in the European Convention.  Instead, the court asked that Ireland provide clarity which can, of course, be provided without legislating for the X case.<\/p><p>  Second, abortion and maternal health care is the crux of this issue.  It goes without saying that Ireland is a world leader in maternal health.  Our excellent track record and high standards of maternal health care, coupled with our extremely low rate of maternal mortality, are second to none.  We have achieved such high standards without legalised abortion.  This is because Irish obstetricians and other specialists will always intervene to save the life of a mother when she has a life-threatening complication of pregnancy.  This practice of intervening, which includes premature delivery of the baby even when the baby has little of no chance of surviving, is permitted in Ireland today.  It is permitted under Irish law and by the Medical Council's ethical guidelines and is within pro-life principles.  As a medical practitioner, I believe the current Medical Council's guidelines are crystal clear on the question of intervening in pregnancy when a woman's life is at risk.  I echo Professor Fionnuala McAuliffe's recent comments that obstetricians know they have absolute freedom to intervene to save the life of a woman, even if it means the loss of the life of her unborn baby.  <\/p><p>  This brings us to a crucial distinction which was clarified during this committee's hearing on Tuesday last but is all too often misunderstood.  That is the distinction between the termination of pregnancy and the termination of the life of a child.  Irish doctors have such freedom to intervene under current Medical Council guidelines because there is a clear difference between intervening to save a woman's life, which includes premature delivery of the baby, and abortion, which intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child.  The blurring of the distinction between these two practices is what is contributing to public confusion.  Birth, an emergency caesarean section and premature induction of labour are all terminations of pregnancy.  Thanks to the expertise of our obstetricians and neonatologists many of these premature babies survive.  How can these be described as an abortion?<\/p><p>  The questions offered by Senator John Crown directly addressed this distinction during the hearing on Tuesday.  Senator Crown asked if it is necessary in permitting a life-saving termination of pregnancy to kill the foetus <i>in utero<\/i> or can the pregnancy be delivered to give the life-saving treatment the woman needs.  The Master of the National Maternity Hospital responded by saying:<blockquote>We never kill a foetus.  That is not our aim.  Occasionally it is required that we deliver a pregnancy before the baby is viable or capable of surviving in our neonatal intensive care unit.  When there is any possibility at all that we can preserve the life of the baby we will do so.  We are able to do so from very low gestations, from 23 weeks on and in those cases Members can be very certain that we will make every effort to preserve life.<\/blockquote>  It was also established that there were no known instances where a mother had needlessly lost her life because of any supposed lack of clarity in the legal framework. <\/p><p>  Third, claims are often made by pro-abortion campaigners that women need to leave Ireland to access, so called, life-saving abortions in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.  Many of my medical colleagues find it grossly insulting to their profession to suggest that we are risking women's lives by not permitting abortion in Ireland.  Almost always, these claims are made without foundation or fact.  Figures freely available under Freedom of Information legislation from the Department of Health show these claims to be entirely false.  The most recent data from the Department of Health for the years 1992 to 2010, inclusive, show that zero abortions were carried out on Irish women in Britain under category F of the Abortion Act which records abortions carried out to save the life of the mother.  Furthermore, zero abortions were carried out on Irish women in Britain during the same period under category G, which records abortions carried out &quot;to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the mother&quot;.  That number is zero because Irish women are never denied the life-saving care they need during pregnancy.  A review of this evidence, easily undertaken, reveals that Irish women are not travelling to the United Kingdom to undergo, so called, life-saving abortions because they are being denied treatment in Ireland.  The truth remains that Irish women are safe in Ireland and are receiving, today, whatever life-saving treatments they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000016#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eoghan de Faoite"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357818000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Members of the committee, members of the public and public representatives, I am a consultant in general adult psychiatry working in the public, independent and voluntary sectors where I deal with the broadest possible case mix.  I have also worked as a consultation liaison psychiatrist with particular responsibility for perinatal psychiatry in Ireland for more than two of the last three years.<\/p><p>  I began my career in psychiatry in Jersey in 1997 one month before the legalisation of abortion on that island.  My very first assessment of an attempted suicide victim occurred in my first weekend on call in Jersey when I was asked to review a 19 year old girl who had taken a large overdose of medication.  During the assessment, when I asked her why she had sought this ending to her life, she indicated that she had been pressured six months earlier by her parents and boyfriend to undergo a termination of pregnancy, and because abortion was not legal in Jersey at that time she was forced to travel to Southampton where she had the abortion against her will.  Six months later she had descended into a profound depression and attempted to end her life as a result.  At the time of the assessment as I tried to discuss with her how she would recover from this depression, and I remember it clearly, she said, &quot;Can you tell me I have not killed my own baby?  Can you tell me I can undo what I have done?  Can you tell me how to bring my baby back?&quot;.<\/p><p>  I hope I am in a better position today to answer those questions which are asked of me on a frequent basis.  In may day-to-day work I frequently come across women who find themselves in situations they describe as crisis pregnancies or unplanned pregnancies.  In the past 12 months alone, I can refer to a case of a lady who, 22 years previously, had undergone an abortion.  Her husband reported that in the intervening 22 years, for a period of approximately three weeks around the anniversary of the abortion, she suffered a marked depressive mood.  I also know of a 21 year old patient who presented for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, having had an abortion on the advice of her mother and her aunts seven years previously.  These people have been left out of the hearings, to a large extent.<\/p><p>  The third edition of <i>Revision Notes in Psychiatry<\/i>, edited by Professor Basant Puri, which is the major text book on psychiatry states, &quot;Only 10% of women suffer with severe or prolonged sequelae as a result of induced abortion&quot;.  The word &quot;only&quot; shows the approach being taken to women who suffer as a result of abortion.  This percentage amounts to approximately 19,000 women in Britain and 400 in Ireland per year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000016#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill"},{"type":"speech","time":1357818600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. David Manley from Family and Life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000017#Q00100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357818600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>On behalf of Family and Life I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today and to allow us to contribute to its deliberations.  I hope that I and my colleague, Mr. Patrick Carr, will be helpful to the committee.<\/p><p>  What follows is a much shortened version of the written opening statement which has been circulated.  The issue of abortion is characterised as being divisive and indeed this is so.  There is, however, a large area of agreement and common ground.  Everyone, I assume, is in agreement that women in Ireland should receive whatever medical care they require in pregnancy.  At the same time there is a large majority of Irish people who would like to see the protection of unborn human life continue.<\/p><p>  Provided that people are reassured that such protection will not have any weakening effect on medical care provided to pregnant women, all but a small number are content to see the comprehensive prohibition of abortion in Ireland.  I use the word &quot;abortion&quot; in the commonly understood sense and I am aware of the confusion that surrounds this word.<\/p><p>  In the 2010 case of A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, the European Court of Human Rights did not require Ireland to legalise abortion.  The court required the Government to put in place procedures that are effective and accessible for women.  It made no stipulation as to what the legal status of these procedures should be.  Following the decision of the European Court in that case, the Government established an expert group to lay out the options available to it.  Unfortunately and for reasons not altogether clear, the expert group's remit was restricted to giving advice, &quot;on how to give effect to existing constitutional provisions&quot;.  In other words, it limited itself to options giving effect to the Constitution and the X case judgment.  <\/p><p>  The 1992 judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case is - and in my view, will remain - the source of our current legal difficulty and social controversy until such time as its suicide provision is removed.  The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights only requires Ireland to address the perceived lack of clarity in its law on abortion.  In reality, the clarity which the court requires can be provided without enshrining in statute law a principle that allows for the direct and intentional killing of an innocent human being; in other words, the suicide provision.  I depend very much on Professor William Binchy's testimony yesterday.  <\/p><p>  It is clear from the testimony given by prominent obstetricians who have come before this committee that further clarity is desirable indeed.  However, it is important to note that whatever lack of clarity currently exists and which existed previously clearly did not prevent doctors in Ireland from providing women in pregnancy with the high standard of medical care they need.<\/p><p>  It is regrettable that the Government has prematurely committed itself to a course of action without the benefit of the valuable testimony that has been presented to this committee over the recent days and without the benefit of the work of this committee.  This is particularly the case since the course of action chosen involves legislation giving statutory effect to the suicide provision of the X case.  All the psychiatrists who testified before this committee agreed that abortion is not a treatment for suicidal threat.  Predicting who will take their lives is not a workable project.  The idea that the lives of some human beings are less valuable than those of others has no place in Irish law.  The Constitution of Ireland recognises the fundamental equality of all human beings.  To their abiding credit, at a time when so many other countries were moving in the opposite direction, the Irish people in 1983 made explicit that this equality extends to the most vulnerable of human beings, the unborn.  The European Court of Human Rights recognised that the Irish people's decision was based, &quot;on profound moral values concerning the nature of life which have not been demonstrated to have relevantly changed since then.&quot;  I believe there are some promises that should not be broken.  The Government has no mandate to legislate for direct and intentional killing of unborn children.  To do so would be to make a law that would be fundamentally unjust, violating the most basic of human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000017#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Manley"},{"type":"speech","time":1357818600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Breda O'Brien from the Iona Institute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000017#Q00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357818600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>As a woman whose primary qualification to be here is as a woman, a mother and a teacher, I am particularly grateful for the opportunity to interact with Members of the Oireachtas at such an important time.  I have spent nearly three decades teaching young women who are the primary group to be affected by any decisions made by legislators.  In that time I have witnessed something terrifying which members of the committee have also witnessed.  I refer to the normalising of suicide so that it becomes part of a menu of options as a response to extreme stress.  Like many others, my own family has been touched by suicide.  When a girl comes to me in school and whispers, \"I don't think I can go on much longer\", I take this very seriously.  I move immediately to put a circle of protective care around her, beginning with her parents.  People have expressed concerns that if we exclude suicide as a ground for abortion that we are somehow stigmatising mental illness.  In fact, the grave mistake would be to fail to see that there is a difference.<\/p><p>  Doctor after doctor has told us that they never fail to intervene where there is a life-threatening risk to a mother.  Someone far more qualified than me, perinatal psychiatrist, Dr. John Sheehan, has said that in the case of suicidal threat, the notion of carrying out an emergency termination is completely obsolete.  A better and calmer intervention is needed.<\/p><p>  Suicide is different.  If we are to enact just and safe legislation, suicide has to be treated differently.  The judges in the X case acted in good faith in making their decision.  The tragic consequences for Ms C, the first girl after X to whom the test was applied, were a direct result.  Ms C had been brutally raped at the age of 13 years.  Unlike Ms X, Ms C was psychiatrically assessed and taken to England by the State for a termination.  The consequences were disastrous.  She has never gotten over the loss of the baby and has made numerous suicide attempts since.  Thankfully, none of the attempts has been successful.  If we want to trust women, we have to trust the experience of women like Ms C.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Science has strict guidelines against doing anything that normalises suicide as a response to stress.  Journalists would be excoriated if they ascribed a single or a simple cause to suicide because of the danger of so-called copycat suicide or contagion.  Yet, by legislating for suicide, crisis pregnancy is being presented, even in very rare circumstances, as something so awful that suicidal thoughts and threats are an acceptable reaction.  Anyone with a bit of life experience will know it is not the baby that ruins one's life, it is everybody else.  It is the family who will not stand by a woman; the principal who will not give a girl a place in his school; the partner who will pay for an abortion but who will not pay child support.  That is what ruins one's life.  It is those kind of attitudes which we should act against, not the innocent baby growing in the womb.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000017#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357819200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms O'Brien.

My first question is to all of them but I refer specifically to a reference in the submission by the Pro-Life Campaign to a survey of maternal deaths in the three Dublin maternity hospitals - the Rotunda, Holles Street and the Coombe - from 1980 to 2011, which found there were two maternal deaths by suicide out of a total of 680,000 live births, both of which occurred post partum, after delivery.  In that particular timeframe, some 130,000 women travelled to Britain or elsewhere for an abortion.  Is it possible, given that we can assume the vast majority of those who travelled were in a crisis pregnancy situation, that they might, if they were unable to access a termination, have become suicidal?  I am merely posing the question.  There are no statistics or figures available to us to assess the 130,000 women who travelled abroad for terminations in that period.<\/p><p>  When the witnesses express their concern that the inclusion of suicidal intent as grounds for termination will open up a more liberal regime, are they effectively saying there should be a referendum to row back on the interpretation of Article 40.3.3&deg; as set out in the X case, or do they see another solution in terms of addressing the outstanding issue whereby the Supreme Court has given its interpretation to that effect?  Some of the delegates will argue that the interpretation was based on flawed assessments, that no psychiatric experts were brought into play or whatever.  The point, however, is that as the matter stands, in jurisprudence, it is the law that suicidal intent is grounds for the provision of abortion in this State.

Dr. &Oacute; Domhnaill has shared his experience in the course of his contribution today and in his written submission.  Likewise, we had five very experienced consultant psychiatrists before us on Tuesday who each stated that despite the fact that this is included in the medical council's current guidelines, they had never in their experience had to employ such an intervention.  If this is so, and given that we are advised by Government that its intention is to introduce confirmatory legislation, why would Dr. &Oacute; Domhnaill expect the situation to change?<\/p><p>  I welcome Ms O'Brien's identification of some of the forces and attitudes in society that have clearly driven some women, including some very young women, to seek abortions.  Those attitudes must be confronted by all, irrespective of our attitudes or outlooks on the core issue being addressed here today.<\/p><p> Mr. Manley acknowledged in his substantial written submission that one in 19 Irish pregnancies ends in abortion, albeit on the neighbouring island.

Dr. de Faoite stated it is clear, from records he has examined, that no women have travelled to the UK for life-saving abortions.  I put it to him that in recent days we have heard evidence which directly contradicts this statement.  For example, a number of medics - both obstetricians and psychiatrists - indicated that it is commonplace to refer women to the UK for abortions.  Perhaps Dr. de Faoite will respond on that point.<\/p><p>  Ms O'Brien theorised about where we are going in the context of what we must do and the challenge which the Government must face up to.  She referred to asking obstetricians to scrub in and intervene in order to either take the life of or deliver a child early and inquired as to what might be the consequences of such action.  What the committee and the Government are attempting to do is give women choices with regard to accessing life-saving treatment.  Perhaps Ms O'Brien will comment further on that matter.<\/p><p>  In his submission, Dr. &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to how the Government is proposing to drag psychiatrists into the draconian position of being obliged to commit women while they are being assessed in circumstances where they are unwilling to submit voluntarily to such assessment.  Again, we have heard evidence to the contrary in respect of this matter.  For example, a number of obstetricians and psychiatrists who came before us previously stated that in the area of medicine, best practice often involves obtaining a second opinion.  At no stage was there any reference to the committal of women.  Psychiatrists informed the committee that if a woman were suicidal, they would believe her.  Why, in Dr. &Oacute; Domhnaill's estimation, would we be obliged to commit women?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000019#S00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357819800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I will deal first with Deputy Conway's question on allowing women to access life-saving choices.

I would say two things about that.  First, as Ms Simons of the Pro Life Campaign has said, what is central to the 1861 Act is the issue of intent.  There is no legal reality to the idea that a doctor might be prosecuted under the Act if he or she acts in good faith to protect to the life of the mother while obviously doing everything possible to save the life of the baby.<\/p><p>  There has been some discussion of the decriminalisation of abortion.  That is a very worrying suggestion because the 1861 Act does not just apply to doctors, it applies to anybody who attempts to procure an abortion.  It has an important function in deterring back-street abortions.  It also deters abortion clinics from opening on the streets of our towns and cities, such as we recently saw in Belfast.  As Ms O'Brien said, the criminalisation of the offence of abortion sends out an important signal to society that it is a morally grave act to destroy the life of an unborn child.  I should also note that sections 58 and 59 of the 1861 Act are actually still in force in Britain, where abortion is widely available.  Even in that jurisdiction they recognise that there may be some circumstances in which it is appropriate and necessary to bring a prosecution for someone who carries out an abortion.<\/p><p>  In terms of summing up as regards the evidence that has been heard, I would like to bring to the attention of the committee the fact that there has been a divergence of views from both the medical community and the legal experts who were heard yesterday.  The Bar Council and the Law Society are conspicuous by their absence.  They both issued statements, I understand, to the effect that they could not adequately represent the divergent views of all their members.  These are the organisations which represent the legal experts in this country and they are recognising that this is not a technical legal issue, it is a moral issue, a value judgment and a matter of opinion.  We all have different views on that and it is important to remember this.  Ultimately, this is a political decision and it is a value judgment.<\/p><p>  What do we want our values, as a society, to be?  I respectfully submit to the committee that the current medical practice, where everything is done to save both the life of the mother and of the baby and where doctors are protected in carrying out those functions, is what we want to see retained.  I am an expectant mother and when I need the services of an obstetrician, I want to be sure that he or she will not intervene unless and until there is a real and substantial risk to my life.  Before that point, the appropriate medical treatment is to admit me to hospital, if necessary, and give me all medical care that I need.  The risk, it should be said, may dissipate but if it increases and if there is a risk to my life, then by all means I want the doctor to intervene to save my life.  I have three children and a husband at home who depend on me.  That is current medical practice and all we would like to see is that protected and enshrined in the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000019#S00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Steen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357819800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>In reply to Deputy Kelleher, if one asked Family and Life would it want a referendum to row back the suicide provision in the X case, the answer would definitely be yes.

I mean no disrespect to the court.  It was faced with an extremely difficult case and I do not envy the task it was given.  Supreme court decisions from other countries were subsequently recognised as being deeply flawed and repudiated.  In the United States, for example, the Dred Scott decision in the middle of the 19th century upheld the principle of slavery.  The Buck <i>v.<\/i> Bell decision in the 1920s justified forcible sterilisation of women judged to be unfit and, more recently in the United States, the Roe <i>v.<\/i> Wade decision which has not been reversed although the previous two decisions have been reversed.  What those three decisions have in common is that they introduced the idea that some people are less equal than others and that some lives are less valuable than others.

Regarding the cases recorded of Irish women who travelled to the UK, Deputy Kelleher gave a figure of 130,000 and wondered if some of those cases could have included women with suicidal intent.  We obtained a freedom of information disclosure from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys in England and Wales last August and from 1992 until 2011, which are the most recent figures, two women gave reasons along mental health grounds.  No one gave the reason of suicidality.  One of the grounds was mental illness - that was the phrase used - and the other one was depressive disorder.  In my experience, as in the experience of all the psychiatrists who have given evidence here this week, abortion has never been indicated and is not reported in any journal or textbook as being a treatment for either mental illness or depressive disorder.  I hope that answers that particular question.<\/p><p>  I have combined the questions on the treatment of acute suicidal intent.  On the last question regarding the procedures that would be followed, as I mentioned, some of the procedures would be considered draconian.  The problem with the presentation of someone who is acutely suicidal is that she is presenting as someone who is acutely stressed, usually in the context of having recently discovered that she is pregnant or later in her pregnancy having discovered that, say, a relationship has broken down and she no longer has the support she had previously.  The key thing to do in that situation, and it is the same for anybody who is assessed or considered to be at risk of suicidality, is to carry out a thorough assessment of her psychiatric history and her mental state at that time.  If it is a case that two psychiatrists are needed to provide a specific opinion, the process does not change.  Dr. Sheehan referred to that when he stated: \"... in our practice, we see people who are profoundly depressed... clearly the intervention [in that case] is to admit [them] to hospital... support and help them... not to make a decision that is permanent and irrevocable.\"  Dr. Sheehan said that the intervention in that case is to admit him or her to hospital, but I should point out that the process of admitting someone to hospital involves their either agreeing or disagreeing to be admitted to hospital. The only legislation we have is the Mental Health Act of 2001 and if someone is deemed to be at immediate risk of suicide, acutely suicidal, he or she must to be admitted to a place of safety.  We are restricted by law.  We cannot just say that we accept the person is suicidal but she should go home, come back and we will get a second opinion.  She has to be admitted and in this situation most people will not want to be admitted to hospital.  In that situation one is obliged, ethically and legally, to detain the person in under the Mental Health Act.  That is draconian, and that is what this Government is purporting to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000020#T00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill"},{"type":"speech","time":1357820400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>That is existing law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000020#T00400","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357820400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000020#T00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill"},{"type":"speech","time":1357820400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>We will not have questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000020#T00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1357820400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>That is existing law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000020#T00700","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357820400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>That is what the Government intends to bring in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000020#T00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357820400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I will address the question on the UK abortion statistics.

F and G directly relate to where there is a risk to the life of the mother and abortion is performed for that reason, and they account for those figures.  I was told by the freedom of information officer in the Department of Health that zero abortions were performed in the 18 year period between 1992 and 2010, which was the only period to which he had access, on Irish women in England under grounds F and G.  Out of interest I also inquired under grounds A and B because they also relate to women's health.  Under those grounds I was informed that only ten abortions were carried out in an 18 year period on Irish women in England where they may, during the course of pregnancy, present with a life-threatening condition.

I will repeat my question of this morning.   When we questioned our colleagues from the maternity hospitals, it appeared that there are probably 30 abortions per year at present carried out where there are unambiguous grounds based on a risk to the life, rather than the health, of the mother.  The consensus among our colleagues was that no cases have been missed.  They believe that no maternal deaths occurred because of a reluctance to perform medically required abortions because of religious or ethical scruples on the part of a doctor.  It has not happened.  It is believed none of the abortions was due to the threat of suicide.  It is likely, barring some unbelievably epidemiological mischance, that we are legislating for approximately 30 medically necessary abortions per year to save the life of the mother.  It is extremely likely that nearly none of these would be carried out on the grounds of a threat of suicide.  Therefore, one must ask why this particular aspect of the proposed legislation is exciting such extraordinary interest.  There are two possible explanations, one of which is that it is believed there will be a major increase in the number of abortions that are not bona fide on the grounds of there being a real threat to the life of the mother.<\/p><p>  If this is not the case, is there a suggestion that suicidality would be feigned?

It may be a very small and tight chink but one should consider what has been the experience of any country around the world once there has been such an opening.  Basically, what members are being asked to do is to lessen the value that is given to the life of the unborn.

Very recently, Professor Fionnuala McAuliffe, who is chairwoman of the public relations committee of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, stated that doctors do know, when they intervene, that they are perfectly entitled to so do and are covered under Medical Council ethical guidelines to intervene when a woman's life is at risk.  That being said, I never stated, in any part of my submission, that I am against legislation or against clarification.  I know my own understanding of the Medical Council ethical guidelines but if it is shown, through discussion and debate, that doctors seek further clarity and seek either a legislative footing or further clarification in the form of Medical Council guidelines to allow them to practice medicine and maternal health care, I would not be against that and nor would any pro-life person I know.  The problem I have is that any legislation, clarification or even guidelines that are brought forward must also recognise the right to life of the unborn child and must recognise that with that, a doctor does everything he or she possibly can to save the life of the mother, while at the same time recognising that he or she also has a duty of care to the unborn child.<\/p><p>  I will conclude on this single point.

Of course, the reason for it is that the X case judgment superficially dealt with abortion for suicidal risk.  There was no medical evidence provided before the Supreme Court in 1992.  That led to a seriously flawed judgment, in my opinion, because the experts on the assessment of suicidal risk are consultant psychiatrists.  The evidence that was given to the Supreme Court at that time was given by a child and adolescent sex therapist - probably not the best place to go looking for advice on suicide.<\/p><p>  The real concern is that our cultural cousins in the United Kingdom and the USA have had the experience of seeing the so-called floodgates opened in relation to suicide.  In 1966, the year before the Abortion Act in Britain, the overwhelming majority of abortions were carried out under cover of the 1938 Rex <i>v.<\/i> Bourne Act, where Sir Alex Bourne had carried out an abortion on a rape victim to protect her health.  Those were the grounds up until 1966.  Following the passage of the Abortion Act in 1967, within 12 months of its enactment, over 95% of all applications for abortion were on risk of suicide.  In the United States, the exact same thing has happened.  We have gone from a situation of 80,000 abortions in 1966 to over 190,000, most of those being on the grounds of risk of suicide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000023#W00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357822200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I would like to deal with Senator Crown's question, which I thought was very important.  Why is there so much emphasis on the question of suicide?  In my opinion, it is not because of numbers, slippery slopes or floodgates.  It is because if legislation were passed it would allow, for the first time in Irish law, the life of an unborn child to be directly and exclusively taken.  In our Constitution we have given that unborn child the right to life, equal to the mother, equal to yours and mine.  How can a law permit such an injustice?  That is the problem.<\/p><p>  The 30 cases of abortion that were mentioned raise the whole difficulty of using the right words.  The obstetricians who talked about their work on the first day, spoke of their efforts to deal with two patients.

Indeed, successive editions of those guidelines have, from this particular perspective, become somewhat weaker in the sense that they have incorporated some of the thinking of the X case decision.  However, it may be possible to have guidelines other than those of the Medical Council.  I would see the Institute of Obstetricians having a major role to play in formulating such guidelines, since they are the people most directly affected other than the pregnant women, of course.  They are the people who are seeking clarification.  The fact remains, however, that while guidelines may satisfy the requirements of the A, B and C <i>v.<\/i> Ireland judgment, they will not resolve the underlying issue, which brings us back to the X case that can ultimately only be resolved either by revisiting the Supreme Court's jurisprudence or by a referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000023#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Carr"},{"type":"speech","time":1357822200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The speaker's time is up.

I heard one of them state that risk of suicide was a ground in the English Act.  I looked again at the 1967 Abortion Act and, as they all will be aware, of course, risk of suicide does not require to be proven.  The test is a much lower test of injury to physical or mental health of the woman.  There is no comparison between the English provision and the Irish law, as it currently is in terms of the Constitution and the Attorney General <i>v.<\/i> X and Others test.  The Attorney General <i>v.<\/i> X and Others test is a much higher standard, of real and substantial risk to the life of the woman.<\/p><p>  Following from that, there is another correction on which I seek clarification from them.  Some of them spoke about a change of culture by legislation.  How can it be a change of culture when the legislation we are talking about is legislation to implement existing law in terms of the Constitution and the Supreme Court decision in Attorney General <i>v<\/i>. X and others?<\/p><p>  Third, in terms of the criminal law and the 1861 Act, doctors have testified, as those present all have heard, that they have a fear of being prosecuted.  The only reason there have been no prosecutions over recent decades is because abortion is legal in England and every year 4,000 women are travelling to England.  Earlier in the week we heard evidence from the doctors that research shows that, for example, infanticide and rape prosecutions increased in Ireland during the Second World War when it was difficult to travel, and we have seen, as women have been able to travel to England in such numbers, that prosecutions have not occurred.<\/p><p>  I should say that I am probably the only person here who has been threatened with jail, which was in 1989 for giving out information on abortion.

In light of the fact that all of the witnesses who have spoken have stated that they accept the current medical practice whereby terminations which are required to protect the life of the mother should be allowed, is it possible that legislation would be introduced in 2013 which would see the constitutional provision enshrined in law but that the ban on abortion would be protected?

The question of what constitutes a substantial risk was raised by the master of the National Maternity Hospital during the course of the hearings.  The legal test at present is whether there is a real and substantial risk to the mother.  It should be borne in mind that the law is not capable of reducing the assessment of risk to a statistical risk and, indeed, it would be dangerous to do so for doctors and, obviously, for women and their babies.  The assessment of risk has to be carried out by a clinician in light of his or her knowledge of the circumstances of the particular patient presenting.  The test requires that the risk be real, not hypothetical, and substantial, not insubstantial or trivial.  Subject to these requirements, the test affords considerable flexibility to doctors.  It is a simple test and it is left to the doctor acting in good faith to judge the situation.  This flexibility is demonstrated by the absence of prosecutions under the 1861 Act.  There is, however, a significant rider to the effect that the termination must be the only means of saving the life of the woman.  That is important to remember as legislators.  Furthermore, under Irish law the unborn child is recognised as having an equal right to life to that of the mother and the vindication of that right requires that no effort should be spared to save the life of the baby without endangering the life of the mother.<\/p><p>  In regard to the X case, the Supreme Court was constrained by the particular facts presented.  The State did not present countervailing evidence and the court was not free to ask for further evidence of its own volition.  The Oireachtas is not so constrained and in light the amount of information that has been published, including the international studies rehearsed by other speakers, about the increase in risk of suicide following an abortion relative to the increase in risk from giving birth, it is important that the Oireachtas does not confine its deliberation to the terms of the X case alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000026#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Steen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357824000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I will be as brief as possible in making clear the distinction between a necessary medical intervention for a woman who faces a serious risk to her life where the child dies and what is commonly called an abortion.  There is a huge difference between the 30 cases that occurred in Irish maternity hospitals and what takes place in an abortion clinic in London.<\/p><p>  The intention of the abortionist is simple.  It is to kill the child.  The intention of an obstetrician in a maternity hospital is to save the life of the mother and, if at all possible, the life of the child.  The intervention of the obstetrician in a maternity hospital is necessary.  If nothing is done, the woman may die.  The intervention has to be quick, accurate and effective.  In the case of the abortionist, an elective abortion is something that is not necessary.  It is chosen, sought and paid for.  An obstetrician will treat the ill mother for certain ailments, such as heart trouble or cancer.

We do have a precedent for a case where a decision of the Supreme Court was considered to create such difficulties that it was necessary to have a referendum to reverse it - it was in regard to the law on adoption - so it is not unheard of that the court would make what would generally be considered to be at least an unhelpful decision.  We should bear in mind too that there is an even higher authority than the Supreme Court, namely, the people.

I believe in the democratic process and I respect it.  Two questions were directly raised about the recent international symposium on maternal health care that I was directly involved with and about the declaration that came out of that.  Members wanted further elaboration.  On 8 September last, a symposium on maternal health was held in Dublin.  It was chiefly organised by Professor Eamon O'Dwyer of the National University of Ireland, Galway, who is one of Ireland's most senior obstetricians and has an absolutely impeccable track record of obstetric care.  That symposium was addressed by international experts in the field of maternal health care, emergency obstetrics and cancer in pregnancy.  We had the world's leading expert in cancer in pregnancy, Professor Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Amant from Belgium, come to address that conference, which was extremely well attended, with over 160 medical practitioners attending.<\/p><p>  At the end of that symposium a declaration, which is now commonly known as the Dublin declaration, was released.  I will not read it in its entirety but it has three main points.  The first point is that abortion is never medically necessary - the direct and intentional termination of the life of the unborn child is not medically necessary.  Second, there is a fundamental difference between abortion and emergency treatment or any other medical treatment a woman may need to save her life.  Third, the prohibition of abortion does not affect, in any way, the availability of optimal care to pregnant women.  That declaration has been released in the past few weeks and, to date, 400 medical practitioners have signed up in support of that declaration.<\/p><p>  Somebody mentioned the dismissive way Dr. Rhona Mahony addressed this declaration earlier in the week.  I want to point out that, with regard to two of the signatories of this declaration, one is a former predecessor of Dr. Mahony as master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, and the second is a current professor of obstetrics in that hospital.

We are here to discuss the implementation of the Government decision, following the recent publication of the report of the expert group on matters relating to the A, B and C <i>v.<\/i> Ireland case, by way of legislation and regulation within the parameters of our current constitutional provisions.  The Government has stated that the aim of its actions in this matter is to ensure clarity and legal certainty in respect of processes to determine whether the termination of a pregnancy is permissible in cases in which there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a woman as a result of that pregnancy.  In doing so we must ensure we take full account of Article 40.3.3&deg;.<\/p><p>  Once again I thank all the members of the committee and hope that in this final session our process of engagement will continue in a calm, tolerant and respectful manner, allowing for the various opinions we will hear.

We congratulate the Government on finally commissioning a report on this and assuring the Irish public that legislation and regulations will be implemented in a timely manner.  We also congratulate it on the success of the hearings over recent days which we hope will encourage future dialogue on the wider issues such as rape, incest, health and fatal foetal abnormalities.<\/p><p>  Choice Ireland is a Dublin-based feminist pro-choice group which has been active since January 2007.  We are a volunteer-run organisation campaigning for free access to accurate information on all crisis pregnancy options, proper sex education, free access to quality child care and free and legal abortion.  We have been campaigning since our foundation for legislation on the X case and welcome the Government's decision to address this issue after 21 years of successive Governments failing to do so.<\/p><p>  Statistics from the UK Department of Health suggest that 4,149 women provided Irish addresses to UK clinics providing abortion services in 2011.  In addition, statistics compiled by the crisis pregnancy programme indicate that 1,470 women travelled from Ireland to the Netherlands between 2005 and 2009 to terminate their pregnancies.  In addition, seizures made by the Irish Medicines Board suggest that many Irish women terminate pregnancies within the State by ordering medication over the Internet, which is an incredibly risky situation for these women who have resorted to self-medication.<\/p><p>  At present, abortion is illegal in Ireland save in cases where there is a real and substantial threat to a pregnant woman's life which may only be addressed through the termination of her pregnancy.  This right was established following the 1992 Supreme Court ruling in Attorney General <i>v<\/i>. X and Others.  However, no legislation has been provided to give effect to this right.  Two subsequent referenda in 1992 and later in 2002 attempted to remove suicide as a potential ground to terminate a pregnancy but both were defeated.  Since then, no known cases have arisen from suicidal ideation, and one can only assume that due to this lack of clarity in Irish law many women will choose to travel abroad to terminate their pregnancies rather than face the Irish legal system.<\/p><p>  In 2010 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights as women had no mechanism to allow them establish whether they had a right to an abortion in the State under the terms of the X case.  The grounds under which abortion is allowed under the terms of the X case are strictly limited and would likely affect only a very tiny proportion of the thousands of Irish women who terminate their pregnancies every year for a multitude of valid reasons.  Choice Ireland welcomes the Government's decision to legislate for the X case, but it is important to be cognisant of the fact that abortion access will continue to be strictly limited and will remain one of the most restrictive regimes in the world.<\/p><p>  It is also important to note that legislating for the X case will not lead to a legal situation similar to that in the UK.  UK abortion legislation allows for abortion in cases where there is a grave risk of physical or mental injury to a woman, and injury as opposed to death is the crucial difference.  Our Constitution gives the foetus an equal right to life as the woman and it would simply not be possible to legislate for abortion in terms of physical or mental injury in this country, save for circumstances where such injury led to a substantial risk to the life of a woman.  Further constitutional change would be required to do so.  In saying this, our Constitution still does not recognise a woman's right to a termination in cases of rape, incest, fatal foetal abnormalities, health or any other of the multitude of valid reasons abortion is legal in the vast majority of other developed nations.<\/p><p>  Let us again consider the case that has brought us here today, which involved a 14 year old girl pregnant as a result of rape.  Incredibly distressed and preferring to end her own life rather than be forced by the Irish State to continue with her pregnancy, she took her case to the Supreme Court to have her constitutional rights vindicated, and won.  We are here today, 21 years on, to discuss what processes and procedures should be in place to ensure that when the life of another pregnant woman is in jeopardy, be it due to physical ailments or a risk of suicide, that her constitutional right to a termination is vindicated.  Choice Ireland agrees with the European Court of Human Rights that women should have an effective means to access their human right.  This is potentially a very distressing process for a woman to go through, and any procedure put in place to measure whether her life, as distinct from her health, is at risk, must be compassionate towards the patient and consider each case in a respectful and timely manner.<\/p><p>  Ms Fay will go through some of our recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000030#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Abigail Rooney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357825800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>The expert group report offers a number of options regarding the qualifications of doctors involved in the process.  Limiting the number of doctors eligible to determine risk to life to those on the specialist register may unnecessarily restrict the number of doctors available to make such determinations and therefore reduce women's access to a termination.  Choice Ireland recommends that medical practitioners eligible for specialist registration, but not actually registered, be allowed to make determinations regarding risk to life.  This option balances the necessity for doctors to have the necessary expertise to make determinations with ensuring a sufficiently wide pool of practitioners is available to ensure women have access to terminations.<\/p><p>  Choice Ireland agrees with the statements of the master of the National Maternity Hospital that a multi-disciplinary approach should be implemented, using the skills of the necessary experts.  Choice Ireland recommends that where practical, the determination should be made by doctors who are already involved in a woman's medical care and the number of doctors required as signatories should be limited to two to reduce the potential stress associated with the process.  In addition, this option avoids limiting access to terminations for women in areas where a wider pool of experts is unavailable.  The expert group report proposes that in cases where a woman's life is in jeopardy due to a threat of suicide three opinions be sought, namely, those of an obstetrician and two psychiatrists.  Choice Ireland recommends that in such cases two opinions should be deemed sufficient.  This would avoid the risk of stigmatizing women through the differential treatment of physical and psychiatric threats to life.<\/p><p>  To avoid delays occurring in cases where there is an immediate threat to a woman's life and it is not possible to secure medical opinions following normal procedure, emergency provisions should be clearly laid down to allow doctors treat women in these situations.<\/p><p>  The expert group recommends that, \"to defend and vindicate the right to life of the unborn, terminations at the fringes of viability, even when survival is not anticipated, should take place in medical facilities which have neonatal intensive care units, and carried out at such a time and in a manner as to maximise the foetal chances of survival, without compromising the right to life of the woman\".  It is important that this provision does not reduce women's access to terminations, particularly in cases where a woman is being cared for in a facility which does not include a neonatal intensive care unit and compelling her to travel to access a termination would pose additional risks to her health.<\/p><p>  Choice Ireland recommends that in cases where a woman is denied access to a termination in the first instance any appeal is carried out by a medical rather than a quasi-judicial review panel to reduce the stress placed by the process on her.  Women seeking a termination should be provided with access to independent legal support in addition to access to a detailed explanation of the grounds under which her initial application was refused.  This would ensure that in cases where a woman feels her request for termination was refused following a failure to follow due procedure that recourse is available to highlight this concern.  We would also be cautious that any appeal process should be specifically established for the woman concerned and not for a third party.  The expert group notes that while legislation does not undermine a woman's existing right to appeal any decision through the courts, a number of options exist regarding how this could be affected.  To ensure a decision is made promptly it would be desirable to put in place specific rights to appeal to achieve a timely resolution.<\/p><p>  Practitioners have a right to conscientious objection and the expert group report notes that doctors who hold such an objection have a \"duty to refer to another doctor who is not a conscientious objector\".  In an emergency situation however, conscientious objection should not delay or prevent a woman from receiving treatment in cases where another doctor cannot be found to carry out the procedure.<\/p><p>  The expert group report suggests that statistics are required to inform policy, as well as to ensure the principles and requirements of the system are upheld.  These statistics should be freely available to the public and civil society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000030#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacinta Fay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357826400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fay.

This position is rooted in an analysis of gender equality and women's human rights.<\/p><p>  Recently, the NWCI led an online campaign to legislate for the X case.  Some committee members will be aware that more than 72,000 e-mails were sent to Deputies  in every constituency by more than16,000 women and men.  We have the support of our membership in calling for the provision of abortion in certain circumstances, particularly where a woman has a life-threatening pregnancy, including the risk of suicide.  This support has also been reflected in recent opinion polls, which reveal that 85% of the population supports abortion where the woman's life is threatened, including by suicide.  Irish laws are clearly out of step with public opinion and the time has come to introduce legislation as a matter of urgency to provide access to abortion services in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Our role is to give voice to the experiences of women who remain largely voiceless in this debate due to the stigma surrounding abortion in Ireland and to support women's access to reproductive health.<\/p><p>  The legislation must immediately repeal sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which criminalises abortion in all circumstances.  As the European Court of Human Rights observed in its judgment, the criminal provisions of the Act constitute a significant chilling factor for women and doctors in the medical consultation process regardless of whether prosecutions have been made.  As the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health stated during his visit to Ireland last month, criminal laws and other legal restrictions disempower women who may be deterred from taking steps to protect their health for fear of stigmatisation and to avoid liability.<\/p><p>  Our members have reported to us that women accessing counselling services on their options in crisis pregnancy situations are terrified of the possibility of going to jail and feel like criminals.  Even in accessing lawful information services, they believed that they may have been doing something criminal.  It is unacceptable that an outdated and archaic law makes women feel this way.  It is our opinion that abortion must be decriminalised if legislation and the regulation approach is to be accessible and effective and to remove the shame, stigma and discrimination that women must endure as a result of these criminal provisions.<\/p><p>  Second, the NWCI advocates that the legislation must provide for regulations that allow for a practical assessment by doctors and women of a real and substantial risk to the life of the pregnant woman.  It must also provide for an accessible review framework to examine or resolve differences of opinion between a woman and her doctor or doctors.  The legislation and regulation must place a duty of care on health service providers to ensure that women receive appropriate information and care, including post abortion.<\/p><p>  The regulations must place a woman's right to reproductive autonomy at the heart of all procedures and services.  This autonomy is reflected in the expert group's report in the chapter on the general principles that should apply to the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  It can be achieved by ensuring that the proposed regulations, procedures and services created by them undergo a gender mainstreaming process so that they are gender sensitive to the particular needs of women and respect the capacity of each woman to make decisions concerning her own reproductive health.  The gender mainstreaming of health policy planning and service delivery is a firm commitment by the Government under the national women's strategy, which will continue until 2016.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, it is important that all reproductive health services be physically and financially accessible to all women without discrimination.  Over the years, our members have communicated to us the lack of agency that women feel while accessing reproductive services.  It is crucial that women be active participants in terms of their reproductive health in conjunction with their doctors.<\/p><p>  The legislation and subsequent regulations must cover the threat of suicide as a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  There are cases in which the risk of suicide would constitute grounds for abortion and women must be viewed and trusted as individuals having agency who are capable of making considered decisions about their reproductive health.  Proper and fair medical assessment procedures should be in place to assess whether the risk of suicide constitutes a real and substantial risk, as provided for in the X case.  It is insulting to women and people with mental health difficulties for groups to claim that women would be likely to fabricate suicidal tendencies in an effort to seek access to abortion in Ireland.  The legislation and regulations should reflect the fact that there have been and will continue to be cases in which crisis pregnancies trigger, or aggravate, existing mental health conditions.<\/p><p>  As a matter of urgency, the NWCI asks the Government to implement legislative measures that will decriminalise abortion, cover the situation of life-threatening pregnancies, including the risk of suicide, and place women's reproductive autonomy at the heart of all procedures and services.  In these discussions, it is also important to acknowledge that introducing legislation to give effect to the X case will make Ireland's abortion laws and practices some of the most restrictive globally.  For many of our members, particularly women who have had abortions as a result of fatal foetal abnormalities or rape, this legislation will not provide an answer.  For the more than 4,000 women who travel to the UK and beyond ever year, Irish law will still provide no support or resolution.<\/p><p>  The NWCI believes that achieving access to safe and legal abortion is critical.  Women must be in a position to make personal decisions about their bodies and health care free from coercion, discrimination and threat of incarceration.  Legislation to give effect to the X case is the urgent and outstanding issue and the NWCI urges the introduction of such legislation early this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000031#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357827000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Action on X welcomes this opportunity to make a presentation to the Joint Committee on Health and Children and to contribute to this public discussion on the issue of legislating for abortion in Ireland.  This is, in many respects, a historic event, not least for those of us who have been seeking to achieve reproductive integrity autonomy and choice for women in Ireland since the late 1970s.<\/p><p>  Formed in 2011, Action on X is an alliance of groups and individuals, including Irish Choice Network, Choice Ireland, Irish Feminist Network, Feminist Open Forum and others, who call on the Irish Government to act immediately to implement appropriate legislation on the right to abortion in Ireland.  I will now outline the current views of Action on X on the issue of abortion.<\/p><p>  With its colleagues from Choice Ireland and the National Women's Council, Action on X calls for immediate repeal of sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which criminalises doctors performing abortions and women who have them.  Action on X agrees with the view of the European Court of Human Rights and Dr. Rhona Mahony of the National Maternity Hospital that the chilling effect of the 1861 Act is a significant impediment for women.  We believe there is no good reason this punitive law cannot be repealed without further discussion or delay.  To those who have said in this Chamber that there is no need to repeal sections 58 and 59 of the 1861 Act because no criminal charges are ever brought I would say, &quot;all the more reason to delete these obsolete and redundant but still chilling clauses&quot;.<\/p><p>  Next month marks the 21st anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in the X case, interpreting Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as permitting abortion where pregnancy poses a real and substantial risk to the life of a woman.  Following the fourth expert group report on abortion in Ireland, Action on X welcomes the Government's decision to introduce legislation combined with regulation to implement the X case ruling.  We welcome this decision as a necessary step required by the Constitution and also so as to ensure our compliance with the European Court of Human Rights ruling in the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland case and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, we are strongly opposed to any dilution of the already restrictive terms of the Supreme Court ruling in the X case and would emphasise that the new legislation must fully acknowledge that a risk of suicide due to unwanted pregnancy as determined by health professionals is grounds for abortion in Ireland.  Action on X has been surprised of late by the readiness of some organisations to question or dismiss the Supreme Court ruling in X.  Since when has it become acceptable in this country to dismiss, disregard or seek to tamper with the rulings of our Supreme Court or to ignore our duties and responsibilities under international law and human rights instruments?  <\/p><p>  Action on X is also of the view that legislation must make clear that preservation of the woman's life is prioritised in any clinical assessment on the need for a termination.  It must acknowledge that while Article 40.3.3&deg; requires that a risk to life be real and substantial, such risk to life does not have to be inevitable or immediate, as set out in the X case ruling.  As regards implementing legislation quickly as a minimum basis for abortion law in this country, the framework for such legislation already exists in Deputy Clare Daly's Medical Treatment (Termination of Pregnancy in Case of Risk to Life of Pregnant Woman) Bill 2012.  As such there is no excuse for further procrastination and beating about the bush in this regard.  <\/p><p>  In framing a law within the confines of Article 40.3.3&deg;, we would ask legislators to acknowledge the real life truth that abortion is an every day fact of life for women in Ireland.  More than 4,000 women and girls go every year to Britain and beyond for abortions.  They do so because they cannot have an abortion here and for many different reasons.  All of these women make valid and often difficult choices.  Some choose abortion because to continue the pregnancy would damage their physical or mental health or, possibly, endanger or shorten their lives.  Others do so because they have become pregnant following rape or incest or because of a lethal fatal abnormality.  I regret the group, Terminations for Medical Reasons, was not invited to make a presentation to the joint committee.<\/p><p>  Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution is the source of inequality of access to medical treatment between women and men, as noted by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, during the November 2012 debate on Deputy Clare Daly's Bill when he stated that legally, women are denied access to certain treatments such as abortion to protect their health whereas men face no legal denials to any treatment.  This inequality is particularly acute for women who do not have the money or are too ill to travel abroad for an abortion.  For these women, permanent damage to health or avoidable shortening of life may be the outcome.  We believe this discrimination must end and call for an acceptance that risks to health are as equally valid grounds for abortion as are risks to the life of a woman, as recognised by the Labour Party in its pre-election promise of legislation is this domain.  The blunt reality is that the restrictive terms of the X case ruling would exclude the large majority of women who leave Ireland for an abortion abroad.  Action on X, therefore, calls for the repeal of the demonstrably unworkable Article 40.3.3&deg; and for appropriate legislation to end inequality and meet women's actual needs.<\/p><p>  Action on X supports the right of a woman to unfettered choice on whether to continue a pregnancy.  We strenuously object to claims that the floodgates will open and that there will be an explosion of abortion in Ireland.  We can predict with considerable accuracy that in the region of 4,000 to 5,000 women will seek abortions in Ireland annually.  This would not be an explosion but consistent with our true abortion rate and comparable rates in many other countries.  The difference would be that at last we would as a country be honest about the realities of women's reproductive lives, choices and needs.  The change in culture feared by some previous contributors to these hearings has already taken place.  During the past 30 years public opinion on abortion has changed profoundly.  The RED C poll conducted at the end of 2012 revealed that more than 80% of the population now believe that abortion should be available to a woman where continuing a pregnancy would damage her health or would threaten her life and that 36% believe a woman should have the right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy.  It has also been revealed in polls that the authority of the Catholic Church has significantly declined, some would say plummeted, during this period.  For example, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>  Ipsos-MRBI poll of June 2012 indicates that only 34% of Catholics attend mass at least once a week while the Contemporary Catholic Perspective survey of February 2012 reveals that 75% of the respondents do not believe that the teachings of the Catholic Church on sexuality are relevant to them or their families.  Ireland is not only constitutionally but, it would appear, socially a manifestly secular democracy.<\/p><p>  With these issues in mind, the public support for increased access to abortion for the women and girls who travel abroad for terminations for medical reasons to preserve their health or prolong their lives and the unequal access to medical treatments between women and men, the view of Action on X is that the new legislation must make access to abortion a real rather than theoretical right.  I will finish with a quote from former President Mary Robinson following the Supreme Court ruling in the X case in 1992.  When speaking about the deep crisis within ourselves she said: &quot; I hope we have the courage, which we have not always had, to face up to and to look squarely and to say this is a problem we have got to resolve.&quot;  Action on X shares the hope of former President Robinson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000032#FF00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Ailbhe Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1357827000,"counter":458,"content":"<p>We now move to questions from members of the joint committee, in respect of which 60 minutes has been allocated.

Many of the questions over the past three days have been repetitious.  I have tried to find something different in each of the contributions and I believe I have found one or two matters on which the witnesses might elaborate.  In Choice Ireland's recommendations, No. 3.1 refers to qualifications of doctors involved in the process.  Choice Ireland recommends \"that medical practitioners eligible for specialist registration, but not actually registered, be allowed to make determinations regarding risk to life.\"  Will the representative elaborate on that and explain why she believes the 18,000 medical practitioners registered with the Medical Council are insufficient to provide the service in all the situations that could present?  What does she believe can be achieved by those who are not eligible?  There was an interesting witness before the committee yesterday who is a practising barrister.  He is also entitled to be a registered member on the Medical Council register.  Is it suggested that he would have the opportunity to make such a determination?<\/p><p>  I thank the National Women's Council of Ireland for its presentation.  It highlights a very important point.  Much of what we are addressing is in the area of equality and fairness.  The representative said it is important that all services are physically accessible, which many have addressed, and financially accessible, which the representative uniquely pointed out.  This is an unequal society.  The publication of the Health Service Executive service plan today has signalled that there will be 40,000 fewer people with medical cards this year.  How does the National Women's Council of Ireland suggest that there will be equality of access to whatever range of treatments and supports that women might require?<\/p><p>  Finally, Deputy Kelleher already raised the phraseology relating to the immediate repeal of sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.  Surely they must also require replacement.  We cannot have a vacuum or void whereby illegal abortions in a changed situation would be allowed to take place unchallenged and without appropriate sanction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000033#GG00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1357827600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and their submissions.

Will the witnesses clarify if their groups support the expert group report's recommendation of legislation and regulation as the preferable procedure?  There has been a suggestion with regard to suicide that women would manipulate their doctors.

Many of the questions I wished to ask have been asked by my colleagues.  However, perhaps the witness would elaborate on something from Choice Ireland's presentation.  It is the statistic quoted from the UK Department of Health statistics which suggests that over 4,000 women provided Irish addresses to UK clinics providing abortion services in 2011.  There was another flip-flop in this regard in the previous presentation.  We were told that a freedom of information request was sent to the Department of Health in England and it yielded the information that no Irish women were sent to abortion clinics.  I do not believe that to be the case but will the witnesses elaborate on that?<\/p><p>  There is another issue which I thank the witnesses for bringing into the public discourse through their presentation.  It is the suggestion from the Irish Medicines Board that many Irish women terminate their pregnancy by ordering a concoction of medication over the Internet.  The Government must face up to that.

We are talking about the X case and where there is a risk to the life of a woman.  The number of cases involved is small and in our view it will not help the vast majority of women who are travelling to Britain.  We absolutely recognise that and it is why we think that while the legislation is urgent, we must take our heads out of the sand about abortion in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Much of the discussion has related to suicide but we must remember that was the basis of the X case.  In some ways, there is no choice about including it or not, it must be done because that is what the judgment stated.  Deputy Healy asked about the manipulation of doctors.  Even since these hearings started, and before in the campaign run by the women's council, one of the things that has come across is that women must be trusted and the medical profession must be trusted.  From our perspective, and from the stories we have been told by women, thinking about having an abortion and going to have one is a very difficult decision; it is surrounded with difficulty and stigma, as is mental health.  The notion that women will suddenly want to do this is appalling and it is insulting to women.<\/p><p>  Post-abortion care has come up with our members and with those women who have contacted us.  A huge problem around post-abortion care is that for so many women, they do not want to admit to having an abortion.  They do not tell their families or friends; often they only tell the person who is travelling with them.  Accessing services is a real difficulty and part of that relates to the removal of the stigma and the decriminalisation of this area.  We must create a completely different environment around abortion so women can go and seek help and seek post-abortive care, even in terms of the services as they currently exist.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about services being financially accessible.  This is an important point and it was raised by Mr. Anand Grover, the UN rapporteur on the right to health.  Following the legislation and regulation, the Government must then provide within the universal health care plans and service plans within the HSE that economic hardship does not act as a barrier.  This must be given consideration.<\/p><p>  The National Women's Council absolutely supports the recommendation in the report of the expert group for legislation and regulation.<\/p><p>  Deputy Conway asked about women accessing medication over the Internet.  This issue was raised by CEDAW, it is very important and it goes back to the wider issue about fear and stigma about seeking help.  Some of our members have told us about the fear that exists about even seeking information about travelling.  That is a constant issue.  Part of the reason that is happening is because women do not feel comfortable about travel or their own situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000034#HH00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357828200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>The best way to ensure there would be no back-street abortions and that there would be sanctions against those who try to provide such services would be to legislate for safe abortion services in this country.  At the end of the day, that is the reasonable answer to Deputy Kelleher's question and it is important we keep on making this point.  We have been saved to an extent from the excesses of the problems of back-street abortions by having the escape route to Britain for at least those women who could afford it.  We cannot, however, and should not in all honesty as a society continue to do this.  This is a shameful exercise we are embarked upon so we must legislate for safe, legal abortion in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000034#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ailbhe Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357828800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Regarding legislation for the X case, as my colleague, Ms Ailbhe Smyth has outlined, not only do we have the 1992 Supreme Court ruling in the X case but we also had a referendum in 1992 and a further referendum in 2002.  In both referenda the electorate had the opportunity to exclude suicide as grounds for an abortion in Ireland and in both cases they refused to do so.  Not only do we have a Supreme Court ruling but we also have the results of two referenda that support this ruling.  What we have never had is an opportunity to vote for a more liberal abortion regime in Ireland, and opinion polls in the past two decades show that increasing numbers of people support a much more liberal abortion regime in Ireland.<\/p><p>  On the question of back-street abortion in Ireland, we are fortunate in some regard to at least have access for those women who can obtain the necessary finances to travel abroad to Britain and to other European countries.  There is some access to abortion for those women but we do not know how many women are unable to travel for various financial, family and other difficult reasons.  We do know that in jurisdictions where abortion is illegal and where there are not other legal alternatives, women will resort to back-street abortion.  We have seen in recent years, as outlined by my colleagues in Choice Ireland, that increasing numbers of women are accessing the Internet to obtain abortion pills.<\/p><p>  Tightening up of laws and regulations will not prevent desperate women seeking desperate solutions.  The only way to be sure that we can avoid the horrific scenario of unsafe back-street abortions is to legislate for free, safe and legal abortion.  That is why when we talk about this legislation we have to see it as just the first step in providing abortion rights for women because there is a danger that we will have X case legislation and we can all say that is over for another decade or until the next woman finds herself dragged through the Irish legal system.

We would have one of the most restrictive abortion regimes in the world.  In all likelihood, if a woman does not believe she can have an abortion under these narrow circumstances, she will travel abroad to have one.  Therefore, it is fairly likely that the same number of women will be going abroad to seek abortions as are going now.  I do not foresee a very considerable change.<\/p><p>  With regard to the register of doctors, our point was that many doctors would have expertise, but perhaps in a hospital with no relevant consultancy post.  Therefore, they might have relevant expertise but might not be on the register.  It may be the case in smaller hospitals that may not have as wide pool of experts as exists in bigger ones.  It is a case of having as much access as possible.  This was our recommendation.<\/p><p>  The decrease in the number of teenage pregnancies and the number travelling to seek an abortion is reflected in increased access to information, contraception and sex education.  We must realise that the only real solution and means of decreasing the number opting for an abortion is access to free contraception and sex education, and free safe and legal abortion in this country.  That is really the only solution.<\/p><p>  With regard to aftercare, we have already discussed how many general practitioners have said women did not go to their doctor on time or seek aftercare because of the stigma associated with abortion.

While the number of women who have abortions in Ireland may be small by comparison with the number who travel to have an abortion - the latter amount to over 4,000 - the legislation is critical if just one woman's life is at risk.  This is very important.<\/p><p>  Decriminalisation is important, as is the message it sends out.  It would have a ripple effect, open up the discussion on abortion and make women feel more comfortable having that discussion and in seeking post-abortive care.  While a small number may be affected, the legislation to be introduced is really important.<\/p><p>  On the question on the decrease in the number of women travelling, my answer is similar to that of my colleague.  The answer concerns the availability of services, including counselling services, which are really important.  It is critical that as many supports as possible be in place to assist a woman in making a decision that is right for her.  Part of the approach involves changing attitudes to remove the stigma currently attached to abortion in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000036#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357829400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>With regard to possible changes in practice, I agree very much with Ms Orla O'Connor.  The legislation is obviously extremely important, not least in that it will provide some clarity and reassurance to medical practitioners.  For that reason alone, it is crucial.  It sends a signal and serves as recognition that abortions can, should be and are carried out in this country and that women need them.  When considering changes in Ireland over the past ten or 12 years, one will note it is true that the number of women and girls going to Britain has been decreasing.  Fortunately, the number of teenage pregnancies is also decreasing.  However, we must bear in mind that abortion will need to be availed of by women for some time into the foreseeable future.  Therefore, we need to provide for it.  The best way we can do so is by maintaining and developing our investment in health education and promotion in regard to sexuality, reproduction and relationships.<\/p><p>  The investment that the health service has made in seeking to combat the spread of AIDS in Ireland has really been very effective and successful.  While it would be quite wrong to state there is no longer any problem in this area, health promotion and education, which have been undertaken both in educational settings and communities, particularly the LGBT community, have been very effective.  We have models for the education, promotion and awareness process that can be drawn on very readily.  However, this requires the commitment of resources and a commitment to really addressing the problem to seek to ensure we can reduce, as far as is humanly possible, the need for any woman to have an abortion.<\/p><p>  However, given the cases I have mentioned very briefly in my presentation - cases in which the abortion of a wanted pregnancy is required or desired for medical reasons, such as the tragic circumstances associated with fatal foetal abnormality, which will not be covered by the X case legislation - we really need to address the matter in this State matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000036#KK00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ailbhe Smyth"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357829400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Let me address the question of counselling.  One barrier to access to post-abortion counselling is that abortion is criminalised in this State.  Many women are aware that when they travel abroad to have an abortion or use the abortion pill, they are, in effect, doing something that is criminalised.  This adds to the certain fear and stigma that might result in a reduction in the number of women who seek post-abortion counselling.  Not every woman needs post-abortion counselling, however, as some women are quite happy with the decision they have made and believe it was right and valid for them.<\/p><p>  The problem faced by women who do feel the need is compounded by the fact that there is such a considerable social stigma associated with abortion in the State.  The services need to be regulated and expanded.  One realises the need for regulation is very clear when one considers counselling for women before they travel abroad.  I refer to crisis pregnancy counselling.  Choice Ireland has done excellent work on revealing some of the so-called crisis pregnancy counselling services that bully or attempt to shame women when they choose to have an abortion.  There are sometimes problems and confusion in that some counselling services may offer information on adoption and keeping the child but not on abortion.  Sometimes it is not actually clear what services are available.  Some women have experienced very distressing circumstances in that they found themselves bullied and attacked over their decision to have an abortion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000036#KK00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1357830000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I welcome the panel.

It is absolutely vital that we look at the woman holistically.  We must not just look at her medical condition but her social, family and relationship contexts, including her emotional and mental health.

To start with Senator Healy Eames's questions, I suppose the first thing to say - I said this at the start of my presentation - is that I come here from the National Women's Council which, as 160 member organisations, represents thousands of women.  In fact, as Senator Bacik stated, others in the room are also part of the women's council as members of the women's groups of political parties, which are members of the National Women's Council.  What I started off to say, because it is really important, is that this issue of abortion has been discussed for over 30 years in the National Women's Council and there have been motions that really reflected the different perspectives and the difficult experiences around abortion.  Coming here today to talk about this, I feel there is a very strong mandate from women and from women's organisations, and it is backed up by the opinion polls.  That is important to say.<\/p><p>  The issue of suicide came up.  My key response to that - Ms Smyth also said it in reference to Action on X - is to ask in what other area of policy do we decide to ditch Supreme Court rulings because we do not like them.  That is what Attorney General <i>v<\/i>. X and others was about.  It allowed for suicide, and the committee members, as legislators, have to go forward with that.<\/p><p>  Some of the other wider questions also related to suicide.  There has been clear testimony from the medical professionals at these hearings, similar to what we have been saying, about why it is important to decriminalise certain types of termination and why it is important to include suicide, and we concur with this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000038#MM01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1357830600,"counter":527,"content":"<p>On the question of whether Choice Ireland was happy that Ireland would retain a restrictive abortion regime, it is not, and neither is the National Women's Council, nor Action on X, but neither, perhaps more tellingly, are 82% of those questioned in the recent Red C poll.  Some 82% of voters supported a constitutional amendment to extend the right to abortion to all cases where the health of the mother is seriously threatened and also to cases of rape.  I will come back to the point made a little while ago by my colleague, Ms Kennedy, which is that we have never really had an opportunity since 1983 to answer a direct question about having more progressive abortion legislation in this country through a referendum.  Increasingly I am of the view that I do not like referendums any more than anybody else here does, but they are very useful in democracies.  In fact, they are important in democracies.  Furthermore, they help legislatures to know what people are thinking in democracies.  I would have thought that, given the amount of conflict, trouble, divisiveness, controversy, bad feeling and all kinds of things that we have had on the issue of abortion over 30 years - I remember extremely well every one of those issues, as do others in the Chamber today - it is about time a sensible practical question was put to the people of this country and that we got a clear answer, at least for the next decade.<\/p><p>  On Senator Bacik's question on fatal foetal abnormalities, obviously I am thinking of the case of D <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, which went to the European Court of Human Rights.  While that case was deemed to be inadmissible in that court because not all of the remedies had been exhausted in the courts in Ireland, at the same time it was apparently agreed that the Government had an argument in its defence that it would have been possible to interpret Article 40.3.3&deg; as permitting terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, and the ECHR agreed with that point.  Therefore, there is something there which is very important to the lives of perhaps not very many women, but it is absolutely crucial to those lives, and it does require exploring.  Perhaps that might be one of the points raised by the committee in its report to the Legislature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000038#MM01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ailbhe Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1357830600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>There are a number of speakers and I will take them all together.

It has done and continues to do an excellent job of giving women in this country a platform and space where our views can be expressed.  It is not the case that we always have the same point of view but the National Women's Council has always worked extremely hard to make sense of the views expressed by the many women in Ireland who see the council as their representative organ in the State.

I am very pleased to be here to bring the public hearings on the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in A, B and C<i> v.<\/i> Ireland to a close.  I commend the Oireachtas Members and invited guests for the balanced and dignified approach we have witnessed over the last three days.  In particular, I thank the Chairman, the clerk of the committee, Paul Kelly, and the committee staff, Mary Lindsay and Colm Duffy, for organising and facilitating these public hearings.  We have followed the hearings closely and have found the presentations and insights very useful and thought-provoking.  I am confident the submissions and the report of the committee on foot of them will greatly assist me and my officials in examining the issues involved in the implementation of the judgment and in formulating a legislative response which will bear public and parliamentary scrutiny.<\/p><p>  Last December, the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in A, B and C<i> v.<\/i>  Ireland by way of legislation and regulation within the parameters of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case.  It agreed also to make appropriate amendments to the criminal law.  The aim of the legislation will be to regulate access to lawful terminations in accordance with the Supreme Court judgment in the X case and to provide for the drafting of regulations to deal with relevant operational and procedural matters.  The advantage of this regime is that the key principles in the primary legislation will be open to the democratic scrutiny of the Houses of the Oireachtas while the regulations will be open to amendment where necessary to address, for example, changes in clinical practice and scientific advances.  Now that we have heard the views of medical and legal expert as well as those with a keen interest in the issue, I will, pending receipt of the committee's report, instruct my officials to start developing policy proposals for the legislation.<\/p><p>  Much work remains to be done to examine and evaluate possible avenues for the assessment of an entitlement to lawful termination of pregnancy in Ireland and for the delivery of medical treatment.  As the exert group indicated, various options exist on the number, roles and qualifications of the doctors who will be involved in decisions as well as on the locations where terminations would take place.  The issue of providing for conscientious objection must also be carefully considered.  In addition, proposals will require to be formulated on the establishment of a formal framework to review an initial clinical decision.  This is one of the main requirements emanating from the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland judgment.  I reiterate to the committee that the only purpose of the legislation will be to clarify what is lawfully available by way of treatment in cases where there is a real and substantial threat to the life of a pregnant woman and to set out clearly defined, specific circumstances in which this treatment can lawfully be provided.  It is clear that much work remains to be done by the Department of Health to give effect to the policy requirements to implement the ECHR judgment through a new legislative framework.  The procedural options are complex given the technical medical, legal, ethical and health-service organisational implications.<\/p><p>  I look forward to receiving the report of the committee.  Once my officials have completed their preparatory work and the heads of Bill have been developed, the Department will engage further with the committee.  I thank the Chairman and all who have participated in these public hearings for their invaluable contribution and assistance to me and my officials in the complex work that lies ahead of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000041#PP00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1357832400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I record my party's appreciation of the Chairman's efforts in chairing the committee over the last three days.  The hearings have been informative and have been carried out in a respectful way.  That there are divergent, strongly held, passionate views on the matter is evident from the testimony of witnesses and comments of Members of the Oireachtas.  While we box people into pro-life and pro-choice positions, there is a substantial middle ground which is sometimes voiceless in debates.  We should be very conscious of the many people who are not affiliated with any political party or organisation and who want clarity on the complex points at issue in respect of the strictly confined interpretation of Article 40.3.3&deg; set out in the X case judgment.  Clearly, a great deal of work remains to be done before we see the legislation, its content and the regulations which result.  The heads of the Bill will be brought before the committee and broader discussions will later take place on the legislation itself.<\/p><p>  We speak about language, which is of critical importance in this debate.  It is important primarily because up to 130,000 Irish women have gone abroad for a termination of pregnancy.  Whatever side of the argument one is on, one should be mindful that strong language can be very offensive.  They are our mothers, sisters and neighbours and we should be conscious of that.  Equally, we should be entitled to put forward forcefully our point of view without fear or favour, while being respectful.  I compliment the Chairman, clerk and support staff of the committee and thank the Seanad for offering its fine room to us for the hearing.

This was an example of how committees should be run within the confines of this building and I put that down to the good chairmanship of Deputy Buttimer and to the participation of all the committee members.  Sometimes we do not have the opportunity to thank the staff and this is an occasion on which we should thank them for their prompt responses to anything that came in to be read and especially for making sure that we were all on time because we are not always on time.<\/p><p>  People have been watching the meetings on television, including members of my family who say I should get my hair dyed.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness said there are people who are for and against this legislation and there are the people in the middle, and they are the ones who have been watching us.  Young women and mothers have watched this debate because this is a very important issue for all mothers and for all young women.  It is a sad reflection on society that it has taken us so long to get to where we are today.  Most of all this is an opportunity to build a better society for everybody.  I see the past couple of days as the first steps.  We are beginning to change many things in politics and legislation.

The feedback from outside the House has been that these meetings have been conducted very well and professionally.

He and I had a conversation prior to this and I thank him and the members of the committee for the opportunity given to those of us on both sides of the divide, who have deeply held genuine convictions on this fundamental question of life, to participate in the hearings.  I thank the Chairman and committee members personally too.  I pay tribute to and thank the witness groups who came in over the past three days.

It was obvious too that the Members had done considerable homework which stood out in the quality of the questions.<\/p><p>  Despite the process having been rushed, which was not the Chairman&rsquo;s fault or that of the committee but was imposed on them, we have garnered much useful and good information from the witnesses.

The psychiatrists were unanimous, including those who are pro-choice, that abortion is never a treatment for suicidal ideation.<\/p><p>  Obstetricians are looking for legal protection because they feel exposed.  One said they could be jailed which is probably unlikely but they are entitled to say that.  Some are concerned that legislation could in some way impact negatively on their ability to provide an effective service to mothers.  I appeal to the Chairman, and he said this morning that the committee will consider this, to give these people the opportunity to be heard.  Without our views being presented there is no way that the hearings can be described as fair and balanced.

Over the past three days we have discussed the issues which require consideration in the drafting of the heads of a Bill following the decision of the Government to accept the expert group's suggestion that the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in respect of A, B and C <i>v.<\/i> Ireland be addressed by putting in place legislation with regulation within the framework of Ireland's current constitutional position, as stated in Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  Over the course of our hearings, we have heard from medical and legal experts who have outlined a range of issues for further consideration.  Today, we heard from representatives of religious groups and an atheist group, as well as from a range of advocacy groups, which have outlined their positions.  Our meetings have enabled us to elicit much information on current medical practice, thereby allowing us all to become fully informed and aware of how current medical guidelines and practices are implemented.<\/p><p>  As has been stated, this issue has been a very vexed question in Irish society for more than 30 years.  Throughout our communities, there are sincerely-held views across a wide range of opinions and at times during previous discourse and debates, they have become very heated.  However, over the past three days, these joint committee hearings in this Chamber have been conducted in a calm, tolerant and respectful way.  This shows that even on this deeply sensitive issue, it is possible to engage in a manner that is measured and which facilitates a nuanced discussion.  Our constructive and positive engagement has only been possible because of the approach taken by the witnesses and Members of Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, who have contributed significantly to our hearings.  I thank you all for attending the joint committee and for your time, helpful contributions and thorough preparations.  To my Oireachtas colleagues, both members and non-members of this joint committee, I very much appreciate the way in which you all have discussed the issue and raised your own concerns.  This has contributed to demonstrating that the political system can engage in a mature way on the most difficult of issues.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Clerk of the Seanad for allowing us to hold our hearings in the very fitting Chamber of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>  I am very conscious that over a three-day period, it was not possible to invite each of the many groups and individuals who would have wished to have made an oral presentation and submission to the joint committee.  Members of the joint committee, as well as other Members of the Oireachtas, made suggestions as to who should be invited to our hearings and all suggestions were considered by the joint committee before members agreed on who to invite.  In deciding on who to invite, the joint committee attempted to ensure there was a fair and balanced expression of views, as well as guaranteeing it heard from experts, both academic and practising, from the legal and medical fields and from religious and advocacy groups.  In particular, I thank the members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children for their help and assistance in the running of these hearings.  As a committee, we have worked well together, putting aside partisan politics, as well as parking our differences of opinion on this issue.  I pay tribute in particular to Deputies Kelleher and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, as the representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, and to Deputy Healy and Senator van Turnhout on behalf of the Independent Members, for their tremendous co-operation, assistance and work in the joint committee.  I also pay tribute to members of the Fine Gael and Labour parties.  I greatly appreciate their contributions and in acknowledging the decision of the Government, their assistance in the organisation of our hearings and the way in which they have engaged have greatly assisted our efforts.  I hope your respective parties will be very proud of your contribution over the past three days, as well as over the past month in organising these hearings.<\/p><p>  The organisation of these hearings has only been possible because of the immense effort of the committee secretariat.  I thank the clerk to the committee, as well as Mary Lindsay and Colin Duffy, for their enormous contribution of work.  They have undertaken this work during the Christmas holidays and have been at work on it both at midnight and at 6.30 a.m.  They have answered promptly, courteously and efficiently, are dedicated and are an example of how public service works in this country.  Now that our hearings are completed, I also wish to pay tribute to the staff from the wider committee secretariat who have supported our clerk, Colm and Mary for the duration of our hearings.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the efforts of the Superintendent of the House, the Captain of the Guard and a very co-operative team of ushers, who have made the transition to this Chamber very easy and who have been very helpful to members throughout.  I also thank the staff of the Debates Office and the broadcasting and communications units, as well as our sound engineers, Ken Lane, Jordan Breslin and all the others.  In addition, I thank the staff of the Library and Research Service and the office of the parliamentary legal adviser, who will continue to be of assistance to the joint committee as it prepares its report.  Finally, I thank all the witnesses who have attended over the past three days and who have made the decision to hold these hearings very worthwhile.<\/p><p>  Now that members have concluded their hearings, the joint committee will reconvene next week.  At that meeting, members will commence the process of preparing a report for the Government.  Its report will be a summation of the information members have gathered from all the witnesses who have given evidence and will include written submissions the joint committee has received.  On its completion, the joint committee will submit the report to the Government for its information and use when drafting the head of the Bill.  I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, for appearing before the joint committee this afternoon and for his restatement of the important role of these hearings in the legislative process.  As a committee, members welcome his confirmation that the joint committee will be used again as a source of information when drafting the head of the Bill and hopefully as part of the debate on Committee Stage.  I again thank everyone sincerely for their participation in our series of constructive hearings over the past three days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013011000043#RR00200","speaker":"989"}]
