The issue of the North-South interconnector is one which I, and other Senators and Deputies, have raised over the past number of years.  The North-South interconnector planning application by EirGrid is poised to have a huge detrimental impact all across the north-east area.  It is a project that carries major public concerns, as the Minister is aware.  This is evidenced by the large number of objections that have been received by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The people of Cavan, Monaghan and Meath have made their position very clear on the North-South interconnector and how the construction of over 400 pylons carrying 400,000 volts of electricity should be abandoned in favour of undergrounding.  Through the north-east pylon pressure campaign, Monaghan anti-pylon committee, and other community organisations, the people of these areas have found their voice.  With that voice they have said a resounding \"No\" to high-voltage overhead power lines supported by pylons running through their communities, beside their houses, and through their lands.  The concerns of these people are very real and should be addressed by the Government and EirGrid.  There are genuine worries for health, the environment, the landscape, the economic development of the areas concerned, and many more.  The people and communities concerned have outlined their position over a number of years and that position is that this should be undergrounded.  Report after report, including one published by the Government-appointed International expert commission, has proved that undergrounding of the power lines is both possible and feasible.  Indeed, many argue that in the medium to long-term, it is economically beneficial to underground this connector.<\/p> <p>I raise this Commencement matter today because of the recently launched &euro;42 billion capital plan, which includes &euro;5.75 billion specifically related to energy infrastructure.  One of the key projects that is earmarked for delivery by the Government is the North-South interconnector.  Is the capital funding commitment for the North-South interconnector contained in the capital programme Building for Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021 dependent on the project proceeding over ground or will the project still be funded under the programme if it is delivered in an alternative way, that is through undergrounding?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kathryn Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2355\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2355&amp;amp;pid=KathrynReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Will the Minister advise on some of the following issues?  How much funding has been allocated for the project?  What are the conditions associated with it?  Does he believe there was a failure by EirGrid to consider the undergrounding option or does he believe it could be considered as a viable alternative?  Will there be a commitment to explore that option further?  Following this, could there be a commitment to fund that option?<br\/><br\/>I take the opportunity to highlight once again the following points of relevance, given the level of concern among communities in the north east, namely, counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath.  Communities across the north east have voiced their full support for the project if it is to be constructed using modern underground cable technology<b><\/b>systems.  EirGrid has conceded that undergrounding is feasible and reliable, with dramatically reduced costs than the company had originally claimed.  However, it has persisted in refusing to even examine a site-specific underground route option and instead has routed the overhead lines and pylons across the most densely populated areas of the affected counties.<br\/><br\/>I wish to be very clear: there is more certainty that delivery of the project would happen sooner if it were to be undergrounded than if there was an to be attempt to proceed with the overground option.  Overgrounding will result in nothing but confrontation, conflict and, ultimately, failure.  In essence, there will be total opposition.  There will be blockades by landowners and communities should that option be proceeded with.  It is important to say this because that is the resounding message I have received from the communities concerned and which I wish to convey to the Minister.  Communities across the north east believe they are being discriminated against by EirGrid and the Government.  The undergrounding analysis made for Grid West and Grid Link was never afforded to the North-South interconnector project.  Subsequently, we heard about the decision relating to Grid West not to proceed with the use of pylons because of the use of new technologies.  Are we to ignore the realities of technologies when considering the North-South interconnector?  EirGrid conceded at a recent Oireachtas joint committee hearing that although HVDC undergrounding was feasible, it had never been examined specifically along roads in the case of the North-South interconnector.  Will the Minister ask EirGrid to perhaps withdraw its application until such time as a proper objective analysis of undergrounding has been carried out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#A00600","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The 400kV North-South interconnection project which is part of EirGrid's Grid25 plan to upgrade the national transmission system between now and 2025 is a critical and strategically urgent transmission reinforcement.

Due to the need for a second planning application, the scheduled feedback and consultation period has been ongoing for double the time planned for projects of similar scale such as Grid West or Grid Link.  Given the extended public consultation and feedback stage of the project, the public has been afforded good opportunities for feedback.<\/p> <p>The project was designated an energy project of common interest, PCI, by the European Commission in October 2013, having been deemed by the Commission to be of strategic, transboundary importance.

EirGrid made a formal planning application for the project to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 9 June 2015.  A further consultative process subsequently opened to interested parties under section 182A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.

As the Senator is aware, the project has a long history.  From as far back as 2007, there have been a number of processes involving and providing for consultation.  When my predecessor, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, held this ministerial portfolio, he set up an expert panel to advise and to report to him and subsequently to me on EirGrid's proposals.  EirGrid has reported to me on both Grid West and Grid Link.  The panel was also asked to examine the North-South interconnector and apply itself to the question the Senator asked, namely, what methodologies were employed by EirGrid in assessing the viability or otherwise of undergrounding and overgrounding of the North-South interconnector.  The expert panel was satisfied that the methodologies applied by EirGrid to the North-South interconnector were as robust as those employed in the case of Grid Link and Grid West.  They are matters that have been addressed and on which there has been considerable consultation.  I accept that there are concerns about the North-South interconnector with respect to some of the areas through which it is proposed that the interconnector would run, but I cannot emphasise sufficiently - the Senator did not refer to this - the critical importance of the project for the provision of a safe and secure electricity supply both here and in the North.

Cromwell was defending the Rump Parliament, with which he was associated in London, he and his generals and troops came to Ireland, to County Clare.  One of his generals was famously quoted as saying on the Burren that there was not enough \"water to drown a man, nor a tree to hang him, nor soil enough to bury him.\"  He was saying, in effect, \"Let us get out of here.\"  The reason I have tabled this Commencement matter is that there is barely enough soil to bury a man.  The fact is Clare is a limestone county, with concentrations spreading from Ballyvaughan to Doolin and the Cliffs of Moher to parts of the east and west of the county.  There is a solid limestone base which can become Moher flag and other strong rock.  As such, it is very difficult for grave diggers to dig.  <\/p><p>I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the 1888 Act which governs the digging of graves and which was amended in 1929 merits re-examination.  The eight feet depth requirement is causing much distress for undertakers in County Clare and particularly families when seeking a new plot on which to inter a loved one.  At a depth of about five feet grave diggers hit concrete and literally specialised machinery is needed to reach a deptj of eight feet.  I understand Clare County Council is considering the by-laws, as the issue is causing much distress.  All of the undertakers in the county have made strong representations on the need to have it addressed, but the county council can only do so much.  As the Minister of State is aware, by-laws are governed by national legislation; therefore, the scope to act is limited.  If the Minister of State was to give a commitment that the Government would look at amending legislation to loosen the eight foot rule, that would be helpful.  Obviously, where a depth of eight feet can be reached, that is the desirable outcome, but where it cannot, there is a need for significant flexibility to facilitate burials in graveyards in which families wish to have loved ones buried.  Given her background, the Minister of State will understand the importance of burial grounds to communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#B00600","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very sensitive issue.  Coming from a rural background, I am aware that there are traditions at burial grounds that can sometimes fall foul of rules and regulations.  It is terrible if a family have to endure this at a time of distress.  It would be prudent to look at the matter to see where difficulties are being caused.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it allows me an opportunity to outline the regulations governing burial grounds.  As he has pointed out, the primary legislation dealing with the management and regulation of burial grounds by local authorities is the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, as amended by the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948 and, more recently, the Local Government Act 1994.  Legislative provision is also made in the Rules for the Regulation of Burial Grounds 1888, as amended.<\/p> <p>While the primary legislation provides the broad legal framework for burial grounds, more specific matters relating to the management of burial grounds, including the depth of burial plots, are provided for in the burial ground regulations which require each grave, when opened for the first interment, be sunk generally to a depth of at least eight feet.  This depth is considered necessary to protect public health, while also allowing for more than one interment in a particular burial plot.  In certain circumstances, however, for example, where the nature of the ground does not permit a grave to be sunk to the minimum depth, it may be sunk to a lesser depth.  This is a matter for the consideration of the local authority in consultation with the Health Service Executive which must certify that the depth is sufficient for the protection of public health.  More than one interment in such plots is prohibited.<\/p> <p>Concern has been raised recently in some areas about the depth of burial plots, notwithstanding the fact that the relevant regulations have been in effect for more than 100 years.  In particular, concerns have been raised on health and safety grounds, with suggestions the regulations are inconsistent with more recent health and safety legislation.  In the first instance, all workplaces are subject to safety, health and welfare at work legislation.  They include local authority graveyards.  Second, it is possible to comply with both the burial ground regulations and the relevant health and safety legislation.  In this regard, the Health and Safety Authority, in conjunction with local authorities, has developed a safe system of work plan for employers and employees working in graveyards.<\/p> <p>While the application of the system is a matter for each local authority, it can be applied through local authorities' own health and safety procedures and policies.  For example, Cork County Council has issued a policy on occupational safety, health and welfare in respect of works in local authority owned graveyards.  It covers, among other things, the excavation of graves.  It provides that graves must be machine excavated in all save exceptional circumstances, but it also sets out procedures to deal with situations where, for example, in older rural graveyards excavation by machine is not possible.  Accordingly, it is not considered necessary to amend the existing burial ground regulations.  In the first instance, local authorities have sufficient scope to apply the regulations practically to deal with atypical circumstances as they arise and, second, it is possible to implement the regulations in a manner consistent with health and safety legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#C00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I wish to ask a short supplementary question.

In particular, I acknowledge the provision of &euro;5.3 million for a further 260 Garda vehicles and the &euro;60 million Garda building and refurbishment programme that has been put in place.  I also acknowledge the reopening of the Garda training college in Templemore, the 550 new garda&iacute; who will graduate this year and the 600 who will graduate next year.  That is all great and shows the Minister, her Department and the Garda are serious about tackling crime.  However, coming from a rural area in County Kerry, as do I, the Minister of State will be aware of the fear in people's hearts.  It is not so much crime but the fear of crime that is getting to people.  I have to hand some figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, from 2014.  As they are somewhat older, I am aware the levels probably have reduced since 2014.  These figures show 420 crimes per month were reported on farms nationwide for the first six months of 2014.  Within that figure, there were 1,720 cases of farm machinery theft reported, as well as 218 vehicle thefts, 280 cases of non-aggravated burglaries, 261 thefts of diesel, 48 thefts of livestock, six thefts from persons and one case of aggravated burglary.  While these are figures affecting the farming community, it does not stop there but moves throughout the community.<\/p><p>In the past, a grant was forthcoming from the Department of Social Protection for security locks, panic alarms and help for security for the elderly.  However, the reason I brought forward this matter is while some people can afford to install electronic gates and security alarms, very many people cannot and no price can be put on a person's peace of mind.  Only last Monday evening, I met a man who told me he was six months from the age of 70 and takes a shotgun to bed with him.  The Minister of State should note this is an example from County Kerry.  He takes the shotgun to bed with him every night but nobody should be obliged to live like that or to be obliged to live in fear that he or she will be broken into or that something will happen.  If people had security alarms in place, it would give them a little peace of mind.  They will not stop burglaries, because these criminals are well able to deal with burglar alarms and security alarms, but at least it might deter them.  Moreover, it would give people living in houses some peace to know the alarm is in place and will go off if someone tries to enter the property and will link up with the Garda station.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the reason and logic behind the closure of Garda stations but as the Minister of State is aware, the actual presence of a Garda station with a garda meant a great deal to people living in rural Ireland.  When that has been taken away, they believe something has been taken from them despite the possibility a Garda patrol vehicle may be patrolling the area.  Nevertheless, they consider that the presence of a Garda station and the presence of a garda during the day, for however long that may have been, was a deterrent to burglars and crime of any sort.  The possibility of some form of grant aid towards the cost of installing security alarms people should be considered.  This could be means tested and restricted to those with an annual income of less than &euro;45,000 or &euro;50,000 perhaps.  It would be of help and while I acknowledge not everybody still would be able to afford it, it would go some way towards helping people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#C00700","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets she cannot be present due to other official commitments.  She is grateful to the Senator for raising this important matter in the Seanad today.  At the outset, the Minister has asked me to state she is highly conscious of the distress which burglary and similar crime can cause to householders, as well as the broader impact the fear of crime can have in communities.  In this regard, she is very much in sympathy with the Senator's intention of supporting law-abiding householders.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, the Minister initiated a broad and urgent review of our approach to burglary crime.  An important fact arising from the Minister's review was that a large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by a particular cohort of serial offenders.  The clear view which emerged was that a new strategy to counteract these criminals should focus on two key objectives, namely, strengthening the law to get tougher on serial and repeat offenders and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively.  The Minister is now implementing this strategy and has introduced the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, which is aimed at those repeat burglars who have previous convictions and are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  The new Bill will require the District Court to provide for consecutive jail sentences where a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences and will allow courts to refuse ball for offenders who have a previous conviction for domestic burglary coupled with two or more pending charges.  This Bill, which is expected to be enacted in the next few weeks, will go a long way towards giving the courts the power to ensure that repeat burglars are kept off the streets.<\/p> <p>Of course legislation on its own is not enough and the Minister is in ongoing contact with the Commissioner to ensure the available Garda resources are used as effectively as possible.  The Minister is prioritising the allocation of resources to enable the Commissioner to enhance the Garda operational response, in particular through the 550 new recruits being taken in to the Garda College this year, with a further 600 new recruits to commence training next year.  Thus far, 295 new garda&iacute; have been attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are now working in communities nationwide.  This probably is the most tangible way the Government can demonstrate its commitment to providing people with the reassurance that comes from a visible and determined police force.  The Minister also is ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary vehicles and technology to respond to the highly mobile gangs behind much burglary offending.  Having secured additional funding, she now anticipates that a total of 630 new Garda vehicles will have come on stream during 2015.  Furthermore, the capital plan for 2016-21 provides &euro;205 million for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, as well as investment in new technology and information systems.  Such measures are of course additional to the extensive community policing and crime prevention measures which are implemented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na countrywide.  These include the work of Garda crime prevention officers and support for more than 3,900 community alert and neighbourhood watch groups, as well as the successful Garda text alert scheme, which is available in every Garda division and now has more than 130,000 subscribers.<\/p> <p>In the context of the extensive investment under way and taking into account the Minister's ongoing discussions with the Commissioner and the heads of the other justice agencies, she is of the view that a generalised grant scheme for domestic alarms would not be the best use of the available resources to help protect communities from burglary crime.  Instead, a focus is to be placed on working with communities and organisations to engage the community in preventing crime.  To this end, the Minister recently has announced a doubling in the funding for both the community alert and the Crimestoppers schemes.  Crime prevention measures at the level of individual households and businesses are extremely important, of course, and excellent advice is available from the Garda on the range of steps that can be taken to protect property.  In terms of determining how best to allocate resources, however, the Minister considers that greater impact will be achieved for everyone in the community through the measures she is putting in place.  The Minister hopes the Senator nevertheless will accept the increased resources which now are coming on stream represent a significant investment by the Government in enhanced policing and community safety in all areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#D00200","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and of course accept it would be a huge cost on the Exchequer.

In regard to County Kerry, generally speaking there is great co-operation there between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local community.  Given the current reduced number of garda&iacute; in the force, everybody must become the eyes and ears of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Irrespective of Garda numbers it is impossible to prevent people carrying out burglaries if that is what they want to do.  A classic example in this regard is the burglary of the home of the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, while there was a Garda stationed at his front door.  If people want to rob houses they will do so.  One cannot have a garda at every crossroads in the country.  As such, everybody must be vigilant.  If I am out late at night and I see a suspicious vehicle I report it to the local Garda station.  People who are suspicious of the activities of other persons or who see a person in a place where he or she not be are duty bound to report that to their local Garda station.<\/p> <p>Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaging with and providing advice to community groups on these issues, which is a very good approach.  If we want to prevent rural crime and burglaries we have to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand, although I do not have the statistics with me, that while the level of rural crime has increased in some counties it has decreased in others.  I again thank the Senator for raising this important matter and I will pass on her views to the Minister.  <\/p> <p>I take this opportunity to mention also two initiatives that come within the remit of the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, namely, the senior alert scheme under which grant assistance is available for personal monitored alarms for older persons of limited means and the recently announced funding under the rural development programme 2014-20 to support the provision of CCTV in rural areas.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, is also mindful of the interest in community CCTV schemes, particularly in rural communities, and has recently instigated a review of their effectiveness in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  The outcome of that review will inform future decisions on the continuation of the scheme.  The Minister has asked me to emphasise that while she agrees that we must do all we can to protect people from crime the measures outlined represent the best deployment of Government resources to support community safety.  The Minister is working closely with the Garda Commissioner on finalisation of details for an enhanced operational response to burglaries and related crimes and expects to be in a position to make further announcements in this regard shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#E00200","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, to the House.  However, I am disappointed that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, is not here to respond to this matter.  I appreciate I am lucky that a Minister of the experience and expertise of Deputy Deenihan is here and will be well able to answer any questions I have in relation to this matter.  Given, coincidentally, the theme of this matter is similar to that of the previous one I am sure much of the Minister's response to it will be a repeat of his earlier reply.<\/p> <p>I am specifically interested in hearing from the Minister whether the Government is considering reintroducing the community-based CCTV scheme which commenced under a previous Government in 2005 and ended in 2008 or 2009 but proved to be hugely successful.  The aim of this initiative was to support local communities, increase public safety and reduce the risk of anti-social and criminal activity.  I have seen this initiative in action, via the community-funded CCTV scheme in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, which has been in operation since 2008.  As a member of the police committee in County Leitrim I attended a meeting at which Garda from the Sligo and Leitrim divisions reiterated their strong support for the CCTV scheme.  They also outlined, as had already been outlined to me by the Manorhamilton community group, that the effectiveness of the community CCTV scheme was unparalleled.  As a result of that scheme, which is closely monitored, the Garda had apprehended many culprits.  In one particular instance, a person in respect of whom the Garda were in pursuit was picked up on the CCTV system.  There are three roads leading out of Manorhamilton, any which one of which the alleged suspect could have taken, but because of the existence of the cameras the Garda were able to focus on the road he did take and he was apprehended.  That is only one of many examples in this regard.  <\/p> <p>I am, therefore, strongly of the view - I have discussed this bilaterally with the Minister - that this initiative should be reintroduced.  The Minister referred in his previous reply to a reduction in rural crime.  However, as he and everybody else here will be well aware, perception can sometimes overrule reality.  Media attention focused on stories about rural crime puts the fear of God into people such that they believe there are criminals outside their doors waiting to steal from them and goodness knows what else.  This does not in any way under-estimate the horrific nature of some of these crimes, the most recent being that carried out in Tipperary, the thugs responsible for which were finally apprehended.  As far as I am concerned they will not spend long enough in prison: they should never be released.  However, that is another issue.<\/p> <p>I believe the community CCTV scheme was effective.  The problem is that towns and villages do not have the resources to implement such a scheme without Government support.  I understand the local business community in Carrick-on-Shannon, which has been crying out for some time for a CCTV scheme, has come together to fund a CCTV scheme, which I hope will be up and running in the not too distant future.  It should not be left to communities to fund their own schemes.  There are areas where this will not be possible without financial aid.  In light of the Minister's earlier reply regarding the comprehensive nature of the approach being taken by the Government to addressing crime, particularly rural crime, this is a no-brainer.  Regardless of the financial or other difficulties being experienced, the Government needs to prioritise this issue and that highlighted earlier by my colleague Senator Moloney.  It is vital the Government finds the money to address these specific issues.  Like me, the Minister comes from a rural part of the country and as such he knows how fearful people are and to whom they are looking to have these issues addressed.  Regardless of the colour of the Government, it is to it and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the people look for protection.  It is, therefore, vital that this scheme be reintroduced as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#E00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Again, the Minister apologies for not being here to take this commencement matter tabled by Senator Mooney.  She has asked me to thank the Senator for raising it.<\/p> <p>CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention and as an aid to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access, such as town centres, fall into two categories, namely, Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems.  Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of the identified operational needs and priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Two rounds of funding were advertised under that scheme and a total of &euro;3.76 million was allocated to fund 43 community schemes.  The last of that funding was paid out in July 2013.  The Minister is very conscious of the value that communities, especially rural communities, place on CCTV and with this in mind has instigated a review of the effectiveness of the community CCTV scheme in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  The outcome of that review will inform future decisions on the continuation of the scheme.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, has recently made an announcement in regard to the provision of CCTV in rural areas, which is to be funded from the rural development programme 2014-2020.  CCTV schemes certainly have a part to play in the detection of antisocial behaviour and criminality, but of paramount importance is a visible and responsive policing service.  There is no doubt but that the Government is determined to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.  The Minister has secured an allocation of a further &euro;5.3 million to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purchase of a further 260 vehicles between now and the end of the year.  This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government's capital plan 2016-21, which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the lifetime of the plan.  This substantial level of investment will be accompanied by the ongoing recruitment of new garda&iacute;, with 600 to be recruited next year on top of the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#E00400","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and wish to focus on a particular part of it.

He then referred to the fact that: \"the Government is determined to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities\".  I have already outlined an example of where the CCTV scheme worked in Manorhamilton, where it was a strong and effective aid to the Garda.  There is no doubt among the Garda or the community that without its presence, the culprit would have got away with his crime.  The problem is resources.  For example, at the recent police meeting, we were informed of the figures the Minister of State has mentioned here in regard to the additional new garda&iacute; coming on stream.  Five of these will be allocated to Sligo, but none to Leitrim, which is a predominantly rural county.  The reason is that the five garda&iacute; will be on probation for some time and must go to a centre that has the facilities and structures in place to monitor their progress and help them become more effective as garda&iacute;.  However, in the context of the 550 additional garda&iacute; this is not much help to the people of County Leitrim.<\/p> <p>I hope that as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and as a rurally based Deputy, Deputy Deenihan will put pressure on Government colleagues to ensure that rural areas where Garda stations have been closed down will get what the Minister of State has said they will get, a visible and responsive policing service.

The more CCTV we have, the more crime will be detected and the greater the deterrent to crime.  The Minister is determined to ensure that those on the front line in the fight against crime have the legislation and resources to fight it effectively.  Her approach is focused on two key objectives, namely, strengthening the law to make it tougher on serious and repeat offenders, principally through the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015, which is before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively through the significantly enhanced Garda resources the Government is making available.<\/p> <p>The substantial level of investment by the Government in the Garda fleet and ICT, accompanied by the continued renewal of Garda personnel, with 600 new garda&iacute; to be recruited next year over and above the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year, will ensure that the Garda has the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of highly mobile criminal gangs and to disrupt crime, particularly burglaries, across both rural and urban communities.  <\/p> <p>Due to the level of interest from representatives of all political parties in this issue, there is serious willingness and motivation to take on the problem of rural crime.

I am sure he will agree that a smart man makes a mistake, learns from it and never makes it again, but a wise man finds a smart man and learns not to make the same mistake.  I am sure the Government could not be accused of doing either.  In the newspapers today we see that 500 people who had been disqualified from driving were involved in accidents that resulted in injury and, in some cases, tragically, death.  All of these deaths could have been prevented if the Government had allowed smart policing and the police force to have the equipment and the wherewithal needed to enforce the law.  We have seen gangs travelling around the country and terrorising communities, yet their members are out on bail and the Garda does not know where they are.  If we were to provide for smart policing, it would allow the Garda to know where criminals were at all times.  Believe it or not, section 102 of the Criminal Justice Act allows for the tagging of those charged with serious offences who are out on bail awaiting trial  However, but it has not been commenced and thus is not available to the Garda.  I am sure Members will be aware that 62% of those released from prison reoffend and that 80% of offences are carried out within the first 12 months.  It would cost &euro;6.45 a day to smart-tag somebody while out on bail or early release; it costs &euro;264 a day to keep someone in jail.  One does not have to smart or a wise man like Senator Paul Coghlan to know that this would be smart government.  If a person electronically tagged were to be stopped at a Garda checkpoint, a garda could check using a smartphone and would be able to take the appropriate action.  If section 102 of the Criminal Justice Act had been commenced, the 500 incidences in which injuries and deaths occurred might have been prevented.  I am calling for a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the reason that section is not in use, given that it would allow those currently on bail and awaiting trial and those on early release to be smart-tagged.  Why does the Garda not know where they are at all times?  If they were to commit an offence, the Garda would have the evidence to show that they were in the said location at the time.  Given what we read in the newspapers today, the 500 drivers in question should be smart-tagged.

Professor Ronan Lyons in TCD has estimated that 90% of the population will require a housing subsidy in order to live in a new two-bedroom apartment in Dublin.  I sat with Senators O'Keeffe, MacSharry and Michael D'Arcy on the banking inquiry.  I do not see any ideas coming from that source, from either the financial community or the construction community.

The estimate for Tralee and Ballincollig, both of which the Acting Leader would be acquainted with, is that it would cost &euro;40 million to replace almost 200 beds, which is a figure based on costings for those greenfield sites.  A reserve price of &euro;40 million should be put on Baggot Street Hospital because that is what it will cost us to put 200 new beds into the system.

As a further contribution to the debate, this morning we all received a document from the Irish League of Credit Unions.  It has substantial resources available and would like to contribute to alleviating the housing crisis.  The ILCU has proposed that the Government should examine how it could use the league's significant resources in an off-balance sheet way through the establishment of a special purpose vehicle to fund the development of social housing.  The proposal is worthy of a debate in this House.  We are trying to address a significant housing crisis and I welcome the provision of 500 modular housing units announced yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  We have a very large hill to climb so every contribution and source of funding should be looked at.

The programme contains a number of elements, including public private partnerships to deliver new Garda stations in key areas, including Galway city.  There will be essential remedial works done to existing stations and there will be an upgrading of cells and provision of improved custody management facilities.  This will have an impact on 30 facilities around the country.  <\/p> <p>I am particularly pleased that Ballinasloe Garda station has been earmarked for station refurbishment and custody management facilities, a move which is long overdue.  I recently visited the station and was appalled at its primitive conditions.  As well as poor working conditions for the garda&iacute;, there is little privacy for the general public who wish to conduct routine business at the station.  The custody management facilities were atrocious, with only one holding cell meeting health and safety requirements.  Such facilities are totally inadequate for a busy urban station that covers a large divisional area.  If people want garda&iacute; to work effectively and efficiently, then they must be provided with the appropriate facilities and resources.  I am pleased that the Government will make significant investments.  This forms part of a major plan that is being put in place, including the recruitment of additional garda&iacute; and the provision of extra resources for patrol cars.  I welcome the announcement made by the Government this week which will effectively deal with the very serious criminal elements that roam the countryside.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#H00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Will the Acting Leader arrange an urgent debate on the persecution of Christians worldwide which has reached genocidal proportions?

The failure to reach a satisfactory outcome over a proposed temporary halting site at Rockville Drive for the bereaved Traveller families is deeply disappointing.  Travellers are citizens with rights but those rights are being denied to them.  On Tuesday, in the D&aacute;il, my party leader, Deputy Gerry Adams, called on the Taoiseach to intervene directly in the Traveller issue and to establish as a matter of urgency a State-wide forum involving Travellers, political parties, Government, local authorities, the health and education sectors and media organisations to make recommendations on how this major issue of inequality facing our society can be addressed.  The Taoiseach refused claiming existing structures are sufficient.  We support the call by Pavee Point for a dedicated Traveller agency to co-ordinate and, where appropriate,  enforce Government policy affecting Travellers.  I urge the Government, as a first practical step towards new and effective positive policies for Travellers, to implement the recommendations of the April 2014 report on Traveller ethnicity by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  In particular, the Government should recognise formally the distinct ethnicity of the Traveller community, as promised.<\/p> <p>I visited a number of halting sites over the weekend.

It is galling to hear some of the Senators on the Government side talking about these issues when we see all the cuts to funding for Traveller initiatives which have been brought in over recent years.  Funding for Traveller education has been cut by 86% and funding for Traveller accommodation cut by 85%.  Funding for equality projects for Travellers has been cut by 77%.

Some 30 years later, figures have recently emerged that show we have an 11,000% increase in the number of people on waiting lists for inpatient or day-care treatment for more than 18 months and some 13,000 individuals have been waiting more than 18 months for an outpatient appointment.

I emigrated in 1985, the year of Marty McFly.  Thankfully, I came back.  Two thirds of my classmates in medical school emigrated and most of them did not come back.  Figures released in the past few days show that, in addition to being the largest exporter of doctors in the world, Ireland is also the largest importer of doctors.  At the same time, we have the highest number of medical schools per head of population.  If anybody here can make sense of it, will he or she, please, explain it to me?  What I can say is we need to have either a debate in this House or perhaps a public consultation forum on the issue of medical manpower and the structure of medical careers.  The only way we can get to grips with this 30 or 50-year festering problem is to recognise that we churn out large numbers of Irish doctors who then expect to find an adequate number of training positions as junior doctors, but, in many cases, as they are not available, they leave.  On the other hand, we have a health bureaucracy that wants them to stay here, not because it wants to train them but because it wants them to continue as cheap labour as opposed to appointing them to appropriate career level positions.  There is an urgent need for us to tackle these issues.  <\/p><p>I wish to parenthetically drop in one quick side message.  Tomorrow is the 40th anniversary of the death of the only doctor to die in the Northern Ireland conflict - Professor Gordon Hamilton Fairley.  His family will be holding a private service tomorrow.  They have been great champions of the peace process since their husband and father was murdered on a street in London in an IRA bombing in which Caroline Kennedy was very nearly killed.  He was a founder of cancer immune and would have been very happy to have seen it advance.  <\/p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 51, Seanad Reform Bill, be taken before No. 2.  There is clearly a large number of Bills on the Order Paper that will never see the light of day during the current Oireachtas.  It is ludicrous that Members go to the effort of writing Bills to try to improve the Statute Book knowing that not only will they not be passed but that they will also never be debated and either accepted or rejected by the system.  I ask the Acting Leader that, instead of having endless motions and statements, we make this the first Oireachtas in the history of our republic to clear the Order Paper.  I am sure those of us who have Bills pending will be anxious to them either accepted or rejected.  It is my intention between now and then to make sure they are given the light of day.  Two of them are mine and at least one is in the name of Senator Geargal Quinn.  There are other Bills which have been tabled by the Opposition or Government sides.  I am making the proposal that we amend the Order of Business to take the Seanad Reform Bill today, particularly on Back to the Future Day when we think that it was in 1979 when a referendum was held to amend the Constitution to reform the Seanad.

Money will solve some of the problems, but there is a societal issue at play which we must embrace and on which there is a need for a national debate.  There may be a percentage of Travellers who have caused difficulties, but all Travellers should not be put in that category.  It is something on which we in this House should give a lead and about which we should have a discussion which should include the issues of homelessness and housing.  Local authorities throughout the country are waiting for money to buy houses currently available, but they cannot access the resources they need from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government because of hindering conditions which are slowing the process.

I know many Senators spoke about this yesterday but, unfortunately, I was not in a position to be here yesterday.  As we are on the eve of marking 1916 when we commemorate those great leaders of that era who sacrificed their own lives so that we might enjoy freedom and be able to live in an independent State which we all value, it is imperative that those who pretend to stand for those great leaders&rsquo; particular values would reflect carefully as well.

I also called for a resumption of the programme started by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government in 2005 for the provision of CCTV cameras in towns and villages but which was ended by this Government in 2013.  This is vitally important in light of the fear and apprehension now felt by people in rural communities across Ireland about crime, burglaries and attacks on property and persons.  Will the acting Leader convey to the Minister for Justice and Equality the importance of ensuring proper resources provided for the Garda, despite the spin the Government is putting out that it is providing more resources?<\/p> <p>What astonished me in the reply I received was that it stated, \"CCTV schemes certainly have a part to play in the detection of anti-social behaviour and criminality but of paramount importance is a visible and responsive policing service\".  From living in County Leitrim, there are serious questions asked about the Government&rsquo;s commitment in that regard.  At the most recent meeting of the Leitrim policing committee, the Garda conceded that of the new Garda recruits coming from the much-lauded increased recruitment presented by the Government, only five will be assigned to the Sligo-Leitrim division.  And where will the five be based?  They will be based in Sligo town with none of them based in County Leitrim.<\/p> <p>I also asked if any of the high-speed Garda vehicles to be introduced by the Government in the next few months would be located in rural areas such as Leitrim where they are needed.  I appreciate there is a need to have such vehicles chasing these thugs and criminals using our motorway system and welcome this development.  All sides of the House will welcome any initiative and provision of resources which will help reduce crime and, particularly, the people&rsquo;s fear of rural crime in their communities.  The two agencies of the State which the people look to are the Government and the police force to protect them in their homes, to protect society and to ensure they are not going to be subjected to the vile brutality like we saw happen in Tipperary.  Will the Acting Leader convey to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the wider Government that it has to get its priorities right in this regard?  Although we have difficult economic circumstances, the Government seems to be giving the impression that it can throw money around like confetti at a wedding.  Let the Government put more money into Garda resources to fight crime, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#L00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I support Senator John Crown&rsquo;s request to deal with the Seanad Electoral Reform Bill 2013.

As he pointed out, it would cost very little money compared to what it would cost to hold them in the prison system.  As I have stated on several occasions, smarter policing is the way to go.  A good start to that would be the introduction of the number plate identification system across the country.  This system would tell whether a car is registered, taxed, insured and its NCT is up to date.  It would also make it easy to identify whether the plates were cloned, a car had been stolen or used by criminals for an illegal or attempted illegal act.  These are matters in which we can make progress on relatively quickly.

He suggested their ethnicity should be recognised and I agree totally.  Again, he is seeking a debate.<\/p><p>Senator Leyden referred to yesterday's passing of the Children First Bill.  He acknowledged the acceptance by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, of Senator van Turnhout's amendment which was unanimously agreed, cherishing all the children equally, particularly people with special needs.  He hopes it will be expedited through the other House.  Again, we will have a word with the Minister regarding that.<\/p><p>Senator Crown outlined very detailed health service considerations, including an 11,000% increase in the number of people on waiting lists.  He outlined a situation in St. Vincent's Hospital, with which he is very familiar naturally, which is jam-packed with trolleys.  We were exporting doctors and now we are importing them.  It is a huge festering problem.  There is an urgent need to tackle these issues.  I have no doubt he is right.  He also proposed an amendment to the Order of Business that we take No. 51, the Seanad Electoral Reform Bill 2013, before No. 2.  As I understand it, there is a Government implementation body and I am afraid I will not be able to accept the amendment.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill supported Senator Crown and agreed with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; about the persecution of Christians.  He referred to the Carrickmines situation and the ten lives lost.  He called for a national discussion on the Traveller situation.  He is right; I agree with him.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the technological universities raised by Senator O'Keeffe.  He also spoke about the coach, Billy Walsh, going to the United States.  He expressed praise for the comments in this House by Senator Eamonn Coghlan on the IABA.  I agree with him on that.<\/p><p>Senator Walsh agreed with Senator Leyden on the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement of children from the Statute Book following the passage of yesterday's Bill.  I have no doubt that what he said about the videos of abortion methods would be absolutely horrific.  I have not seen them, but I have no doubt that he is correct in that.  He mentioned the address of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, to the House of Commons.  He is obviously right.  These people are not republicans.  They are looking after themselves financially and are m&eacute; f&eacute;iners more than anything else.  I do not think there is any argument on that.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney spoke about crime and burglaries in particular.  He asked me to pursue a debate on justice and I certainly will do so.  He talked about the resources for the Garda and questioned the Government's commitment given that only five of the newly-appointed garda&iacute; will be deployed in Sligo and Leitrim and they will be based in Sligo.  He welcomed the high-speed vehicles and all the additional resources.  Again, we know there are budgetary constraints.<\/p><p>Senator Bradford supported the call regarding the Seanad reform Bill.<\/p><p>Senator Wilson echoed what Senator Daly said about criminals on our streets.

First, I compliment the Minister.  I am just back from London, where I received an award from the Foreign Office.  The ceremony was attended by various Ministers of the British Government and people like Ed Miliband and the former leader of the Scottish National Party.  The House will be glad to hear of the tremendous tributes paid to the Government and political parties here and to the Minister for the work that has been done on this issue.  People were quite enthusiastic about the referendum having been passed.<\/p> <p>On section 5, during Second Stage I spoke about degrees of relationship, affinity and so on and so forth and said it would not bother me if cousins married.  I mentioned the \"grotesque\" Irish media and, true to form, they took the bait and my office is now deluged with requests for me to go on air and to talk to the newspapers about this, apparently blissfully unaware that cousins can already marry.  I was not proposing incest or anything of that nature, but a big deal has been made of my comment on cousins marrying.  The Minister may not have realised this either, because she said she would look into the situation.  It is a fairly remote situation.<\/p> <p>When I was speaking, I was not promoting incest.  All I was saying was that it would not bother me if cousins married.  I was thinking of some of the remote regulations of the Anglican church, which forbade this in the past.  In addition, the marriage of cousins is not generally socially popular, but it is legal.  Therefore, I will not go on any radio station or talk to the newspapers on this issue.  It is all perfectly all right.  People can relax.  Cousins will be able and have been able to marry each other.  They have been able to marry each other for decades.  The media should grow up, get some sense and stop stirring up mares' nests.  I am not in favour of incest and never have been and I look forward to a debate on this interesting subject later.<\/p> <p>I am very happy with section 5 and any residual doubts I had have been clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#Q00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I was not here on Tuesday for Second Stage.

There are significant differences between the relationships of same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples.  The main difference is in regard to capacity to have children.  In that regard, blood ties matter and I understand why there would be prohibitions on relationships of consanguinity, because of the risk to children from the close blood tie relationship.  That does not arise in same-sex relationships.<\/p> <p>In regard to the difference in capacity - I put a query to the Minister previously, but she did not answer it during previous debates on the referendum - there are also issues in regard to the consummation of a marriage.

As I emphasised on Second Stage on Tuesday last, my amendment stems from my concern about the exemption that can and is being granted by the Circuit Court in Ireland to allow children under the age of 18 enter into marriage.  The Minister will be familiar with my concerns since they were the subject of a motion tabled by Senator Ivana Bacik and the Labour Party, and which I seconded, in June 2014.<\/p><p>The exemption to the ordinary legal age of 18 years for entry into a contract of marriage is provided through sections 31 and 33 of the Family Law Act 1995 and was more recently retained in section 2(2) of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  We know the exemption is being applied.  On the afternoon of our motion, the former Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, had advised the House that between 2004 and 2013, almost 400 parties to marriages in Ireland were under the age of 19.  More specifically, according to CSO data, kindly compiled by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service in advance of our debate, 28 marriages registered in Ireland in 2012 involved a bride or groom, or both, who were under the age of 18 years.  In 21 of these marriages, the bride was 16 or 17 years of age and the groom was 18 years or over.  In four of these marriages, the groom was 16 or 17 years and the bride was 18 years or over.  In the remaining three, both the bride and groom were 17 years, both children, entering into a legal contract of marriage.  I find this quite remarkable and entirely undesirable in the context of the State's duty to protect childhood.  <\/p><p>Deciding to marry is a very serious matter.  The obligations and responsibilities that arise from marriage are onerous.  It is ironic and seems inappropriate that we would trust children to make this decision when we prevent underage people from making other decisions, for example, unless a person is married, he or she must be 18 years or over in order to make a valid will.  One cannot enter into a civil partnership unless one is 18 years and there is no provision for any exceptions.<\/p><p>A person under the age of 18 also has limited capacity to a contract.  A contract with a person under the age of 18 cannot be enforced unless it is for necessary items that are needed for the child's basic sustenance as opposed to luxury items or is the beneficial contract of service.  Therefore, a child's capacity to enter into a simple contract or valid will is limited but yet we will allow a child under the age of 18 to take the equally, if not more, profound decision to marry.<\/p><p>Ireland is bound by a number of international human rights laws and standards, the provisions of which are completely incompatible with child marriage, for example, the International Bill of Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, CEDAW, the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the slave trade, and institutions and practices similar to slavery.  More recently, in September 2013, Ireland with its fellow EU member states supported the UN Human Rights Council resolution on strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriages, challenges, achievements, best practice and implementation gaps.  It is such a glaring contradiction that we in Ireland speak out against child marriage in countries such as India, Nigeria, Malawi, Iraq, Nepal, Ethiopia and Bangladesh while our Statute Book still allows exemptions to the normal marriage age which, worse still, fails to specify a minimum age for such an exemption.  <\/p><p>This is not just a question of child marriage.  The exemption also raises concerns around the scope for coercion and forced marriages of children here in Ireland, which again appears baffling when we consider our reaction to the horrific incidence of forced marriages internationally - we just need to think of Boko Haram.<\/p><p>Applications for exemptions are made to the Circuit Court in private.  Senator Bacik made an important point about this in the debate on her motion.  There is no public record of the application or the arguments put forward in support of the application.  There are no guidelines on the criteria for granting the exemption.  Rather, the standard language of section 33 gives the court wide discretion and, worryingly, there is no provision for minors to be legally represented at the hearing or for the HSE or the Child and Family Agency and child protection authorities to be notified.<\/p><p>Our motion specifically referenced the criticism levied by Mr. Justice McMenamin in the High Court in a judgment in June 2013 in a case concerning an arranged marriage.  The case concerned the annulment of a marriage between a 16 year old girl and a 29 year old man on the basis that the girl lacked capacity to give true consent in the first instance.  Mr. Justice McMenamin felt the case raised concerns of such magnitude that it warranted a general comment about the danger of the legal loophole for children.  He noted that in certain circumstances such marriage exemptions may give rise to significant child welfare issues and he queried whether the HSE should be put on notice of such applications in order to inquire into the protection and welfare circumstances of the child concerned.  As the Legislature we must provide guidance for the courts to implement the statutory provisions as they are intended or we can lead by example and remove the statutory provision currently allowing minors to marry.<\/p><p>When our motion was debated in June 2014 we were told that a small interdepartmental group would be established.  I have not heard anything about it since.  I appreciate the importance of today and the historic occasion that it is.  As we are in the last few months here, I have tabled this amendment because it is an issue that is close to my heart.  As I have said, I will not press the amendment but I wanted the issue to be raised and I wanted the Minister's officials to hear the reasons we must address this gap for children.  There is no lower age for this exemption, it is all done in the Circuit Court in private.  We must protect children.  Without representation, a decision can be made about their lives, a decision that we all take extremely seriously is what makes today so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#R00700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

The scope of the Bill is very specifically limited to removing the impediment to marriage of the parties being the same sex, to making provision on religious bodies and to amending other legislation to ensure that same-sex couples are treated equally.  It is not about that wider reform of the marriage law, although it is obviously about reform and restricting access to marriage for other categories of persons.

In 1984, homosexual behaviour, even between consenting male adults in private, was a criminal offence.  How could they possibly do so?  Around this time, a judge stopped a case in Dublin - divorce proceedings - because if the witness continued to give the evidence the judge imagined he would give, of homosexual practice, the judge would be required to refer a transcript of the proceedings to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That was the State.  In those conditions, how could any gay person possibly claim a pension?  It is utterly scandalous that a small cohort of people are being precluded.<\/p><p>There is precedent for this.  A number of years ago under the social welfare provisions, the PRSI scheme and so on, farmers' wives, who had been previously prohibited, were allowed to claim.  Retrospective legislation was enacted which gave them the right to claim it.  There is solid precedent there.  Not only that but there is precedent in many other jurisdictions.  There was a legal case before the supreme court of Massachusetts which raised this precise point and it decided that the pension regulations in America had to be changed.  In the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender public servants who enter into same-sex marriages are now allowed to change their single person pension to a spouse pension and to acquire a spouse pension based on all contributions made since 1988 and not since 2005, as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, incorrectly stated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The United States Government, the state authorities of Massachusetts and the United Kingdom Government are all doing this.

What is the estimated cost in that regard?  Why, in terms of the magnitude of the award, is this Government setting its face against giving justice to people in terms of their pensions, many of whom are elderly people who have been discriminated against throughout their lives and relationships by the operation of the criminal law until 1993 and who are now being denied proper pensions.  It is scandalous.  I cannot understand how a Government of this character could stand over such a situation.<br\/><br\/>A very distinguished former Member of this House, now a Member of the other House and Chairman of an important Oireachtas committee, Deputy Buttimer, has said that this displays complete intransigence.  He went on to say that in 1984 it was not even a remote possibility that a gay or lesbian person would ever be able to get married or enter into a civil partnership.  For gay men, relationships were criminalised.  In effect, giving them the option to join spouses and children's superannuation schemes made no sense.  They could also have been imprisoned for ten years if they made a claim under that scheme.  We should allow these people the option to revise their decision.<br\/><br\/>I do not believe that there is a huge cohort of heterosexual people who will take up this option.  However, if they too have been unjustly treated, why should money come into it?  This is a question of justice.  The argument made when equal pay for women and other reforming measures were proposed was that they would cost too much.  That is always the response of the Department of Finance.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is now showing equally niggardly attitudes in this matter.  I am appealing to the Minister to at this late stage follow the lead of her party colleague and give justice to a small number of elderly people.  As I said, there is precedent for this.

This amendment proposes to amend the Pensions Act 1990 to allow access to the complaints mechanism set out in the Act, as amended.  The context of this proposed amendment relates to certain circumstances in which people who have pensions do not have any associated survivor's benefit for a spouse or civil partner.  This arises in two main situations.  First, civil servants who were appointed on or before 31 August 1984 are members of what is termed the original spouses and children's superannuation scheme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That scheme does not permit benefits to be payable to a surviving spouse or civil partner where the marriage or civil partnership takes place after retirement.  Civil servants then serving were given an option in 1984 to become members of the revised scheme and many joined it at the time while others chose not to do so.  They retained a right to a refund of their contributions to the original scheme on retirement.  That facility is not available under the revised scheme.<\/p><p>The terms of certain pension schemes provide survivors benefits to spouses or civil partners on the death of the scheme member only if the scheme member had married or registered a civil partnership within a certain period before or after retirement.  In both situations, the limitations apply regardless of the sexual orientation of the civil or public servant of the scheme concerned.  However, certain representations have been made that those rules have a disproportionate effect on persons in same-sex relationships due to the unavailability to them of civil partnership, which is the point that is being made here, prior to 2011 or marriage until now.  There are ongoing legal issues in regard to this, so I do not wish to make over-extensive comment on it.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has given extensive consideration to the matter of access to the revised spouses' and children's scheme.  He has decided not to make a change at this point because it would not be possible to limit that access to a specific cohort.  The resulting impact on public service pension liabilities could be very significant.  In response to Senator Norris's question, I do not have the figures but the numbers are substantial.  At least 30,000 people did not opt into the revised scheme and many thousands never joined the scheme.  I do not have detailed figures on the costs, which would only be an estimate.<\/p><p>However, even if I were in a position to accept the amendment, I do not believe it would achieve the intended aim for the following reason.  The amendment would allow access past the usual six or 12 month period for the complaints mechanism in relation to pension schemes where there has been a \"material\" change in the rules of the pension scheme but the simple fact of the matter is that there has not been a material change in the pension schemes concerned.  I accept the Senator's point on constitutional change.  The material changes are to who may marry.  That is a critical change in terms of who will qualify for survivor's benefit but the crucial point is that it is not a change to the scheme.  The amendment would not give that hoped for access to the complaints mechanism, so I cannot accept it.<\/p><p>There were many reasons large numbers of people did not join the new spouses' and children's scheme.  It is beyond doubt that some chose not to join because they were homosexual and saw no reasonable prospect that a partner would benefit from a survivor's pension but that is by no means the only reason people did not opt in.  It is not even the only reason which is based on constitutional change because if one thinks about it, the introduction of divorce would have allowed some to marry, having never expected to be able to do so, and they were not given access to the revised scheme in the wake of that constitutional change either.  The points Senator Norris has made are very clear in terms of the constitutional changes that have come about and the connection to pension schemes.  However, it is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  He has considered the matter and taken a particular decision.<\/p><p>I accept the point made by Senator Darragh O'Brien.  I too have great sympathy for people who made what they clearly believed to be the best and most rational choice at the time.  In the circumstances, they thought it was the only choice they could make.  This is a matter for a wider discussion on pension schemes.  Although it does arise in the context of the constitutional change we are discussing today, I suggest that it would be appropriate to have discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and under the legislation relating to pensions generally because it has an impact in that regard.

As I stated on Second Stage, that decision is made and there is nothing in what I propose today that seeks to detract from or undermine that decision.  I accept that decision and that is the state of our law.  The definition we have of marriage in our country is changed and this legislation reflects that.  However, to recall what the Minister herself said on the Second Reading in the D&aacute;il on 23 September:<\/p><blockquote>Historically, many religious bodies in Ireland have carried out the civil aspects of marriage simultaneously with the religious aspects and this will continue to be the case.  It has always been the case that religious bodies have substantial discretion in choosing which marriages to solemnise in accordance with the tenets of their beliefs, and ... this will remain the case.  Nevertheless, it was considered important to make it absolutely explicit in the Marriage Bill that religious bodies will not be compelled to solemnise particular marriages as a consequence of the amendment of statutory provisions.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister's intention is clearly expressed there and it reflects the general tenor of what was stated around the time of the marriage referendum, that is, not only had people no objection to religious organisations continuing to maintain their own rules and their own definition of marriage for their own purposes but it also was well understood that there would not be or certainly should not be any obstacle to the role of religious organisations in solemnising marriage in its civil dimension in the context of weddings taking place in church and so on.<br\/><br\/>I have looked at this matter carefully and have sought and seen legal advice on it.  Moreover, the Presbyterian Church to my certain knowledge has been in contact with the Minister regarding its concerns about all of this.  It believes the legislation as drafted is flawed and would or certainly could be interpreted so as to create a doubt about the validity of marriage civilly witnessed within a religious setting by religious solemnisers.  This is because of the way in which the declarations required by the State of all solemnisers is being changed to a gender-neutral form.<br\/><br\/>I believe what has happened is the Minister has missed the goal, the goal being to leave untouched or to not interfere in any way with the role of religious solemnisers solemnising marriage in a civil context.  This problem is due to what I can only regard as problematic drafting.  What has happened here arises because the legislation focuses on the notion of a form of a ceremony, which is what the registrar, an t-Ard Chl&aacute;raitheoir, is required to approve and is the basis on which a religious solemniser is approved and put on the register or on which solemnisers could be cancelled from the register if they are not using a form of ceremony that is approved by the State.  It is this focus on the form of a ceremony that gives rise to the problem and the misunderstanding of the meaning of that rather technical and different word, &quot;include&quot;, appears to have contributed to a potential confusion in this regard which the Government must remedy.  It would be wrong not to do so because as legislators, my job and that of all Members is to scrutinise proposed legislation according to their best lights.<br\/><br\/>What has happened here is that as the Minister is aware, section 21 changes the declarations set out in the 2004 Act in section 51 and requires of anybody solemnising a marriage a declaration from the parties &ldquo;to the effect that each of them accepts the other as a husband, a wife or a spouse, as the case may be&rdquo;.  This is in circumstances where it previously was a case that the form required was there would be a declaration to the effect that people would &quot;accept each other as husband and wife&quot;.  It is interesting that in other sections of the legislation, one does not encounter this triple option of husband, wife and spouse.  One has the substitution of &quot;husband&quot; or &quot;wife&quot; by the gender-neutral term of &quot;spouse&quot;.  However, what is problematic in this regard is that the form now required is a declaration to the effect that the parties take each other as husband or wife or spouse, as the case may be.  Each of those terms must mean something different.  In the case of a same-sex couple, according to the new definition of marriage, one might reasonably have a situation of a husband taking a husband or a wife taking a wife.  The fact this triple distinction has been included here and the reference to &quot;as the case may be&quot;, suggests clearly there is an inclusivity intended of different options and scenarios, be they a husband-and-wife scenario or a same-sex scenario.<br\/><br\/>The problem is that the 2004 Act requires that any form of ceremony, whether it be a secular solemniser, a religious solemniser or a State ceremony, must include and be in no way inconsistent with the declaration.  However, the law, as amended, requires any form of ceremony to include and be in no way inconsistent with a declaration to the effect that parties take each other as husband, wife or spouse, as the case may be.  The problem is with the word &quot;include&quot; because this does not refer to a specific ceremony.  This is not about the marriage of Joe and Mary Bloggs or Joe Bloggs and Mary Bluggs but pertains to the form of ceremony which, in the Catholic context basically is the rite of marriage and which to my knowledge is not even established or provided for in Ireland, and really it applies to any religious organisation and might apply to a secular organisation.<br\/><br\/>Clearly however, if one considers the form of ceremony used, for example, by the Presbyterian Church, it talks about &quot;Do you, N, take N to be your wife?; do you, N, take N to be your husband?&quot;.  My point is the form of ceremony the Presbyterian Church uses refers exclusively to husband and wife.  The legislation, as amended, now requires that if religious organisations are to have their solemnisers included on the register and not cancelled therefrom, they must have a form of ceremony that includes a declaration to the effect that the parties take each other as husband, wife or spouse, as the case may be.  In other words, my contention is the Minister is placing a burden on the religious organisations involved to change their form of ceremony.  It is at least possible, it is a legitimate possible reading of this legislation that the Minister is doing this.  I do not believe the Minister intended to do this but it is a poorly drafted amendment in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The problem is that elsewhere, it is true, the Minister does her best to give guarantees to religious organisations that they will not be interfered with in their form of ceremony.  The Minister goes to great pains to provide that a religious solemniser shall not solemnise a marriage, except in accordance with a form of ceremony which is recognised by the religious body.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not that they do not have to.  It is that they may not solemnise except in accordance with a form of ceremony approved by their own religious body.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has gone even further by putting in a fail-safe provision that says that nothing in the legislation would require them to solemnise in a manner that is not in accordance with that approved by their religious body.  She has set up this protection that says to religious organisations involved in solemnising marriage civilly that one cannot use a form except one's own.  That provision only goes halfway because she has also set up a situation where, on the face of it, it looks like they must use a form which is different from what they currently use.  It is a bit like the Model T car where one could have any car one wanted as long as it was black.  One can only use one's religious organisation's form of ceremony but one also has to use one that meets the requirements of the State.  The requirements of the State are being changed in this legislation because the Minister is putting in a gender neutral form of wording that must be part of the declaration, one of the key declarations to be made by the parties to a marriage - husband or wife or a spouse, as the case may be.  That does not relate to the individual ceremony but to the form which is approved.  That sets up two potential problems.  There could be a doubt about future weddings and future marriages where it might be found that the form of ceremony in use by the religious organisation was not such as could have been approved under the new legislation.  The Minister has unnecessarily raised an issue about the validity, potentially, of marriages that have taken place.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has created the potential problem that an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, or the Registrar General, might feel under an obligation to put in issue the form of ceremony being used by religious organisations, either as a condition of solemnising or approving future solemnisers or even, potentially, cancelling the registration of existing solemnisers.  All of this has caused unnecessary confusion.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has been contacted about this by parties who are directly involved in solemnising marriages.  I would be grateful to hear from her to what extent she has engaged with their concerns.  Their concerns do not involve putting in issue the result of the referendum but simply involve maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>as regards their right to be involved in solemnising marriage in its civil dimension within the context of their ceremonies.  It is not a lot to ask to get that right and to put that issue beyond doubt which is more important, I would submit, than meeting a deadline today or any particular deadline.  We are not at the end of term, or at least I do not think we are, but one never knows with all the talk about the election, when it will happen or whether it will happen.  <br\/><br\/>What is the solution?  I could have drafted an amendment that baldly expressed the idea or requirement that religious organisations, or that certain organisations, would not be obliged, or would be free, to have ceremonies that were exclusively husband and wife and excluded same-sex couples.  Instead, I adopted a minimalist approach by proposing an amendment which simply provides that forms of ceremony currently in use shall not be put in issue as a result of this legislation.  I submit that it is a minimalist issue.  It is a tactfully put amendment because it simply seeks to ensure that there are no consequences for current solemnisers.  My amendment states:<\/p><blockquote>Nothing in subsection (3)(b) and subsection (4)(b) as amended shall be construed to prevent or invalidate the solemnisation of any marriage, or be construed so as to refuse to register or cancel the registration of any solemniser, on the ground that a form of ceremony in use by any registered solemniser, prior to the commencement of this Act, is no longer compatible.<\/blockquote><p>In other words, should it be found in the future that what this legislation means is that the forms of ceremony being used by religious organisations fall short of the requirements of the State because the State now requires that these forms must include a declaration that the parties take each other as husband, wife or spouse, as the case may be.  If that is construed as to mean that their form must be as broad and gender neutral as that, whatever happens in the individual ceremony being a separate matter, then we have a problem.  My amendment seeks to ensure that there is no doubt about the solemnisation of any marriage that has taken place and that there is no doubt about the status of a religious solemniser or a registered solemniser, as a result of the change in this legislation.<br\/><br\/>To further support the statement that I have taken a minimalist approach, I have not gone into the standing discretion which an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir has to approve or refuse a form of ceremony for use in the solemnisation of civil marriages.  People might have good reason to be concerned about what the future may hold in terms of how an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, with a particular political view, might behave <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>religious bodies involved in the solemnisation of marriage.  Let us remember that it is not just in law that religious solemnisers must comply with the form approved by their religious bodies.  They must also comply with the requirements of an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir.  They have to meet the test set out that registered solemnisers shall not solemnise a marriage except in accordance with a form of ceremony approved by an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir and which includes and is in no way inconsistent with the declarations specified, which is the problem one.  A registered solemniser who is not a registrar is recognised by the religious body.  Recognition by one's own religious body of the form one is using is a necessary but not sufficient condition for one's ability to solemnise a marriage and there is the nub of the issue.<br\/><br\/>I have put this as best I can.  I hope the Minister has given this more consideration because she did not have much of an opportunity to respond on Second Stage as she was under time pressure.  I was disappointed that she simply averred that I was incorrect.  I hope time has been taken to examine my proposal.  This is not something I am taking on the fly or bringing up to be obstructive.  I am trying to do my job as a legislator by pointing out what seems to me to be an obvious ambiguity.  The Minister has taken enormous steps to avoid ambiguity elsewhere in the legislation, not least in section 7 where one already has a situation where religious solemnisers must comply with their own religious bodies.  She has put in another clause that states nothing here shall compel them to marry according to their own form of ceremony.  She looked for the arcane and dealt with it in advance there.  The concern I have raised is a serious one and I hope the Government will take it onboard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#U01200","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>This is a mare's nest and it is a complete virago of nonsense.

The Bill does not do that at all, so I am obviously reading a different Bill to Senator Mullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#X01000","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I call Senator Zappone and ask her to stick to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#X01100","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen, with great respect, and I know we do respect each other, in his lengthy explanation of the amendment said he is trying to do this in a minimalist fashion - minimum, short, succinct - in order to put the issue beyond doubt.  I am not sure what that issue is.  I shall respond by making a couple of points on what I understand to be a minimalist approach to this issue.<\/p> <p>As I listened to Senator Mullen's lengthy explanation, I tried to understand the logic of what he was putting forward, because I know we were both trained in logic.  I believe the nub of his concern is that, if this amendment is not accepted, what the Government is doing would raise the validity of marriages taking place in regard to religious solemnising.  He is also arguing that if we do not have this amendment, the Bill would be interfering with religious organisations regarding their understanding of marriage as distinct from the legislation for civil marriage.  He is basing these very significant charges in regard to the Bill on the basis that the Government wants to add \"spouse\" along with \"husband and wife\".  However, as the word \"spouse\" can mean \"wife\" and can mean \"husband\", there is no material difference in terms of the definition.  I do not understand how that inclusion of \"spouse\" can place such a burden of raising the validity of the marriages previous to the ones that might take place now, as well as interfering with religious organisations in terms of their religious understanding of marriage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#X01200","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Under the law as it stands, a registered solemniser is not permitted to solemnise a marriage except in accordance with a form of ceremony approved by an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir.  This is set out in section 51(3)(a) of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  In the case of a religious solemniser, there is an additional criterion, which is that the form of ceremony must be recognised by the religious body of which he or she is a member.  This is set out in paragraph (c) of section 51, subsection (3).  Paragraph (b) of that same subsection provides that the form of ceremony must also include and be in no way inconsistent with specified declarations.  Those declarations are the following: a declaration by each party that he or she does not know of any impediment to the marriage; and a declaration by the parties that they accept each other as husband and wife.  This second declaration is set out in section 51(4)(b), and this is where the Senator has a concern.<\/p> <p>With the opening of marriage to same-sex couples, it would clearly be an anomaly to require two parties of the same sex to accept each other as &ldquo;husband and wife&rdquo;.  Accordingly, section 21 slightly alters what must be included in the second declaration.  Each of the parties must accept the other as a husband, a wife or a spouse, as the case may be.  This is an enabling provision.  A ceremony in which each party accepts the other as a spouse can be approved by an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir.  Similarly, he can approve a ceremony in which two women accept each other as wives, or two men accept each other as husbands.  Crucially, for the purposes of this discussion, nothing in the section as amended requires any change to a form of ceremony in which a woman makes a declaration accepting a man as her husband, and a man makes a declaration accepting a woman as his wife.  These are still valid declarations.  They are in no way inconsistent with the requirement now set out in section 51(4)(b).  Any form of ceremony which is currently approved by an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir remains valid.<\/p> <p>The amendment is misconceived.  It seeks to remedy a problem which simply does not exist.  The Senator is right in one respect, which is that forms of ceremony with changed declarations can be authorised, once this Bill is passed.  However, he is wrong in suggesting that current ceremonies, with their current declarations, will in any way fall out of compliance with the requirements of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  Furthermore, while forms of ceremony with revised declarations will be possible, the critical point is that churches will most certainly not be required to provide them.  I would direct the Senator again to section 7, which could hardly be clearer on this point.  It states: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act or any other enactment shall be construed as obliging ... a religious body to recognise a particular form of marriage ceremony for the purposes of section 51(3)(c) of the Act of 2004.&rdquo;<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A religious body will still be able to submit new forms of ceremony, and if they wish, the declarations made in those forms of ceremony can still be confined to a woman accepting a man as her husband, and a man accepting a woman as his wife.<\/p><p>Obviously, I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.  This section got as much detail and attention as every other section.  It is redundant because the Bill takes careful and meticulous account of the position of religious bodies, and is completely respectful of the constitutional guarantee that each religious denomination shall have the right to manage its own affairs.  I hope that gives an explanation of the approach in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#X01300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Aonta&iacute;m le cuid den m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir Mullen ach n&iacute;lim cinnte go bhfuil an ceart aige i ngach rud a d&uacute;irt s&eacute;.  T&aacute; suim agam san &aacute;bhar seo agus ba mhaith liom &eacute; a phl&eacute; leis an Aire chun go mbeidh m&eacute; f&eacute;in cinnte nach bhfuil d&aacute;ins&eacute;ar sa Bhille seo at&aacute; romhainn.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister's answer.  I concur with much of what Senator Mullen said on the issue.  I make a distinction.  I have read closely section 7, which the Minister mentioned.  It is fairly clear, but I might ask for clarification on one or two points.  I draw comparison relating to the phrase \"Nothing in this Act or any other enactment shall be construed as obliging\".  Senator Mullen's amendment states: \"Nothing ... shall be construed to prevent or invalidate the solemnisation of any marriage\".  Sometimes nothing obliging somebody to do something does not mean conferring legality on it.  Undoubtedly this will be challenged.  There are many well-funded gay ideological groups which are very active in challenging all sorts of beliefs among people who do not agree with their point of view.  There are many examples of that, particularly in our neighbouring island, if one follows it closely.<\/p> <p>I am anxious to ensure that it is crystal clear that nothing in the Bill or in the changes we are making in redefining marriage will place any obligation or put any of the churches or their priests in a position where they can be successfully challenged - I know they can be challenged - in the courts for sticking to their religious teachings and beliefs.<\/p> <p>Religious liberty is a cornerstone of fundamental human rights and is a constitutional right.  In this there is a certain danger of entering a sphere of conflicting constitutional rights which may have to be adjudicated on by the courts.  That is why I believe the intention of the legislator should be absolutely clear.  It is not the courts' job to make up legislation; it is their job to interpret the legislation that we have passed.  So the first distinction is with regard to preventing or invalidating, as opposed to not obliging or construed as obliging.<\/p> <p>I am reasonably satisfied on the second point I will make relating to a religious body recognising a particular form of marriage.  There is a distinction between a religious body and a religious solemniser in section 7(1)(b), which states, \"to solemnise a marriage in accordance with a form of marriage ceremony\".  The phraseology is slightly different.  There may be a need for it, but I want to elicit more from the Minister in that regard.<\/p> <p>Section 7(2) states: \"&ldquo;form of marriage ceremony&rdquo; includes that form in so far as it relates to the sex of the parties to the ceremony;\".  That would seem to refer specifically to same-sex couples.  I ask the Minister to clarify that.  I welcome that the Bill does not state, \"Nothing in this Act shall be construed\" but it states, \"Nothing in this Act or any other enactment shall be construed\".  To me, not as a legal person but as a layperson interpreting the law, it gives some comfort that nothing, not just this Bill, but in any other laws - equality legislation or anything else, would in any way infringe the religious liberty of churches and of their priests to interpret the law in any other way.  They only need have regard to their religious teachings regarding what will be - unless the churches change at some stage - opposite-sex or heterosexual marriages.  There will be no obligation by the State to interfere in any shape or form with that or expose them to any successful legal challenge.  If the Minister gave me that comfort, I would be happy.  I suggest to Senator Mullen that if we get that, the amendment may be unnecessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#Y00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

She may be Taoiseach at that stage and will not mind too much.  She will find a way to explain it all away and perhaps blame it on the draftspersons.<\/p> <p>I do not think I can be faulted for spotting an issue that I believe is very relevant to a goal the Minister says she wants to achieve, which is to protect from interference the current forms of ceremonies being used by different religious bodies.  It would be in the interest of the State for it to continue as it is with religious bodies that are in the business of marrying people also having a civil role.  I do not have a particular view on whether they should continue to have that role.  I have friends who were married in France.  They went to the registry office one day and to the church the next.  That may be the way of the future.

This is the issue I am raising and is a concern that people have.  In other words, there is a possibility that sections 51(4)(b) and 51(3) could be construed to mean any official form of ceremony which does not include a declaration about accepting the other as &quot;a husband, a wife or a spouse, as the case may be&quot; might be invalid for the purposes of solemnising marriage.<\/p><p>I revert to my point that when one states &quot;a husband, a wife or a spouse,&quot; each of those things must mean something different.  Religious organisations do not use the word &quot;spouse&quot; in their marriage rites, to my knowledge.  As for requiring them to include, in an official form of ceremony, &quot;a husband, a wife or a spouse, as the case may be,&quot; I reiterate that the form must include and be in no way inconsistent with a declaration to the effect that they take each other as husband, wife or spouse.  If it pertained to the individual ceremony, that would be a different thing, but the Minister is requiring them to have a particular form of ceremony, and the presence of the word &quot;include&quot; in section 51(3) means the form of ceremony must be broad.  The form of ceremony must be &quot;a husband, a wife or a spouse, as the case may be,&quot; and the Bill does not use that &quot;husband, wife or spouse&quot; distinction elsewhere.  Therefore, the point is that each of them must mean something different from the other.  It appears to me that on a fair reading of this legislation, the Minister is requiring religious organisations in the future to have a form of ceremony for approval by an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir which is sufficiently broad to encompass a meaning of solemnising a same-sex union as well.  This is not something they have at present, and the Minister simply cannot have such crystal ball certainty.  I am not proposing a bizarre interpretation of the English language.  With the greatest respect, I suggest the Minister is closer to so doing, because the 2004 legislation refers to the form being obliged to include declarations to the effect that the parties to the marriage accept each other as husband and wife, which the Minister has now changed to &quot;a husband, a wife or a spouse, as the case may be.&quot;<\/p><p>I am completely ready to believe this was an oversight, but the Minister has created a <i>dubium<\/i>.  The Minister has been approached by the parties most directly involved in these ceremonies with their concerns and I do not know whether she has given the slightest notice to their concerns or has written a letter to them reassuring them that their legal advice is wrong.  I simply do not know, because the Minister has not said so.  However, it seems to me that if the Minister wished to avoid any possibility that she could be wrong and I could be right, she would do no mischief by accepting my amendment, because it simply provides that the forms of ceremony currently in use shall not be put in issue in the future, which is what she states she wishes to achieve anyway.  It is only Thursday; the Minister could get this back to the D&aacute;il and done, signed and sealed by this weekend.  I believe the Minister has got the drafting wrong in this regard.  Moreover, the fact that an opponent of the referendum is pointing this out to the Minister is not a sufficient reason to reject it.  It certainly does not justify some of the patronising comments from the other side of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#Z00300","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

I also can confirm that an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir has been consulted and is completely certain that nothing in the Marriage Bill will invalidate any approved form of ceremony.  It allows but does not require new forms, and that is important.  As matters stand, an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir approves the ceremonies of marriage, whether they are civil marriages only or marriages with religious and civil aspects.  Those ceremonies must include declarations consistent with those set out in section 51(4)(b).  A ceremony that refers only to husband and wife does meet these criteria.  I really could not be more clear.  A religious body will not be required to change its ceremonies.  Obviously, the form of ceremony provision is intended to enable religious bodies to perform exclusively opposite-sex marriages.  That is the reason for the reference to the sex of the parties.

Once the Bill commences, those who married in other jurisdictions will have their marriages recognised.  When I sign the order, they will go from being regarded as civil partners in Irish law to married couples.  Soon thereafter, the first marriages of same-sex couples will take place.  Soon, we will have Christmas weddings of couples who thought they might never be able to marry.  Today is a joyous day.<\/p> <p>We have had our differences along the way.  Passionate and diverging views have been expressed.  Nonetheless, and I am sure everyone here will agree, that the referendum and this Bill are a vindication of the democratic process.  They demonstrate how democracy enables us to articulate, reconcile and respect diverging views.  The road to marriage equality may have been long but it has rightly involved an entire nation.  Marriage equality is not simply about marriage it is also about acceptance.  The Irish people have made it clear that they accept and embrace diversity.  We have recognised our common humanity and the desire of most of us for the love of a partner with whom we can become our best selves.<\/p> <p>While the journey has not ended, and many have made that point, the people&rsquo;s decision on 22 May 2015 is a powerful riposte to the prejudices of the past.

Some 30 or 40 years ago, Senator David Norris was on his own in this regard and his was a lonely voice.

We have seen what can be done here as a consequence of people power on the ground.  The passage of the Bill, along with people power, gives a clear mandate based on the referendum.  It is now stated clearly that all people in this State, including LGBT girls and boys, are equal.  People no longer have to worry and look at the ground denying they are gay, and they are no longer afraid to admit it.  That day is gone and the law has caught up with the culture of the people, as reflected very clearly in the referendum.  I am so proud to be here in the Seanad today to add my voice on the change of culture.  The change has happened fast in Ireland.  The Minister must be congratulated today.  It is a bright day, including for the Minister.  I welcome the Bill and offer heartiest congratulations to the Minister on a job well done.

Those of us who had and still have reservations about what the people decided still love those with whom we disagreed.  We do love them but we have to be true to ourselves.  I heard the Minister say some days ago how she hoped people would feel their fears have been allayed.  It is important that we do not patronise one another.  Sometimes we have a sincere disagreement that amounts to a concern or represents a well-worked-out position.  Certainly, it should not have taken a referendum on marriage to signal our united horror and opposition to homophobia of any kind, or any behaviour that would lessen our respect for human dignity and the radical equality of each and every person.  In asking proponents of the \"Yes\" side for magnanimity in victory, I am certainly signalling my realisation that there is also a requirement for magnanimity in defeat.<\/p> <p>One development that concerned me somewhat, but which I hope will not reflect a consequence of this legislation, is that there were people on the \"Yes\" side who sought on the day of the referendum result to create a link to the eighth amendment.  I met many people who said they voted to change the position on marriage in the Constitution but not to change the other provision.  It is important that we do not prejudge each other now and that we return to a sincere consideration of the issues that are important if we are to cherish the equality of each and every person in society, particularly the most vulnerable.  I look forward to working with people with whom I radically disagreed on the subject of the definition of marriage but with whom I radically agree on the need to cherish each and every vulnerable human life at all stages of life.<\/p> <p>I salute the people on the \"Yes\" side whom I encountered during the referendum campaign who were very credible, decent, upstanding and positive, and who played the argument rather than the person.  I also salute the 38% of people, or most of them, who voted \"No\" to the proposal for their decency, intelligence and credibility.  They are citizens and have an equal voice, and they are not going away.  They have a different vision of something that is very important to the \"Yes\" side, but it does not mean they do not respect and love those on that side.  They are entitled to their place in this democracy and it is important that those in victory on the political side &mdash; I am talking about public representatives &mdash; acknowledge that and do not just patronise those people as if they were somehow on the wrong track.  They are citizens and electors and need to be heard now and into the future.  They accept the rule of the majority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015102200002#CC00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1445506200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>We all made history and now we are all equal.

I still have fears and I hope that in the future they will not become more magnified.  Those fears relate particularly to children and how they are taught in schools.  I hope we do not go down the same route as Canada, where the human rights and equality commission is now visiting the homes of parents whose children said in school that their mammies and daddies told them that marriage between a man and a woman is best.  Those parents are now receiving visits from the equality police who claim that what they are saying is not in accordance with the law.  If we come to that, this will have been a real failure and how we manage that going forward is important.<\/p> <p>I was in Dublin Castle on the day of the referendum count and one could not but be touched by the happiness of the people there, many of whom have struggled with their orientation and against prejudice.  There is often an internal battle that many of us face in different aspects of our lives while trying to coming to terms with certain issues that we might not be 100% comfortable or happy with.  For those people, I am happy.  Some of them are my friends and I note how happy they are as a consequence of the referendum result.
