Therefore, I intend to be brief in my opening remarks.  <\/p><p>  In 2011 the HSE Vote outturn was &euro;13.9 billion.  Of this, &euro;6.4 billion represented expenditure on direct pay costs, excluding superannuation.  At the end of 2011 health service employment stood at 104,392 staff in whole-time equivalents.  In addition to basic pay, the health service incurs pay costs in the areas of night duty, weekend payments, overtime and on-call payments, locum costs, PRSI and allowances.<\/p><p>  I take the opportunity to clarify that the schedule of allowances provided for the purposes of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform review of allowances and premium payments is a subset of allowances as reported in the HSE statutory financial statements, namely, the appropriation account and the annual financial statement.  There is a wider interpretation of allowances in the financial statements which use the classifications contained in the Department of Health's consolidated pay scales.  For example, the Department's consolidated pay scales classify sessional and on-call payments as allowances.  These types of payments are not allowances in the strict sense and have, therefore, been excluded, with the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, from our submission prepared for the purposes of that Department's review of allowances and premium payments.<\/p><p>  Further work is under way to refine the data provided for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The HSE operates multiple legacy payroll systems which do not facilitate the automated reporting of the information required by the Department and the exercise required significant manual analysis within a very challenging timeframe.  As a result, the information provided has been estimated and extrapolated, where necessary.  A full reconciliation with the statutory financial statements will be completed shortly and can be provided to the committee, if required.  In this context, for 2011 the total cost of allowances in the health sector amounted to &euro;166.5 million, or 2.61% of the total pay bill.  Of this, &euro;86.9 million was spent on allowances paid to nursing staff, with &euro;36.3 million being paid to care and support staff and &euro;29.3 million to medical and dental staff.  The remaining &euro;14 million was paid to management and administration staff who received &euro;9.2 million and health and social care professionals who received &euro;4.7million.  This is all detailed in a table provided for members.<\/p><p>  A total of 41 allowances were identified as payable in the HSE as part of the review of allowances.  Of these, 12 are particular to the nursing profession which accounts for 34% of all staff employed.  A significant number of the allowances involved stem from the resolution of a protracted period of industrial unrest in the nursing profession in the second half of the 1990s.  This process also involved a number of Labour Court recommendations on the allowance issue during this period.  The main thrust in the granting of these allowances was to recognise the nursing staff working in areas in which specialised skills were required or in areas in which the nature of the work was particularly arduous.  There was a severe shortage of nurses in Ireland at the time, with employers recruiting from countries such as the Philippines and South Africa.  Members will note from the detailed information provided that the basic salary of a new entrant staff nurse is a scale running from &euro;27,211 to &euro;39,420.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting that of the 41 allowances identified, 31 are legacy allowances, predating 2000, with the majority having their origins in the 1970s and 1980s through long-standing agreements and-or custom and practice which developed during the life of the former health board structure.  Of these, nine are historical red-circled allowances that have not been paid to new employees for a considerable period of time.<\/p><p>  In more recent times the necessity to remunerate staff for service developments has changed and in most cases allowances have been sanctioned only where legislative or regulatory changes have so dictated.  An example of an allowance approved in 2011 is the forensic psychiatry out-of-hours service allowance which was put in place on foot of the recommendation made in the Barr report following the Abbeylara siege.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110800003#B01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352383800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>May we publish your statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110800004#C00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352383800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110800004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1352383800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Brien, his officials and Ms Buckley.

He stated: \"Due to the challenges posed by the legacy payroll systems predating the HSE, it has been difficult to quantify with precision the exact number of staff and costs associated to individual allowances.\"  That is the first time we have been told by an Accounting Officer that they are not in a position to quantify the number of individuals and the amount of specific allowances.  Perhaps he would expand on that point.  I appreciate there is the issue of legacy payroll systems that predate the HSE, but the HSE is not a new entity as it has been in existence for more than a decade.  Mr. O'Brien might update the committee on the current position with overhauling that payroll system.  He also spoke about being unable to quantify with precision the exact number of staff and costs associated with them.

If one breaks that down, therefore, we have approximately 65,000 staff directly employed and the remainder of the 102,000 are employed by voluntary hospitals and other voluntary agencies.

The norm at that time was for the majority of mental health nurses to work in a hospital setting, usually on a long day shift and seven-day fortnights.  The first major move to the community took place in Castlerea.  There is a well-known formula, called the Castlerea formula, established by Labour Court recommendation No. LCR13358, which determined the compensatory factors.  What happened was that as we moved to the community, to compensate for the loss of access to premium earnings from weekend work and night duty, it was agreed that a community allowance would be introduced to entice staff to move from institutional care to community care.  That continued and was repeatedly re-stated in many subsequent Labour Court recommendations.

Clinical directors had to meet specific requirements under mental health legislation.  The title of \"clinical director\" was not in use outside the mental health service.  As part of our negotiations on the 2008 contract, we sought to bring clinical leadership to the fore in the planning and delivery of all health services, particularly in acute hospitals.  Some initiatives involving directorate and programmatic models, in which services are planned on a programmatic basis, had been pursued.  As part of the negotiations on the 2008 consultants' contract, it was agreed that clinical directors would be put in place with a view to providing direct clinical leadership for the body of consultants.  That was a significant change from the previous contract which identified each consultant as an independent contractor.  This brought the management, governance and accountability of consultants into line.  On that basis, a role was developed for clinical directors.  This was included in Appendix 4 to the 2008 consultants' contract and became part of the agreement.  We have introduced clinical directors across acute settings.  The first positions were filled within a short period.  They were introduced and the clinical directors appointed by way of nomination and agreement among the consultant body.  That term is now up.

Mr. Tony O'Brien referred to the fact that he was also in the management service of a modern HSE.  I raised the question previously and I have put the representatives on notice that I would probably raise the issue.  Within the consultants area, &euro;74 million in private fee income remains unbilled to insurance companies.  I was told on 9 October that there were specific problems with some consultants in terms of completion of forms.  On the previous occasion the HSE appeared before the committee we were informed that &euro;8 million was outstanding for more than a year.  I am looking at this in the context of front-line cuts of the order of &euro;58 million before the end of the year.  It is ironic that &euro;8 million of that relates to home help hours and &euro;8 million of the &euro;74 million is the amount that is outstanding for more than 12 months.  For me the issue is simple.<\/p><p>  Does the clinical director's role involve examining whether the forms are signed and is that the only reason the claims have not been put in?  Is there a specific person in each hospital designated by the HSE to ensure forms are completed by consultants and claims submitted?  I commend the HSE on the fact it got &euro;125 million in accelerated payments from the insurance companies.  I see no reason the same cannot happen in respect of the &euro;74 million unclaimed private fee income.  It could be looked at in the form of an accelerated payment from the insurance companies.  This is about management.<\/p><p>  What is the clinical director's role in interacting with consultants?  Is there a specific person in place in the HSE at administration level to ensure the forms are signed?  I understand that in many cases patient files are not presented to consultants to sign-off on insurance claims.

At the time, management would have been dealing with significant pay claims and each recommendation would have been hard fought throughout the industrial relations machinery.  Each would have had a specific reference as well.  Since then, as we have changed and moved to modernise, we have had occasion to go back repeatedly to the Labour Court to argue.<\/p><p>  In essence, the vast majority of the people involved are on a basic core pay system.  The vast majority of the allowances amounting to 2.61% of the total wage bill are paid to front-line service provision people.  That is the nature of pay within the health system.  People refer to allowances, but the reality is different.  Let us consider the role of a public health nurse on one of our islands.  That person probably gets the ferry over to the island and spends five days there, living in accommodation on the island and making herself available 24 hours per day, seven days per week.

The first item is the historic rest days.  We previously advised the committee that we had an exposure for &euro;104 million for a group of 450 consultants from now until 2027.  We sought to reduce that by 50% and that the leave would be availed of by 2018.  The court has made a recommendation that it will be reduced by 25%, which will give us a saving of &euro;26 million and that it must be taken in full by 2020.  There will be a significant saving to the taxpayer on what was our liability prior to the Labour Court recommendation.<\/p><p>  On the other two matters, the first matter was to do with the current rest day arrangements, whereby consultants working on a rota system of one in one, one in two, one in three and one in four, had certain rest day entitlements as well as being in receipt of their B factor, which is for a liability to be on call and a C factor, which is payment for being called in.  The Labour Court recommended that the B and C factors should continue and that in future they will only get rest where they actually attend out of hours.  They will be given compensatory rest consistent with the Working Time Act.  In other words, if a consultant has cause to come in at 1 a.m. and work until 2 a.m., then the employer has a liability to give one hour's compensatory rest for that hour.  Up to now, those consultants in a one in three arrangement were given 26 days additional leave per year for that liability and those in a one in four arrangement were given 13 additional days.  Therefore, as and from last Tuesday, the HSE has advised all the hospitals that the rest for those in a one in three and a one in four no longer pertains.  The IMO is balloting currently on the entire range of packages and this will be completed by 21 November.  We have invited the IMO to engage immediately on giving effect to the two binding Labour Court recommendations.  I have invited the IHCA to engage immediately on the Labour Court recommendations.  The IHCA decided not to attend the Labour Court.  The IHCA views its participation in the public service agreement as being based on collaboration rather than on a collective agreement.  We view them as being fully encompassed by the Croke Park agreement and therefore it is our view that we have a collective agreement.  Our submissions to the Labour Court were based on the view that any outcome of the court would be applied to all consultants employed in the public health system.

The general picture emerging from these proceedings is that there are approximately 67,000 direct HSE staff, of whom 41,000 - in the region of two thirds - are in receipt of allowances.  Our guests indicated that there are of the order of 36,000 people operating in the voluntary sector.  One could assume, therefore, that approximately 24,000 of the latter are in receipt of some of allowance.  Are our guests aware of any new allowances in the voluntary sector that are separate from those which they have been examining?  Obviously, the voluntary sector is a different animal and different traditions have grown up within it.  Those in the sector must engage in a variety of different practices.  I accept that our guests have not reached a conclusion in respect of this matter.<\/p><p>  I understand from where Deputy Donohoe was coming in respect of the questions he posed.  We are trying to examine the position with regard to allowances across the public service and we have obtained some inconsistent definitions in this regard.  I appreciate that the definition provided by our guests relates to allowances of &euro;166 million, weekend payments of &euro;190 million, overtime payments of &euro;177 million, night payments of &euro;73 million and on-call payments of &euro;65 million.  This amounts to &euro;661 million in overall allowances which are directly relates to the HSE.  One would assume half that amount again is paid in allowances in the voluntary sector.  The overall figure for allowances in the health sector is, therefore, approximately &euro;1 billion.  If we were to use the definitions employed by the other organisations and Departments which came before us in respect of allowances and apply them to the health sector, then an amount substantially in excess of &euro;2 billion would be under examination.  The conclusion to which we are coming is that many allowances are essentially core pay elements.  In other words, they are payments in respect of hours worked.  We are of the view that some Departments, etc., are employing something of a misnomer in the context of allowances.  It is difficult to separate the definitions.  Our guests will understand, therefore, that the committee is obtaining different views from across public service.<\/p><p>  Are there many allowances payable in the voluntary sector which would not be considered normal if they came within the ambit of the HSE?

There is a general thrust that has some validity and I wish to propose a compromise that members might consider favourably.<\/p><p>  The operation of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill will provide a central role for the veterinary profession.  The Bill consolidates a wide variety of legislation.  Establishing different classes and hierarchies of authorised officers and inspectors with different powers and different responsibilities runs counter to the aim of reducing bureaucracy.  Authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Bill have a wide range of functions and different classes of duties may be assigned to different officers by management.  This will be done as appropriate depending on the task in question and is best dealt with on an administrative basis rather than creating rigid legal structures.  Resources are finite and in some instances it may be more appropriate to use an officer other than a vet.<\/p><p>  Under section 23 the Bill does envisage a situation where an authorised officer may put down a badly injured animal where a vet is not available.  A number of points should be made in that regard.  It reflects the existing legal situation where an authorised officer can kill if he or she comes across an animal and it is appropriate to put it down.  The Veterinary Practices Act allows a non-vet to kill an animal.  The previous subsection will apply and specifies that anyone killing must be competent to do so, that is, someone from a knackery yard, for example.  A number of members insisted that to save farmers costs knackery personnel should be allowed to kill an animal.  Therefore it is inconsistent to deprive an authorised officer of the same power.  The provisions of section 23 reflect the current law where a fatally injured animal may be put down.  Similarly, the Veterinary Practices Act allows a non-vet to kill an animal in an emergency situation.  Furthermore, veterinary expertise is not required to kill an animal but competence is.  A variety of persons are permitted to kill animals, for example slaughterhouse operatives and knackery staff.  However, section 23(1) of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill will apply, requiring that anyone who kills an animal be competent to do so.<\/p><p>  In any event, the concerns expressed relate to an unusual case.  A significant number of authorised officers who are Department staff are qualified vets and those who are not will, in the normal course of events and where it can quickly be done, seek veterinary advice.  They are unlikely to use this power lightly because they must satisfy themselves, and potentially the courts, that the animal falls under one of the headings 23(2)<i>(a<\/i>) to <i>(d<\/i>).  However, it may need to be used urgently such that veterinary advice cannot be reached, for example in dealing with rabid animals.  The allowance to perform this act is currently and will remain available to persons without veterinary training.  Therefore, it would be an oversight not to allow an authorised officer to do so.<\/p><p>  Deputy McNamara outlined a specific concern which I will deal with in due course.  What Deputies are trying to do is to create a separate category for vets and for other authorised officers, including inspectors.  I understand the reason.  I presume they want to do that because there is a concern that the two people who can appoint authorised officers, namely, a county manager or a Minister, may appoint people who do not have the appropriate qualifications to carry out inspections on farms or in other places where there may be animals.  Given the concern that has been expressed by veterinary practitioners, farming organisations and members, I suggest that Deputies might consider that we would do two things to improve the Bill in terms of the appointment of authorised officers.  Currently, county managers can only appoint authorised officers from within their local authority.  A county manager cannot, for example, go to an animal welfare organisation with the intention of appointing an authorised officer from the organisation.  That is not allowed in the legislation, although a Minister could do that.  There are instances where we should consider doing that.  We will talk about them later.  If a county manager is to appoint a new authorised officer that is not a veterinary practitioner he or she must seek approval from the Minister to do so.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine must sanction the appointment of an authorised officer that is not a vet in order that we would try to get over the concern that county managers may, for whatever reason, appoint someone that is not suitable for reasons of their level of knowledge to carry out inspections.<\/p><p>  The second point we must address in the legislation in order to put an onus on the Minister to ensure that the right type of person is appointed as an authorised officer is to insert a provision on Report Stage, if members consider it a good idea, to the effect that a Minister must have regard to the expertise and qualification of the person before he or she is appointed as an authorised officer.  The notion that every authorised officer must be a vet does not make sense when one looks at the practicalities of the current situation.  For example, many of the agricultural inspectors in the Department are not qualified vets but they are people who have been trained in agricultural colleges and who carry out many other inspections on farms in terms of control and compliance.  They understand farming very well.  It makes sense for those people to also be authorised officers in respect of this legislation.  If they have a serious animal welfare concern they can call a vet to come and deal with the matter should a complication arise.  The notion that all inspections by authorised officers would have to be undertaken by vets would have a huge resource implication.  For example, if we had an outbreak of foot and mouth disease or any other disease that requires me to authorise a large number of authorised officers to respond to it in a comprehensive way, we would not be able to solely rely on vets for such a service.  In addition, there is a limited role outside of farming for a Minister to consider authorising someone who clearly has qualifications and experience and who may have been working with an animal welfare organisation to act as an authorised officer, for the keeping of domestic animals, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012110800004#C00500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352367900,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The proposal just outlined by the Minister could be an acceptable solution but it appears to me that section 37 already provides those powers to the Minister <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> authorised officers.

What happens outside this House is of no relevance at committee.  A case is being put forward by the movers of the amendments and what the Minister thinks we think is of no relevance.  The way Committee Stage always worked when I was a Minister was that the movers of an amendment made a case for that amendment, explained why they proposed the amendment and then, when the Minister knew the reasoning behind the amendment, he or she replied to the case made by the Deputy.  Let us now deal with the actual amendments, as put forward.<\/p><p>  Amendment No 1 seeks to insert into the Bill a clear distinction between an inspector of the Minister and an authorised officer.  The purpose of that is to clarify that there are certain functions that can be carried out by an authorised officer who need not be a vet but that there are other, specified functions where veterinary expertise is needed.  I will draw the analogy of a hospital, where nurses are highly trained but where it is recognised that doctors have particular functions that only they can carry out.  In proposing this amendment, I believe that there are certain functions that should be reserved for veterinary officers or people acting on veterinary advice and that there are other functions that an authorised officer can carry out without veterinary advice or without a person with a qualification in veterinary medicine being involved in the function.  To allow that differentiation throughout the Act, amendment No. 4 must be accepted.  We must have a definition of an inspector as being a person with veterinary qualifications.  Otherwise it is not possible to follow through in the Act on the rest of its provisions.  <\/p><p>  We then move to amendments Nos. 40 to 45, inclusive, of which my amendment is No. 41.  The question that arises in amendment No 41, which deals with page 23, subsection (2) is very simple.  The Bill at present states:<blockquote>(2) If an authorised officer, a veterinary practitioner acting as such or a person specified in animal health and welfare regulations<br \/>is of the opinion that--(<i>a<\/i>) an animal is fatally injured,<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) an animal is so severely injured or diseased or in such pain or distress that, for the alleviation of its suffering, it<br \/>should be killed,<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) to prevent further suffering to an animal, it is necessary or expedient, or<br \/>(<i>d<\/i>) an animal is a danger to life or property,he or she may, without having to seek the consent of its owner or the person in control of it, kill the animal or cause the animal to be killed or destroyed in such manner as to inflict as little suffering as possible in the circumstances and may destroy or dispose of the carcass or cause the destruction or disposal of the carcass.<\/blockquote>  The issue here is not the killing of the animal, because there are many people who have the skills to carry out that function.  The issue is who is to decide that the animal is so fatally injured that it has to be killed.  The issue is not the killing itself but the decision on the killing.  I have no problem with a person from a knackery yard doing the actual killing.  The thrust of the proposed amendment is very simple, namely, that if an authorised officer is making such a decision and does not have veterinary skills, he or she should consult with a veterinary officer.  There are many ways, in the modern world, of consulting with a veterinary officer, lest the Minister respond that the officer might not have a vet to hand.  There are gadgets known as mobile phones and a lot of consultation, even from vet to vet, is done on mobile phones.  One veterinary practitioner, for example, rings another, describes symptoms and asks for the other's opinion.  Obviously, it is not an on-the-ground opinion as the vet has not seen the animal but he or she can give advice.  Advice can be given without the need to be physically present and the amendment would ensure that the decision to put down an animal was made with the involvement of someone with the requisite veterinary skills.  It has nothing to do with the act of putting the animal down.  The amendment is worthy of consideration.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 69, 70, 72, 74 and 75, which are also in the group of amendments we are discussing, are more or less in the same vein.  What is being proposed in amendment No. 69 is reasonable.  The amendment reads as follows: <\/p><p>  In page 34, subsection (3), lines 29 to 32, to delete all words from and including &#8220;appoint&#8221; in line 29 down to     and including &#8220;agreement.&#8221; in line 32 and substitute the following:<br \/>&#8220;submit the names of persons he or she considers appropriately qualified to be authorised officers for the purpose of all or any of the functions that the person may exercise under the service agreement to the Minister who may appoint in writing any or all such person to be authorised officers&#8221;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012110800005#D00600","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352368500,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I disagree with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and commend the Minister for his approach.

That would be a huge waste of money.  The great majority of farmyard visits could be carried out by a non-veterinarian, but some training in animal husbandry or veterinary practice is required before a person can order the destruction of an animal.  Some of our colleagues will discuss the rights of animals, but aside from that, in some instances, they can be a very valuable and essential piece of property, for example, a pedigree cow or bull, on which a farmer's entire breeding system is based, or a racehorse.  If a person with no training was able to go onto a farm and order the destruction of a farmyard animal against the wishes of the farmer, I would be very concerned.  I declare a conflict of interest, as I am a farmer.  I have also received some legal training and would have grave reservations about the ability of somebody with no animal husbandry or veterinary training to come onto my farm and order me to destroy an animal.  I accept that he or she could honestly believe that that animal requires to be destroyed, but if a farmer believes otherwise, a degree of training or veterinary experience is required before a person could order the destruction of an animal.  I, therefore, urge the Minister to consider how these property rights could be protected.  I acknowledge such rights give way to the common good.  However, I am not arguing that a farmer's property rights in terms of his or her farmyard animals should trump everything else, but they should be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012110800006#E01200","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1352368500,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Does Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v want to clarify a matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012110800006#E01300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1352368500,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Yes.

That was the approach in the Seanad, where I took on board amendments, and I intend to take on board amendments on Committee Stage where appropriate.  I have no problem with spending as long as it takes to go through the Bill, section by section, and listening to what Members have to say.  In an effort to be helpful I will say that I do not think I was, in my opening statement, proposing compromises without listening to what Deputies had to say.<\/p><p>  On the issue of a separate definition of what vets do versus what authorised officers do, clearly there is a different function for vets in a whole range of ways in terms of veterinary legislation and so on.  In regard to much of the work that needs to be done either by vets, as authorised officers, or other authorised officers who are not vets but who will have to call in vets to carry out detailed work because they are not qualified to do it, a clear distinction will be made.  We are trying to decide who will be given the limited powers of authorised officers in respect of inspections and the issuing of welfare notices, which is similar to handing a yellow card to a person.  It means that one is making a welfare mistake in terms of the animals for which one is responsible. One can accept a fine and a welfare notice to change that practice and avoid going to court or, if one is concerned that one is being treated unfairly, one can still go to court and not pay the appropriate fine.  The concern of some farming organisations is that non-veterinary personnel will go onto a farm and fine a farmer without the same level of evidence or proof that would be required in court.  The whole point is that we are trying to keep people out of court, where appropriate, for relatively minor welfare offences that can be corrected quickly.  This is a warning system that does not have the same burden of proof as a court.  That is a good thing for farmers and for other people who keep animals.  If a farm inspector takes a case, he or she must go to court in respect of imposing fines and so on.  I would like to keep people out of court as much as possible and have a practical discussion about welfare notices.  In the event of a complex case there will be a need for a fully qualified vet, because a person who is not a qualified vet would have to rely on the knowledge of a vet to make a complex welfare notice.  I am not suggesting that vets are not in a separate category to other authorised officers; clearly, they are, in respect of their qualifications.  If we want to outline in law the difference between the powers of authorised officers, be they vets or otherwise, we are getting into more complex requirements to respond to a case.  If a person reports a serious welfare case to the Department I would rather be able to send out an authorised officer, whether a vet or a non-vet, to investigate the matter.  If it is a complex case a vet would be called in to do that work.  We want to have the flexibility to use authorised officers in a way that is as efficient as possible.<\/p><p>  This is not a cost-saving measure.  Vets may be concerned that under the legislation a number of vets who are authorised officers will be replaced by cheaper substitutes.  That is not the intention.  My preference is that as many authorised officers as possible will be veterinary practitioners.  There are a large number of agricultural inspectors in the Department, who are inspecting in any event.  Large numbers of people will have to be found to respond to welfare calls, such as domestic pet cases.  I would like to see veterinary nurses involved.  If someone has to knock on a person's door, say there is a report that a dog has been screeching in pain for the past two or three nights and ask for an explanation of what is going on, the credibility of a veterinary nurse is sufficient.  If the case is complex, the veterinary nurse will call in a qualified vet to examine the issue.  The idea that we could not have authorised officers who are not fully qualified vets limits our options in respect of these choices.  <\/p><p>  There is a distinction in the Bill between farm animals and other animals because, in dealing with compensation cases, farm animals are part of a commercial operation.  <\/p><p>  I am seeking the flexibility for a Minister to appoint appropriate people as authorised officers.  What I said before Deputies had an opportunity to make the case for their individual amendments was that I am open to improving the wording to reassure people that in appointing a person as a veterinary officer we would have to have regard to the level of experience and qualifications.  That is not unreasonable.<\/p><p>  I want to deal with the issue of cost savings.  This legislation has been in preparation for a number of years.  To the credit of the previous Government, it happened under its watch initially.  We have tried to improve it.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked who decides when an animal should be put down or destroyed.  Essentially, there are two issues.  We need to ensure that anybody who is putting an animal down because it is in pain as a result of an accident knows what he or she is doing.  We do not want an amateur trying to put a large animal down and causing much more distress for the animal and for everybody present.  That is totally unacceptable.  There may be instances in which an animal is injured - it may have broken a leg in a slatted shed or fallen through a transportation box - and it is difficult to get a vet on site quickly, but there are experienced personnel present, perhaps the farmer or a person from a knackery yard or slaughterhouse.  There can be extreme animal welfare cases in which an animal needs to be put down quickly for its own good.  We need to ensure that a competent person can do that.  Obviously, we would like that person to be a vet, but it is not always possible to get a vet there quickly.  It does not have to be a farmer; it could be anybody else. When an animal is in significant pain and distress an authorised officer can make a judgment call as to whether the animal should be put down, and that can be done by a person who is competent to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012110800007#F00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352369700,"counter":563,"content":"<p>There are a number of amendments.

I still believe there are some functions that should only be carried out by persons with the competent veterinary qualification.<\/p><p>  I will wait for Report Stage in the case of the amendment on the qualifications of those who become authorised officers.  It is important, and I accept the Minister's good faith in this.

I cannot envisage a situation in which a vet could not be contacted by an authorised officer, who, presumably, would have mobile phone numbers for many veterinary surgeons.  I accept, for the purpose of clarity, that it should be made explicit that such consultation or advice could be given by electronic means without the veterinary surgeon being on site.  If the Minister undertakes to consider that issue - I will submit a slightly different amendment on Report Stage - and agrees to provide that there be consultation with a veterinary surgeon but that it may be done by electronic means, by the use of mobile telephones, by e-mail or whatever, and that there need not necessarily be an on-site inspection, I will accept that.<\/p><p>  Where the Bill, in section 38, refers to determining whether there is a disease, it states:<blockquote>  (4) Where an authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing that--(<i>a<\/i>) there is a risk of disease,<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) a disease or disease agent is or may be present on any land or premises[.]<\/blockquote>That is a reasonable position, allowing that there are no specific qualifications laid down for authorised officers and that this is a rather specialised job.<\/p><p>  On the amendments that I have proposed to section 42, the Minister has a point.

They do not have to be an authorised officer.  There is a clear distinction between an authorised officer and a vet, not necessarily in this legislation but in the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Act, which upgraded the legislation in this area in recent months.  There is a clear distinction between what vets and veterinary nurses can and cannot do in terms of treatments, operations and putting animals down. The legislation is very clear.  The role of vets is and can be distinguished from that of authorised officers.  The only matter that is being dealt with in this legislation is the role of authorised officers and what they can and cannot do.  Many authorised officers are also vets and they will have extra legal power to do all manner of other things.  That is why I do not believe there is a need to make a distinction in this legislation between the roles of an authorised officer who happens to be a vet and one who is not.  The legal determination of the decisions and operations that can be undertaken by a vet, a veterinary nurse or someone in a knackery yard is distinguished in legislation already.  The issue we are discussing is whether we should make a distinction in this legislation between authorised officers who are vets and those who are not and give different powers to them.  I think that would complicate the matter unnecessarily.<\/p><p>  In practically all the cases that I can envisage where an animal needs to be put down, the Deputies are right that a vet will reach the scene as quickly as someone from a knackery yard.

A large element of the legislation is about preventing the spread of disease, which is in everybody's interest, particularly the agricultural sector.  Section 38(4) states:<blockquote><br \/>Where an authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing that-  <br \/>the officer may, in addition to the powers exercisable by him or her under <i>subsection (1)<\/i>:(i) search the land or premises;<br \/>(ii) search the vehicle, vessel, aircraft, railway wagon ...<br \/>(iii) require a person in charge to control the vehicle, vessel ....  <blockquote>(I) refrain from moving it, .<br \/>(II) give information regarding its place of departure.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>That provision refers to when animals are being transported and if there is evidence.  To be clear, the authorised officers are garda&iacute;, customs officers and people who are appointed either by county managers or the Minister.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The legislation must take account of the customs officers and the animals that are being transported.  If animals are crossing the Border or coming into the country through a port and there is reason to believe that there is a disease risk associated with them, we must give authorised officers the power to stop the movement of the truck, bring in a vet and assess the situation.  The provision is not all about farm inspections.  An issue on a farm is likely to be discovered following another form of inspection.  In many cases the provision caters for animals that are being moved and there is evidence of disease such as scabs on sheep or symptoms that cattle or calves may have.  In such instances the authorised officer must have the power to address the situation and bring in the expertise that is needed because a customs officers is not a vet.<\/p><p>  I do not want to belittle the other powers that we are giving to authorised officers in section 38(4) which states: <blockquote>(iv) take, without making a payment, samples from an animal, animal product, animal feed, land, water, flora; <br \/>(v) seize and detain an animal, animal product or animal feed;<br \/>(vi) detain a vehicle, vessel, aircraft; <br \/>(vii) remove any equipment or machinery or books, documents or records and detain them for such reasonable period necessary for the purpose of his or her functions under this Act.  <\/blockquote>The provision tries to give an authorised officer powers.  It means that if they come across a situation that raises a reasonable concern - in terms of disease, a disease outbreak or the potential for a disease spread - they will be able to deal with that situation comprehensively and quickly.  Of course that will involve bringing in a veterinary practitioner to make a judgment in terms of what the disease is and so on.  Perhaps Deputies can suggest how we can improve on that.  Clearly, their amendment  is one suggestion.  Amendment No. 72 states that only authorised officers that are vets would be able to detain a vehicle if he or she thinks that there is a serious threat of disease.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012110800010#J01100","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1352370900,"counter":607,"content":"<p>No, it does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012110800010#J01200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1352370900,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 72 states, \"The power conferred on an authorised officer under subsection (4)(a)and (b)\" which refers to the reasonable grounds for believing that there is a risk of disease-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012110800010#J01300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1352370900,"counter":609,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012110800010#J01400","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1352370900,"counter":610,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 72 continues. \"....may only be exercised by an inspector of the Minister\" which the Deputies propose to be a vet.

In talking about these issues, my main focus will be on the physical fabric of monuments and sites.  However, I will go a bit beyond that to talk about the connection between preservation and meaning and will try to connect that discussion with a wider international context.<\/p><p>  In international terms, the starting point in terms of principle can be traced back to the Venice charter, which is a document produced in 1964 by experts in the area of conservation.  The thinking behind that document at the time was that the business of preserving monuments would be facilitated by having international agreements, conventions and protocols that were shared between countries.  A number of European countries came together in France to discuss this and subsequently met in Venice where the charter was drawn up.<\/p><p>  In the documents I have supplied there is an interesting quotation from the first article of that charter, which is highlighted on the screen in my PowerPoint presentation.  It states that the concept of an historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work, but also the rural or urban setting in which is found evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or an historic event.  It goes on to say that this applies to the more modest works of the past that have acquired cultural significance with the passage of time.  The deliberations of the group do not only talk, therefore, about the great monuments but also about modest works that because of the passage of history or events have acquired a significance within their culture.  Therefore, the group's prescriptions with regard to principles and procedures would apply equally in both cases.<\/p><p>  There is a history to how these principles have evolved.  If members will excuse me, I will go back a little to talk about that.  Although the discussion about preserving monuments goes back to the times of the Renaissance, it mainly took wings in the 19th century, at a time when there was massive reconstruction of medieval buildings and all sorts of inventions were being imposed upon them, with significant demolition taking place in order to arrive somehow at what the true building should be like.  However, it is really in the 20th century that we begin to see some progressive developments.<\/p><p>  I started off with the Venice charter from 1964, which involved mainly European countries coming together on this.  It is interesting that the main impetus for the development of conservation and preservation of monuments is clearly traceable to the aftermath of the two world wars.  At times when societies were particularly conscious of the fragility of civilisation and its products.  Therefore, we tended to get international congresses trying to arrive at definitions that would help the business of preservation.<\/p><p>  A number of significant shifts took place within the course of the 20th century and I will mention these as we go along.  From the end of the 1970s and in the early 1980s, we had a move to widen the discussion from the monument and historic area to historic towns and urban areas.  Then, there was an attempt to draw wider landscapes into the understanding and the existence of landscapes of cultural significance was recognised.  That particular discussion is particularly relevant to Ireland, where we have extensive landscapes that retain vestiges of the past and which, for one reason or another, have not been recognised over time, though they are beginning to be recognised now and people are paying attention to how we should deal with them.  For example, the landscapes of early Christian monasteries need to be regarded as a whole, rather than considered as individual examples existing in a particular place.  I will cover this again as we move along.<\/p><p>  Generally, when discussing the preservation or conservation of monuments and places of cultural significance, I always put three questions forward as \"coat hooks\" to help our thinking on the issue.  First, what is the significance of the monument or the place?  Second, how is that significance embodied in the material fabric we see in front of us?  Third, how is that significance maintained, revealed or protected in what we propose to do.  These three layers help us address the issue.<\/p><p>  With regard to the significance of the monument or place, this is an area where thinking has developed over the past few years.  This area brings into play multidisciplinary scholarship, because it is not within the competence of any particular academic or other kind of discipline to fully describe the significance of a particular monument.  One might look at it from an architectural, archeological, geographical, historical or other perspective.  There is a question of its place in folklore and in literature.  There are many different ways in which the significance of a place can be expressed.  As members are aware, there has been some discussion about the city of Dublin and its possible inscription on world heritage site lists.  One of the factors under consideration is that Dublin is and has been acknowledged as a city of literature.  A number of buildings on world heritage site lists are there because they are places where there has been outstanding achievement in the arts, rather than for the architectural quality of the place itself.<\/p><p>  Apart from this, there is the question of analysis of the fabric and detailed discussion of what exactly one is looking at and what remains on the ground in time.  The attitude taken in this regard is that the building itself is a document.  It is a document that was written at a point in time, but has since been progressively altered or written over by different generations under different circumstances.  Therefore, there is what one might call a polymces, which is one of those medieval manuscripts which when finished was erased and written over, but the older text could still be read through the newer one.  That is what buildings are - they are sedimentations of history.  One of the jobs of the analyst now is to go through those sedimentations and portray them.  His job is not necessarily to say this one is more important than that, but here they are, one after the other or one on top of the other.<\/p><p>  Let me refer to one of the international organisations that has had much to say on this area, UNESCO.  It has produced various categories of monument and criteria by which their value can be judged.  It has done this because it administers a system of world heritage sites and prescribes which are world heritage sites.  Therefore, it has had to produce definitions that allow it to make choices and judgments.  In terms of monuments, UNESCO has identified historical, artistic and scientific criteria to be applied.  In terms of sites, it has identified historical, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological criteria and in natural sites, aesthetic and scientific criteria.  Of course, all of these overlap and interpenetrate one another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012110800004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Loughlin Kealy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352382000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor, for that informative and worthwhile presentation.

The management of change, therefore, comes into play as whatever means are necessary to ensure that the significance of a monument is not lost in the process of change.

As Chairman of the committee I made every reasonable attempt to persuade Chartered Land to attend and to facilitate its attendance.  Acknowledging its central role as owners of the site, I acceded to its request for more speaking time than other witnesses.  I guaranteed that it would not be subjected to questioning or interruption by any other witnesses and if this happened, the meeting would be suspended.  I changed the venue of the meeting to ensure that correct parliamentary procedure would be followed to achieve that objective.

The meeting was originally scheduled to take place in the offices of Dublin City Council on Wood Quay.  I thank Dublin City Council for facilitating that request.  We changed the venue specifically to facilitate the attendance of Chartered Land.  However, Chartered Land, among other conditions, wished to give its evidence in private session only.  This was not acceptable to the committee.  This committee hears evidence in public session in so far as possible.  Chartered Land has declined our invitation.

The subject of our presentation is the same as that of previous speakers, the saving of No. 16 Moore Street.  We had the pleasure of meeting the Chairman of the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, and the secretary of the committee, Mr. Eugene &Oacute; Cruadhlaoich, last May for the purpose of further briefing the committee on the two alternatives that are currently before the Minister with regard to securing the above objective.  In the course of the briefing we outlined to the officers of the Oireachtas committee that the first of the two alternatives the Minister is evaluating dates from the time our Save No. 16 Moore Street Committee was formed, which was around 2003, while the other group's option dates from around 2008 or 2009.<\/p><p>  The first option had its genesis in a call by us to the members of Dublin City Council and Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann to desist from permitting the demolition of No. 16 Moore Street and its environs to make way for a regeneration project for the north O'Connell Street-mid-Moore Street-Ilac Centre area in the form of a mixed-use development of commercial and residential accommodation.  Full planning permission had been granted in 1998-99 for the demolition of No. 16 Moore Street and its contextual buildings.  Our proposal to the authorities for the implementation of an alternative vision, which would fulfil both the need to regenerate and the need to commemorate, was that a specialist conservation consultancy be identified and appointed for the specific purpose of carrying out a detailed examination of the area and bringing to the council a report and recommendations on how a balance could be correctly and properly struck between the requirement of the council to regenerate the semi-derelict and decaying northern end of the capital city's main street and the need for correct, proper and appropriate commemoration of the events that were seminal to the genesis of our State, including the Provisional Government's decision to surrender, an important part of which took place at No. 16 Moore Street.<\/p><p>  A firm of expert conservation consultants was selected and appointed.  It duly carried out its work and reported back to Dublin City Council in the form of a detailed bound report which recommended not only that No. 16 Moore Street should be returned to its 1916 specification and to pristine condition and used in perpetuity as a commemorative place for the events that unfolded on, in and around Moore Street in the latter days of Easter week 1916, but also that No. 16's three contextual buildings, Nos. 14,15 and 17, should receive the same preservation treatment, although without specifying that these three buildings should form an integral operational part of the commemorative project.  The report and recommendations by the expert conservation consultancy received a rapturous welcome and endorsement not only from all 52 members of Dublin City Council but also unanimously from our own committee's members.<\/p><p>  The proposal that was specified by the expert consultants as striking an appropriate balance between regeneration and commemoration was subsequently dealt with by the various authorities and players with jurisdiction acting in co-operation with Dublin City Council planning department, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Chartered Land Limited, the Save No. 16 Moore Street Committee, the members of Dublin City Council and the concerned public.  The planning permission that now exists reflects the comprehensive input of all of these groups.  The proposal is fully funded, both in terms of capital provision and in terms of the operation of the commemorative element of the scheme in perpetuity, and the precise detail of its implementation is clearly defined with built-in contingency provisions.  Only ministerial approval of the section 14 application is required to move forward towards the delivery of the commemorative element of the Dublin central scheme by September 2015.<\/p><p>  The Chairman of the Oireachtas committee requested at the conclusion of our meeting that we obtain reinforced assurances from NAMA and Chartered Land Limited that the commemorative element of the Dublin central scheme could be successfully decoupled, if necessary, from the commercial element of the scheme and that, even in the event that the main scheme was held back by prevailing economic circumstances, both the capital and the operational overhead cost of the commemorative part of the scheme would be available.  We gave our assurance to the officers that we would attend to this aspect and report back.  We have since done so and reported back in positive terms.<\/p><p>  To summarise, the proposal to completely restore the buildings at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street and designate them as a commemorative centre for the 1916 Rising, which was made by the owner of the site, Chartered Land Limited, and which was accepted with modifications by the planning authority and, on appeal, by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, was deemed satisfactory by the majority of the Save No. 16 Moore Street Committee in terms of achieving the committee's founding aims and objectives.  In arriving at this decision the committee took cognisance of the likely effect of the proposed surrounding development on the national monument, the financing provisions which were then in place and the approaching deadline for completion of the works by 2016.  The committee is of the view that the proposal is well worked out and achievable within the limited financial context and timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012110800009#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352383800,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Connolly.

The record shows that the agreed founding aim of the committee was to protect the standing and integrity of No. 16 Moore Street in its entirety as the focal point of a 1916 historical cultural quarter.  The record shows that this has always been the case and that this remains the central aim of the committee to this day.<\/p><p>  The holder of the highest office in the land, an t-Uachtar&aacute;in, Michael D. Higgins, on walking the 1916 battlefield with relatives of the 1916 leaders during the presidential campaign said, &ldquo;This area belongs to no individual group or political party.  It belongs to the people.&rdquo;  The recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, that control of planning cannot be left in the hands of elected representatives in light of the disclosure of corruption in the planning decision process makes sense until one examines the decisions taken concerning the proposed development of the Carlton site.  The recent TG4 documentary by D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Maolfabhail on the, to put it mildly, chequered history of the site demands a response from some quarter in defence of a city under siege apparently from our own publicly funded city planners.  Any modest residents&rsquo; association records minutes of meetings.  The startling disclosure by a city official that our city authority does not hold a written record of all meetings on the future development of the heart of our capital city is beyond belief.  Other Carlton site pre-planning meetings also took place with officials in the very Department charged with the protection of our heritage.  Can we assume that they kept the minutes of those meetings?  They should make interesting reading.  Is there contained within a record any official in the Department expressing the slightest concern at a developer&rsquo;s proposal to arbitrarily redraw the boundary of a national monument in his own commercial interest?  If not, why not?  After all, this is the very Department charged with the guardianship of our heritage.<\/p><p>  The apparent secrecy surrounding this proposed development of our city centre must now end.  It continues today with the astonishing absence of Chartered Land.  That elected city councillors were unaware of a contract drawn up in their name should be a matter of the gravest concern.  Was any other official in a Department aware of the contract drawn up in secrecy behind closed doors during the course of preplanning discussions?  There has been surprisingly little response to what has been rightly described in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald as a scandal.  This is not a planning application for a new kitchen extension in a suburban home; this is an application to invade and build on, over and under the protected area of a national monument designated in honour of the men and women of 1916.  This is the highest form of protection the State can bestow on a building or structure.  Put simply, we expect the State to honour that designation.  A national monument by its designation belongs to the people.<\/p><p>  There has been a shocking lack of vision on the part of those charged with the protection of the city culture, history and heritage over a long period, and a lack of consultation with those most affected, namely, its citizens.  There has been an abject failure on the part of State agencies, public officials and those charged with protecting our most recent history and heritage to protect the very heart of this city, the GPO-Henry Street-Moore Street area.  The area includes the 1916 battlefield site.  The Easter Rising was the only land engagement of any size fought in Britain and Ireland in the 20th century.  All buildings that bear witness to and form part of a battle are historic.  The difference between a battle that is written about and taught to our children and one that is largely forgotten can be summed up in one word &ndash; preservation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012110800010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Connolly Heron"},{"type":"speech","time":1352383800,"counter":719,"content":"<p>Mr. Connolly Heron&rsquo;s five minutes are up.

While it would be brilliant if we had the &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million it would take to implement the big plan, that money does not exist.  There is a strong possibility of funding the saving of No. 16 Moore Street and its three contextual buildings.  The Dublin City Council planners, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the other relevant authorities got their decision near enough right.  The planning permission that exists at present is the best that we could make of it.  We support the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012110800010#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1352383800,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Conway and call Mr. John Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012110800010#J01200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352383800,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting us to be present.

I believe it was a Professor Kealy who went a long way towards explaining that there is a psychological element to our natural, living, built, buried and cultural environment which is necessary for a social democratic country to understand.  For example, to deal with built heritage, when one walks down a street the architecture in that street and the manner in which it is presented to the public who utilise that street has a psychological impact on the people.  If the place is monolithic in its presentation, psychologically the people will feel oppressed and therefore when planning departments plan streets and so on they should be cognisant of those issues; it should be an educational requirement for those sitting in such seats of responsibility.<\/p><p>  Regarding No. 16 Moore Street and its environs, I am here as an environmental activist and a member of the Save No. 16 Moore Street.  In early 2003 I was asked by some people to have a look at Moore Street and specifically No. 16 Moore Street.  I was informed that about two years prior to that time a Save No. 16 Moore Street group had come into being which had lobbied Dublin City Council long and hard and eventually achieved its objective, through a unanimous vote in the chambers, to have No. 16 Moore Street put on the list of protected structures.  However, as is the case with ordinary people who have such interests but who are not activists they do not understand that when they achieve their aims through consensus, as voiced by someone earlier, they must ensure that what was achieved is brought to reality.  That is what happened.  They went home and two years later the site still has not been put on the list of protected structures, even though we had a unanimous vote on the issue in the city council chambers.<\/p><p>  I was asked if I could put my energies into it and in doing so I called a meeting of interested individuals in Tailors' Hall off High Street, Dublin.  At that meeting it was decided by everybody present that a committee should be formed to ensure No. 16 Moore Street is listed as a protected structure.  I had not intended going any further on that action that day as I had other interests in mind but I asked the people present if there were interested parties who would chair the committee.  There was a request from the floor that I take the chair but I said I was too busy.  That request was made three times and eventually I succumbed and carried it forward from that point.  I chaired a loosely run committee with little or no regulations; it was just free speech at the table to determine where we could go from that point.  Many members joined and left the committee for different reasons but about 18 months later, through strong lobbying of Dublin City Council, we again achieved a unanimous vote in chambers to have the building put on the list of protected structures.  We continued with the challenge and turned our face to central Government to seek national monument protection because listed protection does not afford great protection.  We got national monument protection.<\/p><p>  My argument at the committee was that we should argue to keep the houses on both sides of No. 16 Moore Street to keep some context to the single building.  The single building would be lost in the development but at least Nos. 15 and 17 would give it some context and we would have some room for a commemorative centre as opposed to a small museum.  I was first lambasted for that idea but we ran with it.  We mentioned it a few times but we continued to argue only for No. 16.  We succeeded in getting four houses put on the list of protected structures, the footfall of six houses designated as a national monument, four on Moore Street and two on back lanes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012110800011#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1352384400,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I must ask Mr. Dunne to conclude.

The national monument as it is currently designated is the buildings on Moore Street, Nos. 14 to 17, back as far as Moore Lane.  The planning permission proposed intends to intrude on 60% of that.  Professor Kealy mentioned the importance of not interfering with buildings.  The planning permission proposes putting staff toilets, kitchens and car parks under this national monument, which could well endanger the structures.<\/p><p>  When the campaign began Nos. 14 to 17 were seen to be very important.  We must keep in mind that Nos. 10 to 25, and the yards behind that, were all occupied.  There were approximately 300 volunteers and they occupied all of the yards and all of the buildings.  The proposal we are putting forward is that we return many of the buildings to their previous use, much as Professor Kealy suggested, namely, living accommodation, relevant shop accommodation not simply a commemorative centre.

I am a grand-niece of Mr. Joseph Plunkett, who was on the Moore Street site along with his two brothers, George and Jack.  I am a member of the group of relatives of the seven signatories.  The more I go to Moore Street, the more I find it extraordinary, emotional and deeply moving.  This has been the experience every time we brought somebody there.<\/p><p>  Every member of this committee should see the TG4 documentary <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&quot;Ini&uacute;chadh Oidhreacht na C&aacute;sca<\/font>&quot;, which must be one of the best documentaries ever to have been made in the country.  It is beautifully researched and the only documentary that tells the entire story.  It will shorten much of the committee's work if the members all watch it together.<\/p><p>  My second recommendation is one that the members probably feel they do not need.  I would like to take them on a journey from the door of the GPO, which was on fire, requiring 300 men to dash across Henry Street, under fire from snipers on the roof of the station, to where they got bottlenecked in Henry Place. <b><\/b>Henry Place was packed when filled with an army of 300 men and their five leaders .  They got stuck because of the sniper fire from the direction of the Rotunda.  They had to wait and go across in batches as Joseph Plunkett signalled by dropping his sabre.  Seventeen of them were wounded.  They were exhausted and very thirsty because there was no water in the GPO while it was on fire.  The buildings around it were heating it inordinately.  The soldiers got to Mrs. Cogan's house, broke down the door and entered.  She was cooking a ham and when she finished cooking it she gave it to them.  The Pearse brothers, who were closer to each other than others were to either of them throughout their lives, slept on the table upstairs.  They got up in the morning and everyone started burrowing through the houses in the way they had been trained to do; they were trained for urban warfare.  Eventually, the whole terrace was filled with men, as were the yards behind.  The leaders took their place in the middle as a place of safety.  Joseph Plunkett sat at the end of James Connolly's bed.  Connolly was in terrible pain owing to a gangrenous foot, which would have killed him had he not been shot first.  Plunkett was also dying, in his case with tuberculosis.<\/p><p>  Pearse looked out the window and saw, to his horror, the three members of the Dillon family, who were wrapped in sheets and carrying white flags, being shot down and killed by the artillery at the top of the street.  He said no more civilians should be killed.  He and the others got together, therefore, and agreed on a surrender.  Ms Elizabeth O'Farrell walked up the street on her own into the mouth of the guns with the surrender note for the British.  She walked down, and up and down again, and then back up with Pearse.  Both were arrested.<\/p><p>  Joseph Plunkett came out and stood in the middle of the street, on which there was nothing but bodies, and waited with his back to the guns for the men to line up.  They all combed their hair, washed their faces and brushed down their uniforms.  The Englishmen, the Liverpool men, and the Glasgowmen argued and were in tears in the belief that they would be shot immediately.  They wanted to continue fighting.  All lined up with their guns unloaded and marched in fours with their arms at the slope behind Willie Pearse and Joseph Plunkett, with Tom Clarke and Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada behind.  They marched back down Moore Street the way they had come, back through Moore Lane, Henry Place and Henry Street.  The marched up O'Connell Street where they laid down their arms outside the Gresham and then marched to the Rotunda where they were made lie on the ground overnight in the wet.  The next battalion that arrived, Edward Daly's men, was made to lie on top of them.  That was the beginning of the end of the British empire.<\/p><p>  The site is a huge battlefield, extending all the way from Prince's Street to Parnell Square and beyond.  If we can enhance it, we can do what makes people feel they are real and belong to the human race, and what makes them feel they have generations behind them.  It would make them feel connected to the whole world, including Australia, America and Africa, whose inhabitants also had to get rid of the empire.  The area to which I refer is very important and nothing should be done lightly.  If the monument is not ready for 2016, it does not matter; doing it right is what counts.  We owe this to ourselves, our forebears and future generations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012110800012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Honor &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352385000,"counter":742,"content":"<p>The committee wanted us to state our reason for being here.

The matter of works to the national monument site is still within process and obviously, any comments we make must take cognisance of that fact.  Professor Kealy's presentation was very interesting because one point it highlighted to everyone is the multiplicity of factors that must be taken into account in situations like this, which is far from being a black-and-white matter.  That was one reason the council commissioned the Shaffrey report in 2005, which we have circulated to members today, together with our presentation, and which is well worth reading by everyone if possible.<\/p><p>  Mention was made of the TG4 programme, of which the council has a very different view.  Moreover, some issues were raised today which are beyond the bounds of what I understood we were here to talk about.  However, I am happy to respond to this effect, namely, when I became city manager in late 2006, one of my very first meetings - that is the reason I remember it so clearly - debated this issue fully.  The situation was openly debated and the issues, some of which were referred to today, were dealt with at the time.  Indeed, some of the decisions prior to my becoming manager, either were lost in terms of the compulsory purchase order or withdrawn in terms of the agreement to which reference was made.  The city council is debating these issues again and a report was put before its members last Monday night dealing with those issues.  A further debate on the issues will be held on 19 November.<\/p><p>  Before I hand over to Mr. Jim Keogan to cover our written presentation in more detail, I will conclude by referring to the planning permission that was granted in 2008.  In effect, our decision was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and following a lengthy oral hearing, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted the permission in March 2010.  In making the decision, the board considered that the proposed development, as amended, and subject to compliance with the conditions it had set out, would constitute an appropriate mix and intensity of land use, would be compatible with the established pattern of development in the vicinity and would be acceptable in terms of impact on cultural heritage of the area, including the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, protected structures within the site and environs, and the historic street network.  The plan approved provided for the preservation of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street as a national monument.<\/p><p>  The fifth condition of the grant permission states that no work shall commence within the preservation order boundary of the national monument at Nos.14-17 Moore Street, unless prior ministerial consent to such works has been obtained in accordance with the statutory requirements of section 14 of the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004.  In compliance with this condition, Chartered Land has made an application to the Minister to carry out works in accordance with the approved plans and the decision is awaited.  I now ask Mr. Jim Keogan to take it from there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012110800013#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Tierney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352385600,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I wish to put in context the role of Dublin City Council in the redevelopment of the area.  The site of the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street is in close proximity to the GPO and both are situated in an area of the city that has suffered from urban blight and dereliction since the 1970s.  The physical appearance of this area has been a cause of concern to the city council, having regard to its historical, social and architectural significance for the nation.  A number of interventions have been made by the city council and the Government over the years to address these issues and problems.  The first was the preparation by Dublin City Council and subsequent approval by the Government in 1999, of an integrated area plan for O'Connell Street.  That plan was one of five approved for the city, which provided for a package of tax incentives to assist in the redevelopment and rejuvenation of targeted sites within the plan areas.  The Carlton sites form \"Site Cluster 1\" in the O'Connell Street integrated area plan, which was identified as having great potential and capacity to act as a catalyst for the redevelopment of that part of Upper O'Connell Street, which had been and is suffering from widespread dereliction.  The site of the national monument at Moore Street formed part of these designated lands.<\/p><p>  Subsequently, designation of O'Connell Street as an architectural conservation area took place in 2001.  This was the first architectural conservation area prepared for Dublin pursuant to the newly-introduced planning and development legislation in 2000.  The purpose of the designation was to give recognition and protection to the historical and architectural character of this area.  The GPO, together with the Carlton facade and other buildings, form part of this designated area.  Subsequent to the aforementioned designation, the area was also made an area of special planning control in 2003.  Again, the city council so designated the area and it was the first of its type on foot of the new planning and development legislation.  The purpose of the exercise was to regulate undesirable uses within the area and to give greater protection to the historical character of this primary main street of the capital.  Again, this designation was the first of its type for the city.<\/p><p>  I refer to Nos. 14-17 Moore Street and the site's inclusion on the record of protected structures.<\/p> <p>Up until 2006, Nos. 14-17 Moore Street had no conservation designation under the provisions of the planning Acts.  In 2005, Dublin City Council commissioned Shaffrey Associates, architects, and John Montague, urban historian, to carry out an architectural assessment of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.  Following consideration of the report, public submissions and the positive recommendation of the city manager, the members of the city council approved the inclusion of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street in the city council's record of protected structures.<\/p><p> A retail core strategy was prepared by Dublin City Council to address the continued decline in the retail offer in the city centre.  The continued migration of retail activity to the suburbs required specific interventions by way of policy initiatives.  The strategy was introduced by way of a variation to the then Dublin city development plan and identified sites within the north and south side retail areas suitable for redevelopment which could enhance and consolidate the city centre as the primary retail area for the region.  It should be noted that the lands at Upper O'Connell Street, inclusive of the Carlton site, were identified as one of these sites.  The strategy took cognisance of the protected status of the buildings, both in O'Connell Street and Moore Street, and would also provide the opportunity to integrate them into a renewed and vibrant city area, thereby further enhancing their status.<\/p><p> Nos. 14-17 Moore Street were subsequently designated as a national monument by the then Minister in 2007.  Between 2002 and 2006, Dublin City Council invested over &euro;20 million in the refurbishment of the O'Connell Street area.  This public investment in the area was to both stimulate and complement private investment which was also taking place.  It should be noted that 11 cluster sites were identified within the O&rsquo;Connell Street integrated area plan for tax designation.  Of these 11 sites, only two remain undeveloped, including the Carlton lands.  In 2008, a planning application was lodged with the city council for the comprehensive redevelopment of a 2.1 ha site situated between Upper O'Connell Street and Moore Street.  The site area included the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.  The applicants, Chartered Land, had assembled the site over several years and had engaged in a consultation process with stakeholders, including the city council members, prior to lodging their planning application.<\/p><p> The application was assessed having regard to the city development plan and the policy objectives of the various strategies and designations outlined above.  It should be noted that major modifications were made to the proposed scheme during this assessment process and a decision was made to grant permission in 2008.  The planning authority was satisfied in making this decision that the national monument was both respected but also would now be enhanced by forming an integral part of a larger, vibrant urban block.<\/p><p> The decision was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and following a lengthy appeal period that included an oral hearing, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted permission for a development in 2010.  The city council has been consistent over the past several decades in seeking the redevelopment of these lands at Upper O'Connell Street and Moore Street.  The city council has sought to achieve this redevelopment in a balanced fashion that respects the historical and architectural significance of the area but, at the same time, recognises the need for investment so as to address the serious urban blight and dereliction from which the area has long suffered.<\/p><p> Since the application by the developer for consent to carry out works on the national monument site was made, we understand further positive steps are being taken with the Minister's office to see if there is a way to reinforce and extend the commitment to appropriately commemorate the 1916 event.  We are not privy to these discussions at this point but when the environmental impact statement, required under new legislation passed in July, emanates from this process it will go on public display, submissions will be taken and the council will also be formally consulted.  It may well be that a proposal that addresses various concerns still being expressed can be achieved through this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012110800013#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Keogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352386200,"counter":747,"content":"<p>For the purposes of making efficient use of the delegations&rsquo; and our own time, will members ask questions?

That would be our ideal position.  If it applied in Singapore, Hong Kong, New York and Tokyo as well as in London and the European centres, we would go along with it.  Our next position, in order of descent, would be that if a financial transaction tax was agreed across the 27 members, we could also agree to that.  Our fear is agreement to any lesser group having a financial transaction tax in which the United Kingdom would not participate.  Some 33,000 people here work in financial services and we believe that if a financial transaction tax were introduced here and not in the United Kingdom, activity would migrate from Dublin to London, resulting in a loss of part of the industry and some jobs.  On the other hand, we can see the merits and principles of a financial transaction tax.  In the event of a group of nine, ten or 11 member states agreeing a financial transaction tax, we will not seek to put barriers in the way of its being introduced elsewhere.  <\/p><p>  What is currently being discussed is a form of stamp duty on share transactions and other financial transactions.  A low level of 0.1% is the tentative suggestion, although that is not a hard proposal.  In Ireland, we already have a stamp duty on transactions in shares, which stands at 1%.  What is being debated is not particularly out of line with what we are doing, although what we are doing is at a higher level than what is being contemplated.  Listening to the contributions of colleague Ministers around the table, I found there was no common view across the 11 member states that have signed the enhanced co-operation request.  Each has its own attitude.  As such, it might be quite difficult to get agreement when it comes down to the particularities of a tax, even among the 11 concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800004#C00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1352367600,"counter":805,"content":"<p>As I understand it, from what the Minister had to say this morning, Ireland will not be engaging in the first round of discussions on this issue but is taking an observational position.

I do not believe there is a question of Ireland foregoing any tax.  That is conceived so far on the basis of what has progressed.  Our tax take for the 1% stamp duty will be in excess of any possible take that will accrue from a financial transaction tax.  A number of other issues are running parallel to this.  There is agreement among the 11 member states concerned that a financial transaction tax is in principle a good idea.  However, what to do with that financial transaction tax is a matter of debate.  Some people believe that as per the Tobin tax, with which Members will be familiar, it be used to fund non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in under-developed countries.  Another cohort of people think it should be used in the area of climate change, to reduce carbon emissions and so on.  The stronger view now is that it would form a separate stream of direct funding for the European Union.  Currently, this funding is provided by way of contributions from member states.  The thinking now is in terms of a separate stream funded by a financial transaction tax and, possibly, other means in the future.

The Minister said in his concluding remarks that Ireland would focus on delivering in all respects on the commitments already agreed to by the Heads of State and Government, including those of 29 June.  I assume we can take that as relating to our bank debt in particular.  It is well recognised that there are two aspects to our bank debt, namely, the &euro;30 billion associated with the promissory note and the &euro;29 billion associated with our pillar bank investment.  On the promissory note, there has been an expectation for some time that a technical paper would be produced setting out a mechanism by which some form of resolution would come about.  In this regard, discussions since June have focused on trying to resolve the cost to the taxpayer of the investment that had to be made in our pillar banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800004#C00800","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352368200,"counter":809,"content":"<p>The decisions of the Council on 29 June were much wider than any commitments made to Spain or Ireland.  The primary decision at that Council was for banking union, and that consists of the three pillars of supervision across Europe, a mechanism whereby insolvent banks across the eurozone and the Union would be resolved centrally by a European mechanism, and a guarantee scheme through insurance for depositors across the Union.  The best way to understand it is to consider how banks work in the United States.  If a bank fails in Texas, the Texan authorities would not have the responsibility for the resolution of the institution.  There would be no big fuss and it is part of the system.<\/p><p>  In that context the commitment was made to separate banking debt from sovereign debt.  In this light, a commitment was also made to the possibility of a direct recapitalisation of Spanish banks through use of the European Stability Mechanism, and then there would be examination of the sustainability of the Irish debt position, with all sovereigns treated equally.<\/p><p>  It is true to say we are pursuing, as the Deputy noted, both sets of negotiations.  We are engaging on the promissory note, as we have been for some time.  The deadline in that regard is effectively the next payment date, which is 31 March next year.  We are not waiting until then but pushing for an earlier resolution on that.  There is also a position on the trading pillar banks and how we might be recompensed for the fact that the Irish taxpayer ultimately carried the responsibility for recapitalising both Bank of Ireland and AIB.<\/p><p>  The Deputy knows from the statement of 29 June on banking union that before any direct recapitalisation of the banking system in Europe can occur, the supervisory aspect of the banking union must be put in place and seen to be working.

Unless we get something in that order, the model predicts we would find it difficult to have a sustainable debt position.<\/p><p>  What is the Minister's expectation in that regard?  I have seen some modelling done by a number of economists and the IMF indicating that the impact would be relatively minor on our overall debt position because of an elongation of the repayment associated with the promissory note.  The significant positive impact on our debt position would be a return to the State of something in the order of &euro;24 billion to &euro;25 billion, which was invested in the pillar banks.

It is used colloquially, such as when people say it will be very hard for Ireland to deal with servicing this bank debt with sustainability.  When people use it in debate, they do not mean we will default but rather that life is being made difficult for everybody and taxpayers in particular.  It is also used in a very narrow sense, effectively meaning that if a country's debt position is not sustainable, the country will default.  In the first sense I agree with the Deputy and the IMF analysis but in the second sense I do not.  There is no question of us defaulting.  The position is that if our debt peaks at 120% or 121%, we can still service it and it remains sustainable in that sense.  Nevertheless, it would put a very severe burden on the taxpayer, and the amount of resources dedicated to servicing a debt of that level would inhibit growth rates.  The Secretary General of the Department, in speaking to the committee yesterday, used the metaphor of driving a car with the handbrake on.  When speaking about sustainability, particularly with regard to the IMF, it is not an inability to pay that is discussed but rather the difficulty in paying, the burden placed on the taxpayer and the inhibition of growth rates.<\/p><p>  There have been various interchanges since 29 June, particularly involving the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel, and both on the telephone and in face-to-face meetings.

He reaffirmed the position of Chancellor Merkel so there is nothing new to add to the position already stated.  It has been recited, parsed and analysed on a number of occasions in the joint statements made by the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel and after the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and I met Mr. Sch&auml;uble.

Of course, the interest payments can continue but that would be at the cost of impoverishing the Irish people and diverting resources that should be going into desperately needed public investment, for example, into paying the national debt.

Of that amount 40% is the transfer of bank debt onto the sovereign.  If we did not have to carry the burden of bank debt on the sovereign then the debt GDP ratio would be somewhere over 80% and would be one of the lowest in the European Union.  The average debt of the euro group is about 94% and we would be well under if we did not have to carry the burden.  The purpose behind the two pieces of negotiations is that we envisage a reduction in the burden on the Irish taxpayer thus making it more sustainable.  In blunt language, to reduce the imposition of the servicing of the debt on the taxpayer is the purpose behind the two pieces of negotiations but I cannot predict the outcome.  The Taoiseach has explained the policy position in great detail and the lines that we are pursuing to secure a better deal for Ireland.

However, it is not yet finalised so I cannot give the precise figures in advance, but that is the tendency or trend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800007#F00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1352369400,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I wish to deal with two issues.  The first is the cost of funds to our banking system at present.  I also wish to hear about the Minister's strategy for the ultimate sale of the banks and how the cost of funds will play into that.  The ECB is reducing the amount of funding it is providing to our pillar banks.  There are many strategies one can use to sell a bank and many different forms of funding can be used.  One can have direct funding from the European Central Bank, personal deposits, corporate deposits or wholesale markets.  In any business model one tries to buy low and sell at a higher price, but we are doing the reverse of that at present.  AIB lost &euro;1 billion last year.  Has the Minister had discussions with President Van Rompuy about trying to provide us with more funding directly from the European Central Bank as we move forward?  We talk about trying to capitalise the bank through the ESM.  That can be done in a less onerous way than going to the markets.  AIB representatives appeared before this committee last week and said they have commenced negotiations with potential investors.  However, if we go to the private markets to sell our shareholding in Bank of Ireland and AIB, we will require multi-strand forms of funding going forward.  I have a preference for going to the ESM.  The reason is that I believe there is a strong argument to be made for our banks to be predominantly funded through the European Central Bank.  It would be a great deal cheaper and less onerous.  Also, it would be a way of dealing ultimately with personal debt.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800007#F00400","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speech","time":1352369400,"counter":828,"content":"<p>First, how are the banks funded?  They take in deposits, and the deposit flow into the banks has increased.  If one looks at the project as a repair of the banking system, the fact they are getting an increased flow of deposits is a good indicator that people with savings believe the banks are being repaired.  They are now at the stage where I think interest rates on deposits will probably come down because they have a strong flow of deposits.  Much of their funding also comes from the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, funding from the European Central Bank.  However, it is not that the ECB is cutting back on the amount of funding available but that with the increased intake of deposits and the deleveraging of the banking system, the Irish banks require less than they did previously.  It is a demand-driven scheme rather than a supply-driven scheme.<\/p><p>  On the sale of the banks, one would look first at values.  We own 15% of Bank of Ireland.  We also have preference shares there which will be taken out at some point.  We own 99% of AIB, effectively the whole shareholding.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund calculates values and it puts a value of between &euro;8 billion and &euro;10 billion on this.  This year's figure was revised earlier this year; it was &euro;8.1 billion.  Last year's figure was &euro;8 billion.

As a Member of the Oireachtas, however, it is very difficult to hear.<\/p><p>  The Minister made some fantastic speeches in opposition, including calling the payments to bondholders a disaster and an obscenity and asking how any Government could stand over them.  The Minister laid out why he is doing it and, although I do not agree with all of what he is doing, I understand why he is doing it.  Some 40% of the debt is not ours.  The markets do not believe there is no chance of default and have factored in a greater than 40% chance of default, reflected in the sovereign risk premium.

Three things struck me when I looked through the paper.  The two main reinforced steel joists of the meeting are the capitalisation of the banks and the role of a central European banking supervisor.  The rest of the issues are packed in around those two issues.  There is a darkening shadow of debt over Europe.  Politicians across the eurozone are beginning to understand that there has been a criminal capture by the financial system of the budgets of eurozone countries.  The financial transactions tax might have had an earlier origin with other ideas for funding different efforts across European Union countries, but it is now essentially converting itself into an insurance fund for banks.  They get the uneasy feeling that the balance sheets of the 6,000 banks across the eurozone are not as healthy as they have tried to fool everybody about.  We had our own banks in last week.  The sort of good news from Anglo Irish Bank was that the final estimate of its loan losses might be &euro;25 billion, rather than between &euro;29 billion and &euro;36 billion.

The prudential capital assessment review assesses the capital requirements arising from expected base and potential stressed loan losses and other financial developments over the medium term and was published in March 2011.  The covered institutions are well capitalised at levels of around 15% to 16%.  These capital levels for tier one capital ratios are clearly well above the minimum of 10.5% required by the Central Bank.  The recent European Banking Authority capital raising exercise did not require further injections into the Irish banks.

Some European countries are in recession at the moment and, indeed, we are one of the stronger countries in terms of growth rates.  We had a growth rate of 1.4% last year, better than the budget provision of 0.7% for this year and somewhere around the middle of the forecast for next year.  We will see in a fortnight's time what the figures will be.  Obviously, if we have stronger growth rates our tax take will increase, our deficit will decrease and more people will go back to work.  Our model is export-led growth and because of that we need growth in the European Union because Europe is such a big customer of ours.  We need growth in Europe to get maximum effect from the model of recovery we are using.  Approximately 20% of our exports go to the United States of America, a further 20% go to the United Kingdom but 40% go to the European Union, with the remainder going to the rest of the world.  One can see from those figures the importance of growing European economies in terms of demand for Irish exports of both goods and services.  We would like to see a European solution that addresses growth and jobs, and the Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions that the main theme of the Irish Presidency will be the growth and jobs agenda.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked how Europe is going at the moment.  It is more settled than it was six months ago but many problems remain to be addressed.  The Greek problem continues but we hope that progress will be made on that in the coming weeks.  Spain still has its difficulties, as Deputies will know from reading the newspapers.  Italy, too, has its own difficulties.  Places like Cyprus and Slovenia have very big banking problems.  Individual countries within the EU all have their own programmes for strengthening their own economies.  The difficulties in Europe are not behind us but significant progress has been made.  The next big European project is banking union.  That should be very helpful to the integrity of the eurozone and the wider ECOFIN zone.

We are of the view that a regulator is necessary both in the context of taking the profits to which I refer and to regulate the market in a certain way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800014#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen O'Meara"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352373600,"counter":962,"content":"<p>My name is Ronan Lyons and I am speaking today on behalf of the Smart Taxes Network.

As part of its presentation and in the context of the interests of its retail members, I am sure IBEC will state that the smuggling of tobacco is increasingly becoming a problem.  If one sets aside the health issues and concentrates on the product, it is evident that there is smuggling and criminality on a massive scale and that, as a result, the Exchequer is losing huge amounts of revenue.  Further increases in the price of tobacco are merely going to compound the problem.  As Deputy Dara Murphy stated earlier in the context of price elasticity, increasing the price can often lead to unintended consequences.  Perhaps our guests might comment on that aspect.<\/p><p>  On the introduction of a site valuation property tax, a particular issue arises.  This relates to the position of those who own high value houses which are situated on low value land versus people who own low value houses which are situated on high value land.  How fair is Smart Taxes Network's proposal in respect of this matter?  It could be criticised because it suggests that more money be taken - in the form of a wealth tax - from those who fall into the latter of the two categories to which I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800014#N00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352373600,"counter":964,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that tobacco smuggling is a very big issue.

From figures supplied through the Revenue Commissioners, we have been able to identify that the tobacco industry takes 21% of the retail price.  In the UK, that figure is much lower.  This is the gap that we are considering.  I did not have an opportunity earlier to explain how the companies have done this in an interesting way.  Generally, there is a price increase in every budget.  In recent years, that increase has been in cent.  Despite the fact that the tobacco industry approaches people such as the Deputy, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and argues against price increases, it increases its own prices while the Government increases taxes on tobacco in the budget.  Therefore, it widens its profit take and keeps its profits high.  This fact has not been identified prior to our work.  We are looking in that direction for profit.  Normally, we would ask for a tax increase and we are not ruling it out.

The vacant landbanks on the edges of towns would not be hit in a tax liability sense.  Their value would be increased relative to everywhere else and their owners would be given free money by the rest of society.<\/p><p>  An element of the impact should be stressed.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has discussed his desire for the regeneration of town centres.

The one good thing that came out of the Budget Statement was the application of guidelines to insist that the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, would engage with vulnerable tenants and potentially reduce rents.  We meet NAMA officials every six weeks and they are doing that.  They have reduced rents in the majority of cases for vulnerable tenants.  We would like those guidelines to be applied to other State landlords in the upcoming budget such as the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which is currently increasing rents for tenants in Cork, and local authorities, which are forcing through rent increases on top of untenable rents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800017#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Fitzsimons"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352375400,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>Essentially we have two key principles in our budget submission this year.

Second, we need measures to support the restoration of consumer confidence in the domestic market.  With regard to the cost of employment, the budget is all about the threats rather than necessarily what we want in it.  The kites that have been flown so far have destroyed investment and expansion in the interim because people are so worried about measures such as employer's PRSI increasing, mandatory pension provision and the transfer of four weeks of sick pay onto employers.  Anything that adds to the cost of hiring somebody will militate against employers creating jobs in exactly the same fashion as the slashing of the redundancy rebate last year killed off the transfer of businesses.  One cannot buy a business now because the risks are too high.  We want the Government to job-proof all policies and to make an assessment of the impact on jobs of the implementation of various measures.  That is the key and critical message.  We have many tax proposals in the submission that might help small businesses, in particular in the area of finance and improving cashflow, and I can take questions about those, but the key message is not to increase costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800017#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan"},{"type":"speech","time":1352375400,"counter":1014,"content":"<p>With respect to Mr. Fitzsimons's opening statement, the committee made a recommendation yesterday afternoon having met Mr. Moran, the Secretary General in the Department of Finance on that matter.

That means when the seasonal peak arrives at Christmas, there is a necessity to hire many more temporary employees than we used to.  It is our contention that between 30,000 and 35,000 will be employed this Christmas.  The problem our members have is it is challenging to make these appointments because people on social welfare find it a challenge to get back on welfare when the work finishes.  It takes six to eight weeks for them to resume their welfare payments and they are bereft of cash to live off during that period.  Thus, they will not take advantage of the opportunity to work temporarily and that is a concern.

It relates to the general principle of how the welfare system works.  We need to move to an hour-based system.  The reality is our system derives from the concept of the five-day week.  Most businesses operate a seven-day week and, for example, nursing homes need people for a few hours in the morning and a few in the afternoon.  The system, therefore, needs to be redesigned in the sense that it should not hamper anyone to take up employment.  Signing on or off should be fluid.  If the welfare system can be integrated more directly with the Revenue, given employers are supplying Revenue with the relevant information when they set up employees on the tax system, it should be a simple process to offset one against the other to ensure people do not lose out.  However, seasonal sectors such as the fishing industry present huge problems in terms of practical details.  Even where up to three months' work is available, there is no incentive for people to take it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800017#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan"},{"type":"speech","time":1352375400,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>I welcome the REI and SFA representatives.

These are the top issues for people thinking about whether to create jobs.  In the context of the budget, we need to move it out of peak business cycles and have uncertainty squashed fairly fast.  One of our five key messages is not only to have an annual budget but to know what will hit us over the coming three years.  Uncertainty kills decision making.  If it is bad news and people know about it, they can decide to invest and plan accordingly.  It is critical to the restoration of confidence.<\/p><p>  With regard to cost, people are struggling to pay wages at the end of the week so anything that increases costs will militate against their decisions to hire people.  One particular example concerns the redundancy rebate reducing from 60% to 15%.  If someone with 20 years service was eligible for the maximum of &euro;600 per week, the overall redundancy payment amounts to &euro;24,600 and, under current rules, the company must come up with an additional &euro;11,070.  For every person the company was going to make redundant, it must now get rid of two people because the bank will not supply money to fund redundancies.  There is no incentive for people on the margin to continue to trade or to sell a business.  It makes people go into the insolvency fund.  It is nonsense and was not thought through.  The approach of the Department of Social Protection concerns its own budget.  We need a whole of Government perspective.  There is no point in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation writing an action plan for jobs with 200 good ideas when, in one fell swoop, negative decisions wipe out that good.  That is why we need consensus.<\/p><p>  I have never taken so many calls and e-mails from our members about any single issue as about the sick pay issue.  They cannot understand it.  In the case of our nearest neighbours, Northern Ireland, people are paid at half the rate here.  Employers there pay the sum in the first instance but reclaim the amount through the income tax system.  It will also put us at a competitive disadvantage.  Across Europe, there is no consistency in systems in terms of clarity, despite the Minister's comments.  The briefing arranged by the Minister had experts flown in from the UK who spent two years analysing this, including consultation, examining medical issues, the problem of certification, and systems and cost problems, and they decided not to change the system because of the recession and the dramatic negative impact it would have on businesses and growth.  Ireland has done no analysis, despite the Minister's promise of a cost-benefit analysis.  The Minister promised she would exempt small companies up to 100 employees, which was promptly revoked by her officials.  In this malaise of uncertainty, people are making decisions and have stopped creating jobs because they are worried about what will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800018#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan"},{"type":"speech","time":1352376000,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.

There have been PRSI exemption schemes to support companies hiring long-term unemployed people and those coming off JobBridge.  The problem with the schemes is that they have been underused relative to their value.  Small companies are not tax experts and the scheme does not really resonate.  One of the proposals, which is under discussion, is that it should be simplified.  The proposal should be to give businesses &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 to take people on.  This is plain language and is why measures such as the special savings incentive account scheme worked all those years ago.  That would be better than the tax system.  In real terms, we have experienced nothing but increased taxation on labour.  The marginal tax rate for self-employed people is 55% and 52% for employees, which is one of the highest in Europe.  It is a deterrent and we should be incentivising people to work.  A tax on labour is a disincentive to work.<\/p><p>  We welcome the reduction of business costs but it is mainly in the private sector.  Government-imposed charges and fees have increased.  It is business to business negotiation that has seen the benefit.  It is no great feat that commercial rates have been frozen when rents have dropped by 20% or 30% in real terms.  Rates have not dropped to the same extent even though we have years of deflation.  There was no deflation in rates.  The whole system is unfair.  Why is the business community paying for the public good?  It is not receiving a service in return.  The whole system must be completely revisited and we are disappointed that, in the programme for Government, even if the &euro;500 million of efficiencies in local authorities is achieved, it will do nothing to help businesses.  Instead, it will offset the central Government contribution.  The proposal is not to split it equally with ratepayers so rates will remain the same.<\/p><p>  Members may be aware of the revaluation process at present, which will take ten to 15 years to get around the country.

We are where we are.  No one wants to be here but we are borrowing &euro;1 billion a month to fund our public services.  Given that position, we must make choices.  In our analysis, as Mr. Ronan Lyons has said, property tax is the least damaging to economic development and growth.  The only way we are going to exit this crisis is by growth and by allowing businesses to get on with their jobs and try to create more jobs.  I hope we will all agree on that.  Our position is not incongruous.  It is about hard choices.  In making those choices, we accept that it will take money out of people's pockets and we do not want that to happen.  It has to happen somewhere, however, and it is better that we tax assets, and a property tax is a wealth tax.  <\/p><p>  With regard to our analysis of the social welfare bill, it is a reality that we got carried away during the Celtic tiger years.  The Department of Social Protection's statistical information on social services for 2010 states that the rates of short-term payments had increased by 80.5% in 2010 on a baseline of 2001.  During that time the consumer price index, CPI, went up by 21.7%.  Our social welfare rates went up at four times the cost of living.  They are completely out of line with international trends.  We certainly do not have a slave population.  We have the second highest minimum wage in Europe, which is something our members are having to deal with.<\/p><p>  Our analysis of youth unemployment is based on a UK model of trying to incentivise people who have never had a job to go and find work.  Schemes such as JobBridge have been successful, but JobBridge could be much more successful.  Some 2,000 of the internships that were advertised attracted no applicants.  We have an issue with making work attractive and encouraging people.  While I accept that there are not enough jobs for everyone, there is a mismatch that we need to get to the bottom of.  This has to do with delivering on Pathways to Work and the Department of Social Protection engaging better with employers.  We all have a common aim, which is to exit the crisis and to have a better life for all our people.  The way to do that is to give someone a job, rather than leave them floundering on welfare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800019#S00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan"},{"type":"speech","time":1352376600,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>Both submissions make the same point about cuts rather than taxes.

When everything is in balance, as Mr. Ronan Lyons said in the previous submission, one can have a tax from the notional income that comes from owning sites or land, depending on whether the land is residential, commercial, retail or whatever.  When in balance, an economy can put a demand on the owners of land for a contribution towards the general purse.  When, however, the revenues of the State have suffered a sudden drop off a precipice and when expenditure is way above revenue, one has to look to revenue, temporarily, as bridging financing for the readjustment programme in order to maintain fairness as well as take a reality check, to use Ms Callan's own words.<\/p><p>  There is income.

Points Nos. 1, 2 and 3 under that heading are imaginative, creative and realistic.<\/p><p>  I come back, however, to the fundamental point that one should not presume that taxes cannot provide the short-term three year bridging financing to carry &euro;1.25 billion of the readjustment programme without hurting the economy, as Deputy Joe Higgins has said.  The indigenous economy, GNP, is worth &euro;130 billion while GDP is &euro;150 billion or more.  The one that everyone in Europe talks about is GDP but this country is, realistically, on GNP.  For our 250,000 employees, it is GNP that counts.  We must get this message across to people listening in from abroad.  It is not happening.  They do not understand the household and business debt burdens on our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800019#S00900","speaker":"1027","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352377200,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm nach raibh m&eacute; anseo ag t&uacute;s an chur i l&aacute;thair.  It is correct that when we frame these conversations we must be cognisant of the catastrophe that has happened in the sector.  It would not be fair to do otherwise.<\/p><p>  With regard to the budgetary process, we met the troika and it was quite shocked at how long the process is in Ireland.  It really starts in July when the discussions begin in public.  Many of the sector's issues focus on cost base.  That is logical because it is an item that could be under the control of the State.  Obviously, demand has collapsed so I would like to hear more from the witnesses about how to stimulate demand in the economy.  On jobs retention, Germany has a system under which viable companies can put in a proposal whereby over a small period of time, perhaps a year or 18 months, they get some level of support from the state to help them keep their employees employed.  That stops after the specified period.<\/p><p>  There is a view that the issue of upward-only rent reviews is dead and buried, but there are possibilities.  We could legislate for a reduction in the length of rental contracts.  I understand that rental contracts in this State are far longer than the European average.  A reduction of those rental contracts would allow for the frozen high rents to come to an end sooner, which would be in everybody's interest.<\/p><p>  Have the witnesses considered the idea of a progressive rates base, whereby the rates take is not changed but the balance of who pays the rates changes?  In other words, a small firm that is not making a profit would pay slightly lower rates than a large multinational that is making a larger profit.  Therefore, typically a rate would be based upon the type and size of the business as well as taking into consideration the profitability of the business.<\/p><p>  What are the witnesses' views on those issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800020#T00200","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352377200,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>To take the latter point first, I disagree with rates based on profit.

Indeed, last Saturday evening, we, along with the President of Ireland, interviewed the winner of the store of the year, who has hired many people over recent years despite the recession.  He is a good retailer.  I do not wish that guy to be incentivised with lower rates if he becomes unprofitable.  The fundamental issue with rates, regardless of how they are structured, is that we get service.  One pays a service charge in shopping centres.  There are weekly and monthly service charge meetings, accounts are put up on the board, everybody has their say and they decide what the shopping centre will do.  They spend the money and do it transparently.  Currently, we have these beautiful big glass boxes called local authority buildings sitting in county towns, but there is very little transparency.  There is a parade to announce the fact that the path was slightly improved or a bit of damage was rectified, but they are not dealing with vacancy, dereliction, street lighting or crime.  Next week, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, our organisation, Chambers Ireland and the County and City Managers' Association are coming together to devise a way forward for our town centres.

That is fundamental.  From the business community's perspective in terms of stimulating our investment and looking at expansion, notwithstanding the absence of customers there are the problems of credit and credit flow that were mentioned earlier.  To refer back to the tax measures that could help, we believe it is important to introduce a roll-over type of relief in the budget whereby we can incentivise entrepreneurs who sell a business to reinvest in another business.  That will help in terms of investment finance for new start-ups, which will be critical for creating an enterprise culture as we move forward.  We propose moving to a VAT cash receipts basis.  We understand that moving from &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million is no problem with the EU and can be done straight away.  It would massively impact and help companies with their cashflow, which would allow them to invest more which, hopefully, will build confidence.<\/p><p>  We also believe there should be specific examination of releasing personal pensions.  It is ironic that when owner managers put money into a pension pot when they could afford it, they were allowed to invest in property and equity but not in business.  It is an absurd system.

I welcome you to the committee.  I will begin by asking Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy about his proposal on property tax, where he stated that he is in favour of the site valuation model as opposed to the valuation model.  There are arguments for and against this, one of which is that the site valuation model does not provide the type of gatekeeping that a true valuation model would have.  For example, in the early 1990s if a person was earning &euro;35,000 his or her house would, perhaps, have been worth &euro;50,000.  People saw their house values increase to &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000 but their salary did not increase with it.  There would have been an immediate question as to the level of taxation on people's property not meeting that of their income.  I would like to hear more on that issue.<\/p><p>  The universal pension system was also mentioned.  Perhaps Dr. Healy would elaborate his views on that issue.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Tom McDonnell proposes an 0.35% tax on residential property.  How did he arrive at that rate?

Does he propose that it apply to all citizens, regardless of annual income and household income?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800021#W00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352377800,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to appear before it.

The most important thing I would like to say to the committee is that at the core of any issue around budget is the question of consistency in government policy, what might be called coherence in government policy.  What I am saying is that the Government should not have a series of policies that are working in different directions.  For example, the most important issue that needs to be addressed within the overall budget context is to face up to the fact that the current set of proposals on the budgetary adjustment aimed at producing a borrowing reduction of &euro;3.5 billion in 2013 is not a consistent or coherent position.  The reason being that the way it is set up, there is a ratio of almost 2:1, that is &euro;2 in cuts for every &euro;1 in tax increases.  If the Government persists with that policy it will not be able to meet other objectives, such as protecting vulnerable people or core public services, whether those services are delivered by the State, the private sector or the community and voluntary sector or combinations of one, two or three of those.  That is not doable if the Government continues to move in that direction.<\/p><p>  Another point about the same issue is that the overall low tax take in Ireland is not sustainable given the commitments the Government is already engaged in on a range of fronts.  One the one side, the Government is trying to reduce borrowing which is desirable and has to be done.  On the other side it is trying to ensure public services are maintained and delivered at a frequency and capacity that people require.  People are trying to provide those services and maintain what is available with far less of a tax take than any other country in a similar position.  One might say the Government is trying to deliver European Union levels of service with American levels of taxation and I do not believe that is possible.  In that context what is needed is more coherence and consistency in policy. What we would be looking at therefore is the service levels that people want and how they are to be delivered, the level of social protection and so on.  We also need to consider what is possible in terms of a fair taxation system and if there is a shortfall of a certain amount how then can those services be delivered.  Does the tax take have to be increased or do we have to find other ways of doing it?  The point is that there should not be an attempt to do the impossible.<\/p><p>  I wish to make one other reservation and then respond to the two questions.  Social Justice Ireland is strongly of the view that Ireland cannot get itself out of its present predicament without getting a serious break on the debt issue and that does not mean extending it, unless for 20 years, such as getting a bond and paying it in 20 years time.  That is not the way to go unless one goes with the Karl Whelan proposal that we pay it all back in 3.1 billion years at the rate of &euro;1 per year, with the interest to be paid at the end.  Clearly it is a rather facetious proposal but it is trying to make a simple point that it is not possible with Ireland's current levels of debt, which are rising, to get ourselves out of this spiral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800021#W00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352378400,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Healy to conclude answering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800022#X00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352378400,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>We propose that there should be a substantial off-the-books investment in a program to generate jobs.

We are proposing that the Government does two things in the budget.  On the one side it should offer tax relief at the standard rate for pension contributions so that it is no longer available at 41%.  At the moment some 80% of pension contribution tax breaks go to top 20% of earners.  Therefore the richest 20% in the country get 80% benefit from the tax break.  For the sake of consistency in policy, coherence and trying to benefit everybody, it would be much more sensible to stop that, make it available at the 20% rate for everybody and use the money not to write off debt but to create a universal pension.  At the moment there is a need for that type of initiative.  Some 46,000 women in Ireland do not have a right to a pension of any kind and never will.  This is an issue that has been ignored by successive governments for three decades.  It is an historical issue about how pensions developed in Ireland.  People never got into the system or were taken out of the system going back to the times of the marriage bar and such like.  The 46,000 women would be covered in this because it would be universal.

That is a fairer system and is a redistribution from the top 20% throughout the system, picking up the holes and closing them off.  That is what we would do with the universal pension.<\/p><p>  On property tax, we favour a site value tax.  The easiest way to calculate it is by paying a tax on the basis of the services that have been put into the site by the taxpayer in the first place.  For example, if a particular area has many services, then the site value has been increased dramatically by the taxpayer putting money into that area.  Another geographical area might have little or no taxpayers support put in.  In such cases we believe the site value has not been enhanced by the public purse.

For consistency with the Government's position we have decided rather than necessarily implicit support for stating that a budge adjustment of &euro;3.5 billion is the appropriate amount, we have to the greatest extent possible attempted to adhere to the Government's triple lock although not fully.  In proposing our composite set of proposals to an adjustment of &euro;3.5 billion we have considered the wide body of empirical literature and radical literature as to which types of tax have which types of effects.  These include long-term effects, short-term effects, sustainability, efficiency, social justice, equity and so on.  We have considered all of these issues and it is in that context that we make our proposals.<\/p><p>  I echo Dr. Healy's points on debt sustainability and the need for a deal on the banking debt, but we can come back to that.  The Chairman asked me specifically about the property tax.  The evidence is very clear.  Recurrent, as opposed to transaction, tax on immovable property is the most efficient and sustainable tax over the long-term.  If properly designed, it can be equitable.  For example a recurrent tax, which is a flat tax, such as the one that is in place at the moment is of course not equitable.  It is a question of how the system is designed and to what extent waivers are given and so on.  We advocate having no waivers and rather having an ability-to-pay-based deferral system.  This ensures the integrity of the funding or revenue source over the long term because it will eventually accrue to the Exchequer in the form of capital acquisitions tax being supplemented by a<i> lien<\/i> on the house or as part of the subsequent transactions.  Therefore it is sustainable over the longer term and because it is a known resource coming in over the longer term, the bond markets and everybody else can regard that revenue as being stable, which is not true in the case of, for example, stamp duty.<\/p><p>  We picked a tax which is market-based in the short term but have given great consideration to the concept of a land or a site valuation tax over the long-term.  Ultimately the current market value of the asset is the amount a buyer will pay for it rather than some notional value which will be subjective pending rezonings and so forth.  Dr. Healy spoke about the services provided and of course the market value will reflect the services in the area, whether it be a Luas line, motorways, shops and so forth.  Therefore a property in Ballyvourney which is identical in every way to a property in Ballsbridge except for location will be valued at a much lower price because of the amenities available in Ballsbridge.  As property prices increase and decrease, it will obviously impact on the revenue to the State, but because the value of tax increases as the price of the property increases, it acts as a dampening effect, both up and down, on the fluctuations in property prices over the medium and long-term thereby helping to prevent future crises.  Nevertheless the advantages of the site valuation system are also very enticing.  We have proposed that it should be a 0.35% levy which should apply to all residential properties except for those for social housing, for housing homeless people and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800022#X01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352379000,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>I welcome both contributors and thank them for their presentations.  I would like to focus for a minute on the property tax.  I do not agree with the notion of a site valuation tax.  Support for or against it is, I suppose, based on one's general experience.  There is usually a nice social mix of housing in rural villages.  Often there could be one large house, built by a professional who had the means to do so, next door to a more modest house which meets the needs of its occupants and is on a site of the same value as the large house.  For this reason, I would be concerned about concentrating our focus on a site valuation tax.  I am interested in hearing Dr. Sean Healy's view, given his understanding of social mix and the dispersal of population, on how a site valuation tax might work negatively in this regard.  While it may not necessarily lead to ghettoisation, it could impact negatively on the way in which rural parts of Ireland nicely knit together.

There are other ways of dealing with that, namely, an income or wealth tax or a combination of both on people with higher income who have built the larger homes which are worth more.<\/p><p>  What we attempted to do was to link the tax with what has already been done with taxpayers' money.

Ultimately, basing the tax on the value of the wealth asset - the property, be it principle or private - should be the basic system employed.  It is possible to have a maximum cap in terms of the proportion of income a person would pay.  Again, we would advocate that that would be a parity, ability to pay and deferral system.  While over the longer term the risks <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> ghettoisation or gentrification do appear, unfortunately every tax and public service created has a behavioural effect on the economy.  There is no doubt about that.  There are winners, losers and unintended consequences, as evidenced from some of the property based tax reliefs over the past decade, which relate to other factors.<\/p><p>  We are calling for the tax to be introduced in this year's budget and to apply from next year.  It needs to be done quickly and at a reasonably high level and should probably be increased in future years.  Ultimately, from an economic efficiency perspective and from an equity point of view, we believe the evidence favours the type of model we are proposing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800023#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1352379000,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Healy and Mr. McDonnell to the meeting.

We are speaking about a non-means tested old age pension which would be paid to everybody at the same level and which would be at the level of the contributory old age pension.  There is an illusion that everybody in Ireland is entitled to a pension at least equivalent to the non-contributory old age pension.  This is not true.  Many people receive a partial payment in their contributory old age pension and they are not in a position to claim on a means tested basis to get the balance through the non-contributory system.  A total of 46,000 women receive nothing because they have no entitlement to a pension under any heading.  They can make a claim for the non-contributory pension if they do not have enough income to live - whatever the basic parameters are for this at any time - but they do not have a right to it as such.  It is means tested and if they have means or notional means, they do not receive it.  We are in favour of a universal payment.<\/p><p>  The question was asked that if people in social housing have more money available than people in other housing, why should they not have to pay a property tax.  My approach is that they should pay tax in another way.  If they have more disposable money available than other people, it is not because of their welfare payments, because these payments are already below the poverty line.  In most cases a welfare payment does not provide enough to live life with dignity.  It is not sufficient to provide the level of income required for a minimally adequate standard of living.  Research carried out by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice shows this to be the case.  If the people have money from other sources, this money should be open to taxation in other ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800024#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1352379600,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>At one stage TASC was considered to be a radical think tank alternative, but I must say Mr. McDonnell's contribution was hugely disappointing.

It is as if every household has a hidden pot of gold it can pull from under the floorboards and pay as property tax.  In fact, it will come from the same place as income tax and VAT, which is the take-home pay of working people.  I find extraordinary Mr. McDonnell's proposals for a deferral if people are on low incomes or unemployed.  Take the generation on 35 or 40 year mortgages as a result of the extortion and racketeering which went on in the property market and of which they were victims when they needed to buy a home to start a family.  For the past ten years they have paid extortionate rates.  Perhaps they must move on to an interest only arrangement with the bank for the next ten years, after which they may barely be able to afford the payments again.  At the end of all this, thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of a tax will have mounted up.  I must put it to Mr. McDonnell that this is extraordinary.<\/p><p>  I agree with much of what Dr. Healy's organisation, Social Justice Ireland, has said, but he is opting for a site tax which would also be on the family home.

One of the advantages of this system is that the tax burden is lower during a time of high unemployment and low incomes throughout the economy and rises at stronger periods.  Property is wealth, and this would be a wealth tax.  I regard a wealth tax as very much a progressive measure.  For too long we have had a dysfunctional tax system.  The amount of revenue brought in by the State is far beneath the levels sufficient to generate western European standards of public services, which I assume Deputy Higgins supports.  Therefore the question is how this is paid for and who pays for it.  Wealth as opposed to income only must be a component of this.  It is the least damaging to employment and efficiency.  The question then is how this is done.  One begins by taxing immovable property in a universal system which acknowledges that those on low incomes and suffering from mortgage arrears difficulties are exempted for a period.  If they remain in difficulty for the coming 20 years, they will continue to qualify for a deferral until such time as the house is transferred.  If the amount is &euro;700 a year for 20 years the total would be &euro;14,000 which would be paid when the house is sold.  It would be much less damaging to the individual at that time than it would be to have to pay &euro;700 per year now.  We feel this is by far the best system to help reduce the &euro;10 billion structural deficit we have in an equitable and efficient way consistent with not damaging employment.<\/p><p>  For what it is worth, the majority of the remainder of our proposals are taxes on inter-generational wealth transfer and inheritance.  We also speak about reducing pension tax expenditures because the current system is a disgrace.  I do not know any economist on the right or left internationally who would support our system.  I agree with Dr. Healy that the basic pension should be increased because this is how one helps people.  I strongly advocate that no cuts whatsoever should be made to primary or secondary benefits for vulnerable groups and taxes should not be increased for low income groups.  Through carefully working out all of these measures one can design a system, even for this year at &euro;3.5 billion, which protects the most vulnerable in society and places the burden precisely where it should be, which is on the wealthiest and highest income groups.  We do not buy into the austerity narrative.  We have argued for years about how it is counter-productive.

In order to help the working poor we simply propose that tax credits be refunded.  There are 130,000 people in jobs but they are so low paid that their household is in poverty.  Therefore, we must do something to target those people and to keep them in their jobs.  We have talked about how to incentivise people to take up jobs.  These people have jobs but they are paid so little that they are below the poverty line or are struggling financially.  A simple measure that would help would be to refund the two main tax credits to which they are entitled.  In other words, change the system so that they can benefit from the full value of their tax credit.  For the most part, they do not benefit from the full value of the tax credit, so they could receive a payment from the State to make up the balance.  That means that the poorest people in employment, the working poor, would benefit from the full value of any changes in the tax credit system.  I know that we are not likely to see that in the budget this year or next year.  There was a time when they were increasing and I hope that it will happen again.  It is perverse that a tax change of that nature can help everybody except the poorest in employment.  We came up with a costing of &euro;140 million that was based on numbers from three years ago.  At the time the Revenue Commissioners claimed that it would cost over &euro;3 billion.  We held discussions in this committee room that eventually sweated down their figure of &euro;700 million and, in subsequent discussions with our technical people, the figure was further reduced to &euro;350 million. The Revenue Commissioners have not been able to move our cost of &euro;140 million by one cent because it was rock solid.  The proposal would probably cost less now because there are fewer people in employment than three years ago.  The provision can be made for that sum.<\/p><p>  It is most important that there is no reduction in child benefit and no second tier payment introduced as a <i>quid pro quo<\/i> for a cut in child benefit.  I am sure that the members will question what I am saying and whether I support the wealthy.  The Department of Finance and the troika asked me the same questions but I gave them the same answer that I shall give here.  Let us take two households that each have a total income of &euro;100,000, two people live in each, the households are identical and pay the same tax.  If one household has two children then it receives over &euro;3,000 from the State in child benefit.  It is a contribution for the two children but it is far below the cost involved.  Along comes a recession and Ireland is in trouble and needs to make savings in order to reduce its borrowing.  What does the Government mean when it proposes a cut in child benefit?  Which household will it take money from?  Obviously, the household that contains four persons.  To me that is not obvious.  It is not the right thing to do and I would leave them alone.  The State already does far too little for children by way of a contribution or supports.<\/p><p>  Instead, if the Government needs to take money from the two households in order to make a contribution to Ireland reducing its borrowing then it should come from both houses through the income tax system or some other process rather than cut the child benefit.  The child benefit is the only payment of substance and my group deems it to be not nearly adequate.  It is the child's payment and should remain as it is.  If one examines the range of services for children the one thing that they all have in common is that they are underfunded.  There is insufficient funding across the system.  The last thing that we should do is to reduce the little funding that exists through that one payment.  There are much fairer ways to increase the tax take and reduce the borrowing than targeting children who are in no position to speak for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800025#AA00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352380200,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I shall address Deputy McDonald's questions by starting with the issue she made about Dublin 1.

On the pensions issue, the witnesses have hit on something important.  They are right that 80% of the benefit going to 20% of the people is problematic and we need to deal with that but why would they not go a little further?  Some &euro;2.5 billion is given in tax reliefs and most of that goes to the top 20%.  Why would they not go considerably further and argue - I think Vincent Browne argued this point a while ago - for eliminating almost all of that relief and have universal provision of the non-contributory pension at double its current level?  We could afford that if most of those reliefs were eliminated and the private pension system was phased out.  Why would the witnesses not take that more radical route?<\/p><p>  On the property tax issue, the witnesses should rethink what they have proposed because they are the good guys but I believe they have got it totally wrong on this issue.  The rate they propose of 0.35% would amount to a property tax of &euro;700 a year on a house valued at &euro;200,000.  People who are not rich live in many areas Dublin where properties have high values and under that scenario they would have to pay &euro;1,000 in property tax alone.  It is of no consolation that the payment of that tax would be deferred until further down the road and people would be accumulating debts.  That is an awful scenario.  The witnesses should rethink this proposal.  Some 70% or 80% of people own their own homes.  There is nothing wrong with that and the family home should not be considered as a form of wealth in the same sense as commodities and financial investments<b>.<\/b>  The witnesses' position reminds me of the joke about anarchists: Why do anarchists drink green tea?

There has been a great degree of rip-off in the private pension industry over decades and the major beneficiaries have been those in the pensions industry, not the people who drew pensions or were depending on them.  We made a proposal previously that the State might invest a serious amount in pensions and make the universal payment of pensions as strong as possible and, on the other side, provide capacity for people if they want to invest in their pensions, but the State would do it and all the charges that go to fund the private pensions industry would be eliminated.  The State would run this through the vehicle already in place for handling State money and so on.  There might be  a possibility of doing something in that context and that would need to be examined.  I would have no problem with it and would be more concerned about how much we could do, what would be the value of the remainder of the tax breaks and so on.

IBEC's pre-budget submission suggests a grant or tax credit package to incentivise home improvement works during a three-year window of opportunity.  Similar work has been done in Sweden and certain works are under consideration in Germany also.  Does IBEC feel this would be effective if a property tax was simultaneously introduced, as home values would be factored in with this?  IBEC's submission specifically states that it supports the private property tax.  Can Mr. O'Brien clarify if that is a valuation-based property tax or is it a site valuation approach?<\/p><p>  ICTU's proposal suggests a &euro;3 billion three-year stimulus package.  What industries does Mr. Sweeney think would be specifically targeted by this stimulus and what new jobs would be created if such a programme were put in place?<\/p><p>  Section 5.7 of the ICTU proposal notes the support of congress for automatic enrolment in pensions.  This ties into what Dr. Healy was saying earlier.  Would this be a universal pension or something that citizens could opt in or out of?  I would welcome greater detail on that proposal.<\/p><p>  The ICTU submission also refers to a property tax.  I would be grateful if Mr. Sweeney could expand further on this position.  Is he proposing a banding of property taxes from &euro;100,000 to &euro;150,000 and from &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000?

As regards our home improvements tax credit-grant proposal, we have examined a couple of models internationally.  We have found this type of approach to be effective in stimulating activity in the domestic economy.  This is what we regard as being probably the most significant challenge we face currently, which is to see some sort of normalisation of activity in the domestic economy.  We have focused on the home improvement sector for a couple of reasons.  One is because it is so labour intensive.  It has a relatively low import content.  We also believe we still have significant savings and wealth in this economy so there is a capacity for households to unlock the activity, given sufficient and adequate incentive.<\/p><p>  Another issue of which we are particularly conscious - not just in home improvements but also across many sectors of the economy - is the growth in the black economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800028#DD00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1352382000,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>There will be a compliance element to this as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800028#DD00500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352382000,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

Our proposal is for the Government to fund an element of home improvement costs.  We suggest up to a maximum of &euro;3,000 in a &euro;20,000 spend.  We are suggesting also that this would be Revenue positive because, first, it would incentivise additional activity and, second, it would move activity from the informal economy into the formal one.  The tax compliance requirements would mean that one would only have fully registered contractors.  In addition, one would have the personal public service numbers of employees working on the contract.  We would have, therefore, fully tax compliant activity.

The essence of the proposal is that there is an incentive for the home owner to carry out these works within the window of opportunity and get some sort of subvention from the State.  It pays for itself by creating new activity and bringing activity from the informal economy into the formal one.  As I said, the merit of looking at something like that now is that we can see how these schemes have worked in the recession internationally.  The cost benefits are there and do stack up.  This would really stack up, particularly at the moment in the Irish economy given the increase we have seen in activity in the informal economy.<\/p><p>  I do not think there are any implications for property tax.

We have particular concerns on how employers would be affected.  To answer the Chairman's specific query as to whether we have opted for a site valuation or the market value approach, we favour the latter purely for its simplicity, deliverability and administrative reasons.

In the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, we think the residential property tax is a good idea, not because we welcome new taxes but because we feel it is better than the current stamp duty system.  When the property market is booming the economy, in general, is booming and there is considerable revenue from stamp duty.  When the economy is not booming the property market is not booming either and stamp duty income drops off.  The residential property tax should be used to fund local authorities.  Having an annual residential property tax, as opposed to a one-off transaction tax, means local authorities can plan ahead and estimate what their income is going to be.<\/p><p>  We have recommended that the property tax be banded.  We have not, however, recommended that the bands be limited when the value of a property gets up to a certain level.  I have just come from a presentation by a member of the UK valuation office, who said the UK top limit is &pound;3,000.  There was also a speaker from the Northern Ireland office, where they have what probably is a better organised and more advanced system.  Their band also cuts off at a certain level.  The Northern Ireland bands run from A to I, alphabetically, and the UK bands from A to H.  That is a policy decision, however, and not something the society would have a view on.<\/p><p>  We would echo comments here that the property tax should be straightforward and unambiguous.  It should be transparent and clear.  The collection should be low-cost and done at a convenient time of the year, that is, not when several other costs are being charged.  Most important, it should be easily understood by the public and there should be a level of transparency about how the money is being spent.  We believe it should be used to fund local authorities but there should be an onus on the local authorities to explain to taxpayers where their money has gone and how it is being spent.<\/p><p>  As for the method and whether the tax should be based on valuation, location, rent or size, that again is a policy decision because all these methods have pros and cons.  We have done considerable investigation on this, internationally, and have come to the sad conclusion that there is no perfect way of levying this tax.  Within our own society, there is considerable disagreement about which is the best way of doing it and consequently, we have not expressed an opinion as to which is the best way.  Much of it comes down to what the policymakers are trying to achieve.  For instance, the easiest method for the homeowner to self-assess, which also is the easiest method to be verified by the local councils or whatever the body will be, is purely a size-based one because anyone can measure the size of his or her own house.  Any local authority will have records in its planning office as to what is the size of the house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800030#FF00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1352383200,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>The conveyancing documentation has that information.

We have covered a lot of that in our submission.  In broad terms, the two big issues that face us in the construction business and in the property business are confidence and finance.  Those are the two big issues which stop activity in the marketplace.  In our submission, we dealt with those under a number of different headings.  For instance, on the residential mortgage side of things, we feel there is some confidence coming back into the market but it is very fragile and it is very localised.  That is very important from a governmental point of view, in particular in the case of new apartments and houses which were built but never sold.  There is a large amount of VAT tied up there and if any of those are sold, the VAT revenue comes back into the central Exchequer, so it is very important to see some activity there.<\/p><p>  From speaking to people involved in residential sales, the big issue we found was that approximately 40% of all transactions in the greater Dublin area this year were cash buyers, including people who sold abroad and are moving back and so on.  That is an indictment of the fact that despite the banks being recapitalised by the State, they are not lending.  Do not get me wrong.  We acknowledged, and did not like, the fact mortgages were too easy to get but it is now the other extreme.  There are very viable mortgagees who should be getting loans but who cannot get them at the moment and, therefore, cannot buy a house and generate revenue for Exchequer.  <\/p><p>  We feel very strongly that despite what the banks are saying, they are not lending at the rate they should be.  Having approved people for mortgages, they are then creating hurdles and difficulties when people go to draw down the finance.

On the property tax issue, from an IBEC perspective, we have 7,500 member companies, the vast majority of which are in the domestic economy.  No matter what we do on the taxation side, it will impact on their businesses in the domestic economy.  The priority for us in the taxation proposals in our budget is to limit that damage on growth and jobs.  It is nothing the Deputy will not have heard already today.<\/p><p>  From an employer's perspective, we have a particular insight into the Government's proposal as to how the property tax will be collected.  We have now heard from the Minister for Finance that the property tax will be collected through Revenue and through adjustments to personal income tax credits.  In some cases, although not in all, it will be deducted by employers in monthly payroll systems.  That is something about which we have quite a concern in terms of employers administering those payroll systems.<\/p><p>  Our concern is that if we go down this route of administering the property tax through the income tax credit and the personal tax credit system, it will have two consequences for employers and business.  It will put wage pressure back into the workplace.  We know that from recent experience where we have had income tax increases.  When people have less money in their pay packet, there is a kick back to the employer.  We are going through a phase when we are trying to reduce costs and be more competitive and I think that will be unhelpful.  <\/p><p>  As Mr. Paul Sweeney said, practically every economist thinks that property tax is a good idea by nature of it being a tax on property and less damaging to growth.

We have a serious difficulty with the income tax system, in that a disproportionate amount is paid by those in the PAYE sector, therefore, cutting universal benefits and means testing them will disproportionately affect those in the PAYE sector because they cannot hide their income, whereas the self-employed are in a position to do so.  I do not have the exact figure off the top of my head but I think in excess of 80% of all income tax is paid for by those in the PAYE sector.

The single biggest reason the domestic economy, because the export economy is performing well, is so weak at present is not because of the impact of austerity but because of the impact of credit flows in the economy.  If one looks at the data from the Central Bank and compares the net lending-borrowing of households in 2012 to the situation in 2007, we have had a swing in the region of &euro;12 billion to &euro;16 billion.  I think that is a multiple of the impact of austerity.  It is the distorted relationship in credit between our households and the banks that is the biggest single reason for the collapse in economic activity.  Much of it is related to what happened to the construction sector.  Some one in two people who are out of work previously worked in the construction sector.  Of course the fiscal adjustment and the austerity is impacting on growth.  If we had normal credit conditions, both in terms of demand and supply, there are supply issues in the banks but there are also demand issues in households.  At present our households have a particularly high savings ratio.  If that savings ratio, as we heard from the IMF was to come down by 4 percentage points it would add 1% to our GDP numbers.  That is the single biggest reason that the domestic economy is so weak rather than the fiscal adjustment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800033#JJ01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1352385000,"counter":1250,"content":"<p>That is a very interesting response, but I completely disagree with Mr. O'Brien.

The crisis in Ireland was caused by the banks behaving like drunken sailors and lending money willy-nilly to anyone and everyone.  There was failure on the part of the public sector in the sense that the regulator, imbued with the ideology that markets work without intervention, went along with it and that is the reason this economy collapsed.   The banks have moved from crazy lending to the other extreme, and on this I agree with Mr. Fergal O'Brien, of becoming totally risk averse.  Austerity has caused a problem on the domestic side.  One cannot simply take &euro;25 billion out of an economy, which is the amount that will have been taken out of this economy by the end of next month, which is approximately 16% of GNP.

The biggest single issue we face is unemployment.  We did not discuss that at length but I am sure everyone would agree it is the biggest single issue.  If people come off unemployment benefits that benefits them and the State.  The witnesses might deal with that issue.<\/p><p>  I wish to take up Mr. O'Brien's point, which was interesting.  Access to credit is a major issue for the SME sector.  Representatives of Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland appeared before the committee and we seemed to get different signals from them on this issue.  Bank of Ireland said that the amount of &euro;3.5 billion will all be for new lending and AIB said only &euro;600 million of the &euro;3.5 billion will be for new lending.  There is a reluctance on the part of the banks to engage in calculated risk-based entrepreneurial lending.  Mr. O'Brien might give us a flavour of the different business models in place elsewhere.  I was interested in his point regarding the business expansion scheme.  How does he envisage that could work in practice?  I am centring both questions around employment.  Rather than a headline mention of these measures, I would like to hear how the witnesses would in practical terms link labour activation measures to the provision of credit for SMEs and to comment on the types of funding models that could be used and on access to credit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800034#KK00600","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1352385600,"counter":1271,"content":"<p>Which of the witnesses wants to respond first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800034#KK00700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352385600,"counter":1272,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy O'Donnell for his questions.  On the labour market activation measures, there are a few points to be noted on the unemployment issue and I will return to aspects of demand and the domestic economy, which is our single biggest challenge.  Specifically on the activation measures, we did some recent research with our members to ascertain what is working and what is not working.  The JobBridge programme is working well  and business is very supportive of it.  We are seeing a good deal of transition from those internships into sustainable employment and that should continue to be supported.  We have found there is a very weak level of awareness among employers of a range of other schemes such as the employer PRSI exemption scheme and the Revenue assist initiative.  Our recommendation would be to streamline those programmes and research suggests that better promoted, better branded cash equivalent payment schemes rather than a tax foregone model would work better.  <\/p><p>  Regarding other issues around labour market activation, we still have incredible skill shortages in the economy.  Our technology sector has 7,000 to 8,000 unfilled vacancies.  We have some good programmes that are working, in particular the Springboard programme, which again is a good exemplar of something that is very close to the workplace, it is reacting to real demand for real jobs and it is giving people who used to work in the construction sector good jobs in the medical devices and technology sectors.  In general, as a principle, those types of programmes that are close to the workplace and that will be able to respond to real opportunities and vacancies in sectors are the way to proceed because we have an incredible churn currently in the workplace.  We are losing jobs but a good many jobs are being created, and there are many unfilled jobs.<\/p><p>  On the issue of credit for SMEs, there is no question it is still a major issue for our members but it depends on the sector of the economy in which one finds oneself.  Certain sectors of the economy have become very attractive.  If someone is involved in the food and drink sector they probably do not have much difficulty in getting access to credit and there are many institutions willing to do business with them.  If someone is in a less attractive sector they are in a much more difficult position.

We have look at experiences in the Netherlands and Austria, in particular, where government has guaranteed some of the risk for the individual investors and we seem to have got a good behavioural response from that.  We think that could make quite an impact.  As I said previously, the business expansion scheme worked because a small group of investors saw the advertisement in <i>The Sunday Business Post <\/i>and went to their advisers and put money into it.

There were more jobs than there were graduates and one of the reasons for that is employment fell sharply and people went into different business, emigrated or whatever, but now things have stabilised.  We are getting this message across to career guidance teachers and parents to encourage them to get their children to consider the property sector as a job for the future because they tend to spend three or four years in college.  While the construction industry has not stabilised yet, it is getting to that point.  We have had a huge loss of skills but we need to start getting people back into that sector in order that we will have people with skills in the future.  We are quite optimistic about the future of the country as a whole.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about measures to create employment.  We believe that currently there is outstanding value in the construction sector but we do not believe the State is necessarily approaching this from the right direction.  One of the reasons is that the public tendering process seems to concentrate solely on the lowest tender and in recent years people have been awarded contracts for which they tendered below cost and when their businesses have then collapsed that has created a mess.  We need to examine the public procurement process, how we can do that more efficiently and we need to speed up the process.  What would help in that respect is if the Government across all State sectors had a chief construction adviser who co-ordinated all of those elements.  Mr. John Moran, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance suggested we examine creating a centre of excellence in Dublin for both property and design skills - construction skills  - because we have built up a huge level of talent that we can export.  Many of these people are going abroad to work and we need to support that export of skills where they can be based in Ireland and do work abroad.  There are sectors in which the Government can help with that and we have covered that in our submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110800034#KK01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roland O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352386200,"counter":1280,"content":"<p>I wish to echo something Mr. O'Connell said about public procurements and the lowest tender.  A section in our report this year was inserted towards the end.  A group of unions in construction are perturbed with some of the practices that basically amount to moneys going out of the country.  Outsiders are coming in bidding very low and then ignoring all labour standards and not paying tax.  Frankly, they are fly-by-night cowboys.  We really need people who are giving tenders in Ireland to think more creatively about it because it is a serious problem.<\/p><p>  On labour market activation, I agree with Mr. O'Brien that the key problem is lack of demand.  Looking at the supply side on activation, a lot more could be done. <\/p><p>  We were nervous about JobBridge but it seems to be working well and we are reasonably happy with that.  It is one of those things that has been very well implemented.  We hope that we get the real jobs for people at the end of it.<\/p><p>  One of the points in our submission is that activation requires an intense level of quality service from State agencies.  The OECD has been rightly critical of the way we have dealt with labour market activation in the past.

Traditionally, we focused on taxing smokers and today we are also asking for the committee to support our recommendation for excessive tobacco industry profits, some of which are being used to manipulate national health policy, to be transferred to the Exchequer.  Part of this revenue should be used to help smokers quit smoking.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, the Government has been taking approximately 79% of the price of a packet of cigarettes in tax.  The rest goes to the tobacco industry.  In the UK, the rate has been 90%, leaving the industry there with a much smaller profit margin.  In monetary terms, the tobacco industry has been earning approximately &euro;1 per pack more in Ireland than in the UK.  We estimate that by increasing the rate to 90%, the State could secure &euro;150 million a year more, not from smokers' pockets but from industry profits, making them pay more for the damage done by smoking.<\/p><p>  Every year, the tobacco industry increases the price of cigarettes, regardless of whether the tax increases.  This means its profit margin gets bigger and it is virtually unnoticed by the smokers, who think all of the increases are caused by tax hikes.  Between 2000 and 2010, for example, tobacco companies increased their prices by 83% compared with tax increases of 78%.<\/p><p>  The industry uses a sizeable proportion of its extra profit to pay lobbyists and public relations firms which come to places like Leinster House to claim that higher tax increases smuggling.  The industry follows this up by increasing its prices.  If the tobacco industry genuinely thought or cared that tax increases fuelled smuggling, why would it have increased the price of cigarettes every year for the past ten years?  The truth is this is a duplicitous industry that cares only about profit and then uses these profits to undermine State tobacco control policy and regulations.<\/p><p>  In our pre-budget submission, we recommend that Government appoints a regulator who would determine a profit level for the tobacco industry that is more in line with other consumer products and with the levels of other countries.  This simple initiative, which has worked effectively for other industries, would mean the tobacco manufacturers would have less money to invest in marketing, PR and lobbying aimed at disrupting the State's efforts to reduce the smoking rate.<\/p><p>  Smoking is one of the greatest public health challenges of our time.  We must do what we can in order that the tobacco industry does not profit from tobacco sales while the State and the individual are left to pick up the bill in financial and human terms.  Last year the State took in &euro;1.36 billion in tobacco tax, but the Department of Health states that at current smoking rates, tobacco related illness will cost the State &euro;23 billion in the next ten years.  This means the taxpayer is subsidising the tobacco industry, which does not create any jobs or make any meaningful contribution to society, to the tune of &euro;1 billion a year.<\/p><p>  Traditional methods of tackling the power of the tobacco industry are not working and we need a new approach.  We know that tobacco companies do not care about their products that kill and maim people.  By reducing their profits, we can hit them where it will hurt them most and also increase Government revenue at this time of greatest need.<\/p><p>  Mr. McCormack from the Irish Cancer Society will finish our submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800003#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352367000,"counter":1290,"content":"<p>The pre-budget submission on which we are working with the Irish Heart Foundation does not stop at this ground-breaking recommendation.

Older and Bolder is a national alliance of organisations that champions the rights of older people in Ireland.  Our member organisations are Active Retirement Ireland, Age and Opportunity, the Alzheimer Society, the Carers Association, the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and Senior Help Line.  Each of the alliance members has its own unique goals and work programme and Older and Bolder's role is to enable our members to speak with a collective and united voice on issues of policy and practice which are critical to the well being of older people.<br \/>  The issue on which Older and Bolder is currently focused, together with people of all ages and from all parts of the country, is the right to age well at home and we have called our campaign &quot;Make home work&quot;.  The campaign highlights the obstacles faced by older people, people with chronic illnesses or disabilities and children with life limiting illnesses who want to live well at home but need support to do so.  Our campaign also highlights the broader social determinants of health, such as income, transport and social participation, and shows how, together with access to home and community care services, these determinants support people in aging well at home.  The focus of our pre-budget presentation this year was guided by our campaign and I intend to avail of this opportunity to make reference to the elements of our pre-budget submission that are relevant to this committee, particularly in respect of home care services.<br \/>  A few months ago our campaign to make home care work became a campaign to rescue home care after the announcement by the HSE of &euro;22.5 million in cuts to home care services.  Some 18% of the cuts announced on 30 August were targeted at home care services and represented a direct attack on old, young and disabled people in their own homes.  Not only are the cuts a regressive step in terms of safe and healthy aging, they make no sense from an administrative or care management perspective.  We are already failing people who need home and community care services.  In the Republic of Ireland in 2006, 14% of older people with limiting disabilities living in the community received no care, compared with 2% in Northern Ireland.  That percentage has not changed much since then.<br \/>  We are being asked to accept assurances that the HSE's priority to is minimise the impact on patients of spending cuts but where is the evidence to support these assurances?  There is a complete lack of transparent information about how these cuts are actually being applied.  In the case of the home help budget the HSE has predetermined that &euro;8 million will be cut from home help services before the end of the year.  To say that the assessment process is based on a review of individual needs is misleading at best.  How is the HSE going to engage efficiently and humanely in the individualised assessment of 11 million home help hours resulting in a reduction of a million hours?  The examples we hear from around the country of people's hours and services been cut are staggering.  In one case a family received a letter from a local HSE office dated 3 September referring to the budget cuts and announcing a cut to the family's home care package.  This letter issued just two working days after the cuts were announced.  There could not have been time for a clinical assessment of needs.<br \/>  The whole process has raised many unanswered questions.  In the absence of home help hours and home care packages, what will happen to individuals who are medically fit for discharge from acute hospitals but need social care support to return home safely?  In the wake of cuts to home care services, will the budget for the nursing home support scheme be increased to cater for increased and earlier admissions to nursing homes?  If, as mooted, people currently in receipt of home care services are assured that a service will be maintained, what will happen to individuals and families currently awaiting assessment for access to home help and home care packages?  How will an already stretched public health nurse network meet the needs of people in the community who have identified unmet needs and who are at risk?<br \/>  The key underlying issue is the lack of a legislative framework for home and community care to govern individual entitlement, single assessment, quality of services, etc.  This issue once again highlights the vulnerability of community care budgets to cuts in both bad times and good in the absence of legislative protection.  Citizens in Ireland have no legal right to care in the home or community.   People do not realise this or understand the implications of it until they are in a transitional or crisis situation.  It is only when they are looking for care and support for themselves or a family member that they discover there is no right of access to care.  The need to clarify the legal situation with regard to home care has been highlighted by various bodies over many years, including the Ombudsman.  The HSE service plan for 2012 states that the HSE will continue to work with the Department of Health on legislative proposals for community services.  Exactly the same commitment was set out in the 2011 service plan and I suspect we might find it in previous plans.  The entire process is characterised by inertia and a failure to plan and act decisively.<br \/>  Access to home and community care is currently <i>ad hoc<\/i>, discretionary and dependent on one's illness, where one lives and to whom one speaks.  Older and Bolder believes it is time to put in place a commission on long-term care in Ireland so that the statistics, facts, projections for costs, population, dependency needs, etc., can be placed in the public domain and debated publicly.  The issues I have outlined reinforce the need for a planned approach to aging, which is why Older and Bolder has campaigned vigorously over the last four years for a national positive aging strategy.  The deadline of October 2012 has come and gone and we are now looking at year end before a draft reaches the Cabinet.  There can be no further delays.<br \/>  Cuts to home care services will devastate the prospect of safe aging at home.  Cuts to these services have again highlighted the urgency to underpin the delivery of community care services in Ireland with legislative protection and we ask the committee to take the lead in advancing this matter.  It is imperative that budget 2013 reflects the vital role home care services play in the delivery of health care in this country.  The committee's letter of 9 October 2012 calling on the Minister for Health to reverse the cuts was welcomed by those of us who champion such a move and we ask members to continue to hold to account those who would cut these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800004#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Dillon"},{"type":"speech","time":1352367600,"counter":1294,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. John Dunne, the chief executive of the Carers Association, and invite him to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800004#F00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352367600,"counter":1295,"content":"<p>I endorse all that Mr. Dillon has said on behalf of Older and Bolder.

We have made a number of proposals in our submission.  Resources are being systematically shifted from home help to home care, which appears to fit the strategy of providing resources where need is greatest.

The Disability Federation of Ireland and its member organisations throughout the country are very appreciative of this opportunity.  I want to explain how health policy is pivotal in determining what the future will be like for disabled people and those with mental health needs and people in general in Ireland.  In the main, people with disabilities are living in communities when they become disabled and they try to stay living there.  They are not immune from the attrition of the recession in families and communities.  Committee members will know from their clinics that people with disabilities have been subject to particular cuts with regard to income and services.  An issue arises of a double hit to already vulnerable people.  In September this year and last year, the Disability Federation of Ireland and eight national organisations, including Mental Health Reform and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, came together to state we have gone past the point of sustainability of services as things stand.  Since last year cuts have been eating into the level of services people require.  We also have information on demographics and greater need.<\/p><p>  These cuts and restrictions also undermine the social infrastructure which enables people with disabilities to live independently and stay out of hospitals and long-stay institutions.  The events of late August and early September with regard to cuts to personal assistants and home help, and the issue raised in recent weeks with regard to the mobility allowance, have torn the confidence of people with disabilities and their families with regard to the stated intent of the Government to protect the vulnerable.  People do not feel this is happening and they do not have confidence it is being brought through.<\/p><p>  Cuts to personal assistants and home help puts more pressure on hospitals and long-care institutions.  It needs to be understood that the best way to take pressure off hospitals is to have fewer people requiring them for shorter periods of time and to put the focus where it is needed.  Voluntary disability organisations, families and carers are at breaking point.  To put it very starkly, the patient will be dead before the austerity medicine works.  This is our stark assessment of the situation.  The cuts are coming too hard and too fast for people and organisations, whether the HSE or voluntary organisations, to be able to react.<\/p><p>  For the past two years this country has had a plan with the troika with regard to income and expenditure.  We have a jobs plan.  Over a similar period of time, since the Government came to power, it has had a commitment to have a plan to protect the national disability strategy.  This plan is not yet in place.  The earliest it will be put in place is January or February next year.  A budget will be announced in four weeks' time which will make it more difficult to have coherence around this issue.  There is an imbalance in Government policy thinking.  Much work is being done on the economic side, which is right, but there does not seem to be any similar coherence or multi-annual planning to have what I broadly call a social infrastructure for people, whether they are disabled, children or elderly.<\/p><p>  Disability and mental health issues and chronic conditions of all types are a risk contingency faced by every person in the country.  Not everybody is directly affected but those we know and love and those around us will at some stage be affected.  Only the Government can underwrite this and try to put a floor under it.<\/p><p>  A value for money report was published a number of months ago on disability services.  It did not deal with a plethora of supports and services which are very much involved in the community and supporting people and their families.  Disability policy and health are central to Irish success and well-being in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800005#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352368800,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>That does not only happen in Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800006#H00200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352368800,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>Yes.

Are they being undertaken by a person at a desk or by a caller to the person's home?  What is the cost of the assessment?  Is it counter-productive?  For example, is the cost of carrying out these assessments greater than the amount which will be saved?  Also, does this place a further administrative burden on the provision of home help?  I have always said that I believe it is counter-productive to leave people with no choice but to go into long-term nursing home care because this places a greater financial burden on the Exchequer and the person concerned, who would probably prefer to remain in his or her home.<\/p><p>  On the presentation by the Carers' Association, no reference was made in its opening statement to the length of time carers are waiting for their applications to be processed by the Department of Social Protection.

Many of these people are waiting in excess of nine months to have their applications processed.

I received a reply yesterday to parliamentary questions on home help hours and home care packages.  The figures with which I was provided in this regard are very worrying.  The figure in respect of the number of people in receipt of home help hours and home care packages indicates a very worrying trend.  A large number of those in receipt of these reports are receiving reduced supports, namely, shorter and-or fewer attendances by their home help hour providers.  This indicates that from 31 December 2010 to the end of July 2012, there were 3,701 fewer people in receipt of home help hours.  During the corresponding period, there was an increase of 1,159 in the number of home care packages.  However, the net reduction in terms of recipients of home supports was in excess of 2,500.  This does not reflect the real impact of cuts.  We are deeply alarmed that in some instances home help time has been reduced to 15 minutes.  It is important these facts and figures are spelled out.  Everyone knows what is happening.<\/p><p>  I am happy to report to Older and Bolder and the Carers Association that this committee unanimously adopted a proposal from me and wrote to the Minister asking that the proposed cuts not proceed.  However, we now know that they have been applied since the last bank holiday weekend.  This is an opportunity for all of us, Government and Opposition, to support the case that not only should there not be further cuts in terms of budget 2013 but that there should be a reversal of the cuts implemented, which are impacting furiously.<\/p><p>  My final question is to Mr. John Dolan of the Disability Federation of Ireland.  Mr. Dolan referred in his submission to an implementation plan in relation to the national disability strategy.  There is no such plan yet in place, which is outrageous.

I am concerned about the way the adjustments were made to home care packages in the past few months.  One of the problems arising is that because people doing home help or care are not permanent and pensionable, it is an easy element to cut.  I raise the idea of getting the Department to ring-fence the home help budget for 2013 so that in August 2013, if there is a budgetary problem with the HSE, we will not be going first to the element that is not permanent and pensionable or the home care packages.  That should be done.<\/p><p>  I met somebody the other day who was getting half a carer's allowance, which is &euro;100 per week.  The person's mother has Alzheimer's disease and it is a full-time job taking care of her.  That person is saving &euro;900 per week for the State because it would cost &euro;1,000 per week for a place in a nursing home.  We must be very proactive in ensuring we do not have a repetition of what has happened this year in 2013.  The only way of doing this is by ring-fencing the budget within the HSE right across the country.<\/p><p>  I support fully the comments of the witnesses and we must support people.  We must grow the number of people we can keep at home for longer than in the past.  We must ensure this can be done through future budget planning as well.

If the supply exceeds demand, there is no problem but we know demand for these services far exceeds any supply.  As this is a budgetary matter, there must be a reduction.

The argument is that we will be able to review that in time to deliver these cuts; in reviewing the process we will be able to reduce the service sufficiently to save &euro;8 million.  The public health nurses are at the end of their wits because, quite unfairly, they must play God.  They get a direction from a local HSE office that 100 hours must be cut, for example, and some person therefore has to lose the service.  One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is by taking 15 minutes from everybody.  The letter I mentioned is from a local HSE office within 50 miles of here and is dated 3 September.  In most cases it is a desk-based cut.<\/p><p>  With regard to the statutory basis for quality of life, we fully endorse the need to introduce legislation to protect community services.  The fair deal nursing home scheme affects approximately 5% of older people, with approximately 530,000 people over 65 in the country.  Approximately 30,000 of those people are in long-term residential homes.  We have legislated for that through the fair deal scheme.  I am not saying the remaining 95% need a carer service but in most cases the service needed would be a community or home-based service.  If we believe in the continuum of care, ranging from a little home help to end-of-life care - our colleagues in the Irish Hospice Foundation can give more detail on that - there are different care needs along that continuum.  We must ring-fence and protect the budget used in that respect.<\/p><p>  There was a question as to why this is happening differently in certain areas, and this is down to discretion.  Where there is discretion, the cut opted for is usually the easiest and quickest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800007#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Dillon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352370000,"counter":1315,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Dillon suggesting that the HSE can use its discretion and not make cuts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800008#K00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352370000,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>Yes, for certain schemes.

It is not a diktat from an official and I do not suggest that there is badness anywhere.  It is my assessment that there is a culture, in certain parts of the public service, where people do their job on their terms.  Under the Croke Park agreement they continue to do their job on their terms but have now been moved to a new job.  I do not know the individual that I am talking about but I presume that his or her previous job involved doing home help.  That means that he or she stayed in the company of a person and did a bit of housekeeping, shopping or whatever.  The work was not time critical and the carer was wanted in the middle of the day.  The person has now been redeployed to a different sort of job which involves giving a certain degree of personal care and helping somebody into bed.  There has been a vocal campaign on their behalf - and I am being general here - that these people deserve work and must be given work.  In order to do that they are being redeployed.  I have no issue, in principle, with that as long as he or she is properly trained and accepts that if he or she has a different job that it is done appropriately.  The problem is that there been a culture of mismanagement within the system and there does not seem to be an ability to drive change.  I do not suggest that there is badness anywhere.  There are gaps in the system and there is a cultural and systemic problem.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of cuts.  Obviously there have been cutbacks.  Deputy Regina Doherty also raised the matter in terms of a geographical spread.  Two shifts have taken place and both are strategically sensible.  First, there has been a shift from home care to home help.  Where resources are scarce it makes sense to concentrate available resources on the people who have the greatest level of dependency but one must not write off others.  That is why we asked for that piece to be backfilled.  <\/p><p>  Second, for some strange reason there has always been a better level of home help and home care support in the south and west than in Dublin and along the east coast.  The HSE is trying to strategically re-align its spending in that area to match the demographic.  It is hard to argue with that aspiration.   <\/p><p>  The net reduction of 2,500 in terms of recipients of home supports was mentioned.  At this stage people are experiencing substantial cuts but they tend to be marginal rather than a total abolition of services.  We must bear in mind that there is a constant turnover in home care and home help, particularly in home help, when people die or go into residential institutions.  That results in significant savings in the short-term because the budget paid for home care is not reallocated but then there is a longer queue created because people must wait for new services.  <\/p><p>  Senator Burke asked for home care funding to be ring-fenced.  I shall return to the management culture and state that I am more than slightly nervous at the concept of ring-fencing.  We need change but ring-fencing would create an obstacle.  I shall return to the statutory obligation and ask for equal priority to be given to the two pots of money.  It would ensure that it is not a matter of having no home care or giving six times as much funding to put a person's granny where she does not want to be.  That is literally where we are at and is purely down to legislation.  The provision is not even politically controversial because the previous Government prioritised it and the current Government has it somewhere on its shopping list.  The Government is wasting money every week that we are without that legislation.   <\/p><p>  I shall make a final point on the institutional side of the debate.  Mr. Dillon is right that it is the Department of Health rather than the HSE that writes the strategies.  It is the same group of officials who will write the legislation and that is where extra staff resources could be provided.  Enacting the legislation is the single most important thing the committee could do for the sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800008#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1352370000,"counter":1322,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Dolan and I ask him to be brief as we have more speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800008#K00900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352370000,"counter":1323,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their questions and interest in the debate.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked two questions on the implementation plan and the national disability strategy, NDS.  I shall add the question by Deputy Regina Doherty to them.<\/p><p>  The national disability strategy has been in existence for the past six or seven years.  There has always been an issue about adding an implementation element to it.  The strategy is a Government plan and is not just for the Department of Health.  It is potentially quite powerful because it can examine the determinants of health and the interconnection between health, social welfare, education, employment and factors like that.  The problem is that we will not have it until January or February because it has been delayed three times this year and that is since the Government took over.  The strategy will come after the next budget which may contain the same level cuts as last year, perhaps more.  That is a big issue.  The Croke Park agreement is also still in place.  There has been talk about adjusting the Croke Park agreement and formulating a Croke Park II but that would be two budgets away.  The strategy is also connected with public service reform but nobody has copped on to that.  There is a broad disability strategy and there are strategies for carers and children.  It is helpful if one can see that all of the strategies are interwoven.<\/p><p>  During the last debate before the general election, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste were asked by Miriam O'Callaghan to identify one social justice priority.  In a flash the T&aacute;naiste said that it would be the disabled and the Taoiseach spoke eloquently about people with mental health needs.  Unfortunately, they have not put their words into action.  <\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the decisions that have been taken, particularly the &euro;10 million cut to the personal assistance service announced on 30 August.  How could &euro;10 million be saved from the &euro;40 million budget for personal assistants with four months remaining in this year without closing down the service lock, stock and barrel?  Like my colleague, Mr. John Dunne, I do not think anyone was trying to do that.  At a senior level in the Department of Health and the HSE people had just carried out a value for money report on the disability programme.  The big issue for people with a governance concern about health is why was such a consequence not spotted earlier.  We very much welcome that the proposal has been withdrawn and that the cuts will be made somewhere else. <\/p><p>  Deputy Healy raised a quality of life issue but I shall not spend time discussing it.  Everyone has said, in different ways, that quality of life is about keeping people where they want to be, with their families, and providing support to people, often at a modest level, at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800008#K01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352370600,"counter":1325,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

I have been talking to the Minister, and I am trying to do my best for all the groups.<\/p><p>  Mr. Chris Macey gave me a shock, and it is not because I am a non-smoker.  A total of 79% of the price of a packet of cigarettes goes to the Government, while in the UK 90% of the price goes to the government.  That is not acceptable.  He said the tobacco industry makes &euro;1.36 billion in profits per year and that it is subsidised by Irish taxpayers to the sum of &euro;1 billion.  It has reached the stage that we will have to examine the damage tobacco is doing to people.  Cancer is an awful disease and I have experience with it because my father died from lung cancer.  It was due mainly to smoking, which put me off cigarettes.  My father got up every day at 7 a.m.  In our house the living room and kitchen were one big room and for 15 or 20 minutes every morning it was unbelievable to listen to him coughing.  It was only a matter of time but we could not get him off cigarettes.  The Government will have to put some type of levy on smoking tobacco and the money should go back to the medical people, the HSE, cancer research or the Irish Heart Foundation.  At this stage the industry is making far too much profit.  It is sickening.  The Minister is talking about introducing a smoking ban in cars carrying children.  That is very important.

Obviously, I join in the support for a gradual ratcheting up of the pressure on the tobacco industry.  I favour punitive levels of tax on its profits.  There is nothing about the tobacco industry we should be trying to protect.  There is no economic argument in the macroeconomics of the country to support keeping the tobacco industry running either nationally or internationally.  A great deal of nonsense is talked about the critical importance of the tobacco industry to farmers, manufacturers and so forth.  There is a colossal opportunity cost associated with the money which is spent on tobacco products, in addition to the obvious health and, indeed, moral benefits which would accrue from everybody stopping smoking.  There would be vast economic benefits.  For that reason we must understand that the tobacco industry, although it is legal, is unethical and evil.  We should be trying to stamp it out.  That should be our goal.  These are people whose business plan can be summed up in four words: addict children to carcinogens.  If the tobacco company does not do that, it fails.<\/p><p>  For that reason I support the increase in tax, but I would go further.  During the six months when Ireland holds the Presidency of the EU, I propose a very far-reaching policy which I believe our Government should espouse and which every Member of the Houses should support.  We should get the EU to commit itself to the idea that by the year 2030 it will be illegal to do any commerce in tobacco, that is, grow it for profit, sell it, import it and manufacture products.  If we invented tobacco tomorrow, it would not be legal.  There is no doubt about that.  Substances which are far less carcinogenic than tobacco products are routinely banned.  They cannot be used in the manufacturing, environmental and many other sectors.  We would never allow it.  It is here because it has been grandfathered in, so we should commit ourselves to that policy.  As a step along that route, we should also consider a very concise, EU directive that bans any contact between a tobacco company and a public relations company until such time as we implement a complete commercial ban.  We have no business allowing the industry to use propaganda to get more addicts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800009#L00500","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1352370600,"counter":1329,"content":"<p>On the first two submissions regarding smoking tobacco and the proposal for the establishment of a regulator, how would that tie in with Single Market rules and are there implications in that regard?

Is there not a problem with the consistency of home help delivery throughout the country?  In some parts of the country there are one hour allocations while in others there are 15 minute allocations.  There is also an inconsistency in what home help provides.  It is personal care in my part of the country and in many others, but in other areas it also includes home support, for example, assisting a person who lives in an isolated area.  That lack of consistency is causing significant anomalies and people are losing out.<\/p><p>  In the three presentations from Mr. John Dunne, Mr. John McCormack and Mr. Sean Dillon there is a consistent theme that there is a lack of joined-up thinking between the acute sector, the hospitals, and the community sector and that significant savings could be made if there were joined-up thinking in that context.  I have a question for Mr. John Dunne on that issue.  There is a statutory right to nursing home subvention, or the fair deal scheme.  He is arguing that this statutory right should be extended to community services.  In the current economic climate that statutory right will not be extended.  What is being considered at present is that a similar means assessment would be introduced for community services as is currently in place for the fair deal scheme.  Is there an argument to be made to move that a step further whereby if an applicant is approved for the fair deal scheme, they can have the option of going into long-term residential care or having a community fair deal package put in place?  It is a type of middle ground but it ensures that elderly people are not left in a position where they must either go into the home or be left without any services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800009#L00600","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1352370600,"counter":1330,"content":"<p>I wish to make a few short comments and ask a question.

Personal care enters the equation.<\/p> <p>That service was tendered and at least it introduced an element of regulation and standards to the home help service.<\/p><p> The difference between home help and home care packages is causing some of the problems.  Ultimately all these things should be based on need and the assessment of need.  A standardised needs assessment would allow for a determination of the nature of the care plan required.  The HSE has a pilot project for single assessment.  This is behind schedule.  However, it will mean that whether a person is in Donegal or west Clare, south Cork or Dublin, the same assessment of the individual's care needs will apply.  This should at least begin the process of standardisation of the delivery of care.  <\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about a review of the home help service.  Our concern is for the person who receives the service and we will wholeheartedly support anything that improves it.  However, instead of the review to determine the problems, we note that the service is cut in advance of any review.  The demand far exceeds the supply.  I suggest we should see how the service can be improved rather than cutting the supply in the face of increased demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800010#M02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Dillon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352371800,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten raised the matter of consistency.  We carried out a listening exercise early in the year.  I travelled around the country and I met groups.  We asked them whether they noted a difference between the two services.  It seems to boil down to whoever is delivering the service.  If one had a good person it did not matter what hat he or she was wearing when they went into a house and the reverse applied with a person who was not so good.  As Mr. Dillon said, there is a lack of consistent management and as a consequence some of the money is being wasted and better results could be achieved.  Mr. Dillon also referred to the issue of standards.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has stated it will be unable to regulate home care until 2016.  In fairness to the authority, it has been very clear in stating what it wishes to do in the meantime.  We would be of the view that we are more important but at least it is a considered position.  In the meantime, the HSE has begun to put in place its own framework using this competitive tender and applying standards.  The difficulty now is that the HSE is cutting across that.  The people who won the right to deliver services based on that tender are now being displaced by home helps who are neither qualified nor trained and to whom these standards are not being applied.  The system demands certain qualifications but the staff delivering the care are not qualified.  This is a fundamental issue but when I raised it with the HSE the response was that it was hoped to sort the problem in the next year or two.  If I said to anyone that I would sort something out in the next year or two, I know what the public sector's response would be if that were to be my defence.<\/p><p>  On the question of a statutory right, there is a statutory right to residential care but in the current financial climate there is no prospect of a statutory right for community care.  For God's sake, legislators have created a statutory right for the most expensive option.  If a statutory right for the cheaper option is not created, the State will be condemned to spending money on the most expensive option.  <\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Byrne for taking the time to read the submission.  I was not making a cheap political shot.  I made a very deliberate decision that we would put nothing in our pre-budget submission that we could not say how it would be paid for.  I refer to the question of the transition period.  A carer who has spent a lifetime caring for a person is formally unemployed six weeks after the person dies and the system then forgets about them.  It was a question of how to pay this cost.  At the time there was the issue of those who had been county councillors who had to forego the dual mandate and were compensated.  To be clear, we did not say that those payments should be abolished.  We simply argued that a very small allocation from the pot would pay for this transition.  I do not apologise but it was not a cheap shot.<\/p><p>  On the question of why full-time carers want a free GP card, the carer's strategy highlights the very obvious connection, which is acknowledged by the Government, that carers are doing a job for the State.  I do not like the notion that they are working for their social welfare payment.  They are saving the State a lot of money.  They need their health in order to do the job.  Employees, even when unpaid, are entitled to holidays and to a certain level of health and safety consideration.  This leads on to the point about physical disability.  I can describe a case of a big man who is bedridden and his wife, who is of small build, is the carer.  The assessment decided it would take two people to move that person from the bed and the HSE decided it could not spare two people.  It left the wife to do it.  Patient moving or handling cause physical injury to carers.  A body is heavy to move and our system does not even provide training to people on how to do it, never mind to provide help.  That is how carers suffer physical ill-health but they also suffer distress and stress.<\/p><p>  Carers also suffer in another third way.  I can describe a case.  A daughter who cares for her mother needed to go into hospital.  She was advised to bring her mother to the accident and emergency department and to leave her there.  We intervened and the matter was dealt with in a different way.  In such situations it is often the case that carers will not go into hospital.  They will put their own care on hold and in the long term, the health of both people collapses.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800011#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352371800,"counter":1355,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the 14% cuts in recent years and he said the country is bankrupt.  The country is bankrupt in the sense that we do not have income to meet expenditure.  The trick for any social democratic State is to ensure we are not also socially and morally bankrupt.  We have to find or try to find a way to match the growing needs with the available resources.  Many people in this country are unemployed, unfortunately.  That is the crux.  It cannot be a case of telling people that we are broke, that they should go away and return when we are flush.  I know the Deputy does not mean it that way.<\/p><p>  Deputy Naughten spoke about the lack of joined-up thinking between acute and community care and the possibility of savings.  I am loath to talk about the savings.  The issue is that we have a big demographic profile in this area.  Ironically, the success in the health area over the past 15 years in bringing down the mortality rate has increased the morbidity rate.  We did not take this on board.  People who survive strokes do not go out to play football the next day; they have conditions and suffer losses as a result.  It is the case that, thank God, more people with disabilities are being born who would not have survived to birth ten or 20 years ago.  According to the Health Research Board, the number of people waiting for personal assistant services, home help services and care attendant services equals the number of people who have these services.  Therefore, the demographic factor must be considered in the equation.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne referred to the work of home helps.

I am conscious that I could speak at length so I have decided to keep it short and deal with the issue of child income supports and squeeze in the issue of the new child and family support agency.<\/p><p>  I am Maria Corbett and I am with the Children's Rights Alliance.  The alliance is a coalition of 100 organisations which are working to promote children's rights and to make the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child a reality in Ireland.  We are very interested in the budget which has a major impact on children.<\/p><p>  The Government in its programme for Government made a commitment to the establishment of a new child and family support agency early next year.  In last year's budget the Government created a new Vote for the new agency.  The new agency comprises the Family Support Agency, which has a clear budget and also the child and family services of the HSE.  It is unclear what budget the HSE allocated specifically for its child and family service as this information was not in the public domain up to now.  It is unclear what the HSE will allocate to the new agency.  It is absolutely critical that we ensure that sufficient resources are granted to the new agency. <\/p><p>  The new child and family support agency to be formally established next year will be a statutory body tasked with promoting the welfare and protection of children.  It will also be tasked with supporting families in Ireland.  It is absolutely critical that it gets an adequate budget and that it starts on the right foot.<\/p><p>  I urge the committee in its work on children and the budget to watch the funding of this new agency closely.  I understand the legislation establishing this new agency will come to the committee.  I am flagging it for members and perhaps we can engage with them when they are reviewing the legislation.<\/p><p>  I am almost loth to mention the children's referendum on Saturday, 10 November.  If that referendum is passed, and we are strongly advocating a \"Yes\" vote, issues will need to be considered by this committee.  Perhaps we can consider how best to address the questions of legislation and resources to make the outcome of the referendum a reality.<\/p><p>  My main focus is on child income supports.  People will know that throughout the years of the Celtic tiger, Ireland did not address the serious issue of child poverty.  It is a national scandal that in a wealthy modern western European country we still have such a high rate of child poverty.  The figures are astonishing.  Almost one fifth of children in Ireland are living below the poverty line.  Of those approximately 8% of children are living in deep poverty.  That is just not acceptable in this day and age.  We need to grasp this problem.  We need to set out at a political level an ambitious child poverty target so that we begin to address this issue and take ownership of it.  I am aware that we are in straitened economic times and that we need to figure out what to do with the annual budget.  I am also aware that we spend a significant proportion, 2.2%, of GDP on child income support.  I am conscious that money is invested in this area.<\/p><p>  The issue I wish to raise is whether that money is being spent in the best possible way.  It is absolutely critical that we ensure that cash and other supports go to vulnerable families.  There are many families who are really struggling.  The child benefit payment is an integral part of the support.  While I acknowledge the child benefit payment needs to be reformed, I am also flagging that it would be very destabilising to make a dramatic change to the child benefit for the families who depend on it.  The reality is that families with children are three times more likely to be in debt from ordinary household expenses.  We need to be very conscious that Ireland has a very vulnerable population with children.<\/p><p>  Our official position is that we do not wish child benefit payment to be cut, to be means tested or to be taxed but we are in favour of reform.  The Department of Social Protection has produced a set of proposals around it.  I wish to give members a sense of the direction in which we are leading on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800012#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms. Maria Corbett"},{"type":"speech","time":1352372400,"counter":1360,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Corbett for making her contribution within the five minutes allocated.<\/p><p>  The next speaker is Dr. Shari McDaid, a policy officer with Mental Health Reform.

Much of what I have to say is a reinforcement of what my colleague, Mr. John Dolan, said earlier.  I will place a particular focus on people with intellectual disability and their families.  The Chairman will be aware that Ireland is almost unique internationally in so far as the voluntary sector provides the substantial majority of services to people with intellectual disability.  Up to 85% of such services are provided directly by voluntary organisations on the basis of service level agreements with the HSE, which has statutory responsibility for this area.  Voluntary organisations have a long and rich tradition of providing services to people with intellectual disability in Ireland.  In some cases, such as Stewart's Hospital and the Daughters of Charity, this form of provision dates back to a time before the foundation of the State.  Voluntary organisations are typically an amalgam of members of local communities, parents, friends, people with an intellectual disability and staff who come together with the common objective of responding to local need by providing the best possible support to people with intellectual disability in their communities.<\/p><p>  Over the decades, services have developed to the extent that they are now internationally recognised for the range and quality of supports provided.  Voluntary organisations are to the fore in promoting quality within services.  Following work done by our federation&rsquo;s quality sub-committee in the 1990s, voluntary organisations took the initiative in developing quality systems.  A recent survey of our member organisations confirmed that the majority have achieved international accreditation as high-quality providers of services to people with intellectual disability.  A unique characteristic of service provision in Ireland is the high number of organisations which were founded by parents and friends of people with intellectual disability.  These organisations, which were established on a voluntary basis, were born out of local communities and therefore have strong ties and affiliations with the communities in which they are embedded.  Parents have a strong role in their governance, as evidenced by the number who are members of the respective boards of directors.  The parental voice is an essential and valued perspective and the federation is committed to ensuring this voice is heard.  To this end, last month we organised comprehensive briefings for parents on the implications of funding cuts and on what we are doing as a sector to manage the cuts and to seek protection from further cuts in the forthcoming budget.<\/p><p>  Being closely identified with local communities gives voluntary organisations access to significant voluntary input, which has evolved from fund-raising activities to include befriending programmes, policy development and supporting people with intellectual disability to enjoy meaningful lives.  The value of this input, which is obviously provided at no cost to the State, has been conservatively estimated to be approximately &euro;50 million per annum.  It has always been the case, within a context of finite resources, that the demand for the services of voluntary organisations has exceeded supply.  Therefore, there has always been a focus on the efficient and effective use of the resources available.  There has been a constant drive to innovate and to develop newer and better solutions to meet the diverse needs of the people we support.  This focus is particularly sharp in the current economic climate.   For example, the needs of over 650 school leavers were met this year through the development of a series of innovative solutions in the absence of additional resources.  That was the first time that any of us can remember when no resource at all was available to meet the needs of school leavers.  That was managed this year.  We have fully engaged with the value for money and policy report that was published recently.  We carried out a national survey of our membership which confirmed that significant progress has been made, and continues to be made, in implementing the recommendations contained in the report.<\/p><p>  I would like to set out the challenges that are facing the voluntary sector at present.  Like everybody else in this country, those involved in this sector have faced significant cuts over the past four years.  In our case, there has been an aggregate cut of approximately 15% at a time when the demand for services has been increasing rapidly and the changing needs of those already availing of our services have never been greater.  Many organisations are struggling to stay afloat and have incurred financial deficits to maintain essential services.  The boards of many registered companies limited by guarantee are concerned that they may be breaching the Companies Acts by trading recklessly.  Board members are worried about the implications of this for their organisations and for themselves personally.  Some organisations are so concerned about this that they are closing services.  Responsibility for services at Cregg House in Sligo, for example, was handed back to the HSE because of real concerns about the deficits being encountered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800013#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352373600,"counter":1366,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Donnell and welcome Ms Caroline Lynch, advocacy and communications manager with the Irish Hospice Foundation.

Both our pre-budget submission and my opening statement have been circulated to members.  I do not plan to go through the latter word for word because we are pressed for time.  There are three issues on which I wish to focus, the first of which is the specialist palliative care budget.  I would appeal to the Government that there should be no cut to that budget this year.  The second issue I wish to raise involves strategy and the position with regard to end-of-life scenarios.  The third and final matter relates to paediatric palliative care, on which I will provide an update.<\/p><p>  The Irish Hospice Foundation is the national charity dedicated to all matters relating to dying, death and bereavement in Ireland.  These are matters which are relevant to all of us.  We have all experienced bereavement in some way in our lives and we will all experience death.  Our work centres on development, support and advocacy across all care settings.  We receive no core funding from the State.  Ours is an independent body which relies on the public for its initiatives.  A key point is that high-quality end-of-life care - which includes palliative care - encompasses primary, secondary and tertiary care, all diagnoses, all ages, all care settings and involves most health care professionals.  We believe that with proper planning, investment and commitment good end-of-life care can make a real difference to both the quality and cost of health care.  CSO figures show almost 29,000 people died in Ireland last year and that at least ten people are directly affected by each death.  This is a hugely important sector and we are concerned here with supporting over 290,000 people each year.<\/p><p>  The budget for specialist palliative care services for this year is &euro;78 million, down from &euro;81 million in 2011.  This &euro;78 million is supposed to run a national service.  In other words, it is supposed to be used to support services and staff in each of the nine hospices, to run day-care services and to support home-care teams, which comprise approximately 160 nurses throughout the country.  By contrast, the budget for one region which comprises two and a half counties and in which three hospitals are located is &euro;94 million.  I am not suggesting that the funding for these hospitals should be cut, I am merely making the point that the Irish Hospice has a budget of &euro;78 million which it must use to try to run a national service.<\/p><p>  The specialist palliative care budget has been cut by 3% in each of the past two years.  There have also been further indirect cuts as the costs of annual increments or non-pay inflation were not met.  As members will be aware, hospice services have always been obliged to rely on the loyalty of local communities.  It has been very fortunate in retaining that loyalty.  Budgets have traditionally been a combination of voluntary and statutory funding.  The ratio of State to voluntary funding used to be approximately 85:15.  Now it is closer to 75:25.  Members of the public are very loyal to their local hospice groups but there is a real concern that any further erosion of an already small budget will destabilise what is a fragile and underdeveloped sector.<\/p><p>  Specialist palliative care involves caring for people with life-limiting conditions who have complex needs.  Many are referred to the hospice movement at the end-of-life stage.  These individuals should receive priority consideration in accessing a high-quality service and should not be on a waiting list.  The goal of specialist palliative care is for patients to have access to services no more than 48 hours after referral.  This goal is becoming more and more difficult to achieve.  This is obviously a result of the fact that many services are experiencing staff shortages and are affected by the public sector recruitment embargo.  The concern in the specialist palliative care sector is that if there is a cut in budget for 2013, this will inevitably lead to longer waiting times for those seeking to access services and a heightened risk of further bed closures.  An example in this regard is that Milford Care Centre in Limerick was obliged to place a temporary cap on the number of beds in use from 30 to 28 last year.  A further cut would cause a major disruption to the provision of palliative care.  As already stated, the sector is struggling to maintain high-quality services.<\/p><p>  There are two facilities which were built with extra bed capacity.  I refer to Marymount in Cork, which 20 additional beds, and St. Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown, with 24 additional beds.  These beds are not being used because there is no funding available.  There is a need for progress to be made on the development of a hospice for the south east in Waterford Regional Hospital and a satellite unit in Kerry.  As members will know, local communities have contributed significantly to the costs of developing inpatient units in these locations.<\/p><p>  We have a policies and strategies for specialist palliative care in Ireland.  Some recommendations in the most recent report, Palliative Care Services - Five Year\/Medium Term Development Framework, have been implemented.  However, most have not.  Palliative care in this country is traditionally recognised as being of a very high standard internationally.  It would, therefore, be a tragedy to see much of the good work done in this regard being reversed.<\/p><p>  The beauty of specialist palliative care is that those involved in it can care for people in their own homes.  In addition, more people are facilitated in the context of dying at home.  This is generally line with the wishes of patients.  There are excellent home-care services in areas that could be termed \"hospice poor\", namely, those which do not have inpatient units.  In such areas, however, patients do not have the choice of going to a hospice if their symptoms cannot be controlled at home.  As a result, their only option is to receive care and die in an acute hospital.  As everyone is aware, the latter is an expensive form of care.  This is contrary to national policy.  It is also contrary to the wishes of most patients, most of whom want to be cared for and to die at home.<\/p><p>  The key message we wish to get across is that people at end-of-life stage should be given priority status within our health service and should be protected.  In that context, there should be no further cuts to specialist palliative care.  Making such cuts would be shortsighted and would give rise to problems for those at end-of-life stage.  After all, we only have one opportunity to get this right.  Those to whom I refer are our most vulnerable citizens and patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800014#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352374200,"counter":1369,"content":"<p>Ms Lynch has had ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800015#R00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352374200,"counter":1370,"content":"<p>There are 1,400 children in Ireland with life-limiting conditions and about 350 children die every year.

It should not only be about airing one's concerns and hopes it is what actions the committee might take.  I do not want to be prescriptive but my view is that we should made a case, as a committee, to the Minister, on a number of the recommendations we have heard or else the exercise will not have a real purpose.  That is what I would like to see happen.  I will take them in reverse order.<\/p><p>  I thank Ms Caroline Lynch.  I have had the pleasure of meeting Ms Angela Edghill who brought me up to speed recently on the work of the Irish Hospice Foundation.  I concur that there should be no further cuts in the budget and that the levels for 2012 be maintained.  The budget is already down to &euro;78 million from &euro;81 million in 2011.  I hope the committee will make a case for the budget.  In a week when we are facing into the children's referendum on Saturday, I fully endorse one of the priority recommendations in regard to the appointment of the outstanding or remaining five children's out reach nurses.  That would be hugely important and I fully endorse that case.  <\/p><p>  On the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, I acknowledge the voluntary basis, the community basis, of the component parts of the organisation.  I very much welcome the reaffirmation that parents not only have a strong role in governance over the various entities within the federation but their voice is an essential and valued perspective going forward.  May we have a brief profile of the 650 school leavers accommodated within the current year?  It is to the great credit of the organisation that it has been able to accommodate school leavers within the budgetary restraints that it has had to manage, recognising that it is not only a 15% cut in the past four years but, as rightly pointed out, when added to the cut of &euro;3.7 million this year, plus PRSI, VAT and other increases, the real impact in 2012 is of the order of &euro;44 million as against the &euro;33 million suggested.  I wish the organisation continued success in all its work and I hope this short opportunity today will bear fruit.  <\/p><p>  I ask Mental Health Reform not to drop the ball on mental health.  I thank Dr. Shari McDaid for his presentation.  I acknowledge his contribution to members in the past 24 hours, along with another interested colleague, on the whole area of mental health provision.  I heard him say yesterday and again I note from his contribution today that he is working on the basis that the &euro;35 million that was mysteriously found in the back pocket of the jeans worn by the Minister State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch was somehow expended.  I have used this imagery previously and I will surely be in trouble with Cork Deputies if not with the Minister of State herself.  Dr. Shari McDaid is working on the basis that this might be applied for the current year but I believe the case for its employment in the current year is almost hopeless, that we have lost it.  Given the overall decrease of 1% in funding for mental health provision in the current year, the situation is grave as I do not see that &euro;35 million being put back into use in the current year.  While we would hope it will be in play for 2013 and as early as possible, will Dr. McDaid elaborate on that issue?  He is hoping to have &euro;35 million now and another to follow in 2013.  I wish that were so but it is important that is emphasised.  <\/p><p>  To Ms Maria Corbett of the Children's Right Alliance I say well done on all its work.  I hope we are looking at happy days post the referendum on Saturday next.  Given the stark facts she shared with us, almost one-fifth of all children in Ireland were living in households with an income below the poverty line in 2010.  That is a serious matter.  No matter what is achieved on Saturday there is a huge body of work to be done in order to provide for the rights of children as I understand it.  I concur with her that we want to see the UNCRC incorporated into Irish domestic law and that it is not only that children's best interests will be taken into account when the State is taking cases on custody, access and guardianship but also it has a case to answer for its failure to provide for the needs of children in education, health and all the other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800015#R00600","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1352374200,"counter":1374,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a few issues around the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.

I thank the Deputies for the kind words expressed about the Children's Rights Alliance.  They are much appreciated.  I was struck by the comments of the other presenters and the Deputies and Senators with regard to how interconnected everything is.  I am mindful that while I am referring to children we need to consider the impact of the cuts.  We have discussed the budget in a broad sense.  The effects are acute and not only cuts in child income supports but in the areas of education, mental health, home help and everything else.  We should keep in mind the cumulative effect of all of this.  Deputy Regina Doherty noted the importance of ensuring that we are not socially bankrupt.  There is a sense in which we need to get out of our silos and examine what we are doing to society and the impact of the cuts on society.<\/p><p>  I imagine the child benefit payment will be discussed on the airwaves in the coming weeks.  I emphasise the importance of the payment, which goes into virtually every household where there are children, because it is of its nature a guaranteed universal payment regardless of whether one is working.  There is a great deal of uncertainty in the lives of many families with regard to money coming in and going out.  At least it is a guaranteed payment and I am keen to put its importance on the table.<\/p><p>  We have spoken about the large number of children in poverty in Ireland.  We should not ignore that the make-up of that large number, one fifth of children, is rather varied.  Within that group there are several vulnerable groups.  In particular I have in mind the children of lone parent families and the children of asylum seeker families living in the direct provision system and the particular additional difficulties these groups face.  There are issues relating to families going through the homeless services as well.  When we discuss the matter we should not be too general or lose the detail because if we are to address child poverty and take it on we should think holistically about how we do it.<\/p><p>  When we are discussing making cuts and savings we should bear in mind the lifelong impact of being a child who grows up in consistent poverty.  It is very difficult to come back from there.  It is good investment to invest in children during this recessionary time and to ensure that children have a right to grow up free from poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800017#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352375400,"counter":1384,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time.  There were several questions on mental health and I will try to answer them as quickly as I can.  Deputy Kelleher asked about the need for more information on all the activity in the mental health and associated areas.  The Mental Health Commission is no longer reporting community mental health team staffing levels, although it used to do so.  The HSE does not report this information either.  In 2011 the Department of Health advised the incoming Minister for Health that efficiencies could be generated in the public mental health services through the development of a national mental health information system, as recommended in the document A Vision for Change.  There has been no movement in this area.  We have good information about child and adolescent mental health services and this is being reported annually.  However, we have no equivalent comprehensive information about adult mental health services.  We are calling for a modest investment in next year's budget to try to get at handle on what is happening in mental health services.  In a wider sense the National Office for Suicide Prevention reports annually on the range of voluntary sector initiatives it supports in the area of suicide prevention.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in rightly pointed out that we continue to be optimistic about the &euro;35 million in this year's budget.  We do not expect that &euro;35 million will be spent this year but we remain hopeful for the promised staff to be appointed before the end of the year.  We are calling for these staff to be appointed and for a commitment from the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Lynch, for a further tranche of money next year to cover additional staff, especially for the forensic services, services for intellectual disability and services for older people.  By the end of this year we hope the staff will be in place as promised this year and that the additional staff promised for next year will be put in place as well.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Byrne for her support on the issue of mental health generally.  I am sorry to hear about the particular occasions of suicide that occurred of which she has become aware.  We know that people with a diagnosis of a mental health difficulty are at a higher risk of taking their own life.  Certainly, there is some link with depression.  We know that the risk is very high in the first year when a person is diagnosed and begins treatment.  The question of mental health staff being put under pressure and therefore being unable to provide the level of follow-up that would be considered best practice is a particular concern in terms of the potential impact on the risk of people taking their own life.<\/p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty raised the tragic case of Una Butler.  She in turn has highlighted other cases where family members, including children, have lost their lives at the hand of another family member.  We agree that families should be involved as much as possible in an individual's mental health case, subject to the permission of the individual concerned.  We consider this to be good practice and it has been identified as good practice by the Mental Health Commission as part of its guidance and quality framework on the delivery of mental health services.  We believe it is important that metal health services staff fully understand their obligations under child protection legislation and guidelines and that there may be a need for further education of mental health staff on their statutory and other obligations in respect of child protection.<\/p><p>  Senator Colm Burke raised a broader issue on the role everyone can play in supporting positive mental health in Ireland.  His comments call to mind a story that a person told me about her personal recovery from a mental health difficulty.  The person said that one of the most important people to provide support to her in her mental health recovery was the local newsagent.  Every week when she went in to the local newsagent store to pick up a newspaper or bottle of milk, the newsagent asked how she was and whether she wanted a cup of coffee.  She said that person played a key role in her recovery.  I fully agree that everyone has the potential to make a notable impact on positive mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800017#T00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352376000,"counter":1385,"content":"<p>I will deal with Deputy Catherine Byrne's question about facts and figures on service reductions.  In my submission, I said that in spite of significant funding reductions we have managed to maintain front-line services to the best of our ability.  Most of our organisations are parents' and friends' associations, so one can imagine that they look at every expense before they go to front-line services.  Up to now, we have been able to manage that.  What has suffered is the quality of the service.  We are seriously concerned about that.  For 2013, all of the big ticket efficiency issues have been implemented and we are now looking at the front line for the first time.  That is a source of huge distress to us.  We have outlined what we are contemplating in the event of further service reductions.<\/p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty asked a number of questions.  I will deal with two of them.  At the start of the year when the budgets are announced, we will engage in a service level agreement process with the Health Service Executive.  A service level agreement is, essentially, a contract.  It is a quantum of service for an amount of money.  Of course, voluntary organisations are reluctant to reduce the quantum of service and that feeds into the deficit.  We try to maintain existing services, even in the face of funding cuts.  Up to now, and this relates to my answer to Deputy Byrne, we have managed as well as we can to maintain services, but service level arrangements for 2013 will be far more difficult because we will be looking at service reductions in the event of further cuts.  We deal with the HSE as colleagues.  We do not see them as the big bad wolf.  They are in a very difficult situation themselves.  However, they are acknowledging that for the first time service reduction is something that will have to be contemplated.     <\/p><p>  I included St. Michael's House in the pack because, although it is just one member organisation all our organisations are suffering.  I mentioned in my presentation that we have a perfect storm here, with the demographic going in one direction, finance and HR resources going in another and the gap between resources and demand on services ever widening.  That challenge for voluntary organisations to maintain a balance is becoming increasingly difficult.  The year 2013 brings us to the unfortunate place where we will have to contemplate service reductions so that we do not exacerbate that situation.<\/p><p>  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Christy Lynch, to deal with the questions on deficits and HSE special schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800018#U00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Donnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352376000,"counter":1386,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about school leavers.  The vast majority are people with intellectual disabilities.  Most of them are known to our agencies because we, typically, run special schools and respite services.  Most of these families are aligned with our agencies in any event and have an expectation that their children will move into some form of adult support programme.  This is the first year that no funding was available.  For the last few years not enough funding was available, but sometimes a little can be stretched and something achieved.  We responded, but our response relates to Deputy Regina Doherty's question as to why we have deficits.  In sorting out one problem, we created another.<\/p><p>  For example, this year students left school in June, not knowing what was going to happen in September.  This was very cruel.  We did not know what was going to happen, although we were working very closely with our colleagues in the HSE.  One should not have to sit in front of a mother whose daughter is doubly incontinent, uses a wheelchair, has no speech, has significant medical problems and needs to be fed and dressed, and say to that mother, who looks after her daughter 24 hours a day and seven days a week all year round, that she is being put on a waiting list.  We are parents' and friends' organisations.  We know better than anyone the impact of these things on families.  Yes, we responded but in doing so we created other problems.<\/p><p>  More and more children with complex medical needs are coming through the school system.  There is an increase in the level of autism, bringing high levels of challenging behaviour.  We are forcing more people into services, typically day services, that are already overstretched and we are asking fewer staff to deal with more people and more complex people.  Real issues are emerging with regard to our viability as companies, because of the deficit.  There are also health and safety issues.  How far can one stretch a piece of elastic before it snaps and something bad happens?  None of us wants to see that.    <\/p><p>  I have a comment on Deputy Dowds's remarks.  I heard the Minister for Health sum this up before last year's budget, when he addressed a group of parents in his constituency.  He made the point that people with disabilities were always on the margins, even in the best of times.  We agree with that.  I was on the board of the National Disability Authority when we launched the national disability strategy with great fanfare in very good days.   We needed that strategy because there was an acceptance that we came from a very low base.  The Minister made the point that even in times of austerity there are groups in society who need particular protection.  Having lost 15% of our budget, we feel, as my colleague has said, that we have done everything that could reasonably be expected to protect front-line services. <\/p><p>  For the first time ever in my memory, the Government acknowledged that 1.7% of the 3.7% cut could come off the front line.  This was because the HSE, and not the voluntary organisations, told the Government that all the low hanging fruit had been picked.  Some of our problems go back to the 1980s, when we had similar austerity and we created huge waiting lists.  We never got to the bottom of that, even in the so called good times.<\/p><p>  We were asked what we will do.  If there is another cut, many of us will go into next year carrying deficits.  We are companies so we cannot sustain that.  We will have to start taking apart front-line services that are essential to people.  If there is another cut on top of that we will have to cut even more.  Otherwise, organisations will follow the example of Cregg House, and it will not be the last, and go back to the HSE and say, \"Here are the keys; we cannot do this anymore\".<\/p><p>  A task force is working on a national policy for the reconfiguration of supports to children with disabilities.  It is called Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People.  In theory, I agree with what it is attempting to do, which is to bring equity and fairness into the system across the country.  The policy is to attempt to pool all therapists, with teams dealing with the age groups 0 to 5 and 5 to 18 in geographical areas.  My background is in occupational therapy.  We have never had enough therapists in the system.  Many therapists are linked to special schools and sometimes parents choose a special school in the hope that their child will get therapy.  In the new scenario, all the therapists will be pooled.  The moratorium on recruitment has meant we have been losing therapy posts in the last number of years, and we never had enough anyway.  Butter that was very thinly spread will be spread much more thinly, and this will be dressed up as equity.  Will special schools lose in this scenario?  Yes, they will. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012110800018#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christy Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352376000,"counter":1387,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the comments of members of the committee and their support for palliative care.<\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne is right.

It is a great honour for this committee to have the opportunity to engage with the EU Commissioner for Transport, Mr. Siim Kallas, and I hope I pronounced the Commissioner's name properly.   <\/p><p>  As we all know, on 1 January 2013 Ireland will assume the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the seventh time.  It is notable that the Presidency will coincide with the 40th anniversary of Ireland's accession to the then European Economic Community in 1973.  Clearly, Ireland will have a significant role to play in influencing the agenda of the EU during that six-month period.  The overarching priority for the Presidency will be to support a range of measures to secure sustainable economic growth and job creation, restore macroeconomic stability and enhance economic governance within the European Union.  <\/p><p>  During the Irish Presidency of the EU, the Houses of the Oireachtas will host eight conferences of committee chairpersons meetings commencing in January 2013 with the final conference taking place in June 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110800002#A00200","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352385900,"counter":1398,"content":"<p>I am happy to be here for several reasons.  First, I am originally from Estonia, a small country which has certain historical similarities with Ireland which has always been admired as a country by Estonians.  It is very nice that I am here for a second time.  On the first occasion I met the then Prime Minister and also had the opportunity to visit the Irish Parliament.  I have pleasant memories of my visit in 2003.  I am happy to talk to the committee about European transport policy.  I will make some introductory remarks and then will be available to answer the questions of members.<\/p><p>  The Chairman mentioned the Irish Presidency.  We met today the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, with whom I have had many previous meetings.  The Irish Government is preparing seriously for the Presidency which is also important for the transport portfolio, given that some important issues will have to be handled during the term of the Irish Presidency.  I would like to refer to some of them.<\/p><p>  I wish to start with a general observation.  Two and a half years ago when the European Commission started its new term, transport was considered as a nuisance &ndash; only as a problem.  It was not mentioned in any European strategic document.  It was only considered as a problem in terms of CO2 emissions and considered to have other bad accompanying features.  Now we recognise at European level in all strategic documents that transport is a very important sector of the economy.  A total of 8 million people earn revenues from transport, which is a big number.  The figure in terms of GDP is approximately 4%.  If one calculates the numbers involved in transport in conjunction with equipment manufacturers, the percentage becomes even higher.  For example, 12 million workers are employed in car manufacturing.  Transport is a big sector of the economy and also an important sector philosophically.  Again, coming from a country where mobility has been restricted for understandable reasons for a long time, we especially consider that freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital is one of the essential values of the European Union which can also be felt in countries such as Estonia.<\/p><p>  It is important to provide for transport policy.  Our White Paper states clearly that the curbing of mobility is not an option.  It is only one sentence in point No. 18.  This is an important sentence for me and the European Union transport policy because there are also other views; that one should force people not to move because transport is bad.  The official position is very clear.  Mobility is a great European value which we must maintain, support and develop.  That means also that we need physical infrastructure.  It is not only a question of rules and texts, but we must also develop physical infrastructure.<\/p><p>  One interesting project for European integration was developed in 1930.  Its author was a man called Dannie Heineman.  He developed a blueprint for the future European Union and all the elements he outlined are present today such as an authority to guarantee the functioning of the Internal Market, the Central Bank, the European Court of Justice and also infrastructure, including railways.  He called for a trans-European network of railways which he considered as important as other elements of European integration.  People have always considered that the European Union is of great value for many reasons, but mobility is one such value.<\/p><p>  The White Paper was presented a year and a half ago and we have pursued several of its objectives.  On the current position, I will outline the main points of today&rsquo;s discussion, the most important being the budget.  We are discussing the future European budget and will know by the end of November whether we will have an agreement.  This is very important for the Irish Presidency also because if the agreement is reached, there will be one type of work to deal with accompanying legislation.  More than 70 legislative Acts will be required, including the documents on a trans-European network.  If there is no agreement, difficult negotiations will continue.<\/p><p>  One could ask what is at stake.  One year ago the European Commission proposed a budgetary change that had two very important new elements, one of which was to create an instrument to connect Europe&rsquo;s facilities.  A total of &euro;50 billion will be spent on the instrument, including &euro;31.7 billion for transport and approximately &euro;10 billion for energy and IT infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110800003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Siim Kallas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352387100,"counter":1401,"content":"<p>I thank Commissioner Kallas for giving of such a detailed overview of the challenges that face the Irish Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110800005#D00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1352387100,"counter":1402,"content":"<p>I welcome Commissioner Kallas, his member of cabinet, and Ms Nolan, who is regularly in contact with this committee and other committees of which I am a member.

Ireland has a good track record on road safety.  This is based on our progressive and aggressive approach to saving lives on the road, largely through enhancing legislative measures.  Since Ireland is an island nation and since the island effectively has two jurisdictions, we have a difficulty levying penalty points on drivers from outside the State.  While our drivers are subject to our law and penalty-points regime, drivers from the six counties north of the Border are not.  Has the Commission any proposal for a pan-European approach to the levying of penalty points?<\/p><p>  I will not refer to rail networks because the Commissioner will appreciate that Ireland, as an island, is more dependent on its air links than its rail links.  Has the commissioner any views on the consolidation that has begun to take place in the aviation sector in recent years?  I do not expect him to discuss the Ryanair-Aer Lingus proposal which is before the Commission at present.  From a broad policy perspective, would it be better if Ireland had fewer larger airlines, or would it benefit more from having a greater number of smaller airlines?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110800005#D00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1352387100,"counter":1403,"content":"<p>I thank Commissioner Kallas, Ms Oen and Ms Nolan for attending.  A badly drawn map of Ireland I have to hand shows Dublin, Cork, Galway and Sligo.  I live in the north-west corner of Ireland in a beautiful constituency covering Sligo and Leitrim.  Given its beauty, I would love to see the Commissioner visit it.  A map of Ireland's infrastructure will show there is a rail line from Dublin to Belfast and from Dublin to Sligo.  One will see many rail lines south of the Dublin-Sligo line.  However, north of Sligo and west of the Dublin-Belfast line, there is no rail infrastructure and the roads continue to be very poor.  What are the Commissioner's thoughts on the internal distribution of project funding and on infrastructural development within nations?  What criteria should we be using?  While many decisions are made based on population ratios, these must not comprise the only consideration.<\/p><p>  The Commissioner referred to access and mobility, on which I agree with him completely.  Access and mobility are as important - if not more important - to people in remote areas as they are to those in centres of population.  Could the Commissioner speak briefly about the factors he believes member states should be taking into account regarding the internal distribution of funding for projects, including cross-border projects?  Much of the road infrastructure between Galway and Belfast, including that in Sligo, is good but there are stretches of the road that are simply not fit for purpose.

I wish to focus on maritime policy.  As Ireland is an island nation, 90% of its goods are exported through a handful of ports and it is critically important for commerce in Ireland to maintain an effective maritime sector.  The Commissioner might outline to the joint committee how the European Union is supporting and might continue to support the maritime industry with regard to the Motorways of the Sea project and the Marco Polo initiative, whereby funding could be maintained to encourage goods to be transported by sea, thereby encouraging lower fuel emissions.  The proposal is to divert goods from the highways and railroads of the European Union.  While diverting such traffic from roads and rail would be of major benefit at a European level, it also would be perceived as being critically important in an Irish context.<\/p><p>  My second point pertains to roadworthiness standards.

As he quite correctly noted, Ireland and Estonia share common interests and common priorities within the wider European Union context.

There are proposals from the United Kingdom's Government to introduce a levy of &pound;100 on access by commercial traffic into the United Kingdom.  I am unsure whether the Commissioner is familiar with this proposal and I have no further details, other than that when the secretariat checked on foot of my request, the response was that it was no stronger than a proposal.  Obviously, however, it is being discussed.  The Commissioner can understand how difficult this would be for Ireland, as has already been indicated, as an island nation with a political divide.  If the Commissioner is not aware of it, perhaps he or his <i>cabinet<\/i> might inform themselves because this measure will obviously be of great importance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110800006#E00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352388300,"counter":1409,"content":"<p>I wish to welcome the Commissioner and his staff, as well as Ms Barbara Nolan from the European Commission's Dublin office.

How cost effective is rail in the movement of people?<\/p><p>  I also wish to register a complaint which is a hobby-horse of mine.  The EU ruled against insurers in Ireland on gender equality, whereas prior to this ruling female drivers could get cheaper insurance.  The reverse now exists whereby we are being discriminated against because we are safer drivers.

As has been said already, we are so dependent on marine and air transport for access to this island nation.  Our regional airports are important not only for transport within this country but also for access to the UK and mainland Europe.  We have a public service obligation which operates in peripheral areas, including two of our strongest regional airports in Kerry and Donegal.  Both airports are very dependent on the tourism industry and are a key to attracting investment to both those areas.  What is the Commissioner's opinion on renewing these vital public service obligation contracts to these particular airports?  I cannot see a real future for them without EU subsidies.  They are important for rural development and connectivity both within and outside the country.<\/p><p>  Marine transport is also important for tourism.  A few years ago, a ferry service was revived between Wales and Ireland, sailing from Cork to Swansea.  There was a major effort, particularly from Deputy Harrington's constituency of west Cork, in conjunction with Kerry.  Private moneys were contributed along with local authority finance to revive that particular route.  Unfortunately, it has been abandoned and due to certain laws and regulations it was impossible for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to subscribe funding to it.  Nonetheless, that is a vital service and, given our current economic circumstances, we need to get that route back up and running.  Can support be obtained from the EU for that service due to our special case as an island nation?  The European rail network is a vital priority and is pivotal, but we have to make up for it with air and sea transport systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110800007#F00400","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352388300,"counter":1412,"content":"<p>We have at least nine issues of maritime policy which will be discussed during Ireland's EU Presidency.
