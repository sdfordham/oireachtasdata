The Supreme Court judgment, about which Members learned more yesterday, was absolutely scathing in that regard.  If the Deputy Leader does not arrange for the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to come into this House next week, my group and I will oppose each section of each item of business next week because the Government cannot be allowed to get away with this.<\/p><p>Yesterday, unlike any Government representative, I went outside Leinster House to meet people who were losing \u20ac325 in respite care grants and, in common with many Members, I met Paddy Doyle and a group of people there.  However, it was indicated to me yesterday that no Government representatives even went out to meet the protesters.  While \u20ac1 million might not be much to Senator Colm Burke and his Fine Gael colleagues, it would pay for a lot of respite care grants.  Consequently, \u20ac1 million wasted by the Government must be accounted for and, furthermore, I call into question the advice the Attorney General gave to the Government in this regard.  I cannot understand how such a glaring mistake was made on the children's rights referendum and I will insist that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, comes into this House next week.  I am putting Senator Bacik on notice that if she does not arrange for this, Fianna F\u00e1il will oppose each session of business next week.  The Minister is answerable to this House and she must come in to account for how the Government took this decision.  I ask the Deputy Leader to do this and I am sure time can be arranged in this regard.<\/p><p>To return to the issue of the respite care grant, I understand the Social Welfare Bill will be before the Seanad next week.  My group, as well as other groupings, I am sure, including Sinn F\u00e9in and the Independent Members, will table amendments to it.  Members will have an opportunity next week to rectify what it appears as though the D\u00e1il will ram through this week with a massive majority of 56 seats.  Members of this House have an opportunity to rectify the issues with the respite care grant, children's benefit and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  Labour Party and Fine Gael Members will have an opportunity to show that the Seanad has relevance and teeth next week.  I ask them to take soundings from the people over the weekend, that is, from their neighbours and constituents, about how they view cuts to respite care grants and other choices that could have been made by the Government.  There will be an opportunity next week to make amendments to the Social Welfare Bill and to send it back to the Government.<\/p><p>I reiterate that I find it incredible how no Government Senators or Deputies went out to meet the protesters outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday.

Moreover, Members, including Senators Quinn and Daly and many others, have continued to push to have this hotline in operation.  While it now is in operation, unfortunately it only is doing so for 18 hours a day until March 2013, after which the ISPCC will be able to operate it for 24 hours per day.

I then had lifted my pen to warn the people of the calamity about to befall the nation from the imposition of a debased currency on the citizenry to their grave disadvantage and peril.  I little thought that the employment of a goose's quill would again become necessary after such an interval.  It has of late come under my observation that a new punishment has been devised upon the population to their infinite despair and misery by our imperial rulers - to wit, the wanton destruction of 3,000 million of their bank notes- a nice amount and by act of providence as if in warning an exact image of that sum recently diverted from their purse by the Government's proposed budget.  Mr. Woods produced at least a currency, though of negligible value.

We will not accept a new IMF deal negotiated by this Government.  What has the Government got in return from agreeing to repossessions?  Have the people of Ireland achieved anything from this, why did it have to be agreed by this Government and why is the IMF interfering in what is effectively an interpretation of Irish statute law?  What business is it of the IMF?  We were constantly criticised by this Government for the deal done in November 2010 but this is a new deal negotiated by this Government.

Its Irish exports amount to approximately \u20ac40 billion and Ireland spends less than \u20ac2 billion per year on drugs.  We have such a large manufacturing and export presence because of the 12.5% corporation tax rate, the presence of people who can do the necessary jobs, our membership of the EU, the fact that we speak English and a degree of political stability.  It has nothing to do with the size of the domestic market for the sale or purchase of drugs.<\/p><p>Ireland is a very small market.  Traditionally, we have had a relatively liberal approval and purchasing regime.  It is not the wild west, as someone outrageously described it recently, but a system that is roughly in line with the one that applies in most countries in western Europe that have social democratic-based health systems.  It is not in line with the UK's system, which historically has had the most restrictive access to new drugs and the inferior outcome statistics to go with it.<\/p><p>We are dealing with a difficult situation.  The pharma manufacturing and export sector is important to our real economy, we have a critical need to decrease costs in our health service and we need to try to maintain ease of access for patients with cystic fibrosis and cancer to drugs that are otherwise difficult to provide.  It will be a challenge all round.<\/p><p>Through the office of the Leader, I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach, who apparently became involved in this situation, my belief that there is zero linkage between where companies decide to put their factories and what we decide to spend on drugs.  They are separate issues.  If an attempt was made to represent the situation in any other way by the pharma sector, the Taoiseach should be warned that it was a bit of a stunt. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200006#G01000","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1355310000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I acknowledge and welcome the fact that this is world human rights week.

We will not accept a new IMF deal negotiated by this Government.  What has the Government got in return from agreeing to repossessions?  Have the people of Ireland achieved anything from this, why did it have to be agreed by this Government and why is the IMF interfering in what is effectively an interpretation of Irish statute law?  What business is it of the IMF?  We were constantly criticised by this Government for the deal done in November 2010 but this is a new deal negotiated by this Government.

Its Irish exports amount to approximately \u20ac40 billion and Ireland spends less than \u20ac2 billion per year on drugs.  We have such a large manufacturing and export presence because of the 12.5% corporation tax rate, the presence of people who can do the necessary jobs, our membership of the EU, the fact that we speak English and a degree of political stability.  It has nothing to do with the size of the domestic market for the sale or purchase of drugs.<\/p><p>Ireland is a very small market.  Traditionally, we have had a relatively liberal approval and purchasing regime.  It is not the wild west, as someone outrageously described it recently, but a system that is roughly in line with the one that applies in most countries in western Europe that have social democratic-based health systems.  It is not in line with the UK's system, which historically has had the most restrictive access to new drugs and the inferior outcome statistics to go with it.<\/p><p>We are dealing with a difficult situation.  The pharma manufacturing and export sector is important to our real economy, we have a critical need to decrease costs in our health service and we need to try to maintain ease of access for patients with cystic fibrosis and cancer to drugs that are otherwise difficult to provide.  It will be a challenge all round.<\/p><p>Through the office of the Leader, I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach, who apparently became involved in this situation, my belief that there is zero linkage between where companies decide to put their factories and what we decide to spend on drugs.  They are separate issues.  If an attempt was made to represent the situation in any other way by the pharma sector, the Taoiseach should be warned that it was a bit of a stunt. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200008#G01000","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1355311200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I acknowledge and welcome the fact that this is world human rights week.

I had hoped that, at least if the Minister rejected the amendments on the basis of their lack of sophistication, which I accept, but he accepted the principle underpinning them, he could offer a way to provide for this categories of child minders.  For example, we do not want a situation to arise where someone working as a nanny represents a child welfare risk and such a person simply moves to work in another home?  That is dangerous and wrong and it should not be beyond the capability of the House to find a way to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200009#O00100","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1355311800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I also tabled an amendment to deal with this issue.  The difficulty I have is there is one big anomaly in the vetting and protection of children.  The Child Care Act 1991 distinguishes three groups.  Everyone is in agreement that the first group under section 58(a) are the relatives of the child or children or the spouse of such relatives but that is not what we are seeking to amend.  We are referring to sections 58(b) and 58(c), which concern a person taking care of one or more preschool children of the same family and no other such children in that person's home, or a person taking care of not more than three preschool children of different families in his or her home.  A total of 92% of victims are abused by either a direct family member, somebody known to the family or somebody trusted by the family.  The fact that the children are being minded in their home means they are members of a high risk group and, therefore, we need to explode the \"stranger danger\" myth.  The reality is a child is most likely to be abused by someone known to, and trusted by, the family.<\/p><p>I agree with the Minister that there is a major difference between an informal, occasional child minding arrangement and an ongoing arrangement for a monetary consideration, which is what we are concerned with.  I listened carefully to the Minister's argument and I could use the same argument not to vet tennis coaches because they often engage in one-on-one training of children in a private arrangement with their families.  I do not know why the Minister is protecting this group.  This sector is unregulated.  The Minister said the parents would have to vet.  Why can such child minders not have to become a member of a professional organisation such as Childminding Ireland, or Early Childhood Ireland.  Why can those organisations not vet on behalf of the parents?  There are ways around this.  Parents need to know the person minding their child in their home, as opposed to a public place or somewhere other people can interact with them, has been vetted.  These minders are members of a high-risk group and that is why I tabled an amendment.  I do not say it is a perfect amendment and I will be happy with any amendment that deals with this issue.  This anomaly needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200009#O00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1355311800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I am also disappointed with the Minister.  The argument has been made clear relative to his response.  This is about persons who do this work for reward, specifically set up a child minding service and who may not even know the children.  This is not about those engaged in personal intrafamily arrangements or neighbours.  They may have a vague relationship with the families and be from the same neighbourhood but there would not be the intimacy the Minister's reply suggested.<\/p><p>My understanding, following discussions with his officials prior to Second Stage, is a self-employed person could be construed as a relevant organisation.  In other words, he or she would be legally obliged to register under the legislation.  Will the Minister clarify the position on this for Report Stage?  Nothing in the section refers to the category of persons we are discussing, which is probably the Minister's difficulty.  If clarify could be brought to that, the self-employed could be deemed to be legally obliged to register.<\/p><p>I have a particular interest in this as chairman of Leitrim county childcare committee, which is part of a quasi-national organisation.  The vetting issue comes up on a regular basis not only in the context of our board meetings but in our interactions with other statutory committees throughout the State.  Some of my colleagues have said that there should not only be a legal obligation on child minders to ensure they are vetted under the new legislation but there should be a designated person within the family who should also be required to vet whenever the primary child minder has to leave the house.  The last time I heard reference to stranger danger was a massive hit by Stella Parton, a sister of Dolly Parton, with a song called &quot;The Dangers of a Stranger&quot;.  I am sure she was not necessarily singing about child abuse but it reminds people of the issue.<\/p><p>Perhaps an accommodation can be found within the section that might provide that a self-employed child minder would be legally obliged to be vetted, which might address the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200009#O00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1355311800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Noel Grealish and his guests to the Visitors Gallery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200009#O00400","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1355311800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>The Minister and I may often have grave disagreements on issues of political expediency and policy but I do not underestimate his ability as a legislator.  What has been said is logical and makes a great deal of sense.  We almost need to step back from this.  Similar to Senator Mooney, I was chairman of the Galway city and county childcare committee for a number of years and one of the biggest issues we had was ensuring formal recognition of people working as child minders, which is difficult.  The more burdens placed on them, the more difficult it was to get them on board as registered child minders.  However, the issues raised by Senators Power, van Turnhout and Power are valid.  The intention of the legislation is to make society safer for children, no matter which adults come into contact with them.  In vetting people who deal with children, it is important to make sure we can take everyone possible into the net in order that it is ensured that anybody who might be a potential danger to children can be identified.  The Minister would be well able to do that if the will was there.<\/p><p>The second line of amendment No. 1 states, &quot;in their individual capacity, engages in the provision of child-minding...&quot;.  If that was changed to &quot;in their professional capacity&quot;, would that delineate between somebody who is child minding as part of a casual arrangement in a family scenario and professional child minders?  That would indicate that this is what the person does for a living.  Would tweaking the wording of the amendment allow the Minister to encompass the safety element suggested by the other Senators while not making it cumbersome and awkward to police?  I take that point on board because, as somebody who dealt with the child minding sector in Galway, the issue was always whether vetting could be policed and resourced, given there are many child minders.  The amendments have been tabled in good faith and they make sense.  I urge the Minister, given his eminent legal ability, to find a wording that takes on board the suggestions being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200009#O00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355311800,"counter":234,"content":"<p>We discussed this difficult issue on Second Stage and we all appreciate a balance must be struck between ensuring the safety of children, which is a paramount consideration, and ensuring the legislation is reasonable.

That was in light of a survey in Northern Ireland on national identity, which I also read with interest.

The grant is not means-tested but the cut will clearly have an adverse effect and particularly disadvantage some people on low means.  A review would be useful and has been raised.<\/p><p>  Senator Gilroy has called for a debate on the abolition of the whip system but the question is whether the debate would be subject to a whip.

We could look into that.<\/p><p>  Senator Mullins commented on the study of the Consumer Association of Ireland on illegal installation of gas boilers.

His father has been very vocal in newspapers since in seeking tougher regulation in the area.

If a parent chooses a grandparent, an in-law, a neighbour, a nanny, an au pair, a sibling or a family friend to mind their child, whether that person is paid or unpaid, the parent is free to make child care arrangements that are appropriate to their circumstances.  Second, it is not the intention to criminalise parents for making such arrangements.  It is, therefore, not feasible to require vetting disclosures in respect of such private arrangements.<\/p><p>The Senator said, and I hope I do not misquote her, that she did not intend that a neighbour's child who was minding young children in their home would come under this requirement.

The difficulty I have is there is one big anomaly in the vetting and protection of children.  The Child Care Act 1991 distinguishes three groups.  Everyone is in agreement that the first group under section 58(a) are the relatives of the child or children or the spouse of such relatives but that is not what we are seeking to amend.  We are referring to sections 58(b) and 58(c), which concern a person taking care of one or more preschool children of the same family and no other such children in that person's home, or a person taking care of not more than three preschool children of different families in his or her home.  A total of 92% of victims are abused by either a direct family member, somebody known to the family or somebody trusted by the family.  The fact that the children are being minded in their home means they are members of a high risk group and, therefore, we need to explode the \"stranger danger\" myth.  The reality is a child is most likely to be abused by someone known to, and trusted by, the family.<\/p><p>I agree with the Minister that there is a major difference between an informal, occasional child minding arrangement and an ongoing arrangement for a monetary consideration, which is what we are concerned with.  I listened carefully to the Minister's argument and I could use the same argument not to vet tennis coaches because they often engage in one-on-one training of children in a private arrangement with their families.  I do not know why the Minister is protecting this group.  This sector is unregulated.  The Minister said the parents would have to vet.  Why can such child minders not have to become a member of a professional organisation such as Childminding Ireland, or Early Childhood Ireland.  Why can those organisations not vet on behalf of the parents?  There are ways around this.  Parents need to know the person minding their child in their home, as opposed to a public place or somewhere other people can interact with them, has been vetted.  These minders are members of a high-risk group and that is why I tabled an amendment.  I do not say it is a perfect amendment and I will be happy with any amendment that deals with this issue.  This anomaly needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200013#O00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1355313900,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I am also disappointed with the Minister.

They may have a vague relationship with the families and be from the same neighbourhood but there would not be the intimacy the Minister's reply suggested.<\/p><p>My understanding, following discussions with his officials prior to Second Stage, is a self-employed person could be construed as a relevant organisation.  In other words, he or she would be legally obliged to register under the legislation.  Will the Minister clarify the position on this for Report Stage?

Similar to Senator Mooney, I was chairman of the Galway city and county childcare committee for a number of years and one of the biggest issues we had was ensuring formal recognition of people working as child minders, which is difficult.  The more burdens placed on them, the more difficult it was to get them on board as registered child minders.  However, the issues raised by Senators Power, van Turnhout and Power are valid.  The intention of the legislation is to make society safer for children, no matter which adults come into contact with them.  In vetting people who deal with children, it is important to make sure we can take everyone possible into the net in order that it is ensured that anybody who might be a potential danger to children can be identified.

Would tweaking the wording of the amendment allow the Minister to encompass the safety element suggested by the other Senators while not making it cumbersome and awkward to police?  I take that point on board because, as somebody who dealt with the child minding sector in Galway, the issue was always whether vetting could be policed and resourced, given there are many child minders.  The amendments have been tabled in good faith and they make sense.  I urge the Minister, given his eminent legal ability, to find a wording that takes on board the suggestions being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200013#O00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355313900,"counter":290,"content":"<p>We discussed this difficult issue on Second Stage and we all appreciate a balance must be struck between ensuring the safety of children, which is a paramount consideration, and ensuring the legislation is reasonable.  The Minister is correct to point out that reward cannot be the criterion.  I know as a parent this is not just about a neighbour's child baby-sitting my child.<\/p> <p>Many people have informal arrangements, which are nonetheless commercial arrangements because there is a reward involved, where one has a neighbour minding one's child for an afternoon or for a few hours a week.  We must be reasonable about what is required of parents and the Minister is right in that regard.  I am also conscious that, as Senator van Turnout said, children are often at risk from people we would never envisage vetting, including relatives and other people living in the family home.  We need to be conscious of all of that.<\/p><p>The definitions in the Bill are somewhat complex.  I believe that some of the matters Senator Power rightly said should be covered are in fact covered.  For instance certain types of au-pair arrangements where somebody is au-pairing as part of a course of education or training are already covered.  Senator Power spoke about a professional nanny service, which is different from a neighbour minding one's child for a couple of hours a week, but they are both commercial arrangements.  However, a professional company employing nannies is already covered.  We need more clarity on what is covered and what is excluded.  Some of the things that all of us agree should be covered are already covered but given that the definitions are somewhat complex and one needs to read through sections 2 and 3, and the Schedule, it can be difficult to see what is covered and what is excluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200013#O00600","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355314500,"counter":292,"content":"<p>The relevant organisations are referenced in section 2, I believe.  I do not want to delay the House by reading through them.  Schedule 1 also details a range of things.  Legislation in this area has been promised for years - I do not say this to score a political point.  Legislation in this area is complex and has been promised since 2003.  When I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, we published a report, I believe, in September 2008 urging the then Minister of State with responsibility for children to publish this legislation by Christmas 2008.  For a number of years the previous Government delayed it on the grounds that there was a constitutional impediment to dealing with this.  The previous Government went through all sorts of gyrations on that issue.  When it was first examined by the committee it was decided there was not a constitutional difficulty and the late, Brian Lenihan finally accepted that.  Rather than publishing legislation by December 2008, as the committee urged, no legislation was published and there has been no protection for children in these areas as envisaged by this Bill in the context of soft information, in particular.  Of course the vetting bureau is doing much good work with hard information, but not with soft information.  We are now at the end of 2012 and certainly four years on from when the Oireachtas committee examined the matter, I regard it as urgent that we enact this legislation.<\/p><p>The legislation recognises a dividing line, which is that individuals and families are entitled to make certain private arrangements relating to child minding without them being criminalised if they do not engage in vetting - it is not appropriate to criminalise people.  Where agencies are recruiting individuals, who might be professional child-minders or professional au pairs, it is appropriate that those individuals provided to a family through such a business agency be vetted, particularly when this is a business co-ordinating a broad range of people.<\/p><p>Let us consider the practicality of this.  There are all sorts of circumstances relating to children.  I fully accept the amendment is well intended - I do not want to be misunderstood in that regard.  However, I need to consider the wording of the amendment and not its intention.  If a mother and father, married or unmarried, wanted to go out for an evening asked the neighbour's 17 or 18 year old, who gets on very well with their child, to mind their five or six year old child and they are going to pay the person for that, the Senator's amendment would criminalise the parents for not having the neighbour's child vetted - we cannot do that.  People often make family arrangements in all sorts of circumstances at the last minute.<\/p><p>Let us deal with the au-pair issues.  There are two or three different ways to get an au pair.  A family might deal through an agency operating in Dublin, in which case the au pair will be vetted.  The vetting of au-pairs can have limited usefulness in any case.  I know a number of families with young children who in recent years had au pairs.  Some of the au pairs were young women in their early 20s who had come from Poland.  Some of them were in third level education in Ireland.  They were staying with the family and in return for the food and roof over their heads, and they acted as an au pair sometime during the day or the evenings looking after the children.  The Garda bureau cannot undertake any vetting that is relevant for a young woman who has arrived from Poland, Italy or Spain to check the position.<\/p><p>Parents take responsibility and there is a responsibility on parents in some areas when they make private arrangements.  We are ensuring that people who work with children for clubs or other organisations either voluntarily or for payment are vetted.  We are ensuring that people in the education and health sectors are also vetted.  There is a broad range of circumstances for vetting.  However, we live in an imperfect world and cannot legislate for everything.  The dividing line determined in the Bill is that where families make a private arrangement with an individual - not through an agency - they are entitled to some family autonomy.  It is almost impossible to address this in legislation in a way that would not create a real problem for practical arrangements that are made every day by families and which give rise to no problem.<\/p><p>We all know of child abuse and institutional abuse in the churches and elsewhere that has received so much publicity.  From all the work I have done over many years in family law on child protection issues, I am very aware that more children are abused in the home, by relations or by neighbours than have been abused by members of the clergy or by strangers.  Based on the research evidence, this State is no different from others.  There have been incidents of abuse and prosecutions of individuals involved in child minding.  However, the overwhelming majority of abuse has not been by people recruited to mind children.  It is much more likely to be the uncle, the grandfather or father.  In a smaller number of cases it has been the mother of the child.  It could be the father of the child, who lives next door, who has never babysat.  We live in a very imperfect world where we cannot legislate for everything.  Sadly we cannot legislate to wipe away the fact that children are at risk in certain circumstances.  We must recognise a degree of family autonomy and that families are entitled to make private arrangements.<\/p><p>This legislation is new and provides for the use of soft information.  While the legislation is quite complex, it is built on the practical experience of how the vetting bureau operates.  This is a step we cannot take.  I want to ensure we have the best legislation we can have within the constitutional constraints, under which we operate.  Of course we have thought about this issue to see if there is a practical way to deal with it.  The dividing came down to where families make private arrangements with an individual.  whether it is a private arrangement with someone up the road who will come in and clean the house for a couple of hours two or three days a week because the husband or wife is unable to do it or they are both working and there happen to be children in the home, whether someone is formally coming in to child-mind or whether it is someone coming on the occasional evening five or six times a year, there are areas into which we cannot enter.<\/p> <p>These are areas of privacy for families.  Families make their judgments.  Many families in this area make good judgments.  They do not need vetting.<\/p><p>Then there is the other obvious issue, which is the capacity of the vetting bureau to process all of this.  If one looks at the myriad of private arrangements that individuals make some of which have a semi-commercial tint, if someone is looking after one's child one will often pay them for doing so.  If someone is coming in to clean one's house one will pay them something to do that and they may come in contact with one's children.  There is a limit to the capacity of the vetting bureau to engage in vetting.  There will be a considerable amount of important additional work derived from the use of soft information and the provisions of the Bill, and it is important that this is up and running.<\/p><p>I will make one point to Members which applies to every piece of legislation.  There is no monopoly of wisdom with regard to any piece of legislation that comes before this House no matter how well it has been teased out.  We all are constantly engaged in legislating either because we are revisiting areas that have been previously addressed where flaws have been disclosed or there is a new area in respect of which legislation is required that has not previously been addressed.  This is an area in a sense that has not been previously properly addressed in the State by way of legislation.  If it emerges, through experience, that there is some frailty in the legislation, if it turns out, in its operation and application, that some amendments are needed, for as long as I am Minister I can say to this House I will not be slow to introduce amending legislation that could be required as a consequence of the experience in working with what we have.  However, what we have is very important.  It is important we get it enacted before the end of this year, we get it up and running, and that another year does not pass before the substantial additional protections afforded by this legislation to children are in operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200014#P00200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355315100,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Power, I wish to inform colleagues that there are 43 minutes remaining.

Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh has provided an excellent alternative which would greatly improve the wording that the Fianna F\u00e1il group tabled.  It would read better if it stated, &quot;in their professional capacity&quot;.  I would also suggest that we could delete &quot;for any period of time&quot;, because the Minister stated that such could be an hour or a year.

Personally, I am not happy to do that.  I am not happy to wait until there is a situation where somebody who would have been captured by an amendment on this, somebody who has been working as a nanny somewhere where there is an identified child protection risk moves to another employer, does not get checked, the Minister at that stage accepts that there is a problem and seeks to do something about it.

The person may be caring for an individual who is of any age who suffered some catastrophic injury.  Effectively, these are private arrangements and often they are familial arrangements.

This is because, as I explained on Second Stage, the spent convictions Bill provides that where a people are applying for positions which give them access to children or vulnerable persons, they must disclose all convictions, including any convictions that could otherwise be deemed spent under the Bill.  That policy is supported by the provisions in the Bill before the House today.  Because of the overriding need to protect children and vulnerable persons, a policy decision has been taken that the spent convictions provisions should not apply where persons are applying for these positions.  This is because relatively minor convictions, which may ordinarily be deemed spent, could still have a particular reference in regard to persons working with children or vulnerable adults.  For example, when the spent convictions Bill is in force, a conviction for theft or fraud may become a spent conviction if the penalty imposed is less than 12 months' imprisonment and other criteria are satisfied.  However, that information might be relevant to a position of trust working with a vulnerable person.  In those circumstances it could be inappropriate that such a conviction be excluded from information furnished pursuant to vetting.<\/p><p>Similarly, many road traffic convictions may become spent convictions.  However, these may be relevant to a position working as a driver of a school bus or a public service vehicle for persons with disabilities.  We live in a grey world where there are not absolute solutions to everything.  I am anxious that people should have a second chance to get on in life.  Where they have made some error in life, it is important that, if they do not re-offend, they are not burdened by convictions long ago that have no relevance to how they are conducting their lives today.<\/p><p>We have to be careful about some areas, however.  For example, one can imagine the furore, concern and anger if, 15 years later, an individual who suffered a conviction for drunken driving, and the conviction was spent, was driving a school bus which crashed, a number of children lost their lives and it was discovered that the driver was drunk.  We have to deal with the real world and its concerns.  It may well be that if individuals are seeking that sort of job and disclose a conviction, they would be able to convince the prospective employer that they are a changed person and have no problems with alcohol.  Then, at least, the employer takes responsibility, knows of the background and can make an informed judgment.  However, there are circumstances in which, because of the greater need to provide protection for children or other vulnerable individuals, someone's record - that may be spent for other purposes - will be disclosed in a vetting process.  <\/p><p>While I am probably saying this to the point of boredom, there is no monopoly of wisdom but there is a balance to be achieved.  We think at this stage that this is the right balance.  We have given very careful consideration to this matter.  My initial reaction when we were preparing the legislation was that, once we were dealing with the spent convictions Bill, it is unfair to an individual whose conviction is spent that it should re-emerge in his or her life in particular circumstances.  One must take the example of the crashed school bus or someone who in their early 20s was convicted of theft and is now, in their late 30s, minding a vulnerable adult and money starts disappearing.  Would the family who employed that individual, and knew nothing about that record, not be entitled to be outraged and ask &quot;Why didn't we know this person had a past?&quot;  We think that we have achieved the balance and we hope we have.  The overriding and overarching principle is to provide protection to children and vulnerable adults.  I cannot therefore accept the amendment the Senator has tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200017#S00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1355316300,"counter":323,"content":"<p>To use the Minister's own logic against him, he argued that one cannot legislate for everything.  I would imagine that the number of instances of crashed school buses by people who might have had a spent conviction is very small.  Thankfully, we have only had a limited number of fatalities in crashed school buses.  I would put the corollary to the Minister, which might be more common place.  For example, people with a spent conviction might have had an alcohol problem in their early lives. They could have had alcohol rehabilitation and might have had a drink driving offence which then became a spent conviction.  If they then applied for a job as a school bus driver - with the vetting procedures that are being suggested and if their spent convictions are all counted in - is there a possibility that they will not receive the vetting because in their spent convictions they had a charge of drunk driving?  Therefore, they may be excluded from getting a job as a school bus driver.  I contend that one could equally have a grey area on that side of the argument.  That is why the Irish Human Rights Commission has argued that point.  I agree with the Minister that there are grey areas, but I contend that the number of people who would be excluded because of the inclusion of spent convictions might increase more so than the incidence of accidents caused due to allowing one or two people through.<\/p><p>As the Minister said earlier, we cannot legislate for everything.  There will be cases where things slip through the gaps and unforeseen things occur.  I am afraid, however, that there is a contradiction between a spent conviction and this Bill, in that one is dragging up somebody's past.  It may involve people who have made a genuine effort to rehabilitate themselves and get on with their lives.  They are then told: &quot;We've cleaned your slate and you've left that behind.  You have repaid your debts and society is allowing you to move on.&quot;  We have done the same with the Personal Insolvency Bill.  The same principle applies in that regard where we draw a line in the sand so people can move on.<\/p><p>If this amendment is not accepted, however, it appears that we are saying: &quot;We have buried the hatchet but we're going to put a flag where the hatchet is and go back and dig it up if we need it.&quot;  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200017#S00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355316300,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I have listened carefully to the debate because, like the Minister, at the beginning of this issue I would also have supported Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh.  It is important, however, that organisations would know of such soft information.  The Minister's words have been very useful.  My difficulty is that a conviction, or even a spent conviction, is barring people from so many professions.  I have a huge difficulty with that.  For example, one cannot do courses in the social work and care professions if one has had a previous conviction, even if one has been rehabilitated.  I understand what the Minister is saying about having the knowledge, but I do not think that all such avenues should be closed off for one's whole life because a person shoplifted once in his or her early 20s.  It was wrong but if people took the punishment and were rehabilitated they should be allowed to go on.  It is about striking the right balance.  While it may not necessarily be relevant to this Bill, when we get back to dealing with spent convictions, there is an issue about how such people are treated by organisations and professions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200017#S00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1355316300,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Does an tAire wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200017#S00500","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1355316300,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Yes.  This is a difficult area and there is no monopoly of wisdom.  My concern is exactly as articulated by Senators \u00d3 Clochartaigh and van Turnhout, which is where individuals have got on with their lives and put their past behind them, it seems extremely unfair that some 20 years later the past might catch up with them.  Of course that is a concern.  On the other hand, however, we are trying to ensure as much protection as possible for children and vulnerable adults, so one would need the wisdom of Solomon to square this circle.  At the end of the day, one has to make a judgment and we have done so.  The fact that there is a conviction from 15 or 20 years earlier in one's life does not necessarily exclude a person from a particular position.  It can be the judgment of those who are advertising the position that a person should be given the post.<\/p><p>For example, we would all know of some individuals who are doing extraordinarily valuable youth work in this country, but who may have had difficult teenage years.  We all know of individuals who have been alcoholics or have been addicted to gambling, but who are now working in centres for individuals who suffer from those addictions.  In fact, some of the best people working in those areas have gone through that trouble in their own lives and came out the other side.  The very insight that has given them has meant that the work they are now doing is very valuable.  They are not necessarily individuals who were ever convicted of anything.<\/p> <p>However, in the youth area, I note some youth workers certainly were convicted during their teenage years.  I refer to their experience in life, their changed personality and present position and note the irony is the fact they went through those difficulties has assisted them in getting these jobs.  In this case, the convictions have not been the obstacle but in fact indicated a level of trouble, out of which they built, and that they now really have something to offer in, because they understand kids who are in that position today.  Consequently, I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.  However, I do not pretend this is an easy issue, as it is not and I have no doubt we will return to debate it further on the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200017#S00600","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355316900,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Is Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh pressing the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200018#T00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1355316900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200018#T00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355316900,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355316900,"counter":331,"content":"<p>SECTION 12<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355316900,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355316900,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I seek clarification in respect of section 12(5), which states, &quot;This section shall not apply to any employment, contract, permission or placement referred to ... that commenced or was entered into ... before the commencement of this section&quot;.

The club or organisation or whatever that employed him or her is not committing an illegality under the legislation by retaining him or her.  Moreover, it is not instantly compelled to have him or her vetted because quite clearly, when this Bill comes into operation, a range of people will fall into that particular position.  However, I am also providing for retrospective vetting where people are in particular employments.  One can require, by ministerial order, that over a period of time to be prescribed, vetting can take place.  Consequently, although there is no illegality in keeping them in place for the period following the legislation coming into operation, there are areas in which people currently are working who may not have been vetted at any point in time.  These areas will be examined and it will be possible, by ministerial order, to bring them into a vetting process and require that within a defined period, such people be vetted.

New staff have been recruited to the vetting office, whose training probably is just about being completed around now, who have been transferred from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I also have had discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, about the Department getting further staff in the context of the arrangements that are in place under the Croke Park agreement for transfer of staff from different parts of the public service.  I am trying to secure additional staff in that manner, in order not to add further to public expenditure.  The Department also used the JobBridge scheme to get individuals into the vetting office who were trained and did an excellent job on foot of that training.  At one point, the Department had ten individuals working in the vetting bureau under the JobBridge scheme.<\/p><p>I am very conscious that the bringing into force of this legislation will add additional pressures.

There have been occasions when there has been an urgent need to have an individual vetted for particular work and they have been facilitated by the vetting bureau where the urgency has been properly communicated.

As I noted, such vetting already takes place as it is required by the contracts entered into my Department.

Many of the companies involved in the operation of direct provision centres may hire in or subcontract tasks such as catering, cleaning, security and so forth.

It is essential that such persons are covered because all those who come into contact with children in accommodation centres should be vetted.

I believe we strayed from the point on Committee Stage.  The point made by Senator Power was that we wished to deal with people who are working with children in homes in a professional capacity as childminders.  They should be included in the vetting procedures.  Senator van Turnhout clearly outlined on Committee Stage the reasons this is desirable.  Many abuse situations or situations of impropriety can happen where people are dealing directly with children in a more domestic setting.  There is no good reason that people who are doing this as a profession or are working in a professional capacity for their main income or for monetary gain should not be included in this vetting.  The aim of the vetting is to ensure that we will know if there is a risk of somebody doing something with children that he or she should not do, and we must ensure those people are not allowed next or near the children in a professional capacity.

Amendment No. 4 states: \"to include work carried out by persons who engage in the provision of professional child-minding services for reward including work carried out by a nanny and\/or au pair service...\".  First, with regard to an au pair service, an organisation or a service that is employing people as nannies means those nannies will be vetted.  Getting somebody from a service is separate from employing an individual au pair.  The reference is to professional childminding.  This would breach the line that I described between an individual privately making an arrangement with another individual, as opposed to an individual making an arrangement with an organisation or business of some description.<\/p><p>The proposed amendment contains no definition of a professional childminding service.  It states: &quot;to include work carried out by persons who engage in the provision of professional child-minding services..&quot;.  If it is a professional childminding service that employs individuals and I contact the service and it sends me an individual to work with a vulnerable child, the service would have had an obligation to carry out vetting.  This amendment does not work.  If the Senator is referring to an individual who professionally carries out a service, as opposed to the way the amendment is phrased, there would have to be a definition of what is meant by &quot;who professionally carries out a service&quot;.<\/p><p>We do not need an uncertain provision in the Bill that generates a grey area, particularly a grey area that could result in somebody being criminally prosecuted.

Does one criminalise the individuals who asked me to engage in that work because I was not vetted?<\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendments.

One of the issues that needed to be addressed was the unusual relationship between the three State airports since the enactment of the State Airports Act 2004.  This Act provided for the establishment of two new public limited companies - Shannon Airport Authority and Cork Airport Authority - for the purposes of owning, managing, operating and developing these two airports, but in reality these functions were never transferred from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  Both companies were established in 2004 and have their own boards, but they have very limited autonomy from the DAA, which remains responsible for all significant commercial decisions with regard to both airports.<\/p><p>The onset of the economic crisis in 2008 created severe turbulence in the aviation sector.  This is because of the close correlation between trends in the national economy and trends in the aviation sector, which means that the key indicators of both sectors mirror each other with a short time lag.<\/p> <p>As the economic situation worsened, there emerged a particular concern for the future viability of Shannon Airport given the quite dramatic fall in its passenger numbers in recent years.<\/p><p>Last week, my colleagues, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, delivered the budget for next year and announced expenditure cuts and revenue raising measures amounting to \u20ac3.5 billion designed to reduce the general Government deficit to 7.5% next year, down from a projected 8.2% in the current year.  The target is to reduce the deficit further in stages, to 2.9% in 2015.  We will continue to face up to the challenges which this involves in a sensitive and as fair a way as possible.<\/p><p>What is the relevance of this to our State airports and to Shannon Airport in particular?  While we have mapped a clear road to the recovery of our economic sovereignty and to the economic recovery of this country, the scale of our current difficulties requires that every part of the State's business, whether in the commercial sector or not, contributes to this goal.  We are, for example, undertaking the most comprehensive reform ever of the public service with the aim of reducing public expenditure and staff numbers while at the same time endeavouring to maintain key services and social supports.  This is far from easy but we have to do it and we must succeed.  We simply have no choice.<\/p><p>Our efforts cannot be confined just to the Exchequer finances, however.  The commercial State sector must also play its part to the full.  In current circumstances, this is a moral as well as an economic and financial imperative.  Our three State airports operate in the commercial sphere and can play a vital role in our economic recovery.  I say &quot;can&quot; because, unless they are actually contributing, they could instead hold back economic development and hinder recovery.<\/p><p>Shannon Airport is currently in this unenviable position.  It is loss-making and its passenger traffic has fallen dramatically since 2007.  It is being supported by the DAA and it is not delivering to its potential for the mid-west region.  Regardless of where ownership of Shannon Airport lies, this cannot continue.<\/p><p>The stark facts are that passenger traffic at Shannon more than halved from 3.6 million to 1.6 million in the period from 2007 to 2011 and is expected to fall further to fewer than 1.5 million in the current year.  It was clear to the Minister and me that these trends could not be allowed to continue without putting the very future of Shannon Airport at stake.  There was need for some intervention to put the airport on a more viable footing.  This in turn required a thorough examination of all the options.  Having discussed the matter with the three airports, the Minister commissioned Booz and Company, a leading firm of aviation consultants, to identify and analyse all likely options regarding the ownership and operation of Cork and Shannon airports and to make recommendations as to the optimal ownership and operational structures for those airports.<\/p><p>After consulting widely, Booz found Cork Airport to be performing well under DAA ownership and management and, as such, it concluded that the benefits of any fundamental change in its ownership status in terms of increased traffic and revenue for Cork would be marginal.  Accordingly, the Government decided that the existing ownership of Cork Airport by the DAA would be maintained for the present and that our energies needed to be focussed on halting and reversing the serious decline of Shannon Airport.<\/p><p>The basic conclusion of the Booz report regarding Shannon Airport was that its decline and financial situation as a loss-making entity would continue unless there was a fundamental change in strategic direction for the airport.  Having carefully considered the matter, the Government agreed in principle last May to a new strategy designed to reverse the decline in Shannon and to put the airport on a new strategic footing.  This new strategy, which takes account of the Booz recommendations, involves the separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, the merging of a restructured Shannon Development with Shannon Airport to form a new entity with a commercial mandate in public ownership and the development of a suite of aviation-related industries located in the lands contiguous to the airport.<\/p><p>The Government also decided to rationalise the tourism and enterprise support agencies in the region.  Shannon Development's tourism functions are being transferred to F\u00e1ilte Ireland and its enterprise support functions will be transferred to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  These initiatives will serve to eliminate the historical duplication of resources and to deliver a better service to the region.<\/p><p>A high level steering group was established by the Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Transport, Tourism and Sport to develop proposals for the implementation of the Government decision and to assess the feasibility of creating an international aviation services centre, IASC, of excellence centred on Shannon Airport.  The steering group was assisted by two task forces.<\/p><p>The aviation business development task force was tasked with seeking out and evaluating aviation-linked business opportunities that could be associated with the merged Shannon entity and to bring forward proposals to address issues relevant to the merger for consideration by the steering group.  The change management task force was formed to develop transitional arrangements for Shannon Airport and Shannon Development prior to the merger including matters relating to IT, HR, finance and accommodation.  The task force also considered issues around the transfer of Shannon Development functions to the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and F\u00e1ilte Ireland and the development plans of these agencies for the region.  Both task forces concluded their work last month and their reports have been published on my Department's website.  The report of the aviation business development task force strongly supports the potential for the establishment of a broadly-based aviation industry cluster in and around the airport with potential to achieve global recognition while also providing a strong employment stimulus in the Shannon region.  Aspects of the aviation sector that will be targeted for this purpose include aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul, flight crew and other aviation-related training and the development of aviation logistics and cargo facilities, among others.<\/p><p>It is a prerequisite for airport separation that the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness, including business planning, of the three State airports.  Detailed business plans for the proposed new Shannon entity, which of course includes Shannon Airport, and for the DAA, post Shannon separation, were prepared and these were subject to independent expert evaluation by KPMG on behalf of the steering group and my Department.<\/p><p>I am here today seeking the approval of the House for this motion because the Government is confident that Shannon is not only ready to stand on its own but will perform far better on its own, free of constraint and control by the DAA.<\/p><p>Of course there is a degree of risk associated with this decision but the risks for Shannon associated with retaining the status quo are, without doubt, far greater.  In this regard, I have seen mention of the passenger projections for Shannon and that these seem fanciful.  While the business plan is confidential, I can say that over the next five years the Shannon plan projects passenger numbers to grow from about 1.5 million this year to 2.3 million in 2017 and to 2.5 million in 2021.  Shannon traffic peaked at 3.6 million five years ago.  Yes, the business plan is based on that assumption.  It will be a challenge I do not deny, but it is achievable.  Moreover, the alternative is worse.  The alternative is to accept that passenger numbers at Shannon cannot be improved.  That would spell the continuation of decline at the airport and we would soon be seeking to downgrade or even wind down the structures at Shannon.  That is not the future I want to see for the Shannon area, as someone who comes from there.<\/p><p>As the Minister announced last week, the Government has now confirmed its decision on Shannon and we are now working on the implementation of that decision.  I am delighted with the news that commitments for the creation of 850 jobs have been secured by the task force from two companies as part of plans for an international aviation services centre to be located in Shannon.  The longer term potential of this centre is projected to create and maintain up to 3,500 new direct jobs within five years, not including construction jobs.<\/p><p>While on this most important subject of jobs, I understand the concern that may be felt by the staff in both Shannon Airport and Shannon Development at this time of significant change.  I acknowledge that, as with any new initiative, there are challenges ahead for the airport and for the new Shannon entity, which we will call NewCo for the time being, to be formed from the merger of the airport and the restructured Shannon Development, but I believe it also provides us with a great opportunity for Shannon and the region.<\/p><p>The terms and conditions of the DAA employees working in Shannon Airport will not be diminished in any way when they become staff of the Shannon Airport Authority.  This was agreed following intense negotiations with ICTU in 2004 when the State Airports Act was being enacted and these protections are enshrined in that legislation.  The terms of the Croke Park agreement apply to the staff in Shannon Development and, in due course, when the State owned NewCo is established, they will transfer to that company with their current terms and conditions.  The workers in both Shannon Airport and Shannon Development are vital to the success of the airport and the vision for NewCo.  Together with management, I am absolutely convinced that they can and will work together to ensure, not just the survival, but the renewed growth and success of the airport and the region.<\/p><p>I know that some in the unions are unhappy with how these policy initiatives have been progressed to date and felt excluded from that process, notwithstanding the arrangements for consultation that were in place.  However, the Minister and I have invited ICTU to nominate a representative to join a steering group of key Departments which he is re-establishing to oversee the implementation of the Government decisions in relation to NewCo.  He also wants to ensure that the workforce in the Shannon Airport Authority can have representation at board level as soon as separation is effected on 31 December and in this regard he has also invited ICTU to nominate an employee representative for appointment to the board of the SAA on a temporary basis pending agreement on arrangements for NewCo.  This Government decision represents a historic new beginning for the Shannon region, with Shannon Airport playing a central role in a drive to develop a world-class aviation industry.  In addition the decisions grant Shannon Airport the long-awaited freedom to determine its own future in the best interests of the airport itself and of the Shannon region.  The decision will give the board, management and staff of Shannon Airport, the scope to bring a fresh approach to the future development of the airport.  Its merger with a restructured Shannon Development provides the opportunity to open up access to the extensive landbank at Shannon that will facilitate the development of the international aviation centre of excellence.<\/p><p>Some in the Shannon region continue to maintain that Aer Rianta International, ARI, should be transferred to Shannon Airport from the DAA.  From the time that separation of the State airports was mooted in 2004, it has been the intention of successive Governments that while the debts associated with the business of Shannon Airport would remain with the DAA, ARI would also remain with DAA.  ARI is an integral part of the DAA group and the DAA's balance sheet, funding and credit rating are reflective of the group's business, including ARI.  Even if it was desirable to transfer ARI out of DAA, it would damage the latter's viability to do so as part of the Shannon separation process.  In short, if the DAA's financial viability was compromised as a result of separating Shannon Airport, separation could not happen.<\/p><p>Both the Minister and I are particularly struck by the degree of support for an independent Shannon airport across a wide spectrum of interested parties including business interests, chambers of commerce, and local authorities.  Airport users, service providers, and prospective new airport customers including airlines and aviation companies have expressed an overwhelming desire to deal directly with Shannon airport on an independent basis.<\/p> <p> The State Airports Act 2004 provides the legal mechanism for the separation of Shannon Airport from the DAA.  In particular, section 5(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Act provides for the making of an order to specify the Shannon appointed day, that is, the day on which the assets and business of Shannon Airport will be transferred from the DAA to the Shannon Airport Authority.  The draft order for approval by this House is a straightforward one which simply sets 31 December 2012 as the appointed day for separation of Shannon Airport from the DAA.  Once this order has been approved by each House of the Oireachtas, it provides the legal basis to progress with the plan that will secure the future of Shannon Airport.  My hope is that co-operating with all interests in the mid-west region and working together we can provide exciting and innovative opportunities that will benefit business, tourism and particularly job creation in the region.  The task now is to make these plans a reality.<\/p><p> I thank Senators for their attention and I look forward to what they have to say in reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200024#Z00700","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355320800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<ul><ul>After &#8216;&#8216;5th December, 2012&#8217;&#8217; to add the following:<br \/>&#8216;&#8216;provided that Aer Rianta International is incorporated in the new, independent Shannon Airport Authority on or before 31st December 2012&#8217;&#8217;.<\/ul><\/ul>As we all know Shannon Airport is an institution in the mid-west region.  Shannon Airport and the Shannon Foynes Port Company are the two major infrastructural hubs of the mid-west and we fully support anything the Minister of State might do to enhance and develop both facilities.  I accept a great deal of what the Minister of State has said and commend him on the basis that action of some sort needed to be taken with Shannon.  The Minister of State just read out the figures and as we clearly did not have the option of doing nothing, I support the Minister of State's initiative.<\/p><p>  We believe our amendment is valid and will underpin what the Minister of State is trying to do.  My party's bona fides on Shannon Airport is well established.  A Fianna F\u00e1il Government conceived and delivered that project back at a time when a very senior Fine Gael Member said that the rabbits would be playing around Rineanna before there would be flights landing there - how wrong he was.  Last month Fianna F\u00e1il introduced the Shannon Airport (Amendment) Bill, which provides for much of what the Minister of State proposes with the exception that we wanted a statutory link between Shannon Airport and Aer Rianta International.  By incorporating Aer Rianta International into the Shannon Airport equation, the Minister of State's forecasts, which he has said are risky, would be underpinned by the buoyant revenues being generated by Aer Rianta International, which last year returned a profit of in excess of &#8364;30 million.<\/p><p>  The Government's plan is based on the fairly risky proposition that Shannon Airport can increase traffic in the European and UK markets by winning back traffic it has lost to Kerry and Knock.  I have a problem with that hypothesis on two grounds.  First, the projected growth is very difficult to achieve.  There is some chance of achieving it with the security that incorporating Aer Rianta International would bring, particularly for investors and potential investors.  Second, much as we are in favour of Shannon Airport being developed, we are not in favour of any further downgrading of our regional airports such as Knock, Sligo and Kerry.  Robbing Peter to pay Paul never worked and will not work here either.  Representatives of the executive of Knock Airport, who appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications last week, expressed very legitimate fears.  While they were in no way jealous of the project for Shannon, they want a level playing field, of which the Minister of State will need to be cognisant if this is to be a success.<\/p><p>  We believe the timing of this proposal is all wrong.  Given the state of the economy, there could hardly be a more difficult time to embark on a project such as this.  Shannon has been hit badly lately by the reduction of the profile of Ryanair, and the downturn in traffic and consumer spending generally.  There is no secure guarantee for Shannon Airport in this motion.  The more we can protect it and ring-fence it with Aer Rianta-type support the better the chance of it being viable.<\/p><p>  We are positive about much of the proposal.  People from the mid-west region of Clare, Limerick and north Kerry, from where I come, welcome the commitment in the motion to create up to 850 jobs in the in new international aviation centres in Shannon Airport and that this may eventually grow to 3,500 jobs.  This is good news and I wish the Minister of State a fair wind - if he can achieve that, it would be a major success and we are not in any way negative about that.  However, I regret that SIPTU felt the need to issue a statement on the lack of consultation that had taken place.  The workforce there has legitimate fears and concerns.  I am somewhat mollified by the Minister of State's statement that SIPTU will have a representative on the steering group, which is good.  It is always wise to consult first especially where the good will of the unions is needed.<\/p><p>  I will finish on a local issue.  According to the Minister of State, the remit of the new company will be to work on &quot;a suite of aviation-related industries located in the lands contiguous to the airport&quot;.  What about the land assets that are not contiguous to the airport, such as a massive land bank in Ballylongford, County Kerry, next to the Shannon Estuary?  We also have other assets such as Kerry Technology Park in Tralee.  Shannon Development is now being broken up and I wish it well.  It has a specific brief to work on aviation-related industry.  Who will promote non-aviation industries such as the gas-oil refinery in Tarbert and the ongoing successful projects in Kerry Technology Park?  The focus will be shifted over which we have concerns.<\/p><p>  We will be pressing our amendment but that aside, I wish the Minister of State well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200026#BB00200","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1355320800,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.  While I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy White, I am sorry that the Minister of State who made the opening speech is no longer present.  I have major concerns about this matter.  It is not that Shannon Airport does not have strategic importance for the west of Ireland or Ireland generally - of course there is and we support giving assistance to it.  However, the Government did not follow the recommendations in the Booz and Company report.  Even though the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, said the Government had acted in line with the Booz and Company recommendations, it selectively cherry-picked some and not others.  There is no strategic aviation policy in Ireland.  The Booz and Company report recommends that before taking action in terms of separation and deciding on subsidising etc., it should define Ireland's aviation policy, which has not been done.  While I am not against Knock or the processes that have been put in place, on a personal level - as opposed to the party - I will be making a direct complaint to Commissioner Almunia in the context of state aid.<\/p><p>  Referring to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, <i>The Irish Times<\/i> on 31 March reports him as stating:<ul>If nothing was done for Shannon the airport stood in danger of being passed out by Knock airport in passenger numbers, despite a current gap of over 900,000 passengers.  I think if the trends continue as they are it will happen because Shannon&#8217;s numbers are already down 20 per cent this year and Knock is still growing.  It is only a matter of time without a change in policy.<\/ul><\/p> <p>According to <i>The Clare Champion<\/i>, the Minister also stated:<ul><br \/>Shannon has less passengers now than it had back in 1997, for example.  In that same period, Knock has increased its passenger numbers by 350%.  Even though both airports operate in the same economy in the same country, the trend in Shannon is down and the trend in Knock is up.<\/ul>In the first quote, the Minister implies clearly that we must change Government policy to facilitate Shannon at the expense of Knock.  That was not necessary.  It is for those reasons that I intend to raise with the European Commission the effective write-down of &#8364;100 million in debt and the stripping out of the assets of Shannon Development, giving the good ones to the airport with a rent-roll and giving the rest, I am reasonably reliably informed, at a cost of some &#8364;12 million, to IDA Ireland.  That &#8364;12 million goes onto the balance sheet of Shannon Airport.  Shannon not only would have &#8364;100 million written off, but &#8364;12 million in cash plus a rent-roll.  In the meantime, there is the cost to the State of 700,000 passengers a year in Knock, which is, effectively, the gateway to the entire north west region.  Sadly, this is trend in Government policy where north of that Dublin-Galway line and west of Mullingar, whether one is a farmer, a business or whatever, it does matter.  The Minister is now rigging the situation.  The Government is effectively manipulating a situation which will guarantee the demise of Knock airport and its potential to act as an economic driver for the region and contribute to national recovery, in favour of Shannon, and that is fundamentally wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200026#BB00300","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355321400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Senator MacSharry has less than a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200027#CC00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>As a former chief executive officer in the chamber of commerce movement, I met IDA Ireland on many occasions over the years.

I thank the Ministers, Deputies Varadkar, Richard Bruton and Noonan, the Ministers of State, Deputies Kelly and Jan O'Sullivan, and above all, the transition team led by Ms Rose Hynes, who has done an incredible job on the ground to bring this about.<\/p><p>It is condescending and an affront to state that this decision will be taken before the EU Commission.  The Fianna F\u00e1il members in Clare need to be made well aware of what the Oireachtas Members are doing here in Dublin.  They need to know and I will certainly inform them.  That type of carry-on is what has got this country to where it is.<\/p><p>I support this decision.  We will set about bringing Shannon back to where it was in the glory days.  It is not all about the airport.  There are 2,000 persons working in the aviation industry in Shannon as we speak, in overhaul maintenance service and aircraft leasing.  We can grow that, and we will do so with the support of the Government.  No doubt we are doing right.  On 1 January 2013, Shannon will have the dead hand of the Dublin Airport Authority taken off it.  We will survive.  We ourselves will make it grow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200027#CC00700","speaker":"1134"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.  It is appropriate that the Minister of State at the Department of Health is in attendance because this airport is in an acute condition heading towards a terminal condition, and it has engaged in serious self-harm in the recent past.<\/p><p>The reports on Shannon when it was under regulation by the Commission for Aviation Regulation showed that it had an extremely high cost per workload unit - more than double that in Cork - and extremely low levels of productivity - by far the lowest of the airports at which the commission looked.  It was moving 3,591 workload units per member employed at Shannon as against 10,500 in Cork.<\/p><p>I support every measure to break up national airport monopolies.  I note that is happening in the United Kingdom, that the last vestiges of the British Airports Authority are being broken up.  Airports should compete against each other and this is a start to what should happen here.<\/p><p>Shannon will have to get its act together.  It has a record, as the Warburg Dillon Read report states also, of wasteful investment.  That report states that, at Shannon and Cork, forecast expenditure per planned extra passenger reaches levels significantly above that spent by the group of airports with which it was compared and that this suggests poor value is being achieved, unnecessary work undertaken or a significant catch-up requirement exists.<\/p><p>Shannon must adjust to the world of low-cost airlines which charge probably approximately 20% of what airlines used charge in fares.  Such airlines have eliminated travel agents.  It did not really matter with airports when airlines did not compete because there was a large bundle of money of which the airports took a good deal.<\/p><p>The Government saw this problem happening in 2004 but the legislation has waited for eight and a half years.  Cork Airport was also given its independence.  Whose foot has been on the brake the whole time?  I recall the officers of Aer Rianta opposing the then Government with scant regard to the role of Parliament in passing legislation to create the Cork Airport Authority and the Dublin Airport Authority.  I believe Cork should also have what Senators have referred to as the &quot;dead hand of the Dublin Airport Authority&quot; removed from it.<\/p><p>We should not have removed the regulatory role.  As I stated, the regulator found important features of inefficiency in Cork in regard to the terminal built there and in Shannon in regard to both labour productivity and capital expenditure.<\/p><p>The regulator also found deficiencies in Dublin.  The passenger per gate was two thirds of the best performer.  Its passengers per square meter of terminal was one third of the best performer and the air traffic movements per runway are approximately three quarters of the best performer.  The labour productivity is approximately half of the comparator airports.<\/p><p>The Government, on 27 October 2009, bypassed the regulator.  The then Minister used his powers to ignore what the regulator said.  The Government increased airport charges.  Shannon lost 61% of its business.  A \u20ac1 charge became \u20ac7.50 and the Government then imposed a \u20ac10 passenger tax.  No wonder this airport is in trouble.<\/p><p>The solution is to also separate Cork Airport, to restore the prospect of competing terminals at Dublin and to restore the regulator's powers because this high-cost airport sector - all three of them - is imposing serious costs on Irish tourism and transport.<\/p> <p>There has been too much low labour productivity, wasteful capital expenditure and going to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to emasculate the regulator for the sector by having the Minister issue orders which appear afterwards on the commission's site.  The then Minister did not issue a press release on 27 October 2009 when he ordered the regulator, against advice and his better judgment, to increase the charges.<\/p><p>This is an outer offshore island and we need an efficient airport sector, which we do not have at present.  We will hold the Presidency of the EU on 1 January.  Other countries for whom aviation is less important, and I include the United Kingdom, impose substantial air passenger charges on travel which really affect island countries.  We should call for taxes based as a percentage of the fare or general sales taxes because a high per head tax on some of the lowest air fares one will find anywhere is a serious barrier to people accessing this country and undermines events such as The Gathering.<\/p><p>This should be the first day on which we discuss this issue.  We must examine excess costs in Cork Airport as well as in Shannon Airport, although Shannon Airport has the most serious problem.  We should also examine those in Dublin Airport.  There has been too much complacency in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport over the years and too much interfering with the referee when he tried to regulate the charges.  This is why Aer Lingus and Ryanair are taking business out of the country.  It is too expensive to land in Irish airports.  The Government has a major problem on its plate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200027#CC00800","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355322000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I commend Senator Mulcahy for his contribution, and he knows more about Shannon Airport than anybody else in either House.  He outlined exactly what is needed for Shannon Airport, those who work there and those who are affected by it.  The Minister correctly stated in his speech that the number of passengers using Shannon Airport declined from 3.6 million to 1.6 million in a four to five-year period.  The Government has decided to arrest this situation.  It established a strategy to separate Shannon and Dublin airports and proceeded to eradicate duplication.  Responsibility for tourism will be transferred to F\u00e1ilte Ireland and the business interest surrounding the airport will be transferred to Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  It has established a change management task force to develop the aviation industry to its full potential including aircraft maintenance and repair, aviation training and overhaul.  Most importantly, the Government recognises that no business will survive without the workforce being brought along with the process.  The Government has now provided permanent and temporary positions for staff representatives to be included in the full process.  As an active trade unionist I know the importance of this.  I worked in Eircom for many years.  It was one of the first companies in the country to establish a partnership process.  It works extremely well because it gives responsibility and accountability to staff for their own job survival.  This is exactly what Shannon Airport will do.<\/p><p>Of course this opportunity carries risk, and I acknowledge what Senator O'Sullivan said, but I ask him to show me a business plan anywhere in the world which does not have a risk attached and I will buy him a pint because every business has a risk attached.  This process has been examined by experts who have taken time, used best practice and gone through all of the processes required to ensure the best business plan is put together.  The Government will proceed to put in place this new system on 31 December.<\/p><p>This action by the Government is supported by the local authorities in the region.  When I speak about local authorities, as Senator O'Sullivan well knows, I mean elected members because to me that is what local authorities are.  They are the people who feel the pulse on the ground as to whether this is the right or wrong decision.  If those elected by the communities throughout the mid-west support it, then quite frankly it is good enough for me.  It is also supported by the chambers of commerce and business interests in the Shannon and mid-west regions.  Most importantly, it is supported by airport users.<\/p><p>The amendment tabled by Fianna F\u00e1il seeks to halt the process.  It has been halted for long enough and it is now time to press the go button and move on and ensure Shannon Airport has a future.  I fully support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200028#DD00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1355322000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Sinn F\u00e9in will support the amendment to the motion.  We believe it is very positive that Shannon Airport will be given more independence as it was never likely to be given the appropriate priority under the DAA.  I understand this has also been welcomed by the local community, as has been outlined.  However, while it is clear Shannon Airport needs more independence it also needs a secure revenue stream to put its new model into practice and make a real drive for achieving a more sustainable set-up.  We are not convinced this will be the case, and the Minister needs to outline how Shannon Airport can be supported in increasing passenger numbers, making more routes available and promoting itself, in particular with regard to its key catchment area in the mid-west and south.<\/p><p>I was in Kilrush last night where the issue was raised.  We are pleased, as I believe the local community is, that the airport remains in public hands.  I hope this remains the case.  I commend all those involved in planning for Shannon Airport's future.  We believe the plan, while it is laudably ambitious, is not realisable in current circumstances.  In particular I am of the view it is being hampered by the stripping of Aer Rianta International from the airport.  Aer Rianta International, which has a long history in Shannon Airport, makes a profit in excess of \u20ac30 million per year.  It is an essential part of what can make Shannon Airport sustainable and turn the tide back in its favour.  To remove it is short-sighted and endangers the ability of the airport to live up to its plans.  Pointing to removing Aer Rianta with regard to the cancellation of debt is not credible.  Those debts could never have been paid and in doing this the Minister is threatening its long-term sustainability.  I fear the effect of stripping it of its only means of making a profit and leaving it in the wilderness with a view to it being privatised in the future.<\/p><p>The plan is also flawed as it pertains to Ireland West Airport Knock, County Mayo, and Kerry Airport, as other Senators have alluded to.  Much of what the plan involves is dragging business away from Knock and Kerry airports to Shannon Airport.  Knock airport is lean and well-run, which is all the more pleasing given that it is community-run.  It has 28 scheduled international destinations throughout Ireland, the UK and Europe and more than 65 weekly flights with passenger numbers for 2012 set to reach almost 700,000.  It has a much lower operational subvention per passenger than the State airports.  It has a turnover of \u20ac12.5 million and a net loss of only \u20ac390,000.  It directly employs 101 people in the local economy and supports an additional 900 jobs.  We should not seek to undermine the good work in Knock by setting up Shannon Airport in competition with it.  We should seek to strike a balance whereby the airports can complement each other, and the west of Ireland can support two significant airports.  Taking the approach proposed will only lead to a situation where we will be examining Knock Airport in a few years time wondering what went wrong.<\/p><p>It would be remiss of me during a debate on Shannon Airport not to make reference to the illegal use of it for military and rendition flights.  A total of 1,382 permits were issued, largely to US military flights, by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to carry munitions or dangerous goods on civilian aircraft through Ireland or Irish airspace.  According to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, fewer than 250,000 US troops transited through Shannon Airport last year.  It is difficult to see how this fits with our view of Ireland as a neutral entity, and successive Governments have relinquished all interest in maintaining an independent Irish foreign policy.  It is certainly an issue which must be addressed and I hope we will have further debate on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200028#DD00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355322000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House again.  Senator Mulcahy eloquently dealt with this poorly thought out motion which, were it to come to fruition, would be very dangerous because of the consequences to which it could lead.  I will not go over them but I will state the notion of history and history making is a cliche used far too often.  However, in this particular instance it is highly appropriate given the fact Shannon Airport has had such a phenomenal history as a driver of economic development throughout the west of Ireland from Donegal to Cork.<\/p> <p>People have come from all over to work at Shannon.  Some of the best industries this country has seen have been incubated and developed in Shannon, thus creating thousands of jobs there.  Shannon is recognised internationally as having a human resources facility for aviation that is second to none.  Shannon also has a phenomenal reputation in aviation finance and engineering.  Effectively, the Government has finally taken the bull by the horns to recalibrate Shannon and allow it the flexibility and space to develop.  Aer Rianta International will go to the Dublin Airport Authority, but Shannon will have a rental income of between \u20ac13 million and \u20ac14 million from the industrial estate alone, despite these economically challenging times.  I have no doubt this rental income will increase substantially because the Government has effectively ring-fenced aviation related industries to the new company.<\/p><p>It is appropriate that tourism-related businesses should go to F\u00e1ilte Ireland and that foreign direct investment should be in the IDA.  We are a small island and need to bank our resources properly.  Shannon will win because thousands of new aviation jobs will be created there.  I have spoken to people in the aviation industry who are excited about what is happening.  There is absolutely no reason Shannon cannot be a European centre of aviation excellence.

I would like to be in that position still but because I was re-elected to this House, I had to relinquish the chairmanship of that organisation.  One of the key elements of the development plan by F\u00e1ilte Ireland in the north west, in consultation with other tourism organisations in the west, was to improve access into the island of Ireland.  That was the main focus.  We dealt with Donegal airport and with our counterparts in Northern Ireland concerning Derry and Belfast.  That necklace of airports included Donegal, Knock and Shannon.  There was always a danger that it could develop into a war between Knock and Shannon airports, but they were seen to be complementary to each other.  Shannon had a deserved history of developing transatlantic flights, as well as a fledgling aerospace industry which developed, and the industrial zone, all of which was absent in Knock.<\/p><p>Last week, Mr. Liam Scollan of Knock airport attended the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, of which I am a member.  He has voiced serious concerns on behalf of the airport's management about the business plan that has been put forward for decoupling Shannon.  It is on that business plan that my colleagues, including Senator O'Sullivan and others, have been focusing.  There is a genuine belief that, as it stands, this plan is risky.  As Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh has said, one of the elements of that business plan, in terms of improving traffic numbers through Shannon, is to take back passengers that have been gained by Kerry and Knock airports.<\/p><p>The figure for passengers that Knock has put forward is in excess of 700,000, which it wants to grow to 1.5 million.  The airport management believes it can realistically grow to at least 1 million over the next couple of years.  The Shannon business plan is seeking to double passenger numbers as well.  No more than with the property tax, is this the right time?  It is not that Fianna F\u00e1il is against the notion of decoupling, in principle.  After all, it was the late and much lamented Seamus Brennan who introduced the primary legislation for decoupling Cork and Shannon from Dublin.  I was in this House when he did it.<\/p><p>Two basic points need to be made.  First, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, should attend this House to explain exactly what the aviation policy is within his Department into which Knock airport fits.  Knock airport's management have said that in their discussions with the Department of Transport, the officials do not see it as a strategic airport.  I do not understand that.  Second, there are serous question marks about the future of the Dublin Airport Authority which are also inhibiting the orderly and successful development of an aviation policy in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200029#EE00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1355322600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.

When Monsignor Horan started it, people said it would be very risky and would not succeed, but it succeeded because local people were behind it.  The same thing can happen in Shannon, but only if the people get behind it.  I was stunned and shaken by the figures provided by Senator Barrett, including the high costs of trying to run that airport.

I am glad there has been so much interest in the debate as the airport is vital for the mid-west.  As someone who comes from that region, I know that only too well.  Even though I am a Tipperary man, I live quite close to the airport on the Clare border near Killaloe.  I am therefore very passionate about the airport and have many friends who work there, as well as in Shannon Development and other related companies.<\/p><p>The days of political ambivalence towards the airport had to end.  It had been left in that situation since 2004 and it needed to be addressed.  The stranglehold over the airport by the DAA needed to end as well because it has to compete.  One must remember that this airport is the lifeblood of a whole region.  It has major assets which we need to leverage.  This plan is about leveraging those collective assets into the future. <\/p><p>I wish to deal briefly with some of the comments Senators have made.  A number of Senators referred to the issue of Aer Rianta International, but it was always the intention for ARI to stay with the DAA, even back in 2004 when the Act was passed under an Administration led by Senator O'Sullivan's party.  The spokesperson here at the time, who is now Deputy Dooley, voted for it.  It was always intended, therefore, that ARI would stay with the DAA.  In short, the DAA's financial viability would be compromised if it did not.  One must remember that \u20ac100 million is being written off Shannon Airport's debt.  It is integral for balance sheet purposes that it stays there.  I appreciate as much as any Member of the Oireachtas what ARI has achieved and the fantastic innovative thinking behind it.<\/p><p>Senators also referred to Knock airport, which should not be an either-or situation.  It is about growing the total number of passengers collectively across the west and, dare I say, the mid-west.  I think they should grow together.  The airport has received substantial funding of up to \u20ac40 million in State aid, but that is sometimes forgotten by those who think this is an issue of competing to the detriment of Knock.  Knock can do very well and I admire many of its achievements.  By the way, there is no issue with State aid whatsoever regarding this move.<\/p><p>I know many of the workers in Shannon.  In a previous life I used to work for F\u00e1ilte Ireland so I got to know many people both in Shannon Development and the airport.  There are 254 workers in the airport and 109 in Shannon Development.  It is guaranteed that they will transfer under the same terms and conditions.  It was protected for the airport workers under the 2004 Act.  It is important to ensure the ICTU has representation on the steering group and also on the board, which will be announced in due course.<\/p><p>The transfer of functions to F\u00e1ilte Ireland and Enterprise Ireland is a very positive step, which gets rid of many layers of bureaucracy.  I am sure Senators would agree with me on that.<\/p><p>Passenger numbers have halved in the airport but we have ambitious targets - 1.5 million this year, 2.3 million in 2017 and 2.5 million in 2021.<\/p>                   Mulcahy, Tony.","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200029#EE00600","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Credit Union Bill 2012: Report and Final Stages","time":1355323200,"counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200030#GG00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1355323200,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Before we commence I remind Senators that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.

To follow on from what Senator Reilly said, perhaps the Minister of State could clarify that the Bill precludes someone who previously worked in a credit union from serving in another one.  Today, I received a specific example of that.  One of the directors of a credit union who was unemployed managed to secure a position with another credit union.  He had been a credit union director for a number of years.  The effect of not allowing the amendment to section 15(10)(a) would prevent him from continuing as a director of the credit union unless he leaves his employment.  Had he secured employment outside of a credit union he would not be prevented from continuing as a director of the credit union.  The board in that instance believes that as the person has not changed, why should his employment prevent him from continuing as a director or working in another credit union.  The board also believes that the director, who has been a volunteer and a voluntary director with the credit union for a number of years, is being unfairly treated by the introduction of this restriction and by not passing the amendment tabled by Senator Reilly.

I also welcome the representatives of the many wonderful youth work organisations and the National Youth Council of Ireland to the Visitors Gallery.  Before I begin, it would be remiss of me were I not to congratulate the Minister wholeheartedly on the recent passing of the children's rights referendum.  Other issues are ongoing, but they should not take from that success.  Many promised; the Minister delivered.  I thank her very much.<\/p><p>  I have a long list of issues that I would like to be able to discuss with the Minister, but I will limit myself to the value of youth work.  I speak as someone who has benefited from experience as a young person in a youth organisation.  I was lucky to have some truly inspirational youth leaders.  Indeed, I wonder whether I would have the confidence to stand before the Minister today had I not become involved in the girl guides.  I can trace many of my skills to my experience in youth work.<\/p><p>  I also had the honour of being president of the National Youth Council of Ireland several years ago.  Through that experience, I learned the value of providing young people with a choice of youth activities.  Just like us adults, one size does not fit all.<\/p><p>  I tabled this motion a number of weeks ago in the hope we could have a debate prior to the budget.  As such, I thank my colleagues in the Independent Group for allowing me to use our precious time to have this debate now.  We know that youth work makes a real difference in the lives of young people and the communities in which they live.  The Indecon report, produced on behalf of the National Youth Council of Ireland, regarding the assessment of the economic value of youth work provides hard evidence to the effect that youth work is value for money and makes economic sense.<\/p><p>  Like me, the Minister is undoubtedly alarmed by the fact that, in the EU, Ireland has the fourth highest number of young people who are not in education, employment or training, NEETs, at 18.4%.  The EU average is 12.9%.  In terms of marginalisation, 29% of people under 25 years of age are unemployed and one third of men between the ages of 20 years and 24 years are unemployed.  The youth population is growing, with 18.4% of our population aged between ten and 24 years.  Alongside this growth, youth work organisations have reported an increased demand for their services.  Perhaps this is due to the recession, in that people are searching for value for money activities.  It is in light of the increased demand that my Independent colleagues and I have tabled this motion.  I also thank the other Senators who added their signatures to the motion.<\/p><p>  The report outlines the evidence, but going through it would use up all of my time.  I can provide hard economic evidence as well as many case studies.  In one example, young teenagers regularly drank in the fields behind the school where a youth work organisation met.  Over a period of two years, they were gradually encouraged to get involved in the organisation's activities.  Through gentle encouragement, they realised the harmful effects of alcohol and ceased hanging out in the fields because they had found a worthwhile activity.<\/p><p>  In another example, an eight year old used to turn up to her youth work meeting half an hour early every week just to chat.  It transpired that this young person had no active engagement with an adult from one end of the week to the other except for the youth worker.  Her parents instructed her in what to do, but no one simply chatted with her.<\/p><p>  Another young person had autism and found any group activity painful and frightening.  After two years of coming along to meetings with her sister, she started to smile and progressively became more involved.  According to her mother, the social skills that the young person developed were remarkable and directly attributable to her youth work experience.<\/p><p>  While on a weekend away with a youth group, a teenager began hitting the other participants and using very sexualised language.  After careful handling by the youth worker who talked with the girl and her parents, it transpired that she was being abused by someone known to the family.  The abuse needed to be reported to the authorities.<\/p><p>  I could continue with my list.  I have not taken these examples from a report or research.  They are my personal experiences as a youth work leader with the Irish Girl Guides.  I have no doubt that any youth worker or, indeed, anyone present in the Gallery could share with the Minister a long list of examples where youth work had made a difference.  The economic report also shows that.  I call them magic moments.  Sometimes, one goes to a meeting and does not have a great night, but situations arise that prove that youth work makes a difference.<\/p><p>  When I tabled the motion, I tried to put down an evidence-based, factual account.  I was tempted to add lines to the effect that, for example, funding should not be cut, but I decided on a wording that was non-confrontational.  When I saw the Government's amendment, it struck me as an attempt to gild the lily.  In recent years, most youth work organisations have seen funding cuts amounting to a cumulative 30%.  Some, particularly small specialist organisations, will no longer be viable, thereby reducing the selection of organisations that young people can join.  Demands on youth work organisations are also increasing because young people do not have resources within their families, which places even greater pressure on local youth work clubs' resources.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to divide the House.  To be constructive and as a first step, I will ask a number of questions.  Perhaps the Minister might help by answering.  I will add some of my own commentary so that the record of this debate can stand.<\/p><p>  The first point I wish to raise is that of front-line youth work services.  There are 382,615 young people participating in and benefiting from youth work, 1,400 full-time employees and more than 40,000 volunteers.  My background is in guiding and scouting.  For me, when we refer to front-line youth work services, we mean volunteers working on the front line who are being provided with resources and supports by staff.  A small group of staff are based in a national office, and they provide and help with programme materials.  They do not design those materials.  Rather, that is done by the volunteers.  Indeed, everything is done by the volunteers, but they need backup.  When I hear &quot;front-line youth work services&quot;, I wonder whether the true voluntary nature is understood.<\/p><p>  In the Minister's discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the lead-up to the budget, did she discuss the Indecon report on the assessment of youth work and the benefits that it clearly demonstrated?  The documents published by the Department of Public Expenditure and reform on budget 2013 showed that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is proposing a further cut of &#8364;3 million in 2014.  These cuts are unsustainable.  Youth work funding is 14% of the latter Department's overall budget, yet is being allocated 30% of the overall cut to that budget.<\/p> <p>This case, about which I received details today, relates to a person in Kilsallaghan in north County Dublin, which is a fine place.  Senator Reilly's amendment, if accepted, would address the issue.  How does the Minister of State propose to address it?  I refer him to section 15(10)(<i>a<\/i>) and ask him to clarify the position in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200032#LL00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355324400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>To respond to amendments Nos. 5 and 6 in the name of Senator Reilly, one of the core purposes of the Bill, as expressed in its Long Title, is to &quot;change the governance requirements for credit unions by removing certain management functions from boards of directors of credit unions and providing for a separate management structure and to improve the oversight and general policy functions of such boards of directors&quot;.  The core change at the centre of the governance provision in the Bill is to separate the role of the board in overseeing the credit unions' operations from day-to-day operations.  These exclusions are designed to ensure people are not overseeing their own work and are not answerable to themselves.  For this reason and given the core function of the board in overseeing the work of voluntary assistants, volunteers of credit unions cannot also be a director.  However, there is no difficulty with volunteers becoming members of boards provided they do not remain in their role as a voluntary assistant at the same time.  The Government has brought forward amendments to allow a volunteer from another credit union or family member of a volunteer to sit on the board.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 6 seeks to delete the second two lines of subsection (10)(<i>a<\/i>) to provide that the employee of one credit union may be on the board of another credit union.  The Minister addressed this suggestion on Committee Stage in the D\u00e1il.  The Government has already shown considerable flexibility in accepting amendments on board membership where to do so would not compromise the principles of the Bill.<\/p><p>  In respect of employees of other credit unions, credit union members must have confidence that board members are free not only from conflicts of duty but also conflicts of loyalty.  A director who is making decisions about business strategy or a possible amalgamation may find it difficult to maintain sufficient objectivity where the decision may also affect the neighbouring credit union at which he or she also works.<\/p><p>  To address Senator Darragh O'Brien's point, the recommendations the Government is following are those made in the report of the Commission on Credit Unions and we are being honest to the recommendations.  A potential conflict arises where a person is employed and serving on another board.  The Senator asked about a person who had previously worked in this area.  This scenario does not present a difficulty because the provision would not apply to such a person on the basis that he or she is not in his or her current employment.  As such, the issue the Senator raises does not create a difficulty because the person is not currently employed in the relevant area.<\/p><p>  As far as the Government is concerned, we are being loyal to and consistent with the recommendations of the commission's report, while showing a degree of flexibility towards the amendments Senators tabled yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200032#HH00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"vote","time":1355324400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the words proposed to be deleted stand.\"<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 30; N\u00edl, 10.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Kathryn Reilly and Diarmuid Wilson.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200032#HH00300","aye":["1148","1121","1138","1150","1114","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1160","1117","1144","1172","1131","1152","1173","1135","1161","1162","1167","1132","1174","1134","1118","1153","1129","1145","1163","1176"],"nay":["1116","1133","1140","1128","1122","1115","1139","1142","1155","1164"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355324400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355325000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 6 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355325000,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<ul><br \/>In page 21, line 6, after &quot;union.&quot; to insert the following:<br \/>&quot;The requirement of this section may be waived by the Bank in exceptional circumstances upon application by the credit union.&quot;.<\/ul>I have a few questions for the Minister of State in respect of the exclusions or exceptional circumstances.

The purpose of that amendment is to allow the Central Bank to appoint a director under section 95A even where that person may have exceeded the term limit.

I also welcome the representatives of the many wonderful youth work organisations and the National Youth Council of Ireland to the Visitors Gallery.  Before I begin, it would be remiss of me were I not to congratulate the Minister wholeheartedly on the recent passing of the children's rights referendum.  Other issues are ongoing, but they should not take from that success.  Many promised; the Minister delivered.  I thank her very much.<\/p><p>  I have a long list of issues that I would like to be able to discuss with the Minister, but I will limit myself to the value of youth work.  I speak as someone who has benefited from experience as a young person in a youth organisation.  I was lucky to have some truly inspirational youth leaders.  Indeed, I wonder whether I would have the confidence to stand before the Minister today had I not become involved in the girl guides.  I can trace many of my skills to my experience in youth work.<\/p><p>  I also had the honour of being president of the National Youth Council of Ireland several years ago.  Through that experience, I learned the value of providing young people with a choice of youth activities.  Just like us adults, one size does not fit all.<\/p><p>  I tabled this motion a number of weeks ago in the hope we could have a debate prior to the budget.  As such, I thank my colleagues in the Independent Group for allowing me to use our precious time to have this debate now.  We know that youth work makes a real difference in the lives of young people and the communities in which they live.  The Indecon report, produced on behalf of the National Youth Council of Ireland, regarding the assessment of the economic value of youth work provides hard evidence to the effect that youth work is value for money and makes economic sense.<\/p><p>  Like me, the Minister is undoubtedly alarmed by the fact that, in the EU, Ireland has the fourth highest number of young people who are not in education, employment or training, NEETs, at 18.4%.  The EU average is 12.9%.  In terms of marginalisation, 29% of people under 25 years of age are unemployed and one third of men between the ages of 20 years and 24 years are unemployed.  The youth population is growing, with 18.4% of our population aged between ten and 24 years.  Alongside this growth, youth work organisations have reported an increased demand for their services.  Perhaps this is due to the recession, in that people are searching for value for money activities.  It is in light of the increased demand that my Independent colleagues and I have tabled this motion.  I also thank the other Senators who added their signatures to the motion.<\/p><p>  The report outlines the evidence, but going through it would use up all of my time.  I can provide hard economic evidence as well as many case studies.  In one example, young teenagers regularly drank in the fields behind the school where a youth work organisation met.  Over a period of two years, they were gradually encouraged to get involved in the organisation's activities.  Through gentle encouragement, they realised the harmful effects of alcohol and ceased hanging out in the fields because they had found a worthwhile activity.<\/p><p>  In another example, an eight year old used to turn up to her youth work meeting half an hour early every week just to chat.  It transpired that this young person had no active engagement with an adult from one end of the week to the other except for the youth worker.  Her parents instructed her in what to do, but no one simply chatted with her.<\/p><p>  Another young person had autism and found any group activity painful and frightening.  After two years of coming along to meetings with her sister, she started to smile and progressively became more involved.  According to her mother, the social skills that the young person developed were remarkable and directly attributable to her youth work experience.<\/p><p>  While on a weekend away with a youth group, a teenager began hitting the other participants and using very sexualised language.  After careful handling by the youth worker who talked with the girl and her parents, it transpired that she was being abused by someone known to the family.  The abuse needed to be reported to the authorities.<\/p><p>  I could continue with my list.  I have not taken these examples from a report or research.  They are my personal experiences as a youth work leader with the Irish Girl Guides.  I have no doubt that any youth worker or, indeed, anyone present in the Gallery could share with the Minister a long list of examples where youth work had made a difference.  The economic report also shows that.  I call them magic moments.  Sometimes, one goes to a meeting and does not have a great night, but situations arise that prove that youth work makes a difference.<\/p><p>  When I tabled the motion, I tried to put down an evidence-based, factual account.  I was tempted to add lines to the effect that, for example, funding should not be cut, but I decided on a wording that was non-confrontational.  When I saw the Government's amendment, it struck me as an attempt to gild the lily.  In recent years, most youth work organisations have seen funding cuts amounting to a cumulative 30%.  Some, particularly small specialist organisations, will no longer be viable, thereby reducing the selection of organisations that young people can join.  Demands on youth work organisations are also increasing because young people do not have resources within their families, which places even greater pressure on local youth work clubs' resources.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to divide the House.  To be constructive and as a first step, I will ask a number of questions.  Perhaps the Minister might help by answering.  I will add some of my own commentary so that the record of this debate can stand.<\/p><p>  The first point I wish to raise is that of front-line youth work services.  There are 382,615 young people participating in and benefiting from youth work, 1,400 full-time employees and more than 40,000 volunteers.  My background is in guiding and scouting.  For me, when we refer to front-line youth work services, we mean volunteers working on the front line who are being provided with resources and supports by staff.  A small group of staff are based in a national office, and they provide and help with programme materials.  They do not design those materials.  Rather, that is done by the volunteers.  Indeed, everything is done by the volunteers, but they need backup.  When I hear &quot;front-line youth work services&quot;, I wonder whether the true voluntary nature is understood.<\/p><p>  In the Minister's discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the lead-up to the budget, did she discuss the Indecon report on the assessment of youth work and the benefits that it clearly demonstrated?  The documents published by the Department of Public Expenditure and reform on budget 2013 showed that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is proposing a further cut of &#8364;3 million in 2014.  These cuts are unsustainable.  Youth work funding is 14% of the latter Department's overall budget, yet is being allocated 30% of the overall cut to that budget.<\/p> <p>There is talk about cutting 30% of funding, which is disproportionate and should be questioned.<\/p><p>The Government amendment to the motion mentions the provision of significant capital funding for the development of youth facilities, which is welcome.  Will the Minister clarify the exact funding?  In November last year there was an announcement of capital funding of \u20ac1.5 million for 2012 and in November 2012 there was announcement of \u20ac500,000 funding for 2012 and \u20ac1.5 million in capital funding for 2013.  Is the total capital funding for 2012 and 2013, \u20ac3.5 million or \u20ac2 million?  Has the Department carried out an assessment to ensure the sustainability of these services?  If a facility can be only opened for a few hours per week I would question the expenditure.  There is a great disparity in services being provided.<\/p><p>The third point of the Government amendment mentions, &quot;Prioritising the protection of funding for front-line volunteer-led provision&quot;.  I have already mentioned what I believe is front-line provision but will the Minister clarify if this refers to the \u20ac1.035 million funding for local services out of a total youth work funding budget of \u20ac56.8 million?  When I read the amendment at first I was excited but I must make progress.<\/p><p>Who is being consulted on the national youth work advisory committee?  I saw a reply to a parliamentary question put down by Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in but what are the terms of reference?  The amendment mentions &quot;reforming and rationalising&quot; and I know the Minister is talking about doing a review.  Is that the same review promised in the 2011 comprehensive review of expenditure and when can it be expected?  What will be the terms of reference?  School facilities are a bugbear of mine.  The Government has told youth organisations to rationalise but when will schools be opened in the evenings for utilisation by youth work organisations?  Too many schools are locked up, with youth organisations being charged for other facilities in the community.<\/p><p>We have had debates in this House on mental health, youth suicide, social inclusion, youth unemployment, bullying and alcohol-related harm.  Central to all of these debates was the valuable role played by youth work organisations, which is why I passionately believe we must support these organisations rather than decimating them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200035#LL00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355326500,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Both the Minister and I have said before that we are constantly trying to \"adultify\" young people through television, radio, video, music, comedy, language and other elements of the entertainment world.  We rush them into glories of adulthood, with the idea that all things adult mean all things great.  We are like fools rushing into adulthood because we consider it a good thing or progress.  We forget that people are young and live in a different world, expecting different outcomes.  They have different dreams, desires, beliefs, needs, aspirations and worries.  They speak, converse and feel in a different and youthful way.<\/p><p>The adult world is not safe and adults are supposed to cope with, know and control that.  The world created by youth work is safe, which is one of the sector's greatest and most positive powers.  For whatever reason, families across a spectrum of society are not necessarily good places in which to grow up.  The street or the corner is not the best place either, so there must always be other roles and models outside the family.  We need those now more than ever because the &quot;greats&quot; have let us down, although the Minister has not done so.  She has made a distinctive contribution to our society, both politically as a Minister and as a director in the field of children's rights.<\/p><p>The world of youth workers can be the greatest place to look when seeking leaders, guides and routes for hope.  In it one can find the answers when we call in education for possibilities, especially where none exist or where young people have nowhere to go, or where there are possibilities but youths have no place to explore them.  The world of youth working gives youths attention, activities, language, arts, communication, dialogue and empathy outside what we call mainstream schooling, which provides youths with a new possibility to breathe and become who they really are.  The world of youth workers is always the world of possibilities.<\/p><p>Youth work, whether voluntary or paid, is about putting young people where they should be located, in their own world and time with their own language.  More importantly, it is with their own peers.  The process is not an addendum to a very false rip-off entertainment world or the world of politics, where we believe we should tell people how to think and feel.<\/p><p>I was in Dublin City University for 25 years and loved it.  When I arrived, it was deserted, dull, dreary, grey and abandoned.  There was a change in the living conditions in Ballymun brought about by a Fine Gael Government and youth workers, with projects, schemes and pilots in all areas of literacy, numeracy, drama, dance and music that came alive.  On the university campus, societies had more to say to students, more gifts and education than academic lecturing, although mine was the exception.  It was only within the youth world and its workers that real change was seen on the ground.  The youth workers of that area became the greatest teachers for the university; they were the route planners in how the university could make a contribution to the world in which it was in the north city.  They have become significant partners, as can be seen from the growth of the community and the university, which have done each other proud.<\/p><p>The best youth workers are those who had an opportunity to use the services themselves.  There are hundreds of these people around the country and these people should be facilitated and celebrated.  We are all clued in, informed and technically adept or plugged in.  It is a veneer of communication, which is a false assurance that we have the right kind of language and argument and it will bring about the right result.  If somebody tells me something has no economic value, I immediately know it has great human value.  The value of youth work is unknown and beyond measurement because it is a silent and managed success, a saviour of the State.  When involved in a youth project, whether voluntary or involuntary, that is what makes it great.  People give, get and turn up, with unparalleled value.  The opportunities can be unmatched.<\/p><p>The report is qualitative.  It was produced by an Irish research and consultancy company, Indecon, which does not receive State grants.  The report is independent in form, function and judgment.  The study is comprehensive.  My colleague has stated that 250,000 young people benefit from the youth work area, with 1,400 staff and 40,000 people working in a voluntary capacity.  That is real politics at work, and the Government can learn from that and realise that without the world of youth and youth work, it would face costs that could be measured in a very negative and - I am sorry to say - destructive way.  I congratulate every youth worker in the country for being political in the best sense of the word and work.  I second the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200036#MM00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1355326500,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<ul><br \/>To delete all words after &#8216;&#8216;That&#8217;&#8217;

It is a timely debate on the value of youth work and the future of youth work funding.  It is interesting to hear Senators' stories about involvement in youth work and the value coming from it.  I endorse the comments about the potential of youth work and what it means to individuals around the country.<\/p> <p> I welcome the recent publication of the economic assessment of the value of youth work carried out by Indecon on behalf of the National Youth Council of Ireland.  I take this opportunity to welcome those in the Visitors Gallery who work in this area and care about the future of youth work in Ireland.  The report, from which I quoted recently when we were discussing the Estimates in committee, is very valuable.  I made the point that we have had a good deal of research in regard to the early years and we are beginning to see more research now about the value of intervention by youth work.  It is very helpful to have a report such as this and I commend the board and its chair, James O'Leary, and the staff led by the director, Mary Cunningham, on their initiative in commissioning this research.  This kind of research is important and it is the way of the future in regard to youth work.<\/p><p> The report illustrates the breadth, depth and value of the youth work sector in Ireland and provides an assessment of the value and contribution of youth work to the economy, to young people themselves and to the entire social fabric of our society.  It contains many interesting findings which I have brought to the attention of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p> As referenced in the motion, I would like to acknowledge the benefits of youth work.  For young people, there is no doubt that engagement in quality youth work can equip them with applicable and transferable skills and competences.  Many of these skills are core and transferable to life and work and include cognitive and non-cognitive skills, critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, effective communication, motivation, persistence, creativity, innovation, etc.  There is no doubt that young people can gain all of those skills through their involvement in youth work, but it is also about improving outcomes from enhancing social inclusion and civic engagement to maximising resilience and minimising risks, including risks of marginalisation, and improving employability.<\/p><p> It is important to be clear about the kind of skills people can gain from youth work and the way they are applicable in the world today.  One consequence of the economic situation facing young people is that they are experiencing what are called elongated transitions between dependence and independence and, unfortunately, they are facing less certain trajectories in terms of occupational engagement and progression.  That presents key challenges which are being recognised nationally and at European level but it also presents challenges for youth work itself in terms of where it is going, the way it relates to young people in this new environment, and its focus.  It is also challenging for a Department like mine in terms of youth policy and future directions of youth policy.  There are particular challenges we must examine.  I say that with particular relevance to those young people mentioned by Senator van Turnhout, about whom we have not spoken hugely in Ireland.  Other countries have had sharper debates about the needs of young people not in employment, education or training, but we are beginning to do that, despite our very high rate of such young people.  This is a group that is coming to the fore in terms of policy discourse and focus.<\/p><p> Senator van Turnhout also referred to the youth sector being significant in terms of scale and reach, with 382,000 young people involved in youth work in Ireland.  There are probably 1,400 full-time equivalent workers and more than 40,000 volunteers.  I have been struck by the numbers of volunteers we have when travelling around the country, which the Senator acknowledges.<\/p><p> There should be no doubt that the sector is both valued and very valuable.  A rich tapestry of people are involved in the voluntary sector, community-based organisations, and services which provide so much to our young people.  the sector has great strength and depth, a great deal of organisational diversity, which is welcome, reach and impact.<\/p><p> I have visited many youth services and I am very impressed by the range and quality of the opportunities being given to young people.  I have seen services, small and large, doing a variety of programmes and it is very encouraging to see the commitment of the staff, the engagement by the young people and the range of services, work and community involvement by the young people involved in youth work.  We have youth caf\u00e9s which provide very positive, healthy environments where young people can meet.  I have seen youth projects working with young offenders and early school leavers, and youth clubs working in various ways to support young people's development as active citizens.<\/p><p> Understandably, one of the focuses in the discussion on youth work is funding.  To recap briefly, the current position is that in 2012, the Department funded youth work to the tune of &#8364;56 million, and the youth sector also benefited from funding from the Irish Youth Justice Service, which is now co-located in my Department.  That was &#8364;7.8 million in funding for the running of the very effective Garda diversion projects within the youth sector.  The citizen participation unit of my Department has also been provided with funding in the region of &#8364;300,000 in 2012 to youth organisations with respect to consultation initiatives with children and young people.  That is an important focus.  We saw in the recent referendum the discussion about hearing the views of young people.  It is important that we do not have that just at constitutional level but that we see it in practice, and this is a way of ensuring that.  For example, we had a consultation recently with young people who had been in care and heard their voices.  Those type of initiatives are very important.<\/p><p> Through this funding we provide support to 33 national youth work organisations;<b><\/b>181 projects under the<b><\/b>special projects for youth scheme; 28 under the youth information centres scheme; 104 mainstream projects<b><\/b>under the young people's facilities and services fund; and 178 current projects<b><\/b>supported under round 2 of the young people's facilities and services fund.  We also fund 21 drugs projects.  We have 1,600 youth clubs<b><\/b>funded under the local youth club grants scheme.  We have the Youth in Action programme;<b><\/b>Gaisce - the President's Award, which is doing very good work; and the national programmes<b><\/b>in the areas of youth health, youth arts and child protection.  It is obvious from that list that a substantial amount of activity is being funded.<\/p><p> There is a great deal of untapped potential in the youth sector when it comes to improving young people's lives.  Youth workers have known that for years.  However, policymakers have been slow to recognise the potential benefit on offer from quality youth work but we are at that point now.  There are not any questions in that regard.  We recognise and acknowledge the value of youth work, and it is a question of where to go from here.<\/p><p> I want to give the House an indication of my thinking and that of the Department on the future of youth work and some of the issues we must consider.  I would like to support the youth work sector to occupy a more central position in the continuum of services available to young people and to see the youth sector being in a position to respond to some of the major issues currently affecting young people.  However, this is not solely about funding.  It requires a much sharper focus on quality, outcomes and evidence-based practice.  The Indecon report supports this view.  The reality of the significantly constrained resources available to youth work makes the need for this sharper focus all the more relevant and critical.<\/p><p> As part of all our efforts to address the financial situation, my Department, like all others, has had to find savings.  The comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE, requires savings to be made in my Department's youth work budget.  That is the reality.  The 2013 allocation for youth work, between current and capital, will be in excess of &#8364;53<i><\/i>million.  This remains a significant level of funding.  I appreciate the constraints organisations are facing but many large youth service providers will receive multi-million euro allocations.  For example, For\u00f3ige and Youth Work Ireland will each receive in the region of &#8364;2 million from the youth service grant scheme alone, and that does not factor in other allocations to local projects run by these providers which in any year will amount to a much greater multiple.<\/p><p> I am acutely aware, however, that the youth work sector has seen its budget reduced significantly in recent years.  I wish it were otherwise.  I recognise this has not been easy and has not been without some pain.  However, I am impressed by the way the sector has responded by restructuring and streamlining provision.  In seeking out further savings, I am committed to further reforms to make the best possible use of resources.  There are initiatives my Department can take that will make it easier for youth organisations to provide the range of services they have provided in the past and to continue to develop.<\/p> <p>The amendment I tabled seeks to reflect the ongoing and proposed programme of reforms, which seeks to achieve this much sharper focus on quality, outcome and evidence-based practice.  This must start with reforming and rationalising funding streams and progressing value for money reviews of youth work funding.  It is striking that, over the past 20 or 30 years, we have not reviewed these funding streams.  It is about time we did and that is what I am doing at present.  We must deal with some of the disparate funding streams and examine overlap.  There has been much overlap and youth organisations have told me such reform should take place.  It will take place next year, which will mean greater flexibility for youth work organisations in how they spend their money and greater flexibility rather than being artificially tied to particular funding streams.  That will make a difference and ensure youth organisations can deliver the programmes they choose to prioritise within certain parameters rather than arbitrary and unreformed funding streams.  It is an important initiative that will happen next year.<\/p><p>These reforms will be aligned with identified policy imperatives.  The objectives will be clear and outcome-focused.  That will be a help to the sector.  We also have a value for money review and we will have a report by mid-2013.  It is part of an overall Government approach to examining various programmes in respect of value for money and ongoing reform.  That will also inform us.  It will take account of the voluntary input to youth work sector.<\/p><p>We must also examine quality provision in youth work.  It is very important that we examine a quality standards initiative.  It is something the youth work sector has welcomed.  We should look at what the youth work sector is providing, how it is doing so and ask questions about quality and outcomes.  We should base our decisions on the answers to those points.<\/p><p>Since becoming Minister, I have been clear on how youth work in Ireland is regarded internationally.  It is very well regarded and it is great to see the input Irish youth work has on the international scene.  We are leading the way in delivering quality focused youth work.  My Department has been involved in a number of initiatives, such as the appointment of VEC youth officers to coordinate and support local youth provision, a national assessor of youth work in my Department, the new national quality standards framework for youth work and the national quality standards for volunteer led youth groups, which will be launched in January.  We have set up a new group, the quality standards training and resource development task group, to harness the training and quality resources within the youth work sector to support implementation of the standards.  The focus on quality and standards is extremely important in terms of the future of youth work.  That is not to cast any doubt on what has happened to date but this is the correct direction in which to move.<\/p><p>We had a major international conference in Dublin Castle earlier this year to examine these issues.  Senator van Turnhout raised a number of questions but I may not get to all of them.  I will certainly correspond with the Senator in respect of the points she raised.  We have provided \u20ac1.7 million for the development of new youth cafes.  I recently announced that a further \u20ac2 million in capital funding would be made available to youth cafes and youth projects.  To the end of 2012, some \u20ac500,000 has been provided for the development of a number of youth cafes that had applied for previous youth cafe funding schemes.  Some \u20ac1.5 million will be provided in 2013 for youth cafes and youth projects.  I will announce details of this early in the new year.  We now have between 75 and 100 youth cafe facilities across the State and they are extremely beneficial to local communities and to young people in providing safe places to meet.  It is important we continue to develop these initiatives.  The Senator asked about the volunteer led local youth provision, which is one of the bedrocks of the youth sector.  It has a significant range and reach and is effective in reaching out to people.  I said there would be a reduction in the scheme to which the Senator referred.  It is a small but important scheme.<\/p><p>I refer to our Presidency of the European Council of Ministers with responsibility for youth.  We will have the opportunity to focus on youth work and quality youth work provision in our Presidency.  The themes chosen by Ireland relate to social inclusion and it will particularly examine the links between youth work and achieving the goals of Europe 2020.  Given the situation outlined in respect of young people neither in employment, education nor training, it is important to have this focus during Presidency.  We recently had a new EU strategy announced last week and we will be working to implement and focus on the area.<\/p><p>The timing of this debate is important given the ongoing discussions regarding the next round of the European social funding.  I hope we can avail of this funding to support and fund targeted Irish youth initiatives over the coming years.  It is important to name that and say that youth work must be part of the continuum funded by the European Social Fund.  The work it does is very relevant to the goals of the fund and the whole Europe 2020 agenda.  These key issues will be advanced during our Presidency and will be put forward to the Council of Ministers meeting in May.  We have structured dialogue and the engagement of young people throughout Europe, which will culminate in a conference in Ireland in March.  Some 200 people from around Europe will inform us of their engagement in the structured dialogue, which involves consulting and getting the views of young people.  It is an important date in our diary for March in respect of young people and youth work sector in Ireland.  I want to ensure the youth work sector in Ireland is very involved in the work we do during the Presidency.  This includes the March conference and a roundtable discussion in June, which examines unemployment issues concerning young people.  It is a high level, expert group.  The debate is timely in the sense that we can consider some of the youth work issues that will emerge to inform the agenda during Presidency.  We can make sure the suggestions that emerge will inform the work I will be doing during Presidency.<\/p><p>The Department is in the process of developing a children and youth strategy framework and we have consulted with 67,000 children and young people.  We also had an online consultation with the stakeholders in the various sectors working with young people and children.  Subsequent to the finalisation and publication of the strategy, work will commence on a discreet youth policy framework in 2013.  We will certainly invite the youth work sector to contribute to that policy development.  It will be very important.  A number of guiding principles have been identified and the framework must be responsive, relevant and realistic.  It must put the needs of children and young people at the centre of Government policy.  As I have elaborated, it must focus on quality and outcomes.  I look forward to further discussion on the framework as it emerges over the course of the year.<\/p><p>I would prefer if savings did not have to be made but I hope my contribution to the debate has shown clearly that my Department and I are matching savings with reforms in seeking to enhance quality and deliver efficiencies in Irish youth work provision against the backdrop of ongoing fiscal constraint.  This is about ensuring value while improving outcomes for young people.<\/p><p>This is challenging and tough for the sector but I believe the sector wants to see the kind of reforms outlined.  As we get economic growth, we can support the sector further.  I hope I have been clear in acknowledging the centrality of youth work and the importance of youth work to our young people, particularly those in more marginalised and disadvantaged situations.  Youth work has major relevance given the economic challenges and the situation facing so many young people.  It is a challenging agenda but I ask Senators for their continuing support in developing and delivering the kind of services we have on the ground and in ensuring this item remains on the agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200036#MM00400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355328300,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Minister to the House and I commend Senator van Turnhout on bringing this motion before the House.<\/p><p>I say &quot;Well done&quot; to the Minister on having the referendum passed.

I commend Senator van Turnhout on bringing it to the House so early.  It was published very recently.

I was very pleased with myself to get the job of chairman and it probably led to a political career.  Youth work and youth organisations are very important.  The National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, is a very important organisation and I concur with the views expressed in the foreword to the report by Ms Mary Cunningham, director of the NYCI. <\/p><p>The report has been prepared by an Irish consultancy organisation, Indecon.  It was printed and designed in Ireland.  The report, itself, provided work in this country.  Indecon has done a great service by providing the report.  <\/p><p>I commend the NYCI for commissioning a report of this nature.  It is an independent report, which is why it has strength.  It is the first national report on youth work.  I concur with the point made by Ms Cunningham and I commend Mr. Alan W. Gray and Mr. William H. Batt, of Indecon, who prepared the report on behalf of the NYCI.  <\/p><p>I also welcome representatives of the organisations who are here to hear this matter discussed in the House.<\/p><p>The National Youth Council of Ireland is a representative body of over 50 national voluntary youth organisations.  Its members include For\u00f3ige, Youth Work Ireland, Scouting Ireland, Macra na Tuaithe, Irish Girl Guides and many more, including \u00d3gra Fianna F\u00e1il, Young Fine Gael and other political organisations.

That is absolutely true.  The more services that are provided for young people the fewer difficulties there will be for the State in the future.  Youth organisations do extraordinarily good work.  I know the Minister recognises that and will do her utmost to support the NYCI.  Every euro spent by the State on youth organisations returns \u20ac2.20.  That is a good investment with a good return.  It has been proven in the report.  This is why it is important that we maintain these services.  Ireland has the fourth highest number of young people not in education, employment or training in the European Union.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to postpone the introduction of cutbacks.  I am sure the Minister will confirm, in her closing remarks, that she and her officials will meet youth organisations as soon as possible.  That is my request, arising from the report.  I hope the Minister will discuss the report with representatives of the NYCI.  I am confident she will do that.  In my own experience, I was always delighted to meet any organisation that had commissioned and prepared an independent report.

I welcome the Minister and also the visitors in the Gallery.  I also take this opportunity to recognise the work of the National Youth Council of Ireland, Youth Work Ireland, For\u00f3ige and all the other umbrella groups that keep youth issues in front of us all the time.  These umbrella organisations are very effective.  That should be noted.<\/p><p>The recently published Indecon report brings into stark relief the work done in the youth work sector in Ireland.  The sector is volunteer based.  The figures speak for themselves.  The report states there are 40,000 volunteers and fewer than 1,400 persons in paid employment.  I found the term &quot;paid employment&quot; quite amusing.  When something is done for nothing we tend not to put a monetary value on it.  I am conscious, for example, of the role of women in the home and the difficulties many women now face because they cannot get adequate pensions.  There is often no recognition of volunteer roles.  I am delighted to see the report put a monetary value on the work done in the youth sector and that this value is not disputed by the Government in its amendment.  There is no argument, therefore, about the monetary importance of the work done in the youth sector.<\/p><p>More than half of those who benefit from youth work programmes come from economically or socially deprived backgrounds.  <\/p> <p>The former governor of Mountjoy Prison, John Lonergan, has frequently pointed out that the correlation between poverty and social and economic deprivation is incredibly stark in our prisons.  It is crucial to recognise the importance of youth work, particularly in economically and socially deprived communities.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to the role of youth work for young people in NEETs.  We are in the midst of a serious unemployment crisis, which is severe for young people, in particular.  Young men are faring worse than young women.  I came across the NEETs categorisation first in the UK.  In former coal and steel mining areas in south Wales, there is a significant difficulty with households in which nobody has ever had a job.  The cost to the British Treasury of pumping money into this and similar regions in the UK in an effort to address deprivation is extreme.  We need to be aware that this is not the way that we want to go and that there is an important role for youth work, particularly among young people who are in crisis in terms of the opportunities available to them.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's announcement that she intends to make youth work and supporting youth unemployment Ireland's priority during our EU Presidency in 2013 as she chairs the EU Council of youth Ministers.  That is an important strategic decision which I welcome.  Youth work does not only provide critical outreach to young people but it also engages them in activities that provide them with invaluable experience in teamwork and leadership, boost motivation and develop skillsets.  We need to be able to see that in the context of the funding we make available for education and training.  If additional funding must be found to support youth work, we need to look beyond the Department for it.<\/p><p>The amendment intends to go further than the motion and I ask Senator van Turnhout to take it on board in that context.  The Minister mentioned a number of initiatives, including the provision of an additional \u20ac1.5 million for youth cafes and capital projects, which is welcome.  It is important to ensure value for money, no unnecessary duplication of services and a reward for bodies that deliver on their strategic objectives.  Across the board cuts benefit nobody and we have to be conscious of performance.  The Minister has retained the funding for local volunteer schemes, which is also important.  During the 1980s, I had the opportunity to work in Darndale and I witnessed the devastation wrought on community services there at the time.  Small sums can make a substantial difference to what happens in the community and I ask the Minister to protect such funding in its entirety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200039#PP02000","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355328900,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I commend Senator van Turnhout on taking the initiative with a well drafted motion.  I join other Senators in unreservedly acknowledging the value of youth work and the contribution youth workers make to society.  A well supported youth sector is one of the elements society needs to have in place to protect its most vulnerable and to ensure societal cohesion, especially when one considers that 37% of young people aged under 18 are at risk of poverty and social exclusion and almost one in five young people is not in education, employment or training.  As Senator Hayden said, Indecon found that youths in NEETs cost the State \u20ac4 billion last year alone and this needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>Week in, week out I engage with groups involved in youth work and helping young people with mental health or LGBT issues.  Other Members have addressed the economic value of youth work as highlighted in the Indecon report.  It is indisputable that youth work is often for those who fall between the cracks and the non-formal education sector is becoming more important in this regard, as youth work plays an irreplaceable role.  I am delighted to salute youth workers and to let them know their contribution is more than recognised; it is valued.  Moreover, the social good that flows from youth work is entirely unique and positive.  Variety is the great strength of youth work and a great mix and balance of youth organisations operate in the sector and provide an excellent service.  I am loth to mention groups in case I forget one or I am seen to be adding to the competition for scarce resources to support the sector but we should channel all our energies to stand up for the entire sector and for young people.  I do not want us to fall into accepting cutbacks as inevitable or facts of life.  They should be challenged, especially with reports such as that conducted by Indecon, which highlight the economic value of this work.<\/p><p>I refer to the role the EU Presidency will play in this area next year.  In a briefing I received from the Department, the Minister referred to the Irish Presidency of the EU Council of youth Ministers and the theme of social inclusion.  Ireland's approach to social inclusion is to emphasise that inclusion involves all young people, in addition to those with fewer opportunities, to enhance their competences and capacities.  The Minister's goal for the Presidency is to promote the value of quality standards in youth work as a means to achieving positive outcomes for young people who engage in youth work opportunities.  It is good to focus on the contribution of such work to the development and well-being of young people.  Given 37% of young people aged under 18 are at risk of poverty and social exclusion and the youth sector is supporting many of these marginalised young people, the continual cutting of funding for the youth sector will mean the capacity of the sector to support them will be undermined.  Does the Minister not think the cuts in this area announced in the budget last week run counter to the priorities during the EU Presidency?  As other Members said, the youth sector has experienced a cut of 30% to its funding since 2008.<\/p><p>She mentioned the high level round table event in June 2013, which will explore youth work's contribution to achieving the goals of Europe 2020, including issues relating to youth unemployment.  Senator van Turnhout asked what dialogue the Minister had with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in advance of the budget about Indecon's economic assessment.  The Minister said in her contribution that she highlighted the report to that Department and the Departments of Social Protection, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  What was the response of the Departments?  What type of working relationship has she with them in the context of the report?  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform repeatedly talks about efficiencies and savings.  It is important that he knows that every euro invested in the youth sector now will equate to saving \u20ac2.22 for every euro in the future.<\/p><p>Much of the correspondence from youth work organisations focuses on the need for greater consultation with them in co-operation with the Department.  Will the Minister commit to meeting their representatives to discuss the budget?  She said there will be a value for money review next year.  Will she meet the relevant youth groups, organisations and agencies in advance of, or during, that process?  She referred to some of the priorities of the review that she will highlight regarding the value of youth work.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister meet those groups in order that they can highlight that issue because the value of first hand experience for the review cannot be underestimated?  I strongly encourage the Minister and the value for money review to meet these groups.  I thank Senator Jillian van Turnhout and others for tabling the motion, which I support.  The youth sector will be valuable especially given the youth unemployment crisis, the social and economic consequences of which cannot be put on the back burner until the economic situation improves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200040#QQ00200","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355329500,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

We are in a new situation as regards the rights of children in the State.<\/p><p>Like Senator van Turnhout I have benefited greatly from youth work and youth organisations.  I am grateful to Haggardstown youth club which made me who I am for better or worse and keeping me on the right path.  My enjoyment of it was somewhat circumscribed by the fact that it was run by my older brother.  I note the presence of many people from Louth with Senator Terry Brennan, two of whom are young men who also benefited from youth work in their time.  It is true that youth work plays a significant role in supporting young people to be active citizens.  Any investment in youth work has important long-term benefits.  <\/p><p>I acknowledge also the vital role played by 1,400 youth workers in that sector, plus the 40,000 volunteers.  It is said that the age of volunteerism is over, I  do not agree with that as there are more than 40,000 volunteers involved in youth work.<\/p><p>I draw to the Minister's attention, as part of the European year of active aging 2012, an inter-generational volunteering project launched in Louth today.  I wish to speak also to the youth workers here today because this project was organised by Louth volunteer centre under Mr. John Cottrell, its development manager.  It involved pairing 68 younger people, that is, students from the local schools and colleges with 62 active older volunteers who volunteer in local charitable organisations.  To shadow them, one of their shift covered during the inter-generational volunteering week in October 2012.  The post survey results show an increase in the number of students with a more positive perception of the older people making a significant contribution in the local community, compared to 14% before the project.  Some 73% of respondents rated their experience during the project as very beneficial and 100% of students said they would consider volunteering in future.  That is significant because youth work can be a two-way project.  If we have young people working with older people the outcomes are significant.  <\/p><p>I am aware of a 20% reduction in funding since 2008 which we all regret.  We would all like if there was more money but as part of the effort to address Ireland's deficit the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the same as all other Departments, has had to find savings.  We have an unsustainable budgetary deficit as regards public spending.  This would have had to be tackled regardless of the banking crisis.  I do not wish to be over-critical but previous Governments threw money around like snuff at a wake, based on unsustainable income from such sources as stamp duty.  It is the solemn task of the Government to restore the public finances to good order for our young people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200041#RR00200","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1355329500,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I invite the Senator to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200041#RR00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1355329500,"counter":565,"content":"<p>N\u00f3im\u00e9ad amhain.

The words that struck me most in the motion were \"active citizenship\" in regard to youth work, an issue I addressed previously in respect of the education system when the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, was in the House.  If we sent our children to school for 14 or 15 years but did not teach them Irish it would be foolhardy to expect them to speak Irish.  We do not teach them how to be active citizens yet we are surprised and perplexed as to why we do not have active citizens.  While we have civic, social and political education, CSPE, and other modules - this is the point I made to the Minister for Education and Skills in respect of the proposed changes to the junior certificate cycle - the leaving certificate does not care about CSPE because we do not measure it by giving points for active citizenship.  Teachers do no teach it, and students do not study it and, therefore, we do not have as many active citizens as we might at the end of the education system.<\/p><p>P\u00e1draic Pearse described the education system, 100 years ago, as the murder machine because it churns out economic units of production.  Individuals are taught how to make a living but we do not teach them how to live, in a country where we have a pandemic of suicide, depression, mental health issues and the tragedy of young girls taking their lives by cyperbullying and all manner of reasons.  Part of the reason for the failure is that in school they are not taught how to deal with the most basic elements outside the school.  They will be working eight hour days, 40 hour weeks.  For the rest of the week and during the day they are dealing with issues of alcohol, relationships, mental health, drugs and drugs awareness and yet in the school system they are not taught how to be active citizens, why they should vote and why they should volunteer; the reason being the system does not measure it.  <\/p><p>The proposal I made to the Minister for Education and Skills was that active citizenship should be a leaving certificate subject.  It should be an optional extra subject whereby one would be granted a maximum of 50 points.<\/p> <p>It would be the only subject a student could do for the leaving certificate as a seventh subject that would give extra points.  For good or bad the leaving certificate is all about points.  Unless we make active citizenship part of the leaving certificate machine, teachers will not teach it, students will not study it and the country will be worse off.  We need to teach children to understand the democratic process, why they should vote, why they should be involved in public life, and why they should look after their mental health and that of their neighbours.  The only way to do that is through the educational system because we cannot rely on all parents-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200041#RR00500","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355330100,"counter":568,"content":"<p>On a point of order.

I understand the argument she is making.  The failing of all governments since the foundation of the State has been that we do not teach our children to be active citizens - all the voluntary organisations do.  We know that the parents who bring their children to the scouts and events are already active citizens.  Most of us are products of parents who are active citizens - we were taught to be active citizens more or less.  It is the same parents who bring their children to the GAA, soccer or youth clubs and other voluntary organisations.<\/p><p>We need to be concerned about the 75% of parents who do not teach their children to be active citizens.  They are the parents who do not get up on a Saturday morning and bring their children to a GAA club.  So the State must take up that role.  The governor of Mountjoy Prison has seen many failed citizens come through the door.  I quoted this earlier.  We teach our children how to make a living but do not teach them how to live.  That is the essence of active citizenship.  There is a great opportunity.  The Minister has been an excellent Minister in her portfolio to engage with the Department of Education and Skills and say we must stop producing economic units of production and instead start creating active citizens.  The only way to do that is to use the education system against itself.  We must allocate points for a subject of active citizenship that students will do because it will give them extra points and get them into college.  It will teach them all why they should engage in public life and their society and not simply go through the entire - as P\u00e1draic Pearse described it - murder machine and come out as an economic unit of production.<\/p><p>I take on board the Senator's point but I did not want to regurgitate the entire motion again.

I had a speech written, but I do not want to regurgitate what has been brought up and I commend Senator van Turnhout on tabling the motion.  I cannot start into what I wanted to say before addressing some of the remarks made by my colleague on the other side of the House.<\/p><p>As a former teacher and somebody who has been involved with young people for the past 27 years, I ask the Senator to reconsider what he said.  The implication of what he said is that there are parents who do not teach their children how to behave or it is not being taught in school.  In my experience the vast majority of children are innately good people given the opportunity.  Transition year is the ideal year to allow our children to develop as people and to become good citizens.  I could name countless children from first year to sixth year, many of whom have had no parental support in what they do or in how they are brought up, but they are the first people I would have relied on in school.  They are the people who are the most considerate to people with disabilities, who seem to instinctively understand what other people are going through.  It is inappropriate to stand up and say that because they have not got the parental support they do not end up as good people.  Some of the best people in this country have come up through that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200042#SS00800","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1355330100,"counter":575,"content":"<p>We are having a debate and I just wanted-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200042#SS00900","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1355330100,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I take the Senator's point.

In a number of key areas youth work is filling the gaps left by the formal education sector.  In the present economic situation youth work is more vital than ever - reference was made to youth unemployment.  I welcome that the European youth guarantee is making great strides and I look forward to that next year.<\/p><p>Like my fellow Senator from County Louth, besides being the age-friendly county and the best county, between the two of us we do not need a gathering in County Louth next year to promote everything that happens in County Louth.  An unforeseen effect of the banking crisis and consequent recession has been the rise in the participation in voluntary youth work.  County Louth VEC has noticed that interest in and the establishment of new youth groups and youth initiatives is gaining momentum as adults are turning to volunteering as a way to practically and actively make use of the extra time they have available.  Recently 46 groups from County Louth received funding grants from the VEC.  This is very positive and shows that the Celtic tiger did not turn everybody into money-grabbing self-centred jet-setting socialites as is often portrayed in the media.<\/p><p>Everybody has talked about the value of youth work and I want to make reference to two projects in Dundalk with which I am acquainted and which the Minister has visited recently.  One of them is &quot;The House&quot;, which started from nothing and this year celebrated its 21st anniversary.  I know the Minister was in attendance that day.  It has gone to great lengths, as have other youth groups in the country, to help many young people who otherwise would have gone down the wrong road.  As a former teacher I am constantly amazed at how beneficial they are.  Sometimes it is down to the youth club, youth service or person who is there.<\/p> <p>It is the feeling of care, of knowing that somebody is concerned, of helping them and of volunteering.  I must go back to the point that it is not something that one can teach.  It is something innate in us as a people.<\/p><p>I also want to make reference to the valuable work that Louth Comhairle has done, particularly last year in developing the mental health app.  As somebody who has an interest in suicide awareness, the Minister will be conscious that the mental health app they produced last year was a testament to what young people can do when left to their own resources.  In everything that they did, they came up with their own ideas.

I remember being in this House aged 18 or 19 looking for funding for youth organisations in order to retain staff.  That was not today or yesterday.  It was a significant learning curve from my point of view and it was one of the reasons I found that I was better involved in politics in trying to achieve change rather than being outside trying to effect change.<\/p><p>One of the first lessons I learned from my involvement in youth organisations was that there were four characters at every meeting in Ireland: Blaming Ben, Preaching Paddy, Peaceful Pete and Fearful Fred.  Every time Senator Leyden stands up, I immediately think of Blaming Ben.  It is amazing when one comes into this House every morning to look for those four characters in the House and assign the names and it is interesting how some mornings it changes.  It shows, in the case of young people in youth organisations, that in the education system one size does not fit all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200043#TT01100","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1355330700,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200043#TT01200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1355330700,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I was involved in youth organisations and then went on to run a centre in a project that was funded by F\u00c1S where there were 50 young people who otherwise would have dropped out of school who had problems with literacy and numeracy.  Most of these young people were referred to us by the Garda because they had dropped out of the main system of education.  When we conducted a survey of those young people five years after they had left the centre, over 70% of them were in full-time employment.  It proves the point that one size does not fit all.  That is why it is so important to have youth organisations and to support youth clubs and the many volunteers who give so much of their time for many years.  Many start off thinking that they will contribute for one year and when one comes back ten years later the same ones are still making that valuable contribution.<\/p><p>It is an interest report.  It shows youth work has a significant impact.  Young people found that it helped them gain practical skills.  Over 70% of them felt their involvement in youth clubs assisted them in that way.  It is important that we recognise that contribution.<\/p><p>The other figure that stands out relates to how youth work helps to reduce the costs associated with crime and anti-social behaviour.  Some 45% felt it had a significant impact.  As someone who has practised in the courts, I note that 85% of young people who end up before the courts are not involved in a youth club, youth organisation or sports club.  That, in itself, answers all the questions about the importance of youth involvement in sport.<\/p><p>I suppose the big difference between sport and youth organisations is that all the sporting organisations have a source of revenue which the youth clubs and youth organisations do not have.  That is why the youth clubs and youth organisations need that vital support from the national level and it is extremely important that this would continue.<\/p><p>Support for youth organisations has come a long way over the past 20 years.  While it is a difficult time, it is important that we ensure we get value for money and continue to protect current funding for the next few years and at the same time try to improve the quality and development of the services because they play an important role.<\/p><p>I will mention one issue at which we should look.  The JobBridge programme has been used effectively in getting the unemployed back to work.  We must recognise that there are over 400,000 people unemployed.  Many of them, unfortunately, are unlikely to find suitable employment in the long term.  Would the Minister consider creating a pilot project which, initially, would train up to 1,000 unemployed people in the skills required to be involved in youth clubs and youth organisations?  If there were 1,000 people engaged under the same procedure as the JobBridge programme involving the payment of an additional allowance, they would provide a vital support at local level where many others would benefit.  Perhaps we could develop it to the point where there would be 5,000 unemployed people in that programme.  It is something that we should seriously look at in the context of getting more people to give the helping hand that is so badly needed by so many young people in this country, and to the many youth organisations and youth clubs that work so hard.  I would ask that such a pilot project would be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200043#TT01300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1355330700,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I compliment Senator van Turnhout and those who have supported her motion.  The Senator has played a significant role in the Seanad on behalf of young people.  We all have different specialties but I can see that where the Senator is concerned.  As a result, we are getting opportunities to speak on issues which might not arise in the Seanad.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister.  I also listened to her reply on the financial side, and we all understand that as well.  It is important for us to realise why we must enable young people to play an active role in society, not only training them.  Obviously, training and educating them is an important aspect, but I refer to idea of allowing them take on leadership roles.  I am always impressed, for instance, when I look at young people being interviewed on television programmes and see their absolute confidence and the manner in which they can articulate whatever are their particular points.  That does not come from school.  It is not taken from education in any way.  Often it comes from the role and the opportunities which they have had in youth organisations.  It is also particularly true when in comes to the farming community that, whether it be Macra na Feirme, For\u00f3ige or any of those organisations, some of us are old enough when they were not articulating their own point of view and their particularly industry suffered severely as a result.<\/p> <p>Now we can see leadership and I am sure that the same is true of public life.<\/p><p>Many people who have entered public life came from youth organisations where they became aware of important issues.  They became aware of how they should have a vision but to try to come up with policies and make recommendations and suggestions.  When eventually they decide to put themselves forward for a local council, or even the Oireachtas, they are exceptionally well prepared for the role.<\/p><p>We must take all of these aspects into account when we think of the dreadful phrase &quot;value for money&quot;.  In this case value for money is very difficult to quantify.  We can examine the report and see that for every euro spent now we will save two later.  That is true.  What would happen if the youth organisations did not exist? I am not saying that all young people would go a certain route.  However, we know that the environment in which they grow up is very important.  What happens if their environment is more negative than positive?  If it is more destructive than constructive?  Let us be fair, why could not young people find themselves in such a position?  Let us think of the loss and the damage that would follow.  It would cost us millions of euro if they are not given the opportunity to appreciate their potential.  Self appreciation is their starting point.  They must appreciate who they are and of what they are capable.  Second, they must use whatever opportunities come their way.  There is no shortage of opportunities if young people are given them.  We have always had and always will have a generation gap up to a certain point.  There is one thing that I am certain of.  When young leaders comes to the fore they will have a better chance of influencing their peer groups because they will use the same language and communicate in the same way.<\/p><p>I do not suggest that all of this will change due to a cut in the grants.  I believe that people will respond and that is part of what we have been talking about.  If the Minister finds a bit of extra money at some point down the road she should remember that young people have made an effort and will make an effort.  I do not think she will find much moaning from them because they are not disposed to that.  Young people have a huge energy, overcome each problem and handle each challenge.  It is important that at times, because they may be short of finance, we take it for granted that they will readapt or whatever.  We may do a certain damage to the infrastructure that is in place.  I presume that, leading up to the budget, the Minister has consulted all of the youth groups, or with as many as possible, and is aware of where they stand.  Senator van Turnhout said at the beginning of the debate that she had hoped that the motion might be debated here before the budget.  It might have been helpful but it may not have changed anything.  More importantly, we could have made a stronger case if it has not already been done so.  <\/p><p>Having looked at the number of organisations and their diversity we should not always say that there are too many organisations.  I do not believe there are because youth work is such a big agenda that it must break down into specialties.  Whatever about merging other bodies of a different nature, the idea of a merger of youth groups is not necessarily the same as the merger of other bodies.  Youth groups already have a particular focus and a merger would create a degree of confusion which I do not think we want to happen.<\/p><p>We should use every opportunity we can to recognise the work done that has been done by youth organisations.  We should acknowledge, not reward them.  We should award them in public life and we should not take them for granted.  They are working in the community where they should be and there is no doubt that of all the groups in the country it is the youth section that has suffered most from unemployment.  We must think of the thousands of young people that live far away from Ireland who never wanted to leave.  It was never part of their view or dream or that of their parents.  We must stem the emigration in whatever way that we can.  The Minister should get the message that we will approach the issue in a co-operative way and not by confrontation.  I have known the Minister for a long time and we trained her in the Seanad so I know that her heart is in the right place.  However, we must keep avenues and lines of communication open, in whatever way that we can, to offset the difficulties that may arise from the reductions in funding.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200043#TT01400","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355331300,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Well spoken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200044#UU00200","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1355331300,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I call Senator C\u00e1it Keane who has six minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200044#UU00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1355331300,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The full title of her office is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which is no accident.  It was designed, as she was designed, to fit the Department.  If one examines her background in social work and where she came from then one will know that there is no better person, in any Department, than Deputy Fitzgerald.  She has done a lot of youth work and she has brought great empathy to her job.<\/p><p>Many people have spoken about the work done by various Senators on youth work.  If one carried out a survey of all of the Deputies and Senators one would find that a lot of them have a background in youth work and social issues.  I have a similar background because I taught Montessori and did youth work.  Later I studied for a diploma in community development and also one on social deprivation.  Senator Hayden mentioned the importance of examining social deprivation and its link to youth work.  Some Senators pointed out that it was important to focus money on social deprivation as all of society is not equal.  Society consists of different people.  There are rich people who cannot be bothered to volunteer but that is the other side of the spectrum.  <\/p><p>I welcome the motion that was tabled by the Independent Senators and others.  Youth work plays a most important part in Ireland today.  It inculcates active citizenship and participative democracy in citizens in Ireland and starts with the young.  From my background I can state that its importance is recognised.  For example, a poem of William Wordsworth in the 1800s uses the words, &quot;The Child is father of the man&quot; which is sexist as it refers to just men.  I shall also quote Dr. Maria Montessori who said, &quot;No man exists who was not made by the child he once was&quot;.  Her work spanned the late 1800s to the mid-1900s.  For young people she set up kinders because she recognised the importance of youth work.  If one examines past society one can see further examples.  Thankfully, we have a Minister who knows, is listening and will work.  <\/p><p>The Indecon report was spoken about earlier.  In 2009 a report was commissioned by the City of Dublin Youth Services to Catholic Youth Care, For\u00f3ige, Youth Work Ireland, financially supported by the Irish Youth Foundation and entitled The Purpose and Outcomes of Youth Work.  The Benefits of Youth Work: Young Peoples' and Youth Workers' Perspective was researched by Maurice Devlin, deposited in NUI and has been published.  It was prompted by a concern in 2009, when the boom was going to bust, that there was a significant change in the social and economic policy context.  I ask Members to realise that there was a concern in 2009.  I do not think that the Minister has let anything slip, particularly in the context of what was started in 2009.  It is now more important than ever to articulate the distinctive nature of youth work and the benefits are not just for young people, but for adults as well.  The benefits of youth work carry on for more than youth, but for adults and for society as a whole.<\/p><p>Much has been said about volunteerism and its benefits. I have written a page on the subject but I shall not say anything more about it because its benefit and value has been recognised.  As Senator O'Donnell has said, one cannot put a monetary value on volunteerism.  <\/p><p>Youth work is vital for the development of active, engaged and participative citizens.  <\/p> <p>We know that habits we often have as adults are formed as children.  Therefore, early learning and development are pivotal in shaping society's future adults.  I am not surprised by the findings of the assessment of the economic value of the youth work project, as published by Indecon.  About 25 years ago, a report by Reichardt in America showed the monetary value of youth work.  Apart from the value to society, investment in youth work and child care is saving money. <\/p><p>The new Child and Family Support Agency that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has established recognises this fact.  It demonstrates the value of family support and youth work.  While we would like to be able to provide more support, we must also cut our cloth according to our measure, that is, according to the funds that are available.  The Minister has therefore assessed and evaluated where the money goes.  <\/p><p>One Senator mentioned \u20ac10 being cut from the children's allowance, but it is a question of how that sum is spent.  The Minister referred to studies on where the money is going.  In addition, Senator D'Arcy mentioned throwing money about like snuff at a wake, which is not the way to do it.

We must all work together in building the youth policy framework.  The process is very important so the relevant organisations need to buy into it as much as the State does.  We must work together to ensure that the next time Indecon and the National Youth Council of Ireland contribute a report, perhaps they will have an increased value.

I have tabled this Adjournment matter to try to discover what plans the Office of Public Works has for the Mount Congreve Estate in Waterford.<\/p> <p>The Minister may be aware that in 1979, an agreement was reached between the State and Mr. Ambrose Congreve, who was the owner of the house and gardens that comprise the Mount Congreve Estate.  The arrangement was that on the death of Mr. Congreve, which occurred a number of years ago, the estate would be managed by a trust involving three trustees, one of which would be the Commissioners of Public Works.  After a transitional period of 21 years, the freehold and ownership would then transfer to the Minister for Finance, after which the State, through the Minister for Finance, would own the house and gardens.  Enormous tourism potential exists because this is a highly attractive and world-renowned garden and a plan certainly should be developed for it.  Approximately 15 horticultural staff are employed there full-time, to keep the gardens to a very high standard and they are concerned, as am I, about the long-term future of the house and its gardens.  It is necessary to ensure that a plan is put in place and in so doing, all the stakeholders must be brought together.  I consider the stakeholders to include the Mount Congreve Estate Trust, which is comprised of the three trustees, including the Commissioners of Public Works.  It must also involve the Congreve Foundation, which essentially derives from the proceeds of Mr. Ambrose Congreve's estate and is funding the continuation of the payment of the staff wages at present, as well as the Office of Public Works itself and Waterford County Council.<\/p><p>I seek to explore what plans the Office of Public Works has and what actions will be taken to bring together all these groups to draw up long-term and short-term plans for the house and the gardens to exploit the existing tourism potential and to ensure the jobs in the house and gardens are safeguarded.  I will listen to what the Minister has to say because the essential purpose of raising this matter on the Adjournment was not to give the Minister a history lesson - I am sure she is aware of the garden's history - but to explore what precisely the Office of Public Works is considering and what will be the plans.  As I mentioned, there is huge tourism potential and as it is a facility that will be in public ownership, there is a responsibility on the State to ensure that what is a world-renowned garden is kept up to the highest standard and that the potential offered by this splendid house and garden is maximised for the people of Waterford and the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200045#VV01100","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355332500,"counter":617,"content":"<p>In 1979 an agreement was reached between the State and Mr. Ambrose Congreve whereby, in exchange for tax concessions, Mr. Congreve placed his house and world-renowned gardens into a trust with ownership of both reverting to the Minister for Finance on the expiration of the trust periods.  The trust is irrevocable and the trust properties are divided into two, the gardens and the mansion house and its demesne, with both having different trust periods.  The trust periods commenced following the death of Mr. Congreve last year.  The gardens, which are approximately 66 acres, will remain in the trust for a period of 21 years after the death of Mr. Congreve.  The mansion house and its demesne, which is approximately 5 acres, will remain in the trust for a longer period and will, in all likelihood, not revert to the Minister for Finance until 2059.<\/p><p>The trust, which is known as the Mount Congreve Garden Trust, currently has three trustees.  The Commissioners of Public Works are a minority trustee and the other two trustees were appointed by Mr. Congreve.  These trustees are also representatives of Mr. Congreve's estate, which is known as the Congreve Foundation.  The Commissioners of Public Works are in detailed discussions with the Congreve Foundation on a number of issues, which include the membership of the trust, the future management and staffing of the trust properties, and the purchase of additional lands for the benefit of the trust.  The Commissioners have indicated they would like to become majority trustees of the Mount Congreve Garden Trust for the State to be allowed greater control over the management of the trust properties.  The other trustees have signalled that they would, in principle, be willing to retire from the trust as part of an overall agreement.<\/p><p>The Senator raised issues regarding the staff.  At present, the staff employed in the gardens are employed by the Congreve Foundation.  Once an agreement is in place, employment of the staff will transfer from the foundation to the trust.  I assure Members that the future welfare of the staff is of paramount concern to the stakeholders.  However, it is important to note that until the trust period expires, it will be the trust and not the State which employs the staff.  Likewise, it is important to note that, at present, it is the trust and not the State which will manage the trust properties.  Their future management is being discussed by the trustees and these talks should be concluded in the near future.  I should also highlight that a third party recently approached the trustees with an offer of a commercial arrangement which may be of immediate benefit to the trust properties and would focus on their tourism potential.  These talks are at an early stage and will be progressed.  It is envisaged that once the trust period for the gardens expires and they revert to the full ownership of the State, they will be managed as part of the National Botanic Gardens.<\/p><p>The lands that were included within the trust deed are integral to the setting of the house and gardens.  However, additional lands are needed for the provision of modern visitor facilities and to ensure adequate car and bus parking.  Likewise, while the trust deed granted various rights of way to the trustees over lands owned by the Congreve Foundation to ensure access and the provision of supplies of water and utilities to the trust properties, it would be preferable for the trust to have direct control over them.  For these reasons, the Commissioners of Public Works have been in negotiations with the Congreve Foundation with a view to purchasing additional lands to be able to control fully access and to future-proof the trust properties in respect of car parking, visitor services and future expansion.  These lands adjoin the trust properties and front onto the current public road system.  They would allow for unfettered control of access and egress by the public to the trust properties and would ensure that in the future, the trust properties would be able to link into the public water supply and utilities without having to revert to rights of way.  Negotiations between the parties have been ongoing for a number of months and a third-party valuer was jointly instructed to issue a non-binding valuation.  While an agreement has yet to be reached, it is hoped that a solution will be forthcoming.  I hope this information has been helpful to the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200046#WW00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1355332500,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and note her response has been very positive.

My request to him is to ask the Minister for Health to outline the criteria used to determine the eligibility of children with rare life-threatening cancers and other illnesses for financial support from the Health Service Executive in order that they may be included in clinical trials in foreign jurisdictions.  Moreover, if this is not possible, the Minister for Health should outline the reason.  It is with some regret that I note the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, has left the Chamber given this issue also would fall within her remit.<\/p><p>Considering the recent passing of the children's referendum and its purpose to put children first, it is important to explore every opportunity for life, for saving lives and for the health care of our children in foreign jurisdictions, particularly children with neuroblastoma.  The Minister may have heard of a little girl called Lily Mae Morrison, who is four years of age, is from Claregalway, County Galway, and who suffers from stage 4 neuroblastoma.  Her parents are Judith Sibley and Leighton Morrison, both of whom are self-employed professional ballet dancers.  Neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer of the nervous system affecting one in 100,000 children, primarily under the age of five.  Between six and eight cases per year are reported in Ireland and while the prognosis for survival at stage 4 is poor, a number of treatments are available in Ireland through the HSE that improve the survival rates of sufferers.  The treatment takes two years and involves chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, stem cell harvesting and rebuild and it involves many inpatient and outpatient visits.  At the end of the treatment, there still is a 70% chance of relapse and the treatment options in Ireland after relapse are limited, the most common option being palliative chemotherapy.  A number of clinical trials for treatments for relapsed neuroblastoma are under way, one in the United States and another in Germany.  These trials indicate an improved survival rate of more than 50% for those children availing of the trials. <\/p> <p> The cost of the trials are between &#8364;500,000 and &#8364;750,000.  There are anecdotal accounts of adult cancer sufferers, in particular those suffering from brain tumours, being facilitated by the HSE with financial assistance to go on clinical trials in foreign jurisdictions for cancer treatment.  Could the Minister confirm if that is the case and if so, why they would be extended to adults and not children?  Is it not the case that all cancer treatments are trials by their very nature, whether or not approved by the HSE for treatment.  What trials are going on in this country that could help and what partnerships exist, if any, between Irish hospitals and other EU jurisdictions that could assist children with neuroblastoma?<\/p><p> In the United States in 2009, a total of $5.6 billion in funding was spent on cancer research.  The sum of $3 million went towards research on neuroblastoma.  The average life person years lost due to neuroblastoma is 67 years.  The average loss for breast cancer is 16 years, which illustrates that neuroblastoma is a particularly aggressive form of cancer.<\/p><p> Lily Mae has become a national treasure.  The Minister may know of her.  She has been on every media outlet and her story has been covered extensively by the Irish media on television, radio and in print, including &#8220;Nationwide&#8221;, &#8220;The Late Late Show&#8221;, the &#8220;Craig Doyle Show&#8221;, &#8220;Ireland AM&#8221;, &quot;Midday&quot;, &#8220;The Afternoon Show&#8221;, and by the<i>Irish Independent <\/i>and the tabloid press.  The campaign behind her has recorded the song &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; &#8211; she is a tiny little girl &#8211; the song by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, who both endorsed her campaign.  That is an indication of the extent of people she has reached.  She has a weekly following of more than 450,000 people.  On average, more than 45,000 people engage with her story on a daily basis either liking, sharing or commenting on a story on her page.  It has been shown that 52% of fans are aged between 24 and 44 and two thirds of them are female.  She is building up a considerable following.  This is now a national story.<\/p><p> To date, the campaign supporting her treatment is somewhere in the region of &#8364;50,000 but it is not just about the amount of money raised, which is significant; it is about the value of the media coverage the charity single has garnered for neuroblastoma and the increased awareness of the disease it has created in this country and internationally.  The beneficiaries of the project are the Sunni Mae Trust, established to help with the care and future medical needs of Lily Mae and the Neuroblastoma Society, a United Kingdom-based charity established by the parents of children with this disease or those whose children have died of the disease that endows neuroblastoma research with financial support in order to promote the discovery of new treatments and potentially a cure for the disease.  I have deliberately put all of that on the record.  This is a serious case that touches the lives of many people in Galway and across the country, in particular the four-year old girl.  It affects six to eight little children every year in this country.  I await the Minister&#8217;s response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200046#WW00500","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355333100,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Healy Eames for raising this matter.

She asked about the criteria which the Department of Health and the HSE use to determine the eligibility of such children as Lily Mae who have rare life-threatening cancers.  The Health Service Executive operates a treatment abroad scheme, TAS, for persons entitled to treatment in another EU or EEA member state or Switzerland under EU Regulation 1408\/71, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 574\/72, and in accordance with Department of Health guidelines.<\/p><p>Within these governing EU regulations and the Department of Health's guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU or EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form El12 (IE).  A decision is made on each application in accordance with this legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts.  The cost of the treatment is not a deciding factor when approving an application.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.<\/p><p>The TAS allows for an Irish-based consultant to refer a patient that is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in another EU member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets the following criteria:  First, the application to refer a patient abroad has been assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.  Second, following clinical assessment, the referring consultant certifies a recommendation that the patient be treated in another EU-EEA country or Switzerland; the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient's needs; the treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment; the treatment is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner; and the hospital outside the State will accept EU-EEA form El12 (IE).<\/p><p>The application to refer a patient abroad must be assessed and a determination given prior to the patient availing of the treatment abroad.

Appointments that are made prior to a decision will have no bearing on the review process or its expedition.<\/p><p>The response sets out the criteria in terms of who is eligible under such a scheme.  Perhaps the person the Senator has brought to the attention of the House is eligible under the scheme outlined, but I am not in a position to determine that as I have not been given the necessary briefing.  The Senator might wish to bring the details to the attention of the family involved and explain to them the precise procedure to be followed.  No applications to the scheme have been accepted for referral for inclusion in clinical trial and current practice is that costs associated in participation in a clinical trial are borne by the providers of the trial.  Applications to the scheme are only accepted where the patient, adult or child, are being referred outside the State for proven treatment that cannot be obtained within the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200047#XX00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1355333100,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I appreciate the information the Minister has provided.

I raise the matter of the private wastewater treatment plant on behalf of the residents of the D\u00fan Ard housing estate.  The plant services up to 59 houses.  Water is seeping out of the plant and into the nearby Dunkellin River which is presenting a significant environmental and health and safety issue.  The threat posed by the plant is further corroborated by the fact that information has become available to the residents under an FOI request which indicates that the plant failed all monitoring tests carried out between 2007 and 2012 yet nothing was done by the relevant authorities to rectify the matter.  To exacerbate the situation, the ESB switched off the electricity supply to the wastewater treatment plant last week due to an unpaid bill, which will undoubtedly cause further significant problems.  It is clear from the information I have received that there is a threat of water pollution and environmental damage as a result of the foregoing.  Health and safety consequences will inevitably follow as long as the power to the treatment plant remains off.  On that basis I ask the Minister to take all necessary remedial steps to ensure that appropriate enforcement action is taken to address the issue.

The programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some \u20ac130 million in the county during the period of the programme.<\/p><p>A key input to the development of the programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Galway County Council, in response to the Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities.  However, the Craughwell sewerage scheme was not among the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current programme.<\/p><p>Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-13 was reviewed in mid 2011 and through this process consideration was given to any newly-emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the programme.

The issue has been ongoing for seven years so a great deal of suffering is taking place as a consequence of the inactivity of the sewage treatment plant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200048#YY00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1355333700,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I will contact Galway County Council on any action on enforcement proceedings in the event it is not able to reach agreement with the developer but must take in charge this development, and to see if the bond is sufficient, in conjunction with the resources of the local authority, to deal with this problem.

Expenditure on illness benefit was \u20ac943 million in 2010, \u20ac876 million in 2011 and in 2012 is expenditure is expected to be just under \u20ac800 million.<\/p><p>In terms of a customer breakdown between the public and private sector, one third of illness benefit claims received are from public sector employees and two thirds are from the private sector.<\/p><p>A study undertaken for the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions in 2010 suggests an overall national absenteeism level of around 3.5%.  The estimate draws upon a number of sources, including small-scale surveys undertaken by IBEC and SFA.  The two surveys by ISME in 2007 and SFA in 2008 cover levels of absence in SMEs.  The number of claimants on the Department's illness benefit schemes suggests an overall absence rate of around 4%, whereas a recent IBEC report suggested an overall rate of around 2.6%.<\/p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General, in a special report on sickness absence in the Civil Service, published in 2009, estimated that some 5% of available working time was lost to sickness absence in 2007, with wide variations between Departments, grades, ages and genders.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection itself lost some 40,000 days to illness in 2011.  These absences ranged from 20 plus working days to 200 plus working days in a small number of cases.  To address this particular challenge, the Department's HR division is actively managing the minority of its staff who have the longest absences in order to facilitate a return to work, where feasible, at the earliest possible stage.  The House will also be aware that proposals have been brought forward by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform which seek to address some of the factors behind the rates of absenteeism in the public sector.  I assure the Senator that active management of the absenteeism is an intricate part of the day-to-day management within the Civil Service and public service overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121200048#YY00500","speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355333700,"counter":637,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 7.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 December 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
